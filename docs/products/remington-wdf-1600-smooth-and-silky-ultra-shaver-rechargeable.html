            <li>an it worked great.</li>
            <li>I love this thing - and for the price, it&#x27;s a steal!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>It shaves very nicely, I wasn&#x27;t unsatisfied at all.</li>
            <li>I had no irritation whatsoever on my legs, and got a very nice shave.  </li>
            <li>i bought one of these from the px today and its amazing!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li>She is very happy ans satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many shavers through the years and find this shaver to be the best.</li>
            <li>Just like most everyone else here, I am very happy with my shaver.</li>
            <li>It is probably the best one on the market at a cheap price, but I stopped using it after two months because it just burns!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>Gave it two stars because it looks and feels good and seems to be a good product--just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>the results have been as good as the razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor after reading the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It shaves good, does not leave a rash.</li>
            <li>&quot; shaves, it does a good job</li>
            <li>This razor is really good.  </li>
            <li>It gives a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>it gave a good shave, however, battery gave out after 14 months.</li>
            <li>it does a good job</li>
            <li>It was good for the amount of time that it lasted, around 4 months.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington corded shaver for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have had this one for just about a month now and the shaver does a very good job although it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as a razor.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this razor on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This shaver does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and it would probably be great if I used it more often.</li>
            <li>The price is great too, no need to spend more ....</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>and I just couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I tried the product for about 3-4 days now and I totally in love with it!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Love this item!</li>
            <li>Love this electric razor!</li>
            <li>This is so easy and a great starter for my daughter to use.  </li>
            <li>I get a good shave, leaving my legs very smooth.</li>
            <li>I now have great smooth skin that doesn&#x27;t look like a battlefield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor shaves smoothly in the shower and I experienced no razor burn on either my legs or underarms.  </li>
            <li>this was sort of an impulse buy, but it worked amazingly...</li>
            <li>I purchased the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky Electric Razor and it is great.</li>
            <li>It has been great for my legs, leaving them almost as smooth as a razor.</li>
            <li>Also, the 6000 has an indicator that the battery needs charging, which is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for the days I forget to shave, and don&#x27;t have time to lather up... gives a nice smooth shave even where Venus razors left stubbly. :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>I have wanted a shaver of my own for some time now</li>
            <li>You do get a nice close clip on your legs and don&#x27;t have to do it so often.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is really nice to have to trim *</li>
            <li>I dont think I would buy this again, honestly.</li>
            <li>and she is thrilled with its performance</li>
            <li>This fills nicely and both wife &amp; husband can use it.</li>
            <li>The one nice thing was I never cut or nicked myself.</li>
            <li>but I have to say this one is nice.</li>
            <li>I am loving my shaver, but I am going to have to stick to blades for under my arms.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy and an excellent result.</li>
            <li>True to it&#x27;s features, this shaver is excellent along the curves and I have gotten a close, smooth shave everytime I use it.  </li>
            <li>My new electric shaver is great!  </li>
            <li>Hesitate to get a new one, but this model is perfect in every way.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to use, is conveniently rechargeable, and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s great for a quick shave when you don&#x27;t want to bother with water/shower, all that stuff.</li>
            <li>It works great, and she loves how easy to it is to use and clean it!  </li>
            <li>If you want to prevent bumps(in-growns) just make sure you exfoliate and make sure you moisturize!</li>
            <li>It is the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Great razor for for the right price.</li>
            <li>I had not owned an electric razor in about 15 years, mainly because the razor I had didn&#x27;t do a very good job</li>
            <li>My 20 year old Chick electric shaver still works better than this Remington!!!</li>
            <li>The good reviews and the price motivated me into choosing the Remington Smooth and Silky Ultra Shaver and I am glad I did.    </li>
            <li>the charger breaks very easily and it takes more than a day to charge.</li>
            <li>and I found it very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far and the price was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a quick shave... worked fine in and out of the shower...</li>
            <li>Originally this was a gift for my wife whom is very pleased &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is very useful for someone recovering from an injury who can&#x27;t safely manuever razors in the shower!</li>
            <li>the on-off switch is really touchy and the re-charge light is very bright, plus there is no carrying case</li>
            <li>A huge plus is that it&#x27;s rechargeable!  </li>
            <li>Choose the panasonic for $5 more.</li>
            <li>I have purchased more types of hair removers than I care to admit to over the years</li>
            <li>Glad I chose to get this one.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>As someone else said, don&#x27;t bother spending more on a \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; shaver, because this one will give you everything you could want.  </li>
            <li>Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>but I would not have been able to post.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I was weary to buy a personal shaver online, but I am very happy I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m impressed, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and would recommend it</li>
            <li>i love my close shaves with my razors and was hoping to get it outta the electric</li>
            <li>glad i saved the receipt</li>
            <li>and im bringing it back and buying the best razor out there.</li>
            <li>I am no longer able to shave my underarms do to health reasons, so I now have to use an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would suggest finding a better quality product with longer life.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve given this one only 3 stars because one shaver (mine) has worked excellently</li>
            <li>I will attempt to return it and get a better one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>The top portion that touches the skin is called the foil.</li>
            <li>There will be a lot more research done before another model shows up on my credit card bill.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Cuts ok but still need hand razor for the close cuts you need on under arms and over the lip.</li>
            <li>I really do love this razor.  </li>
            <li>and she feels a razor is better than this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I got razor burn from it, but I suspect it was more user error than product deficiency.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your great service.</li>
            <li>and it is not any better.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I figured it was time to replace after so many years.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s cordless-</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t-</li>
            <li>The instructions say that it can shave the hair in any direction, but I have found that it works much better when you shave in the direction of your hair growth.  </li>
            <li>He is pleased that he can shave himself and loves the ease of a rechargeable, cordless shaver.</li>
            <li>and I am for the most part satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is cordless.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Remington razors before and was satisfied</li>
            <li>I tried waxing more than once</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product before I bought it</li>
            <li>but Im glad I did.</li>
            <li>I do not get the razor burn any more.</li>
            <li>I love the wet/dry feature bc</li>
            <li>either way content for the most part.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m able to shave both legs.</li>
            <li>I have to shave the bottom of my legs, recharge, then shave the top.</li>
            <li>I would gladly pay more for an electric razor that was nicer to our planet.</li>
            <li>My wife is a satisfied Remington WDF 1600 Ultra shaver user, oh yes and so is our daughter.</li>
            <li>I thought I got a better shave using a razor.</li>
            <li>and I was able to shave my legs and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>She was pleased although she did say.</li>
            <li>This one is so much better.</li>
            <li>glad to have it</li>
            <li>Shaving my legs was ok not a close shave</li>
            <li>this razor is OK for legs but the don&#x27;t recommend it for underarms ..</li>
            <li>paid alot more</li>
            <li>then i&#x27;m accustom to paying my razors for this one I thought it would be better cause</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it cost more</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold a charge well, fits nicely in your hand and has an easily accessible on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>The product came in packaging, perfect condition, charges good, definitely chargefor like a day when you first get it so it is fully powered.  </li>
            <li>I bought this electric razor mainly based on the great reviews I saw here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I did the research and decided to get this one because of the affordable price and pretty good</li>
            <li>I like it THAT much. :p</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge for a long time and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>In fact, you&#x27;ll find yourself shaving more since it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean, and it works in the shower.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but in comparison, WDF 6000 is way better.  </li>
            <li>While I think this razor is a lot better for the planet than disposables, it could be much more earth friendly.  </li>
            <li>My new one is very effective and does not hurt like this one did.</li>
            <li>This product is the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor.</li>
            <li>It shaves smoothly, without irritation, and does an outstanding job.  </li>
            <li>Since I was very satisfied with the performance of the shaver the first time I did not hesitate to buy it again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive areas as well as to avoid nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>I still like this product and think it is good value and works very well.</li>
            <li>It is a good value, works very well</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and received in good condition.</li>
            <li>Good design, and gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better razors that I have bought,  Keeps your legs smooth for days and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>But there are times when you want to be able to shave your legs quickly without the shaving cream and all that, so I decided to try to find a better razor this time around.  </li>
            <li>It takes too many strokes to get a clean shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to grip and hold.</li>
            <li>The product is, as advertised, safe to use in the shower, and the instructions that come with it say to run water over the cutters/blades after every use to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives a close shave &amp; is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is easy to hold in your hand and also to place in the charger.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is rechargeable, cordless, and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It works fine for me and for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Service and delivery was excellent, received it in less than a week.</li>
            <li>Worked fine since them, today will not turn on,</li>
            <li>Does fine on your legs, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these before and they&#x27;ve worked fine.</li>
            <li>I was looking into getting a new one, mostly because I found out that the replacement cutters are kind of pricey.</li>
            <li>The grip is easy to use and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean, comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase as it leaves my legs smooth</li>
            <li>Overall I think it is a great deal for the price</li>
            <li>Its not so great with underarms though, requiring numerous passes, which tended to irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happily it was also inexpensive and had the features (such as rechargeable) that matter to me.</li>
            <li>so i tryed the remington smooth and silky electric..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 weeks now and have given my legs the recommended amount of time to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; and it still isn&#x27;t that smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I think its afantastic choice and the price is cheap too...</li>
            <li>B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]]</li>
            <li>OVERALL THE SHAVER ITSELF IS GREAT</li>
            <li>Smooth and Silky.</li>
            <li>I never knew a guy who liked an electric shaver, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>I can charge it up and take it with me for a weekend trip and it&#x27;s easy to clean.    </li>
            <li>I purchased the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable, for a friend who is handicapped.  </li>
            <li>B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]]</li>
            <li>(it wasn&#x27;t a cheap one, either).</li>
            <li>I was being cheap and bought this one over the WDF 6000.  </li>
            <li>When I tried to order the blades again, they were no longer available.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this Remington Smooth and Silky shaver gives you really smooth legs.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington WDF-5500 Smooth &amp; Silky Ladies Shaver for 3 years and it just died.  </li>
            <li>Legs are smooth.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth.</li>
            <li>I shave every day and it gives me a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I bought Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable product 2 years ago</li>
            <li>The push button is superior to the slide button on the old one.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m delighted.  </li>
            <li>Good shave and probably would last longer if I used it more in the winter.</li>
            <li>When I first used this razor, I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, a nice weight, it holds a charge well and it recharges super fast!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, and I was able to get a clean shave from the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>They made it easy and gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very powerful, and I feel like it needs a charge before I&#x27;m halfway</li>
            <li>From the first use my skin was feeling more comfortable than after razor.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I highly  recommend it as it out-performed a shaver that I had by another popular brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much my original one cost because it was a gift.  </li>
            <li>Shaves nice and smooth and is alot more convenient than a regular razor.</li>
            <li>be sure to charge it before your first use for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s totally worth buying!      </li>
            <li>End result, close shave, easy to use, holds adequate charge to accomplish the task AND the price is certainly right!</li>
            <li>* to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>It gives you a clean shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>It was a good razor too but the battery life was not very long.  </li>
            <li>I dont know if there&#x27;s some special tecnique for this, but it just doesnt get the hairs.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you that baby smooth clean shave like a razor does right away, you&#x27;ll have to work the skin in a repeated motions a while</li>
            <li>It worked great, but it does feel a bit rough to use.</li>
            <li>I still feel it&#x27;s a bit rough on the skin, but it does remove the hair, so I am happy.</li>
            <li>Overall a great razor and a cheaper alternative to buying disposable cartridges so much!</li>
            <li>However, since Amazon sells those at a much more reasonable price (compared to Remington&#x27;s website), I think I&#x27;ll stick with this one and just replace the cutters.</li>
            <li>For the best result, press it against your skin, not too much but enough for you to feel it glide without too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Just plug it in when you find it getting low, and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t get a good enough shave as i did when i used it out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I loved it and definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>$30.00 a year is not bad for an electric razor if it does the job.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job; I was surprised that the  trimmer provided such a close shave as well.</li>
            <li>On the first use the razor shaved fine.</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews on here and took a few weeks of reading and researching before buying it</li>
            <li>If you are lucky, it might work well for years.</li>
            <li>battery runs out too quickly reluctantly scratching my legs.</li>
            <li>Even when fully charged this product can run out of battery quickly.</li>
            <li>The plus side is it makes shaving super quick and a soothing experience - something it has never been for me until I started using is shaver...</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the entire purchase process...</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and stays charged.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly after I purchased it</li>
            <li>Gives an adequate have on legs.</li>
            <li>Shaver\\&quot; for bikini or underarm areas as it has never ripped my hair out, and I can do a quick wet/dry shave without worrying.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>There was light razor burn after the first time or two using it, but that went away quickly.</li>
            <li>For the price I think this is a really great razor considering I have seen many much more expensive electric ones.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars as it might work better with normal skin.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!This was by far the best Christmas present of the bunch!  </li>
            <li>(I thought that maybe the irritation came because it was the very first use of the razor.  </li>
            <li>She has been very pleased with it, and asked that I get her a second one for our daughter</li>
            <li>I love this new razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought this back in Feb., and loved it the first 2-3 times I used it.</li>
            <li>But for between times and a quick touch up, this razor is definitely worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, it gives such an easy and smooth shave!</li>
            <li>No more cuts, my skin feels SO smooth, I REALLY love it!!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see a single hair on my legs when I&#x27;m finished shaving, which is impressive for my Italian legs.  </li>
            <li>As with any electric shaver, there is a little stubble when she is done, but it&#x27;s a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower, since I use a regular razor in the shower, but I&#x27;m sure it will do just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and fast, works as well as a razor but without the cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li>This product produces a fast, trouble-free, smooth shave every time.  </li>
            <li>My legs felt pretty smooth even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
            <li>Still worth the price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that when I&#x27;m off the blood thinner that I won&#x27;t go back to manual razors.</li>
            <li>and I can shave more frequently without irritation.</li>
            <li>When it does finally get all or most of the hair it is smooth.</li>
            <li>I had an old Remington similar to this model that I had for over 13 years that was great</li>
            <li>No unhappy results here.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I found a Remington Mens shaver that I liked and my wife wanted a Lady Remington just like the one she has had for over 5 years , so I ordered hers at the Same time</li>
            <li>she just had a hip replacement and the shaver is useful</li>
            <li>It does a good job of shaving my legs when I don&#x27;t want to get wet.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed - a quick option to lathering up.  </li>
            <li>but this Remington WDF-1600 shaves close and pretty quick</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>And the price is right.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver because it was cheap and it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li>I purchased a new one because I love the shaver so much.</li>
            <li>I have used it wet and dry and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>but apparently nobody sells those any more.</li>
            <li>The blade compartment is much tighter so it doesn&#x27;t get full of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very coarse, fast growing hair and love the extremely smooth shave that I get.      </li>
            <li>This gets me smooth and doesn&#x27;t give me ANY of the irritation that I got EVERY time I used a normal razor.      </li>
            <li>The hair does not grow back as fast, I love this!</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about it, is that it is easy to clean unlike my last electric razor</li>
            <li>This will be a good feature when I travel, less to pack.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, versatile (wet/dry), the charge lasts for days and is so easy to clean - just flip open and rinse.</li>
            <li>The razor cleans easily and makes it easy to do touch ups, which I do pretty much every other day since I like it smooth.</li>
            <li>It does work well in that it will effectively cut away the hair on legs, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have limited time as it does take quite some time to operate.</li>
            <li>but my old one fits just fine.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it seems to work much better dry than wet.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many regular and electric.</li>
            <li>Got a close shave without any stubble,razor burn or bumps the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>and you can just pop the top open and brush the hair out.  </li>
            <li>It even did my bikini area pretty well.</li>
            <li>A bit od razor burn under my arms the first time but after that I never had a problem.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it can be used in the shower and actually prefer to do so.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaver.</li>
            <li>I can only rate this as OK.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaver.</li>
            <li>but I got one from the first use.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it in the shower, it pulled and pinched a lot.  </li>
            <li>Or whenever they first came out with that color combo.    </li>
            <li>And will likely buy a better product to replace it with.</li>
            <li>It does hold a charge well, and it&#x27;s pretty, but I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the sides of the shaver doing it</li>
            <li>that it takes more passes to get all the hair, hence only four stars).</li>
            <li>More effort that using a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>A week later, it shaves better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this shaver from the amazon website and I&#x27;m very pleased so far with it.</li>
            <li>This Remington Electric Shaver is exactly what I anticipated...</li>
            <li>Anyway, the first time I used this, I dropped it - my hands are a bit klutzy.  </li>
            <li>Ii is the first electric razor I have ever owned</li>
            <li>Did not get 5 stars because first shaver was defective.  </li>
            <li>for the first two months.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve had an electric razor .</li>
            <li>this one is much better and the same price.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that this shaver would work better than razors, but it doesn&#x27;t last any longer.</li>
            <li>This is the first rechargeable shaver I have owned</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The Remington shaver lasted for years, like ten years or more.</li>
            <li>I have used this razor several times on my underarms, and it is not getting any better.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased several Remington ladies shavers over the years and have been pleased with them.</li>
            <li>For many years I went the traditional shaving route - a safety razor in the shower with a foaming shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>I tried an electric epilator, but it broke too many hairs (leaving my legs with constant stubble), and it caused many ingrown hairs even though I exfoliated regularly.  </li>
            <li>When it comes time to replace the blades, I&#x27;ll probably just replace the whole thing!</li>
            <li>I selected this for my daughter&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this, thinking that is was going to be better than regular shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll surely buy another one when needed in the future.</li>
            <li>As with most electric razors, it doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as a disposable razor, but you definitely can&#x27;t see the hair after you use it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I posted the first review.</li>
            <li>Mohave not had a problem with it since, don&#x27;t know what happened the first time it quit.  </li>
            <li>Ok maybe I have unusually coarse hair</li>
            <li>that is defective (when I have had only good experiences with Amazon over the years except for one other non-delivery of an item snafu which Amazon quickly rectified)!</li>
            <li>Right now the WDF 6000 is only a couple dollars more, so I would highly recommend buying that one!</li>
            <li>it right, folks - be gentle and be patient.</li>
            <li>I can tell it has shaved a little, but no matter how many times I go over and over it just doesnt feel smooth, and it always misses hairs, no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>And, most importantly, it vibrates at the right frequency all the time, so no more pulled hairs.       </li>
            <li>This one does as nice a job as the shaver that cost 3 times as much and is more comfortable for sensitive areas like underarms and behind the knees.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it does shave nicely on my legs (and even the bikini area - if you are gentle and careful), but I really needed it for my underarms (the hair grows faster and is more obvious there.)  </li>
            <li>It shaves my areas clean with no stubble and my skin feels soft after.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the initial purchase price, especially on Amazon, is quite good.</li>
            <li>Very easy to return, in fact new one was received before I had the chance to send the defective one back.  </li>
            <li>No razor burn, nothing but a pretty decent shave!    </li>
            <li>My legs were dry on my first attempt and I&#x27;m sure shaving would have hurt if I hadn&#x27;t of stopped.</li>
            <li>If you want to be smooth and shaven down there, then buy a shaver, but if you are satisfied with a decent &amp;#34;clip job&amp;#34;, then this is what you need.  </li>
            <li>the positive side, the 1600 hasn&#x27;t had any problems charging, and the charge lasts awhile.  </li>
            <li>A positive is that this works in the shower.  </li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews, I ordered the product.</li>
            <li>but it is fantastic for the entire leg, leaving a soft smooth feel to the touch.</li>
            <li>In past I have had difficulty finding a good product for my condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the razor on both dry and wet skin, I find it works far better on warm, damp skin, so I use it either right after a hot shower or during one.</li>
            <li>I used razor, but cuts and after shave burns (and having to shave almost everyday) made me look for a better way to keep me clean shaved.</li>
            <li>My legs adjusted fine to it, I only had redness the first time, others say up to three weeks.  </li>
            <li>It was not expensive but still a nice little shaver</li>
            <li>but I sure did use it dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come apart and go back together easily.</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy one again.</li>
            <li>, I brought it to my new apartment and let it charge before making a final love it or chuck it decision.</li>
            <li>This is a necessary item for grooming and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>but it does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it was simple to put it back together and it ran just fine after my accident.  </li>
            <li>I got fed up taking so much time and patience</li>
            <li>and this is the only one I actually enjoy using.</li>
            <li>how gently or what way we tried it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs smooth and the shave seems to last longer.  </li>
            <li>What I really want is a corded women&#x27;s shaver</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I really did like the shaver itself, even if it didn&#x27;t shave super-close.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this really works.</li>
            <li>Even with the two year warrantee it was to much of a hassle I tried calling the warrantee place</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and wasn&#x27;t using much pressure at all.  </li>
            <li>I do have very curly hair and that might have some impact on the the shaver&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li>Since this is my first experience with an underarm electric shaver, I don&#x27;t know if this is normal--</li>
            <li>If your looking for a women&#x27;s shaver that will be gentle on your legs</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always ready to go.</li>
            <li>While the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra shaver gets the job done, it does so only passingly.</li>
            <li>so I was gentle</li>
            <li>/&gt;This could be the nature of both my skin and my hair, but either way I am absolutely delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will just be more careful when shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my wife and she seems to be liking it so much.</li>
            <li>Wife really likes how it works.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li>so it is ready when I want to use it.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable in your hand, otherwise I think I&#x27;ll go back to the Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li>THANKFULLY I HAVE ANOTHER CHARGER THAT FIT FROM A SIMILAR SHAVER</li>
            <li>It was better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Low sound.</li>
            <li>If I can help it, I will never use a real razor again.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but find it that it takes much longer to do than shaving</li>
            <li>and I really like that feature.  </li>
            <li>My legs were breaking out from a straight edge razor and my dermatologist did not know why.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li>Legs feel as smooth as using a regular blade razor.</li>
            <li>Does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>This razor may not shave quite as close and silky smooth as disposables, but it will last a lot longer!</li>
            <li>Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent all that money on it and not being able to use it.</li>
            <li>It cuts much of the hair off of the legs, underarms, and bikini area.</li>
            <li>Gets real close, and doesn&#x27;t leave razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace a far more expensive Braun shaver whose battery would no longer keep a good charge.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse hair, and it takes a lot more effort to shave with this than it did with my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>More passes over an area &#x3D; more skin irritation, which is not great.  </li>
            <li>Having used non-electric shavers for the last decade or so, I think it&#x27;s a nice alternative to constantly throwing things away.</li>
            <li>This shaver works fine, though not as well as my older Norelo, which recently died.  </li>
            <li>she&#x27;s actually thinks it is fun!</li>
            <li>It works okay on the rest of my legs but not as well as my other Remington shavers.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Smooth and Silky because my first Remmington gave out last month; it is a similar model to my first one.</li>
            <li>It was new of course and actually advertised accurately.</li>
            <li>Electric razors only work right if you use them consistently.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have tried in nearly 30 years.  </li>
            <li>but for daily use and mobiility full points.</li>
            <li>I have had the product since the beginning of October and it has pretty much completely quit shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new razor and will not be buying a Remington!</li>
            <li>The only issue that I have is that I have to go over an area a few times, other than that, PERFECT!!</li>
            <li>I was really upset because I thought I&#x27;d ruined my new shaver.  </li>
            <li>my previous Remingtons were better than this one</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth and Silky Ultra Shaver to replace my old one that I have had for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an older Remington shaver for years now.  </li>
            <li>obviously, i can&#x27;t use it anymore, so im looking for a different, better electric razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent for an electric razor shave- as close as you can get.    </li>
            <li>they are more narrow and that didn&#x27;t seem like it would be very efficient.    </li>
            <li>This was a decent shaver.</li>
            <li>I have been through many shavers and this is the only one that actually works!  </li>
            <li>but I have to say that the very first shave was just about as close as I could get from a regular razor and</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not sure doing it on dry skin is all that great.</li>
            <li>I like it because you can shave pretty quickly without having to get wet.  </li>
            <li>But the long-term maintenance costs are too high.</li>
            <li>It shaves closely with a high comfort level.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this razor and the seller I purchased it from.</li>
            <li>l Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for about six months and then for reasons unknown, without being dropped, used in water, or buried in the backyard by the dog, etc.</li>
            <li>It does have a little pull, like a pinch really, but the more I use it, the less I feel it, even on the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I just require something with a little more oomph.</li>
            <li>It became a nightly habit to shave a little more.</li>
            <li>Had to send the first one back due to not being able to take and hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>Love this little razor.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the company via e-mail and heard back saying that I had to charge the unit for a certain amount of hours before using the first time to keep a charge, which I had.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives a much closer shave to my legs than the old one did, but I cannot use it under my arms because it chafs the skin.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I again experienced irritation.  </li>
            <li>This razor comes with a product insert that states: \\&quot;Under normal use, we recommend replacing the screens every 6 months and the cutters every 12 months.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It is quite noisy,but the final results are worth the noise.</li>
            <li>the hair needs to get into one of the many holes in the screen in order to get cut &amp; the charge doesn&#x27;t last long either----</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a few more chances considering</li>
            <li>But I had that problem with a normal razor too, so</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t have a problem with shaving</li>
            <li>It is probably a good shaver (works well) based on the reviews here but with poor quality control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hard to please person</li>
            <li>Only problem is that it&#x27;s pretty loud but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a single problem (well, not until I tried to put deodorant on right after...ouch!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my new Remington WDF-1600 for about two months now</li>
            <li>so I was thinking about getting replacement parts but getting a new razor</li>
            <li>When this one wears out I&#x27;ll just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>It is noisy, but I can live with it for the amount of time it is in use.</li>
            <li>I tried my new razor on my underarms using almost NO pressure.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll be finding a new electric razor</li>
            <li>I charge my new razor for the recommended 18 hours</li>
            <li>It was very smooth, no more buring and itching.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user, I would recommend a small patch first or a couple of patches to ensure that you feel just right with the amount of pressure you use to glide along the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even the same color as this one (instead of white, it&#x27;s a light purple with the darker purple accents).</li>
            <li>have only confirmed my initial opinion.  </li>
            <li>However, the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky I purcahsed earlier last year had a probelm with it</li>
            <li>To echo other reviewers, this is an underarm destroyer, (ok, I&#x27;m exaggerating)  but on multiple occasions this thing has pinched my underarm.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m STUCK with a non-functioning shaver, and no refund or replacement and my sister is still using her old one!      </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m presently surprised!</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, especially considering the price of decent disposable razors, waxing, etc.</li>
            <li>and you have to shave several times in the same area to get a clean shave)</li>
            <li>Oh, and it says you can use it wet or dry, but it is pretty much better dry because then it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin as much.</li>
            <li>Guess when the head and blades need replacing, I&#x27;ll just junk the old razor and get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six weeks of using this razor</li>
            <li>I think it needs a new battery, but my old one did not need a  battery this soon.</li>
            <li>I previously owned the Smooth and Silky WDF-3000 which lasted me almost 10 years...</li>
            <li>Overall, this was a positive transaction.</li>
            <li>Most often I end up shaving the bottom half of my legs one day and finish them the next.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades for my old Remington razor were getting too expensive, so I thought this brand new razor would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Although I paid a little more than the current price of $14.99 (about $16 something)  </li>
            <li>So far it works well, but the directions say that it will take several uses before you get a real close shave.</li>
            <li>WOW and thank you Remington.</li>
            <li>So far didn&#x27;t get any pinches or burns.</li>
            <li>It really irritated my underarms and it lasted for several days.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised for the price that this shaver does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have particularly sensitive skin, but I experience what seems to be \\&quot;razor</li>
            <li>MY OLD REMINGTON RAZOR DIED....</li>
            <li>Ugh... I feel that this almost has no benefit over a regular razor (a regular razor has never left my underarm feeling like this before!), as you still have to go over the area multiple times, and in many directions sometimes.  </li>
            <li>The screen is sensitive but that it why it shaves so closely.</li>
            <li>the product offers</li>
            <li>I think if you are someone who has only always shaved with a non-electric &#x27;handle&#x27; shaver, you may feel like this is much slower.  </li>
            <li>and I have had frequent episodes of razor burn.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft without moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I ordered this razor for my 10 year old after she begged to shave her legs.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver hoping it would be like my old one</li>
            <li>I had to purchase this shaver 2ce within a year because my 8 yr old grandson mischeviously damaged my 1st one.  </li>
            <li>i could have gotten it fixed</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get a very close shave compared to a regular razor</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace my daughters old electric razor that broke.  </li>
            <li>I always discharge it completely before recharging.</li>
            <li>Obviously this does not give you the same smooth shave as a regular razor</li>
            <li>I only use it on those days your running   a bit late or need a quick clean up, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li>I did have some irritation under my arms, but they have always been sensitive</li>
            <li>Oh and I have had no razor burn in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>DO NOT ATTEMPT to shave your under arms with this razor if you have even slightly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Works well on legs and arms, but for the sensitive zones(bikini and underarms)</li>
            <li>i replaced this for my old one wich lasted 7 years before the screen broke.  </li>
            <li>I could be spending that much on replacement blades for a regular razor.</li>
            <li>But I will say that this works descent enough on your legs, yes you do have to go over the same area about 2 or 3 times, which can be consuming, so by the time you get to your other leg, you better be quick because the battery will run out or start slowing down.</li>
            <li>To buy a new charger costs almost as much as an entire new shaver package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first rechargable shaver that I&#x27;ve tried since the 90&#x27;s when they were awful, and works almost as good as a razor - not quite as smooth, but close.</li>
            <li>So is there a decent electric shaver for legs &amp; arm pits out there for low price?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this same model for years and it still works just as well as when I first purchased it on Amazon, even though I&#x27;ve dropped it multiple times.</li>
            <li>This new razor seems to be equal in quality to the old one.  </li>
            <li>rate this razor 5 stars for ease of use, 4 for working well for shaving, but only 1 for how much it costs to keep it in working shape over time due to having to pay far too much for replacement parts.</li>
            <li>I ordered two of these shavers (one for my sister and one for myself) based on both of us using previous incarnations of these shavers and being quite satisfied but due to age, dullness of blades, and batteries not holding charges for</li>
            <li>Using it on the legs is easy, I don&#x27;t know about other areas since you have to be careful not to put it at an angle which the instructions say will harm your skin.  </li>
            <li>it was so unreliable that I&#x27;m back online looking for a new one.  </li>
            <li>but it would have cost almost the same price as buying this new one</li>
            <li>My wife was looking for a new Ladies shaver at about the same time I was for a mens shaver myself.</li>
            <li>It was definitely brand new when I received it.</li>
            <li>I have only had this razor for a few months and it caused bumps with even light pressure.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s not super heavy or clunky, very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I think next times I&#x27;ll go a little more expensive and see if it does a better job.</li>
            <li>Better than a regular razor I use especially since I wear glasses and end up missing a lot since I obviously can&#x27;t wear them in the shower!</li>
            <li>long felt that it was time to replace the older models with this newer one.    </li>
            <li>a few weeks later, halfway through shaving, the screen came clean off.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job though you must go over the area several times at different angles.  </li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints at all with this product (except possibly</li>
            <li>I like the razor alot, but I expected a bit of a closer shave from it, it hasn&#x27;t givenme that much of a closer shave,</li>
            <li>Definitely not recommended for the sensitive zones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and thus far have not had any issues with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>but this razor has never run more than two seconds in the last few tries.</li>
            <li>I would think the company would stand behind their products better.</li>
            <li>After a few initial re-charges it now holds a charge for about 5 full shaves.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t let the hair on my legs get too long; also it&#x27;s very loud</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that replacement blades and a replacement head are more expensive than just buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I kept it dry and clean, used it once every couple or few days</li>
            <li>It does not hurt, I did get two little bumps on my leg(non-painful), and the shave is pretty close to the leg.</li>
            <li>now, 2 days later, I can just barely begin to feel some stubble.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say that if you&#x27;re a first time user it will take a few times to get a close shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d purchased it as a replacement for my far more expensive model, which ran about 3x the price and did about the same job.  </li>
            <li>She has told me that it works fine as long as you take your time and go slowly.  </li>
            <li>I was really let down by the product.</li>
            <li>Last week one of the screens tore...to get them out to replace them did damage to the head in general because of the way it opens (hinges to one side) and rendered the entire unit inoperable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for nearly a year now and the battery will no longer hold a long enough charge to get both legs shaved.</li>
            <li>I noted that one woman complained about irritation and welts, and that another woman said her husband claimed that the woman experienced irritation because she pressed down too hard with the razor.  </li>
            <li>So far I have only used it on dry legs.    </li>
            <li>(this is why I only gave it 3stars, I&#x27;m a single mom of a 15mth old n time</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A great ladies shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> And this razor works great.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> Great product....</li>
            <li> For the legs, it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I returned the unit and amazon did a great job with the return.</li>
            <li> I use it under my arms too and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> an it worked great.</li>
            <li> I love this thing - and for the price, it&#x27;s a steal!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> It shaves very nicely, I wasn&#x27;t unsatisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I had no irritation whatsoever on my legs, and got a very nice shave.  </li>
            <li> i bought one of these from the px today and its amazing!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li> She is very happy ans satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many shavers through the years and find this shaver to be the best.</li>
            <li> Just like most everyone else here, I am very happy with my shaver.</li>
            <li> It is probably the best one on the market at a cheap price, but I stopped using it after two months because it just burns!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Gave it two stars because it looks and feels good and seems to be a good product--just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> the results have been as good as the razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after reading the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It shaves good, does not leave a rash.</li>
            <li> &quot; shaves, it does a good job</li>
            <li> This razor is really good.  </li>
            <li> It gives a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> it gave a good shave, however, battery gave out after 14 months.</li>
            <li> it does a good job</li>
            <li> It was good for the amount of time that it lasted, around 4 months.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington corded shaver for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have had this one for just about a month now and the shaver does a very good job although it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as a razor.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this razor on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shaver does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and it would probably be great if I used it more often.</li>
            <li> The price is great too, no need to spend more ....</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> and I just couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I tried the product for about 3-4 days now and I totally in love with it!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Love this item!</li>
            <li> Love this electric razor!</li>
            <li> This is so easy and a great starter for my daughter to use.  </li>
            <li> I get a good shave, leaving my legs very smooth.</li>
            <li> I now have great smooth skin that doesn&#x27;t look like a battlefield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor shaves smoothly in the shower and I experienced no razor burn on either my legs or underarms.  </li>
            <li> this was sort of an impulse buy, but it worked amazingly...</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky Electric Razor and it is great.</li>
            <li> It has been great for my legs, leaving them almost as smooth as a razor.</li>
            <li> Also, the 6000 has an indicator that the battery needs charging, which is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for the days I forget to shave, and don&#x27;t have time to lather up... gives a nice smooth shave even where Venus razors left stubbly. :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> I have wanted a shaver of my own for some time now</li>
            <li> You do get a nice close clip on your legs and don&#x27;t have to do it so often.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is really nice to have to trim *</li>
            <li> I dont think I would buy this again, honestly.</li>
            <li> and she is thrilled with its performance</li>
            <li> This fills nicely and both wife &amp; husband can use it.</li>
            <li> The one nice thing was I never cut or nicked myself.</li>
            <li> but I have to say this one is nice.</li>
            <li> I am loving my shaver, but I am going to have to stick to blades for under my arms.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy and an excellent result.</li>
            <li> True to it&#x27;s features, this shaver is excellent along the curves and I have gotten a close, smooth shave everytime I use it.  </li>
            <li> My new electric shaver is great!  </li>
            <li> Hesitate to get a new one, but this model is perfect in every way.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to use, is conveniently rechargeable, and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s great for a quick shave when you don&#x27;t want to bother with water/shower, all that stuff.</li>
            <li> It works great, and she loves how easy to it is to use and clean it!  </li>
            <li> If you want to prevent bumps(in-growns) just make sure you exfoliate and make sure you moisturize!</li>
            <li> It is the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Great razor for for the right price.</li>
            <li> I had not owned an electric razor in about 15 years, mainly because the razor I had didn&#x27;t do a very good job</li>
            <li> My 20 year old Chick electric shaver still works better than this Remington!!!</li>
            <li> The good reviews and the price motivated me into choosing the Remington Smooth and Silky Ultra Shaver and I am glad I did.    </li>
            <li> the charger breaks very easily and it takes more than a day to charge.</li>
            <li> and I found it very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far and the price was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a quick shave... worked fine in and out of the shower...</li>
            <li> Originally this was a gift for my wife whom is very pleased &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Also, this is very useful for someone recovering from an injury who can&#x27;t safely manuever razors in the shower!</li>
            <li> the on-off switch is really touchy and the re-charge light is very bright, plus there is no carrying case</li>
            <li> A huge plus is that it&#x27;s rechargeable!  </li>
            <li> Choose the panasonic for $5 more.</li>
            <li> I have purchased more types of hair removers than I care to admit to over the years</li>
            <li> Glad I chose to get this one.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> As someone else said, don&#x27;t bother spending more on a \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; shaver, because this one will give you everything you could want.  </li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> but I would not have been able to post.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I was weary to buy a personal shaver online, but I am very happy I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m impressed, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and would recommend it</li>
            <li> i love my close shaves with my razors and was hoping to get it outta the electric</li>
            <li> glad i saved the receipt</li>
            <li> and im bringing it back and buying the best razor out there.</li>
            <li> I am no longer able to shave my underarms do to health reasons, so I now have to use an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would suggest finding a better quality product with longer life.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve given this one only 3 stars because one shaver (mine) has worked excellently</li>
            <li> I will attempt to return it and get a better one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> The top portion that touches the skin is called the foil.</li>
            <li> There will be a lot more research done before another model shows up on my credit card bill.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Cuts ok but still need hand razor for the close cuts you need on under arms and over the lip.</li>
            <li> I really do love this razor.  </li>
            <li> and she feels a razor is better than this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I got razor burn from it, but I suspect it was more user error than product deficiency.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your great service.</li>
            <li> and it is not any better.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I figured it was time to replace after so many years.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s cordless-</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t-</li>
            <li> The instructions say that it can shave the hair in any direction, but I have found that it works much better when you shave in the direction of your hair growth.  </li>
            <li> He is pleased that he can shave himself and loves the ease of a rechargeable, cordless shaver.</li>
            <li> and I am for the most part satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Remington razors before and was satisfied</li>
            <li> I tried waxing more than once</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product before I bought it</li>
            <li> but Im glad I did.</li>
            <li> I do not get the razor burn any more.</li>
            <li> I love the wet/dry feature bc</li>
            <li> either way content for the most part.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m able to shave both legs.</li>
            <li> I have to shave the bottom of my legs, recharge, then shave the top.</li>
            <li> I would gladly pay more for an electric razor that was nicer to our planet.</li>
            <li> My wife is a satisfied Remington WDF 1600 Ultra shaver user, oh yes and so is our daughter.</li>
            <li> I thought I got a better shave using a razor.</li>
            <li> and I was able to shave my legs and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> She was pleased although she did say.</li>
            <li> This one is so much better.</li>
            <li> glad to have it</li>
            <li> Shaving my legs was ok not a close shave</li>
            <li> this razor is OK for legs but the don&#x27;t recommend it for underarms ..</li>
            <li> paid alot more</li>
            <li> then i&#x27;m accustom to paying my razors for this one I thought it would be better cause</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it cost more</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold a charge well, fits nicely in your hand and has an easily accessible on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> The product came in packaging, perfect condition, charges good, definitely chargefor like a day when you first get it so it is fully powered.  </li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor mainly based on the great reviews I saw here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I did the research and decided to get this one because of the affordable price and pretty good</li>
            <li> I like it THAT much. :p</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a long time and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> In fact, you&#x27;ll find yourself shaving more since it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean, and it works in the shower.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but in comparison, WDF 6000 is way better.  </li>
            <li> While I think this razor is a lot better for the planet than disposables, it could be much more earth friendly.  </li>
            <li> My new one is very effective and does not hurt like this one did.</li>
            <li> This product is the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> It shaves smoothly, without irritation, and does an outstanding job.  </li>
            <li> Since I was very satisfied with the performance of the shaver the first time I did not hesitate to buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive areas as well as to avoid nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> I still like this product and think it is good value and works very well.</li>
            <li> It is a good value, works very well</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and received in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good design, and gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better razors that I have bought,  Keeps your legs smooth for days and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> But there are times when you want to be able to shave your legs quickly without the shaving cream and all that, so I decided to try to find a better razor this time around.  </li>
            <li> It takes too many strokes to get a clean shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to grip and hold.</li>
            <li> The product is, as advertised, safe to use in the shower, and the instructions that come with it say to run water over the cutters/blades after every use to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave &amp; is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to hold in your hand and also to place in the charger.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is rechargeable, cordless, and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> It works fine for me and for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Service and delivery was excellent, received it in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Worked fine since them, today will not turn on,</li>
            <li> Does fine on your legs, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these before and they&#x27;ve worked fine.</li>
            <li> I was looking into getting a new one, mostly because I found out that the replacement cutters are kind of pricey.</li>
            <li> The grip is easy to use and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean, comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase as it leaves my legs smooth</li>
            <li> Overall I think it is a great deal for the price</li>
            <li> Its not so great with underarms though, requiring numerous passes, which tended to irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Happily it was also inexpensive and had the features (such as rechargeable) that matter to me.</li>
            <li> so i tryed the remington smooth and silky electric..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 weeks now and have given my legs the recommended amount of time to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; and it still isn&#x27;t that smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I think its afantastic choice and the price is cheap too...</li>
            <li> B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]]</li>
            <li> OVERALL THE SHAVER ITSELF IS GREAT</li>
            <li> Smooth and Silky.</li>
            <li> I never knew a guy who liked an electric shaver, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> I can charge it up and take it with me for a weekend trip and it&#x27;s easy to clean.    </li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable, for a friend who is handicapped.  </li>
            <li> B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]]</li>
            <li> (it wasn&#x27;t a cheap one, either).</li>
            <li> I was being cheap and bought this one over the WDF 6000.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to order the blades again, they were no longer available.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this Remington Smooth and Silky shaver gives you really smooth legs.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington WDF-5500 Smooth &amp; Silky Ladies Shaver for 3 years and it just died.  </li>
            <li> Legs are smooth.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth.</li>
            <li> I shave every day and it gives me a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I bought Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable product 2 years ago</li>
            <li> The push button is superior to the slide button on the old one.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m delighted.  </li>
            <li> Good shave and probably would last longer if I used it more in the winter.</li>
            <li> When I first used this razor, I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, a nice weight, it holds a charge well and it recharges super fast!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, and I was able to get a clean shave from the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> They made it easy and gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very powerful, and I feel like it needs a charge before I&#x27;m halfway</li>
            <li> From the first use my skin was feeling more comfortable than after razor.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I highly  recommend it as it out-performed a shaver that I had by another popular brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much my original one cost because it was a gift.  </li>
            <li> Shaves nice and smooth and is alot more convenient than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> be sure to charge it before your first use for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s totally worth buying!      </li>
            <li> End result, close shave, easy to use, holds adequate charge to accomplish the task AND the price is certainly right!</li>
            <li> * to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> It gives you a clean shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> It was a good razor too but the battery life was not very long.  </li>
            <li> I dont know if there&#x27;s some special tecnique for this, but it just doesnt get the hairs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you that baby smooth clean shave like a razor does right away, you&#x27;ll have to work the skin in a repeated motions a while</li>
            <li> It worked great, but it does feel a bit rough to use.</li>
            <li> I still feel it&#x27;s a bit rough on the skin, but it does remove the hair, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> Overall a great razor and a cheaper alternative to buying disposable cartridges so much!</li>
            <li> However, since Amazon sells those at a much more reasonable price (compared to Remington&#x27;s website), I think I&#x27;ll stick with this one and just replace the cutters.</li>
            <li> For the best result, press it against your skin, not too much but enough for you to feel it glide without too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Just plug it in when you find it getting low, and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t get a good enough shave as i did when i used it out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I loved it and definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li> $30.00 a year is not bad for an electric razor if it does the job.</li>
            <li> It does a very good job; I was surprised that the  trimmer provided such a close shave as well.</li>
            <li> On the first use the razor shaved fine.</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews on here and took a few weeks of reading and researching before buying it</li>
            <li> If you are lucky, it might work well for years.</li>
            <li> battery runs out too quickly reluctantly scratching my legs.</li>
            <li> Even when fully charged this product can run out of battery quickly.</li>
            <li> The plus side is it makes shaving super quick and a soothing experience - something it has never been for me until I started using is shaver...</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the entire purchase process...</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and stays charged.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly after I purchased it</li>
            <li> Gives an adequate have on legs.</li>
            <li> Shaver\\&quot; for bikini or underarm areas as it has never ripped my hair out, and I can do a quick wet/dry shave without worrying.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> There was light razor burn after the first time or two using it, but that went away quickly.</li>
            <li> For the price I think this is a really great razor considering I have seen many much more expensive electric ones.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars as it might work better with normal skin.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!This was by far the best Christmas present of the bunch!  </li>
            <li> (I thought that maybe the irritation came because it was the very first use of the razor.  </li>
            <li> She has been very pleased with it, and asked that I get her a second one for our daughter</li>
            <li> I love this new razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this back in Feb., and loved it the first 2-3 times I used it.</li>
            <li> But for between times and a quick touch up, this razor is definitely worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, it gives such an easy and smooth shave!</li>
            <li> No more cuts, my skin feels SO smooth, I REALLY love it!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see a single hair on my legs when I&#x27;m finished shaving, which is impressive for my Italian legs.  </li>
            <li> As with any electric shaver, there is a little stubble when she is done, but it&#x27;s a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower, since I use a regular razor in the shower, but I&#x27;m sure it will do just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and fast, works as well as a razor but without the cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> This product produces a fast, trouble-free, smooth shave every time.  </li>
            <li> My legs felt pretty smooth even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
            <li> Still worth the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say that when I&#x27;m off the blood thinner that I won&#x27;t go back to manual razors.</li>
            <li> and I can shave more frequently without irritation.</li>
            <li> When it does finally get all or most of the hair it is smooth.</li>
            <li> I had an old Remington similar to this model that I had for over 13 years that was great</li>
            <li> No unhappy results here.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I found a Remington Mens shaver that I liked and my wife wanted a Lady Remington just like the one she has had for over 5 years , so I ordered hers at the Same time</li>
            <li> she just had a hip replacement and the shaver is useful</li>
            <li> It does a good job of shaving my legs when I don&#x27;t want to get wet.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed - a quick option to lathering up.  </li>
            <li> but this Remington WDF-1600 shaves close and pretty quick</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> And the price is right.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it was cheap and it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new one because I love the shaver so much.</li>
            <li> I have used it wet and dry and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> but apparently nobody sells those any more.</li>
            <li> The blade compartment is much tighter so it doesn&#x27;t get full of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse, fast growing hair and love the extremely smooth shave that I get.      </li>
            <li> This gets me smooth and doesn&#x27;t give me ANY of the irritation that I got EVERY time I used a normal razor.      </li>
            <li> The hair does not grow back as fast, I love this!</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about it, is that it is easy to clean unlike my last electric razor</li>
            <li> This will be a good feature when I travel, less to pack.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, versatile (wet/dry), the charge lasts for days and is so easy to clean - just flip open and rinse.</li>
            <li> The razor cleans easily and makes it easy to do touch ups, which I do pretty much every other day since I like it smooth.</li>
            <li> It does work well in that it will effectively cut away the hair on legs, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have limited time as it does take quite some time to operate.</li>
            <li> but my old one fits just fine.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it seems to work much better dry than wet.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many regular and electric.</li>
            <li> Got a close shave without any stubble,razor burn or bumps the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> and you can just pop the top open and brush the hair out.  </li>
            <li> It even did my bikini area pretty well.</li>
            <li> A bit od razor burn under my arms the first time but after that I never had a problem.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it can be used in the shower and actually prefer to do so.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaver.</li>
            <li> I can only rate this as OK.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaver.</li>
            <li> but I got one from the first use.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it in the shower, it pulled and pinched a lot.  </li>
            <li> Or whenever they first came out with that color combo.    </li>
            <li> And will likely buy a better product to replace it with.</li>
            <li> It does hold a charge well, and it&#x27;s pretty, but I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the sides of the shaver doing it</li>
            <li> that it takes more passes to get all the hair, hence only four stars).</li>
            <li> More effort that using a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> A week later, it shaves better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shaver from the amazon website and I&#x27;m very pleased so far with it.</li>
            <li> This Remington Electric Shaver is exactly what I anticipated...</li>
            <li> Anyway, the first time I used this, I dropped it - my hands are a bit klutzy.  </li>
            <li> Ii is the first electric razor I have ever owned</li>
            <li> Did not get 5 stars because first shaver was defective.  </li>
            <li> for the first two months.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve had an electric razor .</li>
            <li> this one is much better and the same price.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that this shaver would work better than razors, but it doesn&#x27;t last any longer.</li>
            <li> This is the first rechargeable shaver I have owned</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The Remington shaver lasted for years, like ten years or more.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor several times on my underarms, and it is not getting any better.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several Remington ladies shavers over the years and have been pleased with them.</li>
            <li> For many years I went the traditional shaving route - a safety razor in the shower with a foaming shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> I tried an electric epilator, but it broke too many hairs (leaving my legs with constant stubble), and it caused many ingrown hairs even though I exfoliated regularly.  </li>
            <li> When it comes time to replace the blades, I&#x27;ll probably just replace the whole thing!</li>
            <li> I selected this for my daughter&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this, thinking that is was going to be better than regular shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll surely buy another one when needed in the future.</li>
            <li> As with most electric razors, it doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as a disposable razor, but you definitely can&#x27;t see the hair after you use it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I posted the first review.</li>
            <li> Mohave not had a problem with it since, don&#x27;t know what happened the first time it quit.  </li>
            <li> Ok maybe I have unusually coarse hair</li>
            <li> that is defective (when I have had only good experiences with Amazon over the years except for one other non-delivery of an item snafu which Amazon quickly rectified)!</li>
            <li> Right now the WDF 6000 is only a couple dollars more, so I would highly recommend buying that one!</li>
            <li> it right, folks - be gentle and be patient.</li>
            <li> I can tell it has shaved a little, but no matter how many times I go over and over it just doesnt feel smooth, and it always misses hairs, no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> And, most importantly, it vibrates at the right frequency all the time, so no more pulled hairs.       </li>
            <li> This one does as nice a job as the shaver that cost 3 times as much and is more comfortable for sensitive areas like underarms and behind the knees.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it does shave nicely on my legs (and even the bikini area - if you are gentle and careful), but I really needed it for my underarms (the hair grows faster and is more obvious there.)  </li>
            <li> It shaves my areas clean with no stubble and my skin feels soft after.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the initial purchase price, especially on Amazon, is quite good.</li>
            <li> Very easy to return, in fact new one was received before I had the chance to send the defective one back.  </li>
            <li> No razor burn, nothing but a pretty decent shave!    </li>
            <li> My legs were dry on my first attempt and I&#x27;m sure shaving would have hurt if I hadn&#x27;t of stopped.</li>
            <li> If you want to be smooth and shaven down there, then buy a shaver, but if you are satisfied with a decent &amp;#34;clip job&amp;#34;, then this is what you need.  </li>
            <li> the positive side, the 1600 hasn&#x27;t had any problems charging, and the charge lasts awhile.  </li>
            <li> A positive is that this works in the shower.  </li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews, I ordered the product.</li>
            <li> but it is fantastic for the entire leg, leaving a soft smooth feel to the touch.</li>
            <li> In past I have had difficulty finding a good product for my condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the razor on both dry and wet skin, I find it works far better on warm, damp skin, so I use it either right after a hot shower or during one.</li>
            <li> I used razor, but cuts and after shave burns (and having to shave almost everyday) made me look for a better way to keep me clean shaved.</li>
            <li> My legs adjusted fine to it, I only had redness the first time, others say up to three weeks.  </li>
            <li> It was not expensive but still a nice little shaver</li>
            <li> but I sure did use it dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come apart and go back together easily.</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy one again.</li>
            <li> , I brought it to my new apartment and let it charge before making a final love it or chuck it decision.</li>
            <li> This is a necessary item for grooming and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> but it does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it was simple to put it back together and it ran just fine after my accident.  </li>
            <li> I got fed up taking so much time and patience</li>
            <li> and this is the only one I actually enjoy using.</li>
            <li> how gently or what way we tried it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs smooth and the shave seems to last longer.  </li>
            <li> What I really want is a corded women&#x27;s shaver</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I really did like the shaver itself, even if it didn&#x27;t shave super-close.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this really works.</li>
            <li> Even with the two year warrantee it was to much of a hassle I tried calling the warrantee place</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and wasn&#x27;t using much pressure at all.  </li>
            <li> I do have very curly hair and that might have some impact on the the shaver&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> Since this is my first experience with an underarm electric shaver, I don&#x27;t know if this is normal--</li>
            <li> If your looking for a women&#x27;s shaver that will be gentle on your legs</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always ready to go.</li>
            <li> While the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra shaver gets the job done, it does so only passingly.</li>
            <li> so I was gentle</li>
            <li> /&gt;This could be the nature of both my skin and my hair, but either way I am absolutely delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will just be more careful when shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and she seems to be liking it so much.</li>
            <li> Wife really likes how it works.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> so it is ready when I want to use it.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable in your hand, otherwise I think I&#x27;ll go back to the Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> THANKFULLY I HAVE ANOTHER CHARGER THAT FIT FROM A SIMILAR SHAVER</li>
            <li> It was better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Low sound.</li>
            <li> If I can help it, I will never use a real razor again.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but find it that it takes much longer to do than shaving</li>
            <li> and I really like that feature.  </li>
            <li> My legs were breaking out from a straight edge razor and my dermatologist did not know why.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> Legs feel as smooth as using a regular blade razor.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> This razor may not shave quite as close and silky smooth as disposables, but it will last a lot longer!</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent all that money on it and not being able to use it.</li>
            <li> It cuts much of the hair off of the legs, underarms, and bikini area.</li>
            <li> Gets real close, and doesn&#x27;t leave razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a far more expensive Braun shaver whose battery would no longer keep a good charge.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse hair, and it takes a lot more effort to shave with this than it did with my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> More passes over an area &#x3D; more skin irritation, which is not great.  </li>
            <li> Having used non-electric shavers for the last decade or so, I think it&#x27;s a nice alternative to constantly throwing things away.</li>
            <li> This shaver works fine, though not as well as my older Norelo, which recently died.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s actually thinks it is fun!</li>
            <li> It works okay on the rest of my legs but not as well as my other Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Smooth and Silky because my first Remmington gave out last month; it is a similar model to my first one.</li>
            <li> It was new of course and actually advertised accurately.</li>
            <li> Electric razors only work right if you use them consistently.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have tried in nearly 30 years.  </li>
            <li> but for daily use and mobiility full points.</li>
            <li> I have had the product since the beginning of October and it has pretty much completely quit shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new razor and will not be buying a Remington!</li>
            <li> The only issue that I have is that I have to go over an area a few times, other than that, PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> I was really upset because I thought I&#x27;d ruined my new shaver.  </li>
            <li> my previous Remingtons were better than this one</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth and Silky Ultra Shaver to replace my old one that I have had for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older Remington shaver for years now.  </li>
            <li> obviously, i can&#x27;t use it anymore, so im looking for a different, better electric razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent for an electric razor shave- as close as you can get.    </li>
            <li> they are more narrow and that didn&#x27;t seem like it would be very efficient.    </li>
            <li> This was a decent shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been through many shavers and this is the only one that actually works!  </li>
            <li> but I have to say that the very first shave was just about as close as I could get from a regular razor and</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure doing it on dry skin is all that great.</li>
            <li> I like it because you can shave pretty quickly without having to get wet.  </li>
            <li> But the long-term maintenance costs are too high.</li>
            <li> It shaves closely with a high comfort level.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this razor and the seller I purchased it from.</li>
            <li> l Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for about six months and then for reasons unknown, without being dropped, used in water, or buried in the backyard by the dog, etc.</li>
            <li> It does have a little pull, like a pinch really, but the more I use it, the less I feel it, even on the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just require something with a little more oomph.</li>
            <li> It became a nightly habit to shave a little more.</li>
            <li> Had to send the first one back due to not being able to take and hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> Love this little razor.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the company via e-mail and heard back saying that I had to charge the unit for a certain amount of hours before using the first time to keep a charge, which I had.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives a much closer shave to my legs than the old one did, but I cannot use it under my arms because it chafs the skin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I again experienced irritation.  </li>
            <li> This razor comes with a product insert that states: \\&quot;Under normal use, we recommend replacing the screens every 6 months and the cutters every 12 months.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is quite noisy,but the final results are worth the noise.</li>
            <li> the hair needs to get into one of the many holes in the screen in order to get cut &amp; the charge doesn&#x27;t last long either----</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a few more chances considering</li>
            <li> But I had that problem with a normal razor too, so</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t have a problem with shaving</li>
            <li> It is probably a good shaver (works well) based on the reviews here but with poor quality control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hard to please person</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it&#x27;s pretty loud but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a single problem (well, not until I tried to put deodorant on right after...ouch!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new Remington WDF-1600 for about two months now</li>
            <li> so I was thinking about getting replacement parts but getting a new razor</li>
            <li> When this one wears out I&#x27;ll just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> It is noisy, but I can live with it for the amount of time it is in use.</li>
            <li> I tried my new razor on my underarms using almost NO pressure.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll be finding a new electric razor</li>
            <li> I charge my new razor for the recommended 18 hours</li>
            <li> It was very smooth, no more buring and itching.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user, I would recommend a small patch first or a couple of patches to ensure that you feel just right with the amount of pressure you use to glide along the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even the same color as this one (instead of white, it&#x27;s a light purple with the darker purple accents).</li>
            <li> have only confirmed my initial opinion.  </li>
            <li> However, the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky I purcahsed earlier last year had a probelm with it</li>
            <li> To echo other reviewers, this is an underarm destroyer, (ok, I&#x27;m exaggerating)  but on multiple occasions this thing has pinched my underarm.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m STUCK with a non-functioning shaver, and no refund or replacement and my sister is still using her old one!      </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m presently surprised!</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, especially considering the price of decent disposable razors, waxing, etc.</li>
            <li> and you have to shave several times in the same area to get a clean shave)</li>
            <li> Oh, and it says you can use it wet or dry, but it is pretty much better dry because then it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin as much.</li>
            <li> Guess when the head and blades need replacing, I&#x27;ll just junk the old razor and get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six weeks of using this razor</li>
            <li> I think it needs a new battery, but my old one did not need a  battery this soon.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Smooth and Silky WDF-3000 which lasted me almost 10 years...</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a positive transaction.</li>
            <li> Most often I end up shaving the bottom half of my legs one day and finish them the next.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades for my old Remington razor were getting too expensive, so I thought this brand new razor would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Although I paid a little more than the current price of $14.99 (about $16 something)  </li>
            <li> So far it works well, but the directions say that it will take several uses before you get a real close shave.</li>
            <li> WOW and thank you Remington.</li>
            <li> So far didn&#x27;t get any pinches or burns.</li>
            <li> It really irritated my underarms and it lasted for several days.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised for the price that this shaver does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have particularly sensitive skin, but I experience what seems to be \\&quot;razor</li>
            <li> MY OLD REMINGTON RAZOR DIED....</li>
            <li> Ugh... I feel that this almost has no benefit over a regular razor (a regular razor has never left my underarm feeling like this before!), as you still have to go over the area multiple times, and in many directions sometimes.  </li>
            <li> The screen is sensitive but that it why it shaves so closely.</li>
            <li> the product offers</li>
            <li> I think if you are someone who has only always shaved with a non-electric &#x27;handle&#x27; shaver, you may feel like this is much slower.  </li>
            <li> and I have had frequent episodes of razor burn.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft without moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor for my 10 year old after she begged to shave her legs.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver hoping it would be like my old one</li>
            <li> I had to purchase this shaver 2ce within a year because my 8 yr old grandson mischeviously damaged my 1st one.  </li>
            <li> i could have gotten it fixed</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get a very close shave compared to a regular razor</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my daughters old electric razor that broke.  </li>
            <li> I always discharge it completely before recharging.</li>
            <li> Obviously this does not give you the same smooth shave as a regular razor</li>
            <li> I only use it on those days your running   a bit late or need a quick clean up, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I did have some irritation under my arms, but they have always been sensitive</li>
            <li> Oh and I have had no razor burn in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ATTEMPT to shave your under arms with this razor if you have even slightly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Works well on legs and arms, but for the sensitive zones(bikini and underarms)</li>
            <li> i replaced this for my old one wich lasted 7 years before the screen broke.  </li>
            <li> I could be spending that much on replacement blades for a regular razor.</li>
            <li> But I will say that this works descent enough on your legs, yes you do have to go over the same area about 2 or 3 times, which can be consuming, so by the time you get to your other leg, you better be quick because the battery will run out or start slowing down.</li>
            <li> To buy a new charger costs almost as much as an entire new shaver package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first rechargable shaver that I&#x27;ve tried since the 90&#x27;s when they were awful, and works almost as good as a razor - not quite as smooth, but close.</li>
            <li> So is there a decent electric shaver for legs &amp; arm pits out there for low price?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same model for years and it still works just as well as when I first purchased it on Amazon, even though I&#x27;ve dropped it multiple times.</li>
            <li> This new razor seems to be equal in quality to the old one.  </li>
            <li> rate this razor 5 stars for ease of use, 4 for working well for shaving, but only 1 for how much it costs to keep it in working shape over time due to having to pay far too much for replacement parts.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these shavers (one for my sister and one for myself) based on both of us using previous incarnations of these shavers and being quite satisfied but due to age, dullness of blades, and batteries not holding charges for</li>
            <li> Using it on the legs is easy, I don&#x27;t know about other areas since you have to be careful not to put it at an angle which the instructions say will harm your skin.  </li>
            <li> it was so unreliable that I&#x27;m back online looking for a new one.  </li>
            <li> but it would have cost almost the same price as buying this new one</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a new Ladies shaver at about the same time I was for a mens shaver myself.</li>
            <li> It was definitely brand new when I received it.</li>
            <li> I have only had this razor for a few months and it caused bumps with even light pressure.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s not super heavy or clunky, very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> I think next times I&#x27;ll go a little more expensive and see if it does a better job.</li>
            <li> Better than a regular razor I use especially since I wear glasses and end up missing a lot since I obviously can&#x27;t wear them in the shower!</li>
            <li> long felt that it was time to replace the older models with this newer one.    </li>
            <li> a few weeks later, halfway through shaving, the screen came clean off.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job though you must go over the area several times at different angles.  </li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints at all with this product (except possibly</li>
            <li> I like the razor alot, but I expected a bit of a closer shave from it, it hasn&#x27;t givenme that much of a closer shave,</li>
            <li> Definitely not recommended for the sensitive zones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and thus far have not had any issues with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> but this razor has never run more than two seconds in the last few tries.</li>
            <li> I would think the company would stand behind their products better.</li>
            <li> After a few initial re-charges it now holds a charge for about 5 full shaves.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t let the hair on my legs get too long; also it&#x27;s very loud</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that replacement blades and a replacement head are more expensive than just buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I kept it dry and clean, used it once every couple or few days</li>
            <li> It does not hurt, I did get two little bumps on my leg(non-painful), and the shave is pretty close to the leg.</li>
            <li> now, 2 days later, I can just barely begin to feel some stubble.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say that if you&#x27;re a first time user it will take a few times to get a close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased it as a replacement for my far more expensive model, which ran about 3x the price and did about the same job.  </li>
            <li> She has told me that it works fine as long as you take your time and go slowly.  </li>
            <li> I was really let down by the product.</li>
            <li> Last week one of the screens tore...to get them out to replace them did damage to the head in general because of the way it opens (hinges to one side) and rendered the entire unit inoperable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for nearly a year now and the battery will no longer hold a long enough charge to get both legs shaved.</li>
            <li> I noted that one woman complained about irritation and welts, and that another woman said her husband claimed that the woman experienced irritation because she pressed down too hard with the razor.  </li>
            <li> So far I have only used it on dry legs.    </li>
            <li> (this is why I only gave it 3stars, I&#x27;m a single mom of a 15mth old n time</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, itchy skin in the winter, especially when shaving with a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> It still works, it&#x27;s functional, and for 10-15 dollars less than a new one, I&#x27;d rather just replace the cutters as opposed to getting something else.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does get hot when it&#x27;s been on awhile.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same exact spot at least 5 times in order to remove the hair and it still leaves stubble.</li>
            <li> so i recommend only using the dry feature or just try a different shaver altogether.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have purchased in at least a decade.  </li>
            <li> Batteries doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> and I only hope it has a &#x27;long&#x27; service life...</li>
            <li> Product stopped holding a charge, long enough to use it, 3 months after the two year warranty expired.  </li>
            <li> but I believe my old previous remington&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the WDF-1600 for a few weeks now, but I&#x27;ve already noticed marked improvements in design.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a few shaves, which I have only tried without water so far.</li>
            <li> I have to use an electric shaver in the winter because my legs are too sensitive and get dried out and itch with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I think maybe it&#x27;s because my underarm is very soft, but not smooth even though I try to flatten/</li>
            <li> Just a little hard to clean.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient for travelling and is not bulky or hard to hold onto..good design for the hand.</li>
            <li> It is possible to use this as a wet or dry shave though I have only used it dry.  </li>
            <li> It was not as close as a razor shave, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all (kind of like the way my legs feel the day after a razor shave.)    </li>
            <li> The up-front cost of printers is often amazingly cheap, but the company beggars you paying for their expensive</li>
            <li> But recently a wire had popped up and really cut my legs up, which is not good with lipedema.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry with her cutting herself and she&#x27;s able to shave all by herself-</li>
            <li> I was always worried that they wouldn&#x27;t give me a close shave or would hurt my skin, but I was curious especially given the price of razor refills.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge a long time, you get a close shave and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> We wanted a razor we can take on long trips.</li>
            <li> so *long</li>
            <li> a few weeks into using it, a rip developed in the protective screen.</li>
            <li> Seems to keep a charge for a long time too.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time to buy myself an electric razor</li>
            <li> The one thing I wish is that it didn&#x27;t have a Ni Cad battery, and I wish it didn&#x27;t charge all day long.  </li>
            <li> I do have to do a few passes over an area to get it completely.</li>
            <li> Given the low price of most consumer products these days, only the least expensive materials are used.    </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not buy another 6000 after that one died after 3 years of use (it would no longer take a charge) was that I wanted to try something different and a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the razor as due to lipedema I cannot use a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> After using I got long welts that looked and felt like burns and cuts!</li>
            <li> I like having the option of using it dry too in</li>
            <li> I like to use it dry (not in the shower).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like mowing the lawn except to get all the hair gone requires lots and lots of back and forth, sometimes from different angles just to catch a few rogue hairs.</li>
            <li> I am getting a closer shave and the razor lasts about 10 days on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> One problem is that the first one I had was dropped and the shaver screen was broken.</li>
            <li> I end up buying a new razor about every 3 years when the blades get dull.</li>
            <li> It is a wet or dry shaver</li>
            <li> i tried both wet and dry..</li>
            <li> I expect this product to last no more than 1 year based on it&#x27;s current performance, if that.</li>
            <li> I have used it for both dry and wet shaing and</li>
            <li> I did not get a more expensive one because I was not sure I would like using one-</li>
            <li> only problem I had with the shaver is a little redness under the arms (not on the legs) when I tried shaving dry -</li>
            <li> I ordered this because sometimes, I just don&#x27;t have time to mess with a traditional razor and shave gel.</li>
            <li> My other one wouldn&#x27;t have lasted that long.  </li>
            <li> It also seems that my hair is softer when it grows back - less stubble and absolutely no razor bumps...  </li>
            <li> Works WET &amp; DRY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on coumadin, a blood thinner, and I&#x27;m not supposed to use regular razor blades because of the danger that a little cut won&#x27;t clot.    </li>
            <li> Recently I tried THIS inexpensive little shaver.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical, thinking there was no way I&#x27;d get a smooth shave and expected some stuble.</li>
            <li> You must go over the area to be shaved with multiple strokes and it hardly gets a shave comparable to a standard razor.</li>
            <li> He has limited use of one elbow after 6 surgeries, and an amputation of the thumb and index finger on the other.  </li>
            <li> I did read some of the negative reviews about this item, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of those issues.</li>
            <li> update this review after some service life experience, like how long does the screen last, which is usually the weakness of foil shavers.</li>
            <li> I have to say no thanks to Remington.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately by the time she told me and gave it back to me it was too late to return it to Amazon for a free replacement</li>
            <li> And when I opened it to empty the hair, the pieces all fell apart.</li>
            <li> When I went to use it a week later, dead.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding it in local department stores for an affordable price</li>
            <li> she used it for a few months and now its lying some where in the house with out being used for the last one year.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the razor actually turned on several times, but then stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> Kinda of rough on underarms</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints or have I had any problems using this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have not and probably will not use it wet...</li>
            <li> It works well for my legs, but is too rough for my underarms.</li>
            <li> but the wet feature sucked for me</li>
            <li> Broke in no time - such a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> so I would not really recommend it for legs, but it works find for everywhere else.</li>
            <li> To be honest I only shave like once or twice a week because I&#x27;m lazy and hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my legs was LONG, so I went over it slowly and several times.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you always use it wet and with a cream for under arm shaving - no problems this way!</li>
            <li> you looking for other option than razor-this is your item.</li>
            <li> other areas as well.</li>
            <li> Ive had this now for about a month or so, and I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> It seems to leave a smoother and longer-lasting shave than the other one.  </li>
            <li> I dont know what the other reviewers are talking about.</li>
            <li> Based upon other reviews of the product and the its brand reputation, I chose it.  </li>
            <li> I have owned electric razors in the past (dating back to the 1970&#x27;s) and have never experienced irritation like this with a new razor.  </li>
            <li> This is not good to shave over sensitive skin or creases of any kind, it will turn red, and get those dreadful razor bumps, just stick to legs.</li>
            <li> I also have to be very careful in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through several less expensive shavers and none can beat the performance of my new remington razon.</li>
            <li> I can tell its starting to dull</li>
            <li> It was not as bad as the first time, but was present for over a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just tired of the battery dying when the shaver isn&#x27;t even that old.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington Wet/Dry ladies razor for years (and by years, I mean probably 25) until it recently died.  </li>
            <li> but in the mean time it&#x27;s back to the $5 replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> I used it dry on a small spot I had missed</li>
            <li> The shavers contain nickle, which can make some people have a black footprint problem on the skin.</li>
            <li> Literally I had this less then a day i accidentally dropped it</li>
            <li> I have tried using less pressure with no improvement.  </li>
            <li> I find that I have to shave less often using this shaver.</li>
            <li> so it takes you longer to shave &amp; the battery dies about half way through...</li>
            <li> It gives a closer shave than my previous Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple times using different pressure thinking maybe I was using it wrong and changing that would help.</li>
            <li> other razors don&#x27;t have as large of a cutting surface-</li>
            <li> turned out to be less expensive and of course it was new.</li>
            <li> waste of time to even try it out and besides you have to have a razor to get the down under region..</li>
            <li> I had read a few previous reviews that it burns your armpits when you use it on them.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very soft, so it is difficult for any razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with a little concern that it might not be satisfactory.</li>
            <li> just a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Hubbie George</li>
            <li> I just got a little edge tool for bikini lines instead.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and just very disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you want to clip the hair round your little bits</li>
            <li> but you have to go over the spot you are shaving a few times.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell how narrow it would be from the photo.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, both shavers I&#x27;ve been sent are old.</li>
            <li> But a shaver is only as good as the charger, and that has failed miserably.</li>
            <li> i wasted 18 dollars and learned a valuable lesson about Remington Products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use it everyday because my underarm doesn&#x27;t recover from the day before.  </li>
            <li> I have used this a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now</li>
            <li> Another difference with this one is I used it a few days after I had charged it</li>
            <li> nd review:  the shaver started working a few days after it quit.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have sensitive skin and hate razor bumps that I get with a regular blade.</li>
            <li> That little sucker catches every hair and cuts so close</li>
            <li> 6 weeks old and starts cutting my wife&#x27;s legs.</li>
            <li> This product does not work I am indian, and maybe i have thicker hair than usual.</li>
            <li> I have always used remington shavers and unfortunately dropped my last one in the tub and the impact broke it.  </li>
            <li> It also helps to pull up on the skin and work in small sections.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close and no more nicks and no more disposable razors to purchase.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful I am, every time I use it the skin behind my knees gets cut.</li>
            <li> During the second use the grills head cut through the grill making the unit useless.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> (no complaints) from the time of delivery and the other shaver (my sister&#x27;s) HAS NOT, and because I&#x27;m a bit annoyed that Amazon has sold something to me</li>
            <li> Sucks after a few months use the blade wasnt cutting the hair as it promised hadvto back to using razors contacted the company they refused to help me</li>
            <li> This is the worst razor ever, I bought it only 10 months ago, and used normally and just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I barely touch this shaver under my arms &amp; I have a nasty rash for the next few days.</li>
            <li> No need to press hard.</li>
            <li> and he said the user was pushing too hard instead of letting the shaver glide over the skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe the blades were dull, so I replaced them  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t press too hard when shaving.</li>
            <li> I just tried this Remington Smooth &amp; Silky rechargeable shaver is terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to have at least had this maybe at LEAST 5-6 years?</li>
            <li> I asked my husband about this complaint</li>
            <li> The process was tedious, uncomfortable, a waste of water, and it sometimes left me with cuts or a rash.  </li>
            <li> It felt as thought it was ripping out my coarse hair instead of cutting it every time.</li>
            <li> It seems like the front cutter doesn&#x27;t do much cutting since it is quite lower than the back trimmers.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it, apart from the fact that you had to hit it repeatedly to achieve the right frequency of vibrations that meant the difference between shaving hair and ripping it out painfully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it painful to use at all although that could be a problem later when the blades start to get dull as with any razor of any type.  </li>
            <li> They have improved over the years and are less expensive than these.</li>
            <li> The irritation was horrible, and I was left with red welts.  </li>
            <li> I had this shaver for the last few years, stowed away because I hated it and couldn&#x27;t pawn it off to anyone.</li>
            <li> My first time using this I got terrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks, I had horrible razor rash (and I even used soap).</li>
            <li> No more nicks for me!!</li>
            <li> was tired of spending $18 for 8 cartridges for venus disposables</li>
            <li> I was so tired of replacing razor/blade heads on the Schick and Gillette non-electric models that are sold in the grocery/big box stores.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE CHARGER IS HORRIBLE BECAUSE IT CHARGES WHEN IT WANTS.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $5 for replacement razors and nicking/cutting my legs all the time, so I decided to buy an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it harsh or painful.  </li>
            <li> but it was messy, painful, time-consuming, and inefficient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone could go wrong buying this razor.</li>
            <li> Sad to say i could not.  </li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and it is difficult to find a shaver that doesn&#x27;t nick and cut.</li>
            <li> Upon moving, however, I felt I had given it an unfair chance -</li>
            <li> I was bored</li>
            <li> Sadly i cannot recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li> I got it after getting tired of constantly cutting myself in my bikini area shaves.</li>
            <li> I boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if eventually the razor will stop irritating my underarms or not, but I am disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it saves on buying those darn expensive blades!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an electric shaver for the past year because I hate shaving with a razor!  </li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair to remove under my arms.</li>
            <li> Worthless and useless.</li>
            <li> Too bad there is no hair to shave for about a week....</li>
            <li> On/off button is in a bad location.</li>
            <li> It was getting so bad</li>
            <li> , I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it simpy does not charge :(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> but I did mind that annoying battery</li>
            <li> The design is horrible and dangerous!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Worst experience ever.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t charge turn on or anything, would not recommend at all, worst!!</li>
            <li> That was the worst razor I have ever owened.</li>
            <li> This is worst rechargeable razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> it was horrible.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this razor and it is terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It takes too many strokes to get a clean shave and then skin becomes irritated.  Hair grows back with an itch.  Do recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair to remove under my arms. My skin is very soft, so it is difficult for any razor. I have tried many regular and electric. This finally gets the job done but still with some effort. It is the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> this product is junk. 6 weeks old and starts cutting my wife&#x27;s legs. Prior to that it never gave a close have.  Choose the panasonic for $5 more.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in Feb., and loved it the first 2-3 times I used it. Then it started taking longer, and longer to shave and in sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t do anything at all. I was constantly cleaning it, thinking that might be the problem but it wasn&#x27;t. I got fed up taking so much time and patience plus it started to irritate my legs.   I read so many good reviews on here and took a few weeks of reading and researching before buying it, I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, this shaver shaves a lot closer than I would think.  My legs felt pretty smooth even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about six months now and I find that I don&#x27;t get as close a shave as I did with the Remington WDF-6000.  The only reason I did not buy another 6000 after that one died after 3 years of use (it would no longer take a charge) was that I wanted to try something different and a little cheaper.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t get the 6000, for it was a closer shave than this 1600.  Also, the 6000 has an indicator that the battery needs charging, which is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the 1600 hasn&#x27;t had any problems charging, and the charge lasts awhile.  It&#x27;s also easy to grip and hold.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to use, is conveniently rechargeable, and feels good in the hand. The problem comes in if you are hoping to purchase an inexpensive electric razor. Yes, the initial purchase price, especially on Amazon, is quite good. But the long-term maintenance costs are too high. This razor comes with a product insert that states: \\&quot;Under normal use, we recommend replacing the screens every 6 months and the cutters every 12 months.\\&quot; Remington sells the screens and cutters packaged together for $24.99 and the screens packaged separately for $14.99. You will have to purchase 2 screens and 1 cutter every year, which comes to $40/year to operate this razor after the initial purchase. This is very similar to the way that companies who sell laser printers operate. The up-front cost of printers is often amazingly cheap, but the company beggars you paying for their expensive toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the razor on both dry and wet skin, I find it works far better on warm, damp skin, so I use it either right after a hot shower or during one. The product is, as advertised, safe to use in the shower, and the instructions that come with it say to run water over the cutters/blades after every use to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this razor 5 stars for ease of use, 4 for working well for shaving, but only 1 for how much it costs to keep it in working shape over time due to having to pay far too much for replacement parts.</li>
            <li> I want to recommend this product.  It does a wonderful job and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feel all stubbly.</li>
            <li> I have purchased more types of hair removers than I care to admit to over the years and this is the only one I actually enjoy using. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. This product is the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor. WOW and thank you Remington.</li>
            <li> I just tried this Remington Smooth &amp; Silky rechargeable shaver is terrible. My Mom &amp; I both tried it &amp; got razor burns no matter how gently or what way we tried it. The Remington didn&#x27;t shave off the hair well &amp; left burns!!! My 20 year old Chick electric shaver still works better than this Remington!!! I can&#x27;t believe it. So is there a decent electric shaver for legs &amp; arm pits out there for low price?</li>
            <li> Works WET &amp; DRY! Perfect for the days I forget to shave, and don&#x27;t have time to lather up... gives a nice smooth shave even where Venus razors left stubbly. :D</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to give this razor a try!! It&#x27;s great ! Got a close shave without any stubble,razor burn or bumps the first time I used it. A \\&quot;light\\&quot; touch works best. No need to press hard. Quick, easy and an excellent result. Better than a regular razor I use especially since I wear glasses and end up missing a lot since I obviously can&#x27;t wear them in the shower! End result, close shave, easy to use, holds adequate charge to accomplish the task AND the price is certainly right! I was considering a mens electric razor. Glad I chose to get this one. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Provides a close shave.</li>
            <li> I ordered it to use outside US, and there is not mention in description that this razor works only in north america. so it simpy does not charge :(</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it was cheap and it had decent reviews. I have to say that I am pleased with my purchase. I did read some of the negative reviews about this item, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of those issues. It does not hurt, I did get two little bumps on my leg(non-painful), and the shave is pretty close to the leg. If you want to prevent bumps(in-growns) just make sure you exfoliate and make sure you moisturize! My legs were dry on my first attempt and I&#x27;m sure shaving would have hurt if I hadn&#x27;t of stopped.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington Wet/Dry ladies razor for years (and by years, I mean probably 25) until it recently died.  I never used it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; but I sure did use it dry. This new razor seems to be equal in quality to the old one.  And the price is great too!  I don&#x27;t know how much my original one cost because it was a gift.  I don&#x27;t think anyone could go wrong buying this razor.</li>
            <li> So far it works well, but the directions say that it will take several uses before you get a real close shave.</li>
            <li> Without question this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I read the warnings about how it might take 3 weeks before I got a close shave but I have to say that the very first shave was just about as close as I could get from a regular razor and now, 2 days later, I can just barely begin to feel some stubble.  It&#x27;s comfortable, a nice weight, it holds a charge well and it recharges super fast!  It&#x27;s also easy to clean, comfortable in my hand and I just couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better!  I&#x27;m completely thrilled with it.  As someone else said, don&#x27;t bother spending more on a \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; shaver, because this one will give you everything you could want.  I recommend it without reservation!!</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  First time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It shaved closer than a blade!!  Why didn&#x27;t i get this ages ago!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a far more expensive Braun shaver whose battery would no longer keep a good charge.  This one does as nice a job as the shaver that cost 3 times as much and is more comfortable for sensitive areas like underarms and behind the knees.</li>
            <li> For the price I think this is a really great razor considering I have seen many much more expensive electric ones.  It gets the job done but you have to go over the spot you are shaving a few times.  I like it because you can shave pretty quickly without having to get wet.  It is possible to use this as a wet or dry shave though I have only used it dry.  Another thing I like about it, is that it is easy to clean unlike my last electric razor it comes with a brush and you can just pop the top open and brush the hair out.  It seems to hold a charge well, fits nicely in your hand and has an easily accessible on/off switch.  Overall I think it is a great deal for the price and I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> This shaver works fine, though not as well as my older Norelo, which recently died.  The price was right.</li>
            <li> I will call the company AGAIN but this razor has never run more than two seconds in the last few tries. I have charged it for days. In the beginning I shaved my legs twice but never could finish. My razor will not hold a charge. There should not be a star at all but I would not have been able to post.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new Remington WDF-1600 for about two months now and I absolutely love it.  It leaves my legs smooth and the shave seems to last longer.  It also seems that my hair is softer when it grows back - less stubble and absolutely no razor bumps...  I have always used a regular razor with replaceable blades and decided to make this change when the cost of blades skyrocketed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with the shaver is a little redness under the arms (not on the legs) when I tried shaving dry - I recommend that you always use it wet and with a cream for under arm shaving - no problems this way!</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for about 2 1/2 years, only because it fell and broke. But I will say that this works descent enough on your legs, yes you do have to go over the same area about 2 or 3 times, which can be consuming, so by the time you get to your other leg, you better be quick because the battery will run out or start slowing down. This is not good to shave over sensitive skin or creases of any kind, it will turn red, and get those dreadful razor bumps, just stick to legs. Very easy to clean, and it works in the shower. If you are looking for something affordable, I recommend you buy it. Personally, it was a gift and I never minded having to shave over the same area, but I did mind that annoying battery if I was in a rush.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace another Remington that I had for 10 years.  It works great!  Shaves nice and smooth and is alot more convenient than a regular razor. And the price is right.  I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because sometimes, I just don&#x27;t have time to mess with a traditional razor and shave gel. Was a little skeptical, thinking there was no way I&#x27;d get a smooth shave and expected some stuble. However, I&#x27;m very impressed! I get a good shave, leaving my legs very smooth. There was light razor burn after the first time or two using it, but that went away quickly. I find that I do need to go over the area a couple of times in different directions, but its still faster than a traditional shave. It even did my bikini area pretty well. Its not so great with underarms though, requiring numerous passes, which tended to irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> This works very good. I have used it wet and dry and am very happy with it. Have told friends.</li>
            <li> The head on this could be wider - I couldn&#x27;t tell how narrow it would be from the photo.  I have tried it but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very powerful, and I feel like it needs a charge before I&#x27;m halfway done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just require something with a little more oomph. I&#x27;ll be ordering something else to replace this one. What I really want is a corded women&#x27;s shaver but apparently nobody sells those any more. I&#x27;m just tired of the battery dying when the shaver isn&#x27;t even that old.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research I decided to buy this one. I tried it out immediately. It worked great, but it does feel a bit rough to use. It took my skin some time to get used to it, especially in the bikini-line. I use it on every hairy surface (arms, legs, bikini-line, under arms) except my head. I still feel it&#x27;s a bit rough on the skin, but it does remove the hair, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a shaver of my own for some time now and now I do. The reviews of this shaver was a deciding factor for me. I got it and tried it once. It was very smooth, no more buring and itching. Thank God.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Italy thinking I could charge it over there with a converter.  Sad to say i could not.  I used it at home the month leading to the trip and it works great. A bit od razor burn under my arms the first time but after that I never had a problem.  I love the way it can be used in the shower and actually prefer to do so.  All in all a great razor.</li>
            <li> This is a necessary item for grooming and it works just fine.  Happily it was also inexpensive and had the features (such as rechargeable) that matter to me.</li>
            <li> Item received in timely manner,excellent condition.Included charging unit and instruction booklet.Also was discounted. My former electric razor stopped working so I was thinking about getting replacement parts but getting a new razor turned out to be less expensive and of course it was new.Razor works well for legs and underarms,gives close shave.</li>
            <li> I was weary to buy a personal shaver online, but I am very happy I did. It was new of course and actually advertised accurately. I love it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like the product. You do get a nice close clip on your legs and don&#x27;t have to do it so often.  It is quite noisy,but the final results are worth the noise.I would recommend it.I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> My new electric shaver is great!  It shaves my areas clean with no stubble and my skin feels soft after.  It is a rechargeable wet/dry shaver and works well in the shower and out.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaver. I did the research and decided to get this one because of the affordable price and pretty good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Before Remington I used razor, but cuts and after shave burns (and having to shave almost everyday) made me look for a better way to keep me clean shaved. I tried the product for about 3-4 days now and I totally in love with it! It doesn&#x27;t give you that baby smooth clean shave like a razor does right away, you&#x27;ll have to work the skin in a repeated motions a while but it is possible! So far didn&#x27;t get any pinches or burns. It says that you might need 3-4 shaves to get use to it...I didn&#x27;t even need that. From the first use my skin was feeling more comfortable than after razor.&lt;br /&gt;If you looking for other option than razor-this is your item. Price is great, and it works!&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to charge it before your first use for about 24 hours. And read the instructions and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> The shavers contain nickle, which can make some people have a black footprint problem on the skin. Unfortunately, both shavers I&#x27;ve been sent are old.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades for my old Remington razor were getting too expensive, so I thought this brand new razor would be a good choice.  I am thrilled!  I am getting a closer shave and the razor lasts about 10 days on a single charge.  This will be a good feature when I travel, less to pack.  The only draw back is the on-off switch is really touchy and the re-charge light is very bright, plus there is no carrying case but my old one fits just fine.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth and Silky Ultra Shaver to replace my old one that I have had for about 10 years.  This shaver gives a much closer shave to my legs than the old one did, but I cannot use it under my arms because it chafs the skin.  I also have to be very careful in the bikini area.  It is wonderful on the legs, but I do not recommend it for use anywhere else.  It is a wet or dry shaver but I have not tried it in the shower as yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a birthday present for my daughter. She is very happy ans satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This shaver isn&#x27;t the best of the ones I&#x27;ve used.  I have coarse hair, and it takes a lot more effort to shave with this than it did with my old Panasonic.  More passes over an area &#x3D; more skin irritation, which is not great.  I can only rate this as OK.  It&#x27;s a good shaver for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I bought this in June, 2010, and by April 2011 it had died, and not from excess use, either. I really did like the shaver itself, even if it didn&#x27;t shave super-close. But a shaver is only as good as the charger, and that has failed miserably. To buy a new charger costs almost as much as an entire new shaver package. Go figger. I have to say no thanks to Remington.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaver. I was always worried that they wouldn&#x27;t give me a close shave or would hurt my skin, but I was curious especially given the price of razor refills. When I saw the price on this one I decided there was no harm in trying and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The instructions say that if you&#x27;re a first time user it will take a few times to get a close shave but I got one from the first use. It&#x27;s comfortable and fast, works as well as a razor but without the cost of replacement blades. When this one wears out I&#x27;ll just buy a new one.  I&#x27;ve used it on my legs in the shower with lather and it hasn&#x27;t damaged my skin. I used it dry on a small spot I had missed and it didn&#x27;t harm either but it was a tiny spot. I like having the option of using it dry too in case I&#x27;m in a hurry. Using it on the legs is easy, I don&#x27;t know about other areas since you have to be careful not to put it at an angle which the instructions say will harm your skin.  Overall I&#x27;m impressed, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and would recommend it, don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this really works.</li>
            <li> was tired of spending $18 for 8 cartridges for venus disposables so i tryed the remington smooth and silky electric.. i love my close shaves with my razors and was hoping to get it outta the electric.. i had to go over the same spot 5x before i got all the hairs and it still was prickly i tried both wet and dry.. glad i saved the receipt was $38 and im bringing it back and buying the best razor out there. talk about piss me off.. waste of time to even try it out and besides you have to have a razor to get the down under region..</li>
            <li> Literally I had this less then a day i accidentally dropped it maybe a foot off the ground while i was shaving my calfs. A piece on the inside broke off and then the foil tops wouldn&#x27;t stay on. Worst experience ever. Even with the two year warrantee it was to much of a hassle I tried calling the warrantee place and they gave me the run around overall i wasted 18 dollars and learned a valuable lesson about Remington Products. Cheaply made and just very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is probably a good shaver (works well) based on the reviews here but with poor quality control. Given the low price of most consumer products these days, only the least expensive materials are used.    If you are lucky, it might work well for years. So beware and keep the box and be prepared to return it if it dies prematurely.</li>
            <li> unimpressed. battery runs out too quickly reluctantly scratching my legs. my goal was to avoid using a disposable of any style. They have improved over the years and are less expensive than these. I&#x27;m done with trying to find &#x27;easier&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am no longer able to shave my underarms do to health reasons, so I now have to use an electric shaver.  After reading the reviews, I purchased this one.  The first time I tried it in the shower, it pulled and pinched a lot.  I followed the directions and wasn&#x27;t using much pressure at all.  It really irritated my underarms and it lasted for several days.  I tried it again with the same results.  I do have very curly hair and that might have some impact on the the shaver&#x27;s performance.  Since this is my first experience with an underarm electric shaver, I don&#x27;t know if this is normal--but I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for another one. Gave it two stars because it looks and feels good and seems to be a good product--just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Although I paid a little more than the current price of $14.99 (about $16 something)  I still like this product and think it is good value and works very well.</li>
            <li> Batteries doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this product. No nicks and it takes all the hair off. Only problem is that it&#x27;s pretty loud but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a women&#x27;s shaver that will be gentle on your legs this is the shaver to buy. I have psoriasis and it is difficult to find a shaver that doesn&#x27;t nick and cut. I was surprised for the price that this shaver does what it says it will. In past I have had difficulty finding a good product for my condition.I gave it 5 stars because it exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember when I got this shaver. I&#x27;ve had it for yeeears. It&#x27;s not even the same color as this one (instead of white, it&#x27;s a light purple with the darker purple accents). I&#x27;ve had to have at least had this maybe at LEAST 5-6 years? Or whenever they first came out with that color combo.    Regardless, it&#x27;s still ticking. I just keep it docked on the charger so it&#x27;s always ready to go. I&#x27;d have to agree that it does burn under arms, which isn&#x27;t a big deal since I&#x27;d rather use a regular razor on my under arms. However, it&#x27;s great for a quick shave when you don&#x27;t want to bother with water/shower, all that stuff. The trimmer is really nice to have to trim *ahem* other areas as well. I was looking into getting a new one, mostly because I found out that the replacement cutters are kind of pricey. However, since Amazon sells those at a much more reasonable price (compared to Remington&#x27;s website), I think I&#x27;ll stick with this one and just replace the cutters. It still works, it&#x27;s functional, and for 10-15 dollars less than a new one, I&#x27;d rather just replace the cutters as opposed to getting something else. I like it THAT much. :p</li>
            <li> While the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra shaver gets the job done, it does so only passingly. You must go over the area to be shaved with multiple strokes and it hardly gets a shave comparable to a standard razor. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 weeks now and have given my legs the recommended amount of time to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; and it still isn&#x27;t that smooth. It does work well in that it will effectively cut away the hair on legs, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have limited time as it does take quite some time to operate. Even when fully charged this product can run out of battery quickly. Most often I end up shaving the bottom half of my legs one day and finish them the next. I expect this product to last no more than 1 year based on it&#x27;s current performance, if that. And will likely buy a better product to replace it with. I would recommend this product only if you&#x27;re looking to save money and have plenty of time on hand for shaving. Otherwise, I would suggest finding a better quality product with longer life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have particularly sensitive skin, but I experience what seems to be \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; when using this.  I have tried using less pressure with no improvement.  It does hold a charge well, and it&#x27;s pretty, but I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> MY OLD REMINGTON RAZOR DIED.... HAD IT APPROX. 30 YEARS.  LOVE THIS ONE I BOUGHT !!!!&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN ALWAYS DEPEND ON REMINGTON !!!!</li>
            <li> To echo other reviewers, this is an underarm destroyer, (ok, I&#x27;m exaggerating)  but on multiple occasions this thing has pinched my underarm.  And I don&#x27;t know how it happens!  At first I thought it was the sides of the shaver doing it but seems like it&#x27;s likely to happen anywhere on the foil.  I think maybe it&#x27;s because my underarm is very soft, but not smooth even though I try to flatten/taut the area with my finger.  Well after this happens, my underarm turns red and is irritated and feels like it&#x27;s been cut, though there is no bleeding.  Ugh... I feel that this almost has no benefit over a regular razor (a regular razor has never left my underarm feeling like this before!), as you still have to go over the area multiple times, and in many directions sometimes.  I can&#x27;t even use it everyday because my underarm doesn&#x27;t recover from the day before.  A positive is that this works in the shower.  Anyway,  I&#x27;ve thrown this out now.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these shavers (one for my sister and one for myself) based on both of us using previous incarnations of these shavers and being quite satisfied but due to age, dullness of blades, and batteries not holding charges for long felt that it was time to replace the older models with this newer one.    Ironically, my shaver worked well from the get go (having charged it overnight on removing it from the packaging).  My sister&#x27;s shaver did not work at all (after charging it overnight and subsequently charging it for weeks thereafter).  Unfortunately by the time she told me and gave it back to me it was too late to return it to Amazon for a free replacement so I&#x27;m STUCK with a non-functioning shaver, and no refund or replacement and my sister is still using her old one!      So I&#x27;ve given this one only 3 stars because one shaver (mine) has worked excellently (no complaints) from the time of delivery and the other shaver (my sister&#x27;s) HAS NOT, and because I&#x27;m a bit annoyed that Amazon has sold something to me that is defective (when I have had only good experiences with Amazon over the years except for one other non-delivery of an item snafu which Amazon quickly rectified)!</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have sensitive skin and hate razor bumps that I get with a regular blade. Ive had this now for about a month or so, and I use it every other day.  I dont think I would buy this again, honestly. I dont know if there&#x27;s some special tecnique for this, but it just doesnt get the hairs. I can tell it has shaved a little, but no matter how many times I go over and over it just doesnt feel smooth, and it always misses hairs, no matter what I do. I paid around $30 for this with S&amp;H. Maybe if you find this for like $5 bucks I would say go ahead and try it, but I wouldnt reccomend it otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times. And when I opened it to empty the hair, the pieces all fell apart. It doesn&#x27;t come apart and go back together easily. The pieces should have never fell apart. I will attempt to return it and get a better one.  Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older Remington shaver for years now.  Nothing wrong with it, apart from the fact that you had to hit it repeatedly to achieve the right frequency of vibrations that meant the difference between shaving hair and ripping it out painfully.  And to use it without being doused in water was unimaginable.    I&#x27;ve only had the WDF-1600 for a few weeks now, but I&#x27;ve already noticed marked improvements in design.  The push button is superior to the slide button on the old one.  It seems to leave a smoother and longer-lasting shave than the other one.  The blade compartment is much tighter so it doesn&#x27;t get full of hair.  Surprisingly, it seems to work much better dry than wet.  And, most importantly, it vibrates at the right frequency all the time, so no more pulled hairs.       So far I have no complaints at all with this product (except possibly that it takes more passes to get all the hair, hence only four stars).</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have tried in nearly 30 years.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  It gives a smooth shave.  Only took a couple of uses to get the hang of it.  No more nicks for me!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed - a quick option to lathering up.  It works fine for me and for what I wanted.  I don&#x27;t find it harsh or painful.  It is the perfect \\&quot; going out the door\\&quot; shaver - no nicks to worry about either.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it.   I purchased this as a gift for my wife. On the outset she cut herself. The top portion that touches the skin is called the foil. If you shave with any pressure, it will tear. If it tears while shaving, you will cut yourself. If you do not exert some pressure, you will not get a close shave.     The manufacturer says that the foil will have to nbe replaced every 6 months of use. That presents an additional expense.</li>
            <li> More effort that using a traditional razor.  Not a close shave at all.  Wasn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
            <li> I have been using disposable shavers for number of years and thought I should try an electric shaver. I think its afantastic choice and the price is cheap too...I have used it for both dry and wet shaing and the results have been as good as the razor. It took some time to experiment with the pressure to be applied and Im still not confrtable using underarms but for daily use and mobiility full points.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver on my legs several times now.  It does a decent job though you must go over the area several times at different angles.  Still, it beats shaving with a razor. So far I have only used it on dry legs.    It is noisy, but I can live with it for the amount of time it is in use.</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for the last few years, stowed away because I hated it and couldn&#x27;t pawn it off to anyone. Upon moving, however, I felt I had given it an unfair chance - the only time I used it was for three days and I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I brought it to my new apartment and let it charge before making a final love it or chuck it decision. I was bored so I was gentle and I let it do its thing. Actually, this thing got close! It became a nightly habit to shave a little more. A week later, it shaves better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. AND, without any thought to it, I don&#x27;t get razor burn or bumps from it like I do with a regular hand razor - which cuts too close and often causes ingrown hairs and then red bumps. I now have great smooth skin that doesn&#x27;t look like a battlefield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could be the nature of both my skin and my hair, but either way I am absolutely delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it right, folks - be gentle and be patient. Electric razors only work right if you use them consistently. Your skin has to get used to it for awhile. The plus side is it makes shaving super quick and a soothing experience - something it has never been for me until I started using is shaver...</li>
            <li> I bought my WDF-1600 in Feb. of 2008 and upon writing this it is January 18, 2010.  For about 21 months the shaver worked like a champ.  I&#x27;d purchased it as a replacement for my far more expensive model, which ran about 3x the price and did about the same job.  Both electric razors gave me a close shave every time, both were rechargeable.  Here&#x27;s was the clincher.  This model (WDF 1600) started dying on me after 21 months of moderate use and by month 23 it was so unreliable that I&#x27;m back online looking for a new one.  Adding insult to injury, these things are built such that you can&#x27;t even go in and try to replace the battery, assuming that&#x27;s the root of the problem...    There will be a lot more research done before another model shows up on my credit card bill.  Not even 2-years&#x27; use, and it already needs to be replaced.  Does anyone build anything to last anymore?</li>
            <li> I have tried many shavers through the years and find this shaver to be the best. It shaves closely with a high comfort level. I find that I have to shave less often using this shaver. One problem is that the first one I had was dropped and the shaver screen was broken. I had to throw out the shaverand purchase another. The screen is sensitive but that it why it shaves so closely. I purchased a new one because I love the shaver so much. I will just be more careful when shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased the razor as due to lipedema I cannot use a regular razor.  I have only had this razor for a few months and it caused bumps with even light pressure.  But recently a wire had popped up and really cut my legs up, which is not good with lipedema.  Sadly i cannot recommend this razor.  I gave it 2 stars as it might work better with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shaver from the amazon website and I&#x27;m very pleased so far with it. I use it to shave my legs and pubic area and it works great. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far and the price was great. I shopped around before I decided to purchase this shaver and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m not a hard to please person so it gets the job done, my boyfriends not complaining either.</li>
            <li> i bought one of these from the px today and its amazing! it shaves your legs great no cuts which is great and all you do is take the brush and wipe it off after use. great razor!</li>
            <li> This Remington Electric Shaver is exactly what I anticipated...It is a good value, works very well and I only hope it has a &#x27;long&#x27; service life...the item was delivered in a timely manner and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the entire purchase process...</li>
            <li> I was so tired of replacing razor/blade heads on the Schick and Gillette non-electric models that are sold in the grocery/big box stores.  The blades alone were close to $5 for replacements, so I thought why not try an electric.  So far, I&#x27;m delighted.  This razor shaves smoothly in the shower and I experienced no razor burn on either my legs or underarms.  I asked my husband about this complaint and he said the user was pushing too hard instead of letting the shaver glide over the skin&#x27;s surface.  Maybe that will help someone else.  Anyway, the first time I used this, I dropped it - my hands are a bit klutzy.  I was really upset because I thought I&#x27;d ruined my new shaver.  Fortunately, it was simple to put it back together and it ran just fine after my accident.  My only criticism is that replacement blades and a replacement head are more expensive than just buying a new razor.  Guess when the head and blades need replacing, I&#x27;ll just junk the old razor and get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six weeks of using this razor have only confirmed my initial opinion.  It shaves smoothly, without irritation, and does an outstanding job.  I use it in the shower, soaping my legs before I shave, and I&#x27;ve had no issue with stubble or razor burns.  In fact, you&#x27;ll find yourself shaving more since it&#x27;s so easy.  I&#x27;m definitely a happy camper!</li>
            <li> The mesh on the head broke after just one use.  Returned item.  Sticking with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a quick shave... worked fine in and out of the shower... only problem... I thought the size was a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of everyone else&#x27;s reviews-But after trying it out -didn&#x27;t like it at all.. It doesn&#x27;t cut well at all - you have to go over the same spot over and over -because the hair needs to get into one of the many holes in the screen in order to get cut &amp; the charge doesn&#x27;t last long either---- so it takes you longer to shave &amp; the battery dies about half way through... I am gonna get a mens rotary norelco instead</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and she seems to be liking it so much. She is quite happy with the comfort and elegance the product offers</li>
            <li> This is quite a shaver for the money. It holds a charge a long time, you get a close shave and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Wife really likes how it works.</li>
            <li> This is the worst razor ever, I bought it only 10 months ago, and used normally and just stopped working.  Won&#x27;t charge turn on or anything, would not recommend at all, worst!! Didn&#x27;t even get that close of a shave either.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my Mom and she is thrilled with its performance</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my daughter to use on her legs. She has told me that it works fine as long as you take your time and go slowly.  I think if you are someone who has only always shaved with a non-electric &#x27;handle&#x27; shaver, you may feel like this is much slower.  I like it because it saves on buying those darn expensive blades!</li>
            <li> the charger breaks very easily and it takes more than a day to charge. and the shaver tends to not pick up hairs in different directions. save your money and buy a guy&#x27;s shaver instead.</li>
            <li> We wanted a razor we can take on long trips. This fills nicely and both wife &amp; husband can use it. Cuts ok but still need hand razor for the close cuts you need on under arms and over the lip. Still worth the price. Delivery was fast and received in good condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for nearly a year now and the battery will no longer hold a long enough charge to get both legs shaved. I suppose in part that&#x27;s because it takes so *long* to get a clean shave. It&#x27;s like mowing the lawn except to get all the hair gone requires lots and lots of back and forth, sometimes from different angles just to catch a few rogue hairs. Not the greatest product I ever used. Oh, and I can only use it on my legs, it tears my underarm and bikini-line skin to shreds, as others have reported.</li>
            <li> I really do love this razor.  I bought two of them. One for my daughter at her dad&#x27;s house and one for my house.  This is so easy and a great starter for my daughter to use.  The only issue that I have is that I have to go over an area a few times, other than that, PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 20 years, and have never been a fan of cordless shavers, but this shaver has changed my mind.      This shaver has plenty of charge to last for several shaves and my shaves have been the closest I&#x27;ve ever achieved with a cordless shaver.  I have very coarse, fast growing hair and love the extremely smooth shave that I get.      I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> I have to keep it plugged in all the time so it is ready when I want to use it. One time it was charged so I thought I&#x27;d unplug it.  When I went to use it a week later, dead.  It works great. I have never used it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this razor on Amazon. I was having trouble finding it in local department stores for an affordable price</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after reading the good reviews.  I was very disappointed.  It never did cut the hair well.  I thought maybe the blades were dull, so I replaced them  I still have the same results.  I cannot use a regular razor as I use blood thinners and I had hopes this would do the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance and value for the price! I didn&#x27;t find it painful to use at all although that could be a problem later when the blades start to get dull as with any razor of any type.  I HAVE recommended this shaver to family and friends and will buy another when this one stops working at peak perfiormance.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and I have had frequent episodes of razor burn.  It also requires lots of going over the same spots to get all the hairs.  Last week one of the screens tore...to get them out to replace them did damage to the head in general because of the way it opens (hinges to one side) and rendered the entire unit inoperable.  It is comfortable in your hand, otherwise I think I&#x27;ll go back to the Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> Just like most everyone else here, I am very happy with my shaver. The price is reasonable, especially considering the price of decent disposable razors, waxing, etc. It&#x27;s the first rechargable shaver that I&#x27;ve tried since the 90&#x27;s when they were awful, and works almost as good as a razor - not quite as smooth, but close. Holds a charge for a few shaves, which I have only tried without water so far. Also, this is very useful for someone recovering from an injury who can&#x27;t safely manuever razors in the shower!</li>
            <li> The shaver arrived DOA. I charged it overnight and it would not turn on. Possibly a defective switch.  I was so disappointed, I just threw it away...</li>
            <li> my wife uses this and she feels a razor is better than this product. she used it for a few months and now its lying some where in the house with out being used for the last one year.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  It charges quickly and stays charged.  It removes leg hair painlessly without leaving stubbles.  The grip is easy to use and it is easy to clean.  I travel with it as well.  I didn&#x27;t find it that helpful for removing underarm hair but it is fantastic for the entire leg, leaving a soft smooth feel to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor b4, n when I opened the package I found the lil warrning slip saying it can take up to 3wks for ur skin to get use to it if u&#x27;ve never used one. I wasn&#x27;t happy reading that but then it didn&#x27;t apply to me. I&#x27;ve used it now 3x n have had no irritation. My problem with it was that it takes a lot longer then a regular razor (this is why I only gave it 3stars, I&#x27;m a single mom of a 15mth old n time is something I don&#x27;t always have) mayb &#x27;cuz I don&#x27;t let the hair on my legs get too long; also it&#x27;s very loud but overall I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase as it leaves my legs smooth n no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the razor actually turned on several times, but then stopped working completely.  Very disappointed.  Never got to use it.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor 2 years in December and I give it 5 stars happily. Ii is the first electric razor I have ever owned and I will never go back. It keeps a charge for a long time and works wonderfully. I did not get a more expensive one because I was not sure I would like using one- but this one is perfect, does a great shave job and is a great price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I dont know what the other reviewers are talking about. This product does not work I am indian, and maybe i have thicker hair than usual. Still, it doesn&#x27;t do even a passable job!</li>
            <li> Had to send the first one back due to not being able to take and hold a charge.  Very easy to return, in fact new one was received before I had the chance to send the defective one back.  Originally this was a gift for my wife whom is very pleased &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; with this shaver.  Did not get 5 stars because first shaver was defective.  She has been using this shaver for over a year now.</li>
            <li> Works as advertized. A bit noisier than the Norelco roatary shaver I was using ... but this Remington WDF-1600 shaves close and pretty quick so the noise is tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Will update this review after some service life experience, like how long does the screen last, which is usually the weakness of foil shavers. [[ASIN:B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]]</li>
            <li> OVERALL THE SHAVER ITSELF IS GREAT BUT THE CHARGER IS HORRIBLE BECAUSE IT CHARGES WHEN IT WANTS. THANKFULLY I HAVE ANOTHER CHARGER THAT FIT FROM A SIMILAR SHAVER I HAD BEFORE</li>
            <li> I bought this item about a month ago. It definately lives up to it&#x27;s name. Smooth and Silky. I had been debating about purchasing one and came across this one and decided to give it a try. I love it. It leaves your skin feeling soft without moisturizer. I recommend it if you are thinking about buying one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, and got it 2 days later (I did standard shipping by the way). It was charged when I received it, but when you put it on the charger, it lasts a while...I haven&#x27;t charged mine in a month, and it&#x27;s still charged up! It shaves very nicely, I wasn&#x27;t unsatisfied at all. It even comes with a cleaning brush!!! Which cleans quite well. This is the best electric shaver!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA:Husbands must buy their wives this product for Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> I use an electric razor several times a week and have for over 10 years. I end up buying a new razor about every 3 years when the blades get dull. I bought a Conair aroung 12/08 to replace my current razor at the timer. That was the worst razor I have ever owened. Based on the reviews on Amazon, I purchased this razor as the replacement ot the conair that did not work at all. I love this razor. It is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. It shaves so close. In the future, I will only purchase Remington razors.</li>
            <li> This shaver does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and it would probably be great if I used it more often. I don&#x27;t like that I got razor burn from it, but I suspect it was more user error than product deficiency. Having used non-electric shavers for the last decade or so, I think it&#x27;s a nice alternative to constantly throwing things away.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly.  It was better than expected.  Thanks for your great service.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy. Great value. Low sound. Lightweight. Highly recommend.Another great Remington product. Been rocking Remingtons for 30 years. Best value out of the 7 I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> this was sort of an impulse buy, but it worked amazingly... for the first two months. a few weeks into using it, a rip developed in the protective screen. a few weeks later, halfway through shaving, the screen came clean off. obviously, i can&#x27;t use it anymore, so im looking for a different, better electric razor.</li>
            <li> My first time using this I got terrible razor burn. I thought I would give it a few more chances considering sometimes they say you have to get used to a razor. Well several uses later and it is not any better. It&#x27;s alright for the legs (still misses a lot and you have to shave several times in the same area to get a clean shave) but the underarms are unbearable! I am going to try to return this and find another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on coumadin, a blood thinner, and I&#x27;m not supposed to use regular razor blades because of the danger that a little cut won&#x27;t clot.    My legs have been qualifying me for a part in the next Planet of the Apes remake, so it was time to do something about it. I never knew a guy who liked an electric shaver, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I figured I&#x27;d just go with whatever would work for the best price because whatever I&#x27;d get just wouldn&#x27;t do a good job.    Well, I&#x27;m presently surprised! The hair on my legs was LONG, so I went over it slowly and several times. It was not as close as a razor shave, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all (kind of like the way my legs feel the day after a razor shave.)    The razor cleans easily and makes it easy to do touch ups, which I do pretty much every other day since I like it smooth. The directions say it can take three weeks to get used to an electric razor, but I had no such time problem. No razor burn, nothing but a pretty decent shave!    I can&#x27;t honestly say that when I&#x27;m off the blood thinner that I won&#x27;t go back to manual razors. I like the closeness of the shave. But for between times and a quick touch up, this razor is definitely worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I have always used remington shavers and unfortunately dropped my last one in the tub and the impact broke it.  So without hesitation, I knew that I had to replace it with another Remington shaver. Service and delivery was excellent, received it in less than a week. True to it&#x27;s features, this shaver is excellent along the curves and I have gotten a close, smooth shave everytime I use it.  I like the grip as well especially when my hands are slippery with soap. For the best result, press it against your skin, not too much but enough for you to feel it glide without too much pressure.  If you are a first time user, I would recommend a small patch first or a couple of patches to ensure that you feel just right with the amount of pressure you use to glide along the skin.  To sum it up, it works!</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor for my 10 year old after she begged to shave her legs. It is terrific. I don&#x27;t have to worry with her cutting herself and she&#x27;s able to shave all by herself- she&#x27;s actually thinks it is fun! Seems to keep a charge for a long time too.</li>
            <li> Great razor for for the right price. First time I&#x27;ve had an electric razor . It shaves good, does not leave a rash. Kinda of rough on underarms though</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this product. I have sensitive, itchy skin in the winter, especially when shaving with a conventional razor. While it doesn&#x27;t yet provide \\&quot;blade close\\&quot; shaves, it does a good job and I can shave more frequently without irritation. I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver hoping it would be like my old one but it isn&#x27;t. I have to go over the same area several times before it cuts all the hairs. I think the mesh screen on the shaver needs to have larger openings or the blades need to be brought closer to the surphase. I&#x27;m not very happy with it but it will do for now. I think next times I&#x27;ll go a little more expensive and see if it does a better job. When it does finally get all or most of the hair it is smooth. mixed emotions on this item.</li>
            <li> Sucks after a few months use the blade wasnt cutting the hair as it promised hadvto back to using razors contacted the company they refused to help me so I tossed it and donated it to my local thrift store. Worthless and useless. DO NOT BUY doesntbmeet expectations. I bought because of the reviews but was obviously deceived.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase this shaver 2ce within a year because my 8 yr old grandson mischeviously damaged my 1st one.  Since I was very satisfied with the performance of the shaver the first time I did not hesitate to buy it again.  Gives a close shave &amp; is easy to handle.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have to use an electric shaver in the winter because my legs are too sensitive and get dried out and itch with a regular razor.  I had an old Remington similar to this model that I had for over 13 years that was great and it finally bit it- not because the motor went out but because it fell apart and I couldn&#x27;t get the springs back to have it work properly again.  i could have gotten it fixed but it would have cost almost the same price as buying this new one and I figured it was time to replace after so many years.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  I was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t find one like it but this one is almost identical except you can also use it in the shower!  Both in and out of the shower work great.  You don&#x27;t get a very close shave compared to a regular razor but no one could tell by looking and it solved my skin irritation issue with shaving.  It&#x27;s decent for an electric razor shave- as close as you can get.    I love that it&#x27;s cordless- I can charge it up and take it with me for a weekend trip and it&#x27;s easy to clean.    Don&#x27;t bother buying a more expensive model.  I was tempted too but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t- other razors don&#x27;t have as large of a cutting surface- they are more narrow and that didn&#x27;t seem like it would be very efficient.    I&#x27;m very happy with Remington- I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else unless they stopped making these!    Good model and great price!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my daughters old electric razor that broke.  this one is much better and the same price. Works great and she loves it.</li>
            <li> For the pricing, this product is perfect, design is great...I would recommend wetting skin before shaving though, I&#x27;m not sure doing it on dry skin is all that great.</li>
            <li> Love this little razor.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, and I was able to get a clean shave from the very first time I used it.  I had read a few previous reviews that it burns your armpits when you use it on them.  I didn&#x27;t have a single problem (well, not until I tried to put deodorant on right after...ouch!) and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.      You can&#x27;t see a single hair on my legs when I&#x27;m finished shaving, which is impressive for my Italian legs.  I can&#x27;t just use one swipe, however, because it&#x27;ll miss spots.  But I had that problem with a normal razor too, so I can&#x27;t fault it for that.    A huge plus is that it&#x27;s rechargeable!  No batteries needed.  Just plug it in when you find it getting low, and you&#x27;re good to go.  No searching for AAA or AA batteries.    If I can help it, I will never use a real razor again.  This gets me smooth and doesn&#x27;t give me ANY of the irritation that I got EVERY time I used a normal razor.      A+!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.  I like it, but find it that it takes much longer to do than shaving and I&#x27;m not seeing a closer shave.  The instructions say that it can shave the hair in any direction, but I have found that it works much better when you shave in the direction of your hair growth.  It also helps to pull up on the skin and work in small sections.  I was hoping that this shaver would work better than razors, but it doesn&#x27;t last any longer.</li>
            <li> This is the first rechargeable shaver I have owned and I really like that feature.  The good reviews and the price motivated me into choosing the Remington Smooth and Silky Ultra Shaver and I am glad I did.    I have absolutely no complaints or have I had any problems using this shaver.  I have not and probably will not use it wet...just my preference.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!This was by far the best Christmas present of the bunch!  It works great, and she loves how easy to it is to use and clean it!  One recharge lasts over a week with constant use!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable, for a friend who is handicapped.  He has limited use of one elbow after 6 surgeries, and an amputation of the thumb and index finger on the other.  He is pleased that he can shave himself and loves the ease of a rechargeable, cordless shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to hold in your hand and also to place in the charger.  Basic shaver but exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> My legs were breaking out from a straight edge razor and my dermatologist did not know why. When I started using the Remington shaver, my legs did not break out--the razor gave too close of a shave even after showers. I told my dermatologist the solution! after using two steriod creams and several doctor visits. The Remington shaver lasted for years, like ten years or more. I love it and highly recommend it. I purchased the Smooth and Silky because my first Remmington gave out last month; it is a similar model to my first one. [[ASIN:B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]]</li>
            <li> I received the shaver in great condition. It arrived quickly after I purchased it and I am for the most part satisfied. It works well for my legs, but is too rough for my underarms. Overall, this was a positive transaction.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor mainly based on the great reviews I saw here on Amazon.  I had not owned an electric razor in about 15 years, mainly because the razor I had didn&#x27;t do a very good job (it wasn&#x27;t a cheap one, either). But there are times when you want to be able to shave your legs quickly without the shaving cream and all that, so I decided to try to find a better razor this time around.  THIS razor; however, is great.  It shaves close and I found it very comfortable. I like that it is rechargeable, cordless, and easy to handle.  The price is great too, no need to spend more ....</li>
            <li> Love this item! I bought it after shaving with a razor was causing such irritation with my skin. This works so well in the shower, I don&#x27;t have to use shave cream and I use it for my legs and underarms. I don&#x27;t press too hard when shaving. I just wish I had bought it sooner. You really can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor based on the reviews I read.  I noted that one woman complained about irritation and welts, and that another woman said her husband claimed that the woman experienced irritation because she pressed down too hard with the razor.  That husband doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about.  I tried my new razor on my underarms using almost NO pressure.  The irritation was horrible, and I was left with red welts.  Bravely, I used it on my legs.  I had no irritation whatsoever on my legs, and got a very nice shave.  The underarm irritation lasted over a week.  Once the irritation was gone, I tried the razor again.  (I thought that maybe the irritation came because it was the very first use of the razor.  Also, the instructions say that it takes three uses for your skin to get used to the razor.)  Unfortunately, I again experienced irritation.  It was not as bad as the first time, but was present for over a week.  I don&#x27;t know if eventually the razor will stop irritating my underarms or not, but I am disappointed in the product.  I have owned electric razors in the past (dating back to the 1970&#x27;s) and have never experienced irritation like this with a new razor.  This is the first electric razor I have purchased in at least a decade.  I gave it three stars because it does shave nicely on my legs (and even the bikini area - if you are gentle and careful), but I really needed it for my underarms (the hair grows faster and is more obvious there.)  I hope this review helps you make an informed choice.  -Donna   &gt;&lt;&gt;    Update:  I have used this razor several times on my underarms, and it is not getting any better.  It pinches and \\&quot;bites\\&quot;.  I would never have purchased this razor if I had known that I could not shave my underarms with it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job!  Legs feel as smooth as using a regular blade razor. Love the fact that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> This razor is really good.  I&#x27;ve had 3 of them over the years.  They eventually lose their capability to recharge, but for the cost, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Good shave and probably would last longer if I used it more in the winter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with a little concern that it might not be satisfactory. I had a lady&#x27;s electric shaver years ago and it was unimpressive. This shaver is, however, great! No unhappy results here. I love it. It shaves close and no more nicks and no more disposable razors to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Remington ladies shavers over the years and have been pleased with them. After reading the positive reviews, I ordered the product. It arrived just before I was leaving to go on a two-week vacation so I didn&#x27;t have an opportunity to try the shaver until it could not be returned. No matter how careful I am, every time I use it the skin behind my knees gets cut. I would never try to use it on my underarms. It works okay on the rest of my legs but not as well as my other Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> It does not hold a charge now.  I think it needs a new battery, but my old one did not need a  battery this soon.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well. Frees you up from having to run water in the shower. I think it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this electric razor! I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and I still love it. I can tell its starting to dull but it still works well. I&#x27;d definitely purchase another Remington in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Remington razors before and was satisfied so I didn&#x27;t keep my receipt. However, the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky I purcahsed earlier last year had a probelm with it not keeping a charge from the start.  I contacted the company via e-mail and heard back saying that I had to charge the unit for a certain amount of hours before using the first time to keep a charge, which I had.  I also charged the recommended hours each time after that.  When I informed of this I never heard back from them. I would think the company would stand behind their products better. I&#x27;ve been looking for a new razor and will not be buying a Remington!</li>
            <li> I had another Remington lady razor for years,,,, it finally quit holding a charge.  I bought this one and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with its performance.  Based upon other reviews of the product and the its brand reputation, I chose it.  I highly  recommend it as it out-performed a shaver that I had by another popular brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky Electric Razor and it is great. I get a closer shave on my legs tahn I did the Mens Norelco. I had Remington similiar to this several years ago but it got to where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after apx 5 years. I highly reccomend this razor and the seller I purchased it from. Both are great!!!!  5 stars.</li>
            <li> No shaved flush, plus the battery lasts only 10 minutes use</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. It gives a good, close shave. My only complaint is that it does get hot when it&#x27;s been on awhile.</li>
            <li> For many years I went the traditional shaving route - a safety razor in the shower with a foaming shaving gel.  The process was tedious, uncomfortable, a waste of water, and it sometimes left me with cuts or a rash.  I tried waxing more than once but it was messy, painful, time-consuming, and inefficient.  I tried an electric epilator, but it broke too many hairs (leaving my legs with constant stubble), and it caused many ingrown hairs even though I exfoliated regularly.  Recently I tried THIS inexpensive little shaver. Lo and behold, it gives such an easy and smooth shave! No downside whatsoever. I like to use it dry (not in the shower).  I don&#x27;t need any ancillary products such as shaving gel or an exfoliator. This product produces a fast, trouble-free, smooth shave every time.  After a few initial re-charges it now holds a charge for about 5 full shaves.  I always discharge it completely before recharging. No need to look further, this is now THE shaver for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because my WDF 6000 finally would not charge after 5 years.  I was being cheap and bought this one over the WDF 6000.  This one does not work as well.  It works fine, but in comparison, WDF 6000 is way better.  This one does not shave as close and it takes longer.  Right now the WDF 6000 is only a couple dollars more, so I would highly recommend buying that one!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product before I bought it but Im glad I did. I do not get the razor burn any more. It did take a several days before the razor gave me a closer shave. I tried underarm shaving...won&#x27;t do that again, OUCH...It works with or without shaving cream. In the tub too!..</li>
            <li> This razor may not shave quite as close and silky smooth as disposables, but it will last a lot longer! It does a very good job; I was surprised that the  trimmer provided such a close shave as well. It&#x27;s convenient, versatile (wet/dry), the charge lasts for days and is so easy to clean - just flip open and rinse. I waited a long time to buy myself an electric razor and I&#x27;m very happy with my choice (except I should have treated myself sooner!).</li>
            <li> This is one of the better razors that I have bought,  Keeps your legs smooth for days and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Smooth and Silky WDF-3000 which lasted me almost 10 years... I only replaced the blades once. When I tried to order the blades again, they were no longer available. Then I realized that this razor was all together cheaper, so I decided to give it a try.  Obviously this does not give you the same smooth shave as a regular razor, so don&#x27;t expect a miracle... but it does a pretty decent job. It&#x27;s great for sensitive areas as well as to avoid nicks and cuts.  I love the wet/dry feature bc I keep mine in the shower.  I would definitely recommend this, especially for the low price on Amazon. When it comes time to replace the blades, I&#x27;ll probably just replace the whole thing!</li>
            <li> The product came in packaging, perfect condition, charges good, definitely chargefor like a day when you first get it so it is fully powered.  My legs adjusted fine to it, I only had redness the first time, others say up to three weeks.  I like the razor alot, but I expected a bit of a closer shave from it, it hasn&#x27;t givenme that much of a closer shave, but maybe if i let the hair grow longer ( I don&#x27;t want it to grow longer thats why I have the razor?).  either way content for the most part.</li>
            <li> When I first used this razor, I thought it was pretty good. It gives a closer shave than my previous Panasonic. However, after only a year it won&#x27;t hold a charge. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m able to shave both legs. I have to shave the bottom of my legs, recharge, then shave the top. This is worst rechargeable razor I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;d rather go back to the razors with a cord.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $5 for replacement razors and nicking/cutting my legs all the time, so I decided to buy an electric razor. For the first 2 weeks, I had horrible razor rash (and I even used soap). I have had the product since the beginning of October and it has pretty much completely quit shaving. I have to go over the same exact spot at least 5 times in order to remove the hair and it still leaves stubble. I like to have a close shave and this defiantly does not give me that, I feel almost like I didn&#x27;t shave when I use this product. The one nice thing was I never cut or nicked myself. Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll be finding a new electric razor but in the mean time it&#x27;s back to the $5 replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was for a man. I figured, how different could it be. Just what I thought, worked great and gives me an excellent, close shave. I only use it on those days your running   a bit late or need a quick clean up, but it does the trick. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Good design, and gives a really close shave.  The one thing I wish is that it didn&#x27;t have a Ni Cad battery, and I wish it didn&#x27;t charge all day long.  While I think this razor is a lot better for the planet than disposables, it could be much more earth friendly.  Why not use a capacitor instead of a battery?  Why not have a charger that shuts off?!  I would gladly pay more for an electric razor that was nicer to our planet.</li>
            <li> That little sucker catches every hair and cuts so close I am wanting to shave my legs every day....Too bad there is no hair to shave for about a week.... Think I&#x27;ll try it on my chin--we grandmas have to contend with those stragglers, you know.</li>
            <li> When I just got it, I think it&#x27;s very good, though a bit noisy. But after using it 2-3 times per week for three months, the charger stops working. The shaver cannot get charged and of course stops working gradually too. I think a 50+ dollar product should not have quality like this!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for 5 years and have replaced the foils/cutters twice, but the shaver just keeps on shaving.  I tried to replace with a newer shaver, but was so dissatisfied with the quality, it went back and I reordered the replacement foils/cutters for this one.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I selected this for my daughter&#x27;s first shaver. She loves it and uses it a couple of times a week. It never nicks or cuts her skin. As with any electric shaver, there is a little stubble when she is done, but it&#x27;s a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> This model lasted me about 14 months.  it gave a good shave, however, battery gave out after 14 months.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this Remington Smooth and Silky shaver gives you really smooth legs. The hair does not grow back as fast, I love this! This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Product stopped holding a charge, long enough to use it, 3 months after the two year warranty expired.  On/off button is in a bad location.</li>
            <li> This was a decent shaver. I kept it dry and clean, used it once every couple or few days and it simply stopped working after 6 months of use.  It suddenly wouldn&#x27;t take a charge and stopped working.</li>
            <li> It worked but lasted about a year.</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a new Ladies shaver at about the same time I was for a mens shaver myself. I found a Remington Mens shaver that I liked and my wife wanted a Lady Remington just like the one she has had for over 5 years , so I ordered hers at the Same time A Remington WDF 1600 Ultra Shaver . She has been very pleased with it, and asked that I get her a second one for our daughter so she can get hers back, my daughter likes it as well. My wife is a satisfied Remington WDF 1600 Ultra shaver user, oh yes and so is our daughter. A great ladies shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> My wife has one of these and loves it so I baught one for my Chest legs and arms.  I&#x27;m a body builder so I constantly have to shave my body and stubble. And this razor works great. If this one ever quits working I will buy another.</li>
            <li> My wife was shopping for a shaver.  I choose this one from Amazon because it was the best seller.  My wife is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a men&#x27;s shaver, imagine my imbarasment when I gave it to my son.</li>
            <li> i always wanted to buy a shaver. so i bought this one it&#x27;s pretty good for the price but the wet feature sucked for me i tried it in the shower and i didn&#x27;t get a good enough shave as i did when i used it out of the shower. so i recommend only using the dry feature or just try a different shaver altogether.</li>
            <li> I bought this wanting something easier and a bit cheaper than disposable razors.     Using the razor on my legs is a breeze. I do have to do a few passes over an area to get it completely. I had to do this with a manual anyways so no big deal in my book. I did have some irritation under my arms, but they have always been sensitive so I&#x27;m going to not use the razor there.     Overall a great razor and a cheaper alternative to buying disposable cartridges so much!</li>
            <li> it was present for my mother-in-law. she is very happy with it.  she just had a hip replacement and the shaver is useful</li>
            <li> Switched back to Braun Silk‑epil</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife as a Christmas present..works as advertised after charging. It is very convenient for travelling and is not bulky or hard to hold onto..good design for the hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this, thinking that is was going to be better than regular shaving. I was really let down by the product. I thought I got a better shave using a razor. Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent all that money on it and not being able to use it. Think I will just stick to regular shaving instead.</li>
            <li> I love this new razor.  I had a Remington WDF-5500 Smooth &amp; Silky Ladies Shaver for 3 years and it just died.  It was a good razor too but the battery life was not very long.  I charge my new razor for the recommended 18 hours and I was able to shave my legs and bikini area.  My other one wouldn&#x27;t have lasted that long.  Another difference with this one is I used it a few days after I had charged it and it lasted again to shave my legs and bikin area.  I was really impressed by that.  It gives you a close shave, but obviously not as close as a razor.  I loved it and definitely recommend it.  Oh and I have had no razor burn in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I have gone through several less expensive shavers and none can beat the performance of my new remington razon. I&#x27;ll surely buy another one when needed in the future.</li>
            <li> Great razor.Love it.Had one years ago.It died.As I get older-it&#x27;s easier to use than a razor blade.Legs are smooth.Would definitley buy again..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same model for years and it still works just as well as when I first purchased it on Amazon, even though I&#x27;ve dropped it multiple times. As with most electric razors, it doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as a disposable razor, but you definitely can&#x27;t see the hair after you use it. It just doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best electric, chargeable shaver on the market.  It does a good job of shaving my legs when I don&#x27;t want to get wet.  I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower, since I use a regular razor in the shower, but I&#x27;m sure it will do just fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for about six months and then for reasons unknown, without being dropped, used in water, or buried in the backyard by the dog, etc. it just stopped working.  There was no warning, one day it worked, the next it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy one again.</li>
            <li> Great product....I keep plugged in at all times</li>
            <li> She was pleased although she did say. it does a good job but I believe my old previous remington&lt;br /&gt;was just a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Hubbie George</li>
            <li> Had one of these before and then tried a different brand.  This one is so much better. glad to have it</li>
            <li> Bought April 13, 3013.  Worked fine since them, today will not turn on, have kept it in the rechargeable holder daily.  2 nd review:  the shaver started working a few days after it quit. &amp; I posted the first review. Mohave not had a problem with it since, don&#x27;t know what happened the first time it quit.  Gives an adequate have on legs.</li>
            <li> I love this thing - and for the price, it&#x27;s a steal!! I got it after getting tired of constantly cutting myself in my bikini area shaves. It was getting so bad I was thinking about just getting laser.  Then I tried this thing... It&#x27;s fantastic!!! It does have a little pull, like a pinch really, but the more I use it, the less I feel it, even on the most sensitive areas. No more cuts, my skin feels SO smooth, I REALLY love it!! Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have never used a electric shaver but I have to say this one is nice. It gives you a clean shave in the shower. It was not expensive but still a nice little shaver</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an electric shaver for the past year because I hate shaving with a razor!  To be honest I only shave like once or twice a week because I&#x27;m lazy and hate shaving.  I have had this one for just about a month now and the shaver does a very good job although it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as a razor.  For the price it&#x27;s totally worth buying!      Simple to use and cleaning is a breeze! (Per another reviewer, how in the world do you get a \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; from an electric shaver??)</li>
            <li> I am loving my shaver, but I am going to have to stick to blades for under my arms. I barely touch this shaver under my arms &amp; I have a nasty rash for the next few days. It&#x27;s almost like it burns me. It leaves a rash instantly when I attempt to use it under my arms. My underarms feel like they are on fire. It has been great for my legs, leaving them almost as smooth as a razor. I have not tried it on my bikini line yet. For the legs, it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaving my legs was ok not a close shave but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.  DO NOT ATTEMPT to shave your under arms with this razor if you have even slightly sensitive skin.  Normally I don&#x27;t have a problem with shaving but this razor left me red and sore. There is NO WAY I&#x27;m even going to ATTEMPT to shave me bikini area with this!</li>
            <li> On the first use the razor shaved fine. During the second use the grills head cut through the grill making the unit useless. I returned the unit and amazon did a great job with the return.</li>
            <li> Works well on legs and arms, but for the sensitive zones(bikini and underarms) it was horrible. I tried multiple times using different pressure thinking maybe I was using it wrong and changing that would help. No way. It felt as thought it was ripping out my coarse hair instead of cutting it every time. Definitely not recommended for the sensitive zones. I prefer the \\&quot;Panasonic Close Curves 3-Blade Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver\\&quot; for bikini or underarm areas as it has never ripped my hair out, and I can do a quick wet/dry shave without worrying.</li>
            <li> It was definitely brand new when I received it. It cuts much of the hair off of the legs, underarms, and bikini area. I would&#x27;ve like the front cutter to be at the same level as the back cutters (covered by the aluminum porous film). It seems like the front cutter doesn&#x27;t do much cutting since it is quite lower than the back trimmers.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this razor and it is terrible! After using I got long welts that looked and felt like burns and cuts! I was in pain for three days and the welts took even longer to go away. The design is horrible and dangerous!</li>
            <li> I have been through many shavers and this is the only one that actually works!  I may buy a second one in case this one dies on me someday.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of schedule and works perfectly. I shave every day and it gives me a close comfortable shave. Would recommend this</li>
            <li> If you want to clip the hair round your little bits, this is the clipper to use.  The two of us have used this every week now for a couple of years and had not one problem.  The batteries last forever.  Just note though.  This is a clipper and not a shaver.  If you want to be smooth and shaven down there, then buy a shaver, but if you are satisfied with a decent &amp;#34;clip job&amp;#34;, then this is what you need.  I use it under my arms too and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> this razor is OK for legs but the don&#x27;t recommend it for underarms .. my previous Remingtons were better than this one</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my daughter. It was good for the amount of time that it lasted, around 4 months. The reason why I purchased it was because it took the same replacement heads and foil of my Ladies Remington Rechargeable shaver. Wished that it would have lasted longer than it did.</li>
            <li> Broke in no time - such a waste of money.  Did not work well and defintely will not be purchasing again --- ugh! Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product is alright. It is probably the best one on the market at a cheap price, but I stopped using it after two months because it just burns! I just got a little edge tool for bikini lines instead. It is a lot smaller (philips brand) so I would not really recommend it for legs, but it works find for everywhere else. My new one is very effective and does not hurt like this one did. Oh, and it says you can use it wet or dry, but it is pretty much better dry because then it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin as much. Does fine on your legs, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and thus far have not had any issues with this shaver.  I like that it&#x27;s not super heavy or clunky, very easy to handle.  It&#x27;s also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have always used Remington of some sort, this one seem to have a very short short run time.&lt;br /&gt;I paid alot more then i&#x27;m accustom to paying my razors for this one I thought it would be better cause&lt;br /&gt;it cost more I boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington corded shaver for years and loved it.  Hesitate to get a new one, but this model is perfect in every way. l Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these before and they&#x27;ve worked fine. This one wouldn&#x27;t charge. I sent it back. They made it easy and gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> This has been a wonderful razor! Use it all the time and it keeps on going! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shaver for my wife. She uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> i replaced this for my old one wich lasted 7 years before the screen broke.  it works just great!!!!!!!!!! Would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> The best razor ever. Especially for the bikini area. Gets real close, and doesn&#x27;t leave razor bumps. Just a little hard to clean. But I just shake it on the sink. And sanitize it with alcohol or peroxide. Don&#x27;t get much better than this. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors.</li>
            <li> I bought Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable product 2 years ago an it worked great. Then it died. I did not realise I could not replace the battery when I bought it. So now I will buy anouther one. I look at it this way. $30.00 a year is not bad for an electric razor if it does the job. I could be spending that much on replacement blades for a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Ok maybe I have unusually coarse hair but the only part that works is the leading edge.</li>
