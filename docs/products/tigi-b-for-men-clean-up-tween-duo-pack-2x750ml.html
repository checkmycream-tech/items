            <li>This shampoo and conditioner smells good and does a good job of keeping my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell for a guy.</li>
            <li>I used to be one of those guys that would buy whatever smelled good and was cheap.</li>
            <li>Peppermint Conditioner stuff cleans my hair very well, softens it and the conditioner is great for the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of my hair after using the Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>And this is such a great deal!</li>
            <li>advice, don&#x27;t buy it and move on to something better.  </li>
            <li>I think the shampoo and conditioner are just okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li>Just nothing that I love.  </li>
            <li>The scent is okay</li>
            <li>and all, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>But then I started growing my hair out longer than an inch and realized that I needed something better.</li>
            <li>love the tingle feeling.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my scalp feel and</li>
            <li>Great suff highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t easy to find since Tigi doesn&#x27;t have a store locator.  </li>
            <li>I now use this exclusively because it is such a great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Bought the Clean Up Shampoo &amp; Clean</li>
            <li>You really do pay for quality and now I can see why this stuff is better than the cheap shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Wakes you up in the morning and leave your hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Even if you get genuine product, it is no longer worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been more than satisfied with everything else I&#x27;ve tried by Tigi over the years, so when I finally ran out of shampoo, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I have some of the original product that I bought from a salon, and it smells exactly like Peppermint, not Menthol.</li>
            <li>My hair feels extremely light, smooth, and manageable right out of the shower, but it starts to feel ever so slightly dry and more tangle-prone once I get going.  </li>
            <li>He loves the tingly sensation and i love how soft his hair is and the smell.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and manageable and i love the peppermint tingle.  </li>
            <li>but I think worth it.</li>
            <li>His hair seems to have a little more healthy shine to it.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m absolutely no expert in hair care and can only refer to my own experience, the somewhat drying effect these products have may work perfectly for someone with slightly oilier hair than mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this duo pack of shampoo and conditioner for years, buying first from my stylist and then from Amazon after my stylist stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t buy nice hair products, but I can definitely feel the difference.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and great smell.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling clean but still very soft.</li>
            <li>The other shampoo&#x27;s are really fruity and this one has a clean and minty scent, so better for a guy.</li>
            <li>As far as how it feels after washing, though, there&#x27;s nothing too special to report.  </li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s still much better than some of the other shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, but for the price, I&#x27;ll probably try to find something better suited to my hair/scalp chemistry in the future.  </li>
            <li>hair also feels much thicker and softer once it dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before using this stuff,I stuck to the cheap shampoos such as suave for men.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel</li>
            <li>I get compliments on having great hair and this is my secret weapon to achieve that.  </li>
            <li>I like the minty stuff, and it always seems to be available only for men, so...</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores, it smells like peppermint and very refreshing and energizing feel.  </li>
            <li>and I find this works just as well for more then half the price.  </li>
            <li>My most recent order from Amazon is not the same product.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a decent shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The mint smell and tingling sensation are somewhat strong, especially if you leave them on for a minute or two, but personally, I&#x27;ve yet to meet a mint soap I&#x27;ve found too intense.  </li>
            <li>love the big size it lasts for so long</li>
            <li>The conditioner is much better, and the shampoo works like expected, but the peppermint scent I purchase this product for is overpowered by a smell similar to model airplane</li>
            <li>The problem is most of these salons don&#x27;t carry this product anymore, so it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans but is not harsh, the conditioner softens but is not heavy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo, besides making my hair feel clean, adds a little Zing to my scalp.</li>
            <li>shampoo makes my hair feel much cleaner than any other</li>

            <li> any different then any other brand</li>

            <li> My head&#x27;s in a towel, still tingling like crazy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner really good price</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while having my hair cut. The tingling sensation was awesome and I had to have some for the house. I bought some at the salon and it was PRICEY! I came home did some research and found it here on Amazon for a quarter of what it was in the salon.</li>
            <li> The shower smells like a spa after he uses these. He loves the tingly sensation and i love how soft his hair is and the smell.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner...love the smell and the way my hair feels...love the big size it lasts for so long</li>
            <li> Bought the Clean Up Shampoo &amp; Clean Up Peppermint Conditioner stuff cleans my hair very well, softens it and the conditioner is great for the scalp.  Had been using Nioxin for a while but gets very expensive and I find this works just as well for more then half the price.  Good product!</li>
            <li> The product us in different packaging which I don&#x27;t mind but I&#x27;m dissatisfied it doesn&#x27;t come with nozzle. It&#x27;s hard to use the big bottles as squeeze bottles. Nozzles are picture and should be included.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of my hair after using the Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo makes my hair feel much cleaner than any other I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;My hair also feels much thicker and softer once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a little less than you normally would. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure this was the real thing...it gave my fianc&amp;eacute; an allergic reaction and we ended up giving it away to his step-dad.</li>
            <li> Before using this stuff,I stuck to the cheap shampoos such as suave for men. I made the switch and I am very glad I did. It leaves your hair feeling clean but still very soft. The best part about this shampoo is that the peppermint conditioner leaves an awesome tingly feeling on your scalp for good amount of time. You really do pay for quality and now I can see why this stuff is better than the cheap shampoos.  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is Fake, it does not smell like the salon quality product,  this product has a strong smell of Menthol, not Peppermint. I have some of the original product that I bought from a salon, and it smells exactly like Peppermint, not Menthol. The problem is most of these salons don&#x27;t carry this product anymore, so it&#x27;s hard to find. Also, some of the wording on the back of the label is different from the bottle that I have, and some of the ingredients are not the same. I bought my set from a proffessional salon, where I get my hair cut, and what I received is not the same quality and smells completely different.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair so fresh and clean! Absolutely love the sent! I know it&#x27;s for men,  but I steal it from the hubby sometimes! And this is such a great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this duo pack of shampoo and conditioner for years, buying first from my stylist and then from Amazon after my stylist stopped carrying it.  My most recent order from Amazon is not the same product.  The smell of both is terrible, the shampoo leaves my hair squeaky, and the conditioner feels like the stuff you get when staying in a cheap hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since purchased a duo pack from a salon that swears it&#x27;s genuine product.  They weren&#x27;t easy to find since Tigi doesn&#x27;t have a store locator.  The product I purchased isn&#x27;t as bad as what I received from Amazon, but is distinctly different from the previous product that I liked.  The conditioner is much better, and the shampoo works like expected, but the peppermint scent I purchase this product for is overpowered by a smell similar to model airplane glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that the product has been reformulated, and the counterfeits are based on the reformulated product.  I still believe the product I received from Amazon was counterfeit because the ink on the bottles started to flake off after one day in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, don&#x27;t buy it and move on to something better.  Even if you get genuine product, it is no longer worth the price.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy nice hair products, but I can definitely feel the difference. My hair seems healthier.</li>
            <li> Great suff highly recommended. Only stuff i can find that works well for my oily hair. Long lasting and great smell.</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo and conditioner are just okay.  I&#x27;ve had better I&#x27;ve had worse.  There&#x27;s nothing really that I hate about them.  Just nothing that I love.  The scent is okay and it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel any different then any other brand I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price.  packaged well.</li>
            <li> smells great, feels good.</li>
            <li> I used to be one of those guys that would buy whatever smelled good and was cheap. But then I started growing my hair out longer than an inch and realized that I needed something better. This shampoo and conditioner smells good and does a good job of keeping my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for over a year and cannot be any happier with them. The conditioner leaves your head feeling awesome.</li>
            <li> This is another excellent shampoor and duo package that we enjoy. The quality and fragrance is absolutely amazingly great!  Hair is clean the peppermint conditioner is awesome!  All around great product and service!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, it smells like peppermint and very refreshing and energizing feel.  Wakes you up in the morning and leave your hair feeling clean.  I know it&#x27;s just shampoo but try it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo, besides making my hair feel clean, adds a little Zing to my scalp. Then you put the conditioner on and ZING, BANG what a feeling!</li>
            <li> My regular shampoo/conditioner.  I get compliments on having great hair and this is my secret weapon to achieve that.  Keeps hair soft and manageable and i love the peppermint tingle.  A bit pricey but I think worth it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are expensive, but my wife insists that they leave my hair cleaner and softer than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ll take her word for it.  Amazon seems to be one of the best places to buy it - it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, and seems to be cheaper on Amazon in any case.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try and the results were great, extremely refreshing tingle while letting settle. Was impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> cleanest my hair has ever been. smells great. love the tingle feeling. for those that care about the pump (i didnt) it does not include them</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo, perfect without making my hair to soft and has a great manly smell.  I bought the BB matte wax too, great products!</li>
            <li> I now use this exclusively because it is such a great shampoo and conditioner. I love the way it makes my scalp feel and how well it cleans my hair and how well the conditioner works. My girlfriend also loves the way my hair smells and feels too, extra bonus.</li>
            <li> Sorry, boys. I&#x27;m using your shampoo and conditioner. I like the minty stuff, and it always seems to be available only for men, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I&#x27;m staking my claim. This is the mintiest, even the conditioner. My head&#x27;s in a towel, still tingling like crazy. The shampoo cleans but is not harsh, the conditioner softens but is not heavy. Girls, do not be afraid..</li>
            <li> I got this for my teen son. He seems to like it. His hair seems to have a little more healthy shine to it. It has a nice smell for a guy. The other shampoo&#x27;s are really fruity and this one has a clean and minty scent, so better for a guy.</li>
            <li> My son loves this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, nice minty feeling</li>
            <li> Great product for mens hair. Especially if you have long/dry hair. The conditioner smells like a candy cane. My wife loves it</li>
            <li> No way this wasn&#x27;t a fake.</li>
            <li> I have been more than satisfied with everything else I&#x27;ve tried by Tigi over the years, so when I finally ran out of shampoo, I decided to give this a try.  All in all, it&#x27;s a decent shampoo and conditioner.  The mint smell and tingling sensation are somewhat strong, especially if you leave them on for a minute or two, but personally, I&#x27;ve yet to meet a mint soap I&#x27;ve found too intense.  As far as how it feels after washing, though, there&#x27;s nothing too special to report.  My hair feels extremely light, smooth, and manageable right out of the shower, but it starts to feel ever so slightly dry and more tangle-prone once I get going.  I say &amp;#34;ever so slightly&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s still much better than some of the other shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, but for the price, I&#x27;ll probably try to find something better suited to my hair/scalp chemistry in the future.  While I&#x27;m absolutely no expert in hair care and can only refer to my own experience, the somewhat drying effect these products have may work perfectly for someone with slightly oilier hair than mine.</li>
