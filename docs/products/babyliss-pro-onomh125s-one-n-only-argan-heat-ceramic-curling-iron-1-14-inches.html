            <li>I purchased auria cacia argan oil, which I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not that satisfied...</li>
            <li>I notice my hair is softer after use, much more so than with</li>
            <li>If you want to use it more than once, keep looking.</li>
            <li>and so many people have noticed my hair since having bought it.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>arrived today and I am so pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy again, sometimes new isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li>The curls are smooth and hold up for most of the day.</li>
            <li>The 1 1/4\\&quot; barrel is great to acheive body, volume, soft waves, lift and smooth ends.</li>
            <li>sure to clean after use - of course after it has cooled a bit.</li>
            <li>My hair just slides out of it at first, all on its own.</li>
            <li>The curling iron curls her hair just fine...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and I set it to a 20.  </li>

            <li>It heats up fast, and leaves my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend to anyone looking to achieve smooth results.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the cool tip is helpful.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll gladly take it because I feel like I found a secret to beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>I realize I sound a bit over the top, but this really is a great curling iron and really not much more than a drugstore one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of completely frying my hair, so would be nice to know.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>It heats up really quick which is about the only good thing I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, the hair glides right over it, and comes out with a smooth curl.  </li>
            <li>It clicks between heat settings but can be changed during styling pretty easy.</li>
            <li>The tip is general cool to the touch when in use but be sure to watch your finger tips!</li>
            <li>Now, let me make this clear: I take VERY good care of my curling irons and my last one held out for an eternity (Helen of Troy) before kicking the bucket.</li>
            <li>Obviously, giving it a 24 hour break did nothing to help and Amazon took it back and refunded me immediately (no questions asked, they&#x27;re awesome!).</li>
            <li>It heats up fairly quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This iron doesn&#x27;t pull or snag the hair, is quick to heat up, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried after.</li>
            <li>* leaves a super shine in your hair</li>
            <li>very hot (dial goes up to a 30, and</li>
            <li>I have found this to be a very good iron and have not had any of the negative issues.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get how this curler got so many good reviews because it sucks</li>
            <li>That feature is always nice for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;These downsides aren&#x27;t deal breakers and would recommend.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more frequently than I thought.  </li>
            <li>I read the other reviews on here and thought I&#x27;d still take a chance on this because I love all argan products so why wouldn&#x27;t I love a curling iron made by them?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right....</li>
            <li>/&gt;*clamp isn&#x27;t very secure (This is better than having it too tight because it won&#x27;t pull your hair, but when doing barrel rolls, I almost don&#x27;t even need to release my hair as i rotate the iron.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot very quickly, and though it says fine hair only needs a heat setting of 10, I crank this baby up to 25 (out of 30) because my hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron after choosing it from some quick research.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*button is easily shut off while I use due to positioning, but now that I&#x27;m aware, I pay more attention to it and</li>
            <li>I was also pleased to see that they included a tiny bottle of Argan oil with the curling iron.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I wish they had thought out better is the heat setting dial which they placed on the handle of the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I like to use a wet cloth while it is warm to ensure all product is removed.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t a temperature button, so you never know how hot you are turning it up.</li>
            <li>and if your like me with bone straight hair an can&#x27;t hold a curl this curler is for you!</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>Hot Tools has the market on mid-priced tools...</li>
            <li>I ordered this curling iron to replace my Hot Tools iron I have had for 8 years.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would give this one a try because I LOVE all of the &amp;#34;One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil&amp;#34; hair products.  </li>
            <li>Easy to burn yourself if you&#x27;re not careful - That being said - It does what it&#x27;s meant to do.  </li>
            <li>The heat is consistent, and curls my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and evenly.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This iron works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for the argan oil that came with the iron.  </li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, really well at that.</li>
            <li>I really like this one by babyliss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tip grip, which is a very important part of the design and usage of this very hot iron, is way to small, thus leading to burning my fingers over and over.  </li>
            <li>the iron is more gentle on my hair than other curling irons on the market.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made and is solid in your hand (has a decent weight to it).</li>
            <li>I bought this recently after my original curling iron died out.</li>
            <li>This dial is sub-standard for such a nice curling iron, and I hope the manufacturer takes note and changes and improves it in the very near future.</li>
            <li>It comes with a mini argan oil sample which I used the first time - didn&#x27;t really see a major result</li>
            <li>I dont even have to turn it up high an risk burning my hair</li>
            <li>though that might not tell you a whole lot, a 23 is hot enough for my wavy, unruly hair and my old Hot Tools</li>
            <li>It came with a tiny bottle of argan oil, which smells really good, but is not new to me as I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for several months now, but nonetheless I like it.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if I received a new item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller won&#x27;t take returns.</li>
            <li>Seems like it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>NEVER was hot enough, though it is supposed to be 430 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;*ceramic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just not pure argan oil.  </li>
            <li>The barrel size is just right for loose curls.</li>
            <li>Clearly it&#x27;s a necessity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as it being infused with argan oil, I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>This one works well for my 11-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>The only reason for the 4 star rating is the hair does slide out a little too easily, but that does prevent any breakage.  </li>
            <li>It curls my hair quickly and the curls last longer than when I use other curling irons.  </li>
            <li>aside from other problems, it never got hot enough, ironically), so I started scouring amazon for something new.  </li>
            <li>She is Asian and has very think and straight black hair.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to try something new rather than roasting it with a flat iron all the day.</li>
            <li>this one when my basic Conair died of old age.</li>
            <li>With my busy life, I&#x27;ve come home discovering I left it on..freaked out!</li>
            <li>Even with my thick, coarse, and unruly hair I have found the tension on the spring to be just fine, and the location of the controls have not been an issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent this iron back and ordered the Hot Tools Pink Titanium Curling Iron which is very similar to the one I was replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Part of the plastic tip on the end closest to the metal gets a little too hot</li>
            <li>It heats up quick, the ceramic barrel keeps hair from frizzing and my once, none holding, completely straight thin hair stays curled to bedtime!</li>

            <li> I dont even have to turn it up high an risk burning my hair</li>
            <li> though that might not tell you a whole lot, a 23 is hot enough for my wavy, unruly hair and my old Hot Tools</li>
            <li> It came with a tiny bottle of argan oil, which smells really good, but is not new to me as I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for several months now, but nonetheless I like it.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if I received a new item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller won&#x27;t take returns.</li>
            <li> Seems like it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> NEVER was hot enough, though it is supposed to be 430 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;*ceramic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just not pure argan oil.  </li>
            <li> The barrel size is just right for loose curls.</li>
            <li> Clearly it&#x27;s a necessity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as it being infused with argan oil, I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> This one works well for my 11-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> The only reason for the 4 star rating is the hair does slide out a little too easily, but that does prevent any breakage.  </li>
            <li> It curls my hair quickly and the curls last longer than when I use other curling irons.  </li>
            <li> aside from other problems, it never got hot enough, ironically), so I started scouring amazon for something new.  </li>
            <li> She is Asian and has very think and straight black hair.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to try something new rather than roasting it with a flat iron all the day.</li>
            <li> this one when my basic Conair died of old age.</li>
            <li> With my busy life, I&#x27;ve come home discovering I left it on..freaked out!</li>
            <li> Even with my thick, coarse, and unruly hair I have found the tension on the spring to be just fine, and the location of the controls have not been an issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent this iron back and ordered the Hot Tools Pink Titanium Curling Iron which is very similar to the one I was replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Part of the plastic tip on the end closest to the metal gets a little too hot</li>
            <li> It heats up quick, the ceramic barrel keeps hair from frizzing and my once, none holding, completely straight thin hair stays curled to bedtime!</li>
            <li> Curls last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I only have to have it in my hair for a short amount of time as compared to other irons (at the same heat setting) to make it curl and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> which is a huge disappointment because I am used to my old curling iron and not worrying if I turned it off.</li>
            <li> The clamp mechanism is nowhere near firm enough to hole the hair in place while using the iron.  </li>
            <li> my hair falls out immediately and no matter how long I curled it...</li>
            <li> I have long thick/fine hair.</li>
            <li> the curling is fine only that for slick o thin hair doesn´t hold curls as I expect it..need to use a lot of product</li>
            <li> I could honestly not get a decent curl to form because of this...</li>
            <li> just a working mom trying to maintain some shred of beauty in the limited time I have to myself.</li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised to receive a small sample bottle of argan oil with it.</li>
            <li> Heats up well but clamp seems a bit loose.</li>
            <li> On a different brand of a previous curling iron, they had a button that you pressed until you got to the level of heat you wanted, and I never had a problem with that one.  </li>
            <li> It was above my expectations, one thing about it is that it does not hold tight</li>
            <li> I am a picky buyer and was extremely iffy about this product.</li>
            <li> My Hot Tools curling iron died a couple of weeks ago (and I&#x27;m not too sad about that...</li>
            <li> I may return it due to no auto shut off because I am very forgetful.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to not twist the cord and hadn&#x27;t dropped the iron or anything else you can think of.</li>
            <li> I figured it was a minor issue and not worth the trouble returning it.</li>
            <li> often accidentally turn the temp up and down while it&#x27;s in use.  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t think this was of any importance until I read reviews on other irons that were missing this feature...</li>
            <li> After less than 3 months of use, it doesn&#x27;t stay turned on anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> infused (I understand the idea but am not real sure how an oil infused iron stays infused with oil...</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and this curling iron makes my hair look  voluminous.</li>
            <li> The clamp isn&#x27;t tight - I like this because if you&#x27;re using an iron with this barrel size you&#x27;re not looking to get tight curls; so this aids in twirling.</li>
            <li> However, because of this, the curls are a little looser...</li>
            <li> What a let down !</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even waste your time with the Babyliss Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time even giving this sucker a chance.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the temp gets adjusted on accident due to poor placement, but I would still purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have base of neck/shoulder length african american hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and they always last at least 18 months before the heating element starts to fail.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep hair in curling iron.</li>
            <li> so it was hard to know what to buy.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because the dial for the heat setting is in an inconvenient place on the handle where I keep bumping it with my thumb and have to keep resetting it to the desired temp.</li>
            <li> Maybe it loses temperature after attempting to curl the hair.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to have caused any, or at least any visible damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Well....this iron is a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use the curling iron every day because I was still on the fence on how well it even curled my thin-medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> maybe because I have thin silky hair....</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li> And last...the positioning of the temperature dial is very unfortunate because while in use, one does tend to inadvertently adjust down the temp setting making if somewhat useless until you re-adjust it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Argan oil given is very very less :(</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron even after reading a couple of mediocre reviews because it had all the features I wanted.</li>
            <li> It is very poor placement of the dial.  </li>
            <li> it was very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Now the bad....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read the other reviews on here and thought I&#x27;d still take a chance on this because I love all argan products so why wouldn&#x27;t I love a curling iron made by them? Immediately, I noticed the clip problem that another person on here mentioned about--how your hair will just slip through because the clamp does not hold the hair properly. I figured it was a minor issue and not worth the trouble returning it. Now, let me make this clear: I take VERY good care of my curling irons and my last one held out for an eternity (Helen of Troy) before kicking the bucket. I was very careful to not twist the cord and hadn&#x27;t dropped the iron or anything else you can think of. I didn&#x27;t even use the curling iron every day because I was still on the fence on how well it even curled my thin-medium thick hair. 3-4 weeks go by and suddenly, I go to turn it on and nothing happens. I figured it was a fluke and tried several different outlets before telling myself I&#x27;ll just try again tomorrow. Obviously, giving it a 24 hour break did nothing to help and Amazon took it back and refunded me immediately (no questions asked, they&#x27;re awesome!). I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time even giving this sucker a chance. I went back and purchase a 1 1/4 barrel titanium Helen of Troy and I&#x27;m happy again, sometimes new isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> This is the 1 st time using a larger barrel curling iron.  The curls are smooth and hold up for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because it said \\&quot;Argan Heat\\&quot; and I like Argan oil.  The curling iron itself is very good, and I think it gives good volume. I was also pleased to see that they included a tiny bottle of Argan oil with the curling iron. The only thing that I wish they had thought out better is the heat setting dial which they placed on the handle of the curling iron.  Every time that I twist the barrel as I&#x27;m curling my hair, my hand accidentally hits the dial and turns it, too!  I&#x27;m always having to re-adjust the heat setting after I&#x27;ve accidentally moved it as a result of turning the handle of the iron while I&#x27;m curling.  It is very poor placement of the dial.  They should have put it elsewhere on the handle OR used a different type of heat level element.  On a different brand of a previous curling iron, they had a button that you pressed until you got to the level of heat you wanted, and I never had a problem with that one.  This dial is sub-standard for such a nice curling iron, and I hope the manufacturer takes note and changes and improves it in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The Mechanics*&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the iron itself. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made and is solid in your hand (has a decent weight to it). The tip is general cool to the touch when in use but be sure to watch your finger tips! The swivel cord ensures unhindered curling. There is a built in stand - so you don&#x27;t burn up your counter. The clamp isn&#x27;t tight - I like this because if you&#x27;re using an iron with this barrel size you&#x27;re not looking to get tight curls; so this aids in twirling. My only gripe is the temp control dial. It clicks between heat settings but can be changed during styling pretty easy. This isn&#x27;t that big of a deal since it can be changed back with ease. It heats up fairly quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Use*&lt;br /&gt;Remember always use some sort of heat protectant in your hair when using a heat appliance. I don&#x27;t care how fine or resistent your hair is ; in order to keep damage at bay/prevent it use a good heat protectant!. I have base of neck/shoulder length african american hair. I was having trouble with my ends/lifting my roots when wearing straight styles. They looked blah so I wanted to try something new rather than roasting it with a flat iron all the day. The 1 1/4\\&quot; barrel is great to acheive body, volume, soft waves, lift and smooth ends. It comes with a mini argan oil sample which I used the first time - didn&#x27;t really see a major result but it didn&#x27;t hurt. As far as it being infused with argan oil, I can&#x27;t tell. It glides well through hair without catching or crimping. My results after I use this iron are always great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Care*&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to clean after use - of course after it has cooled a bit. I like to use a wet cloth while it is warm to ensure all product is removed. This also prevents the burnt hair smell from infiltrating your follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone looking to achieve smooth results. Remember the bigger the barrel the looser the curl.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase of this curling iron.  I love the smoothness of the barrel.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, the hair glides right over it, and comes out with a smooth curl.  I was also pleasantly surprised to receive a small sample bottle of argan oil with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently after my original curling iron died out. I am a picky buyer and was extremely iffy about this product. I was wrong! I have thick long hair and this curling iron makes my hair look  voluminous. I tease my hair and work this curling iron on the ends and it makes my hair look gorgeous. I am glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves a mark on hair where you placed the iron.</li>
            <li> Great product! Heats up fast and evenly. Feels like the iron is more gentle on my hair than other curling irons on the market. Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because the dial for the heat setting is in an inconvenient place on the handle where I keep bumping it with my thumb and have to keep resetting it to the desired temp.</li>
            <li> Curl didn&#x27;t even last a minute.. Even after using it with hairspray... What a let down ! I don&#x27;t get how this curler got so many good reviews because it sucks</li>
            <li> It was above my expectations, one thing about it is that it does not hold tight but it still gets the job done. Heat is perfect and the quality is good. It takes just a second to heat and use/</li>
            <li> This was an upgrade for me from my standard Con-Air curling iron.  I really like it.  Sometimes the temp gets adjusted on accident due to poor placement, but I would still purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron after choosing it from some quick research. It heats up quick, the ceramic barrel keeps hair from frizzing and my once, none holding, completely straight thin hair stays curled to bedtime! A couple things to note from my use.... 1) the tip of the barrel doesn&#x27;t have alot of room for my fingers and have sizzled my pointer a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;2) there isn&#x27;t a temperature button, so you never know how hot you are turning it up. I&#x27;m not a fan of completely frying my hair, so would be nice to know.&lt;br /&gt;3) I haven&#x27;t noticed an automatic shut off. That feature is always nice for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;These downsides aren&#x27;t deal breakers and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the coating on this curling iron surface. It came with a tiny bottle of argan oil, which smells really good, but is not new to me as I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for several months now, but nonetheless I like it. It gets hot very quickly, and though it says fine hair only needs a heat setting of 10, I crank this baby up to 25 (out of 30) because my hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl. Another great thing is that the kickstand doesn&#x27;t get hot, so your fingers don&#x27;t get burned when you swivel it out of the way. Part of the plastic tip on the end closest to the metal gets a little too hot but I&#x27;ve been able to adjust to that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this one when my basic Conair died of old age.</li>
            <li> The best curling irons I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep hair in curling iron. Doesn&#x27;t keep curl.  Seems like it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Maybe it loses temperature after attempting to curl the hair. Didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon but from Sallys. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Gives amazing curls , packing was ok nothing great and product reached safely. Argan oil given is very very less :(</li>
            <li> Gotta Love A Good Curl I dont even have to turn it up high an risk burning my hair this curler is amazing....and if your like me with bone straight hair an can&#x27;t hold a curl this curler is for you! SERIOUSLY! ♡♡♡♡</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and heat up very fast. I can finish it with in 10 minutes especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> This iron works very well for me.  It curls my hair quickly and the curls last longer than when I use other curling irons.  It does not seem to have caused any, or at least any visible damage to my hair.  I use it about 3 times a week.  I didn&#x27;t care much for the argan oil that came with the iron.  It&#x27;s not bad, just not pure argan oil.  I purchased auria cacia argan oil, which I love.</li>
            <li> Easy to burn yourself if you&#x27;re not careful - That being said - It does what it&#x27;s meant to do.  It curls my hair with ease.  Just be warned - This puppy gets HOT !!!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, really well at that. Curls last for a long time. And my hair does not look fried! But shinny and glossy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that satisfied...maybe because I have thin silky hair....my hair falls out immediately and no matter how long I curled it...it only only produce wavy ends....anyways....maybe it would work for others but not for me....</li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for 3 months.I love it! I have long thick/fine hair. This iron doesn&#x27;t pull or snag the hair, is quick to heat up, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried after. The heat dial goes up to 30, and the booklet that comes with it lets you know what heat temperature corresponds with each number on the dial.I notice my hair is softer after use, much more so than with the drugstore bought curling irons I have had before.</li>
            <li> After less than 3 months of use, it doesn&#x27;t stay turned on anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and they always last at least 18 months before the heating element starts to fail. Makes me wonder if I received a new item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller won&#x27;t take returns. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Used it once and it worked great, thus the reason for the one star.  Went to use it again and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  That&#x27;s right....once.  If you are looking for a curling iron to use one time and then you don&#x27;t need it anymore, then this is the curling iron for you!!  If you want to use it more than once, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! It heats up fast, and leaves my hair nice and smooth. The barrel size is just right for loose curls. It&#x27;s the best curling iron I own.</li>
            <li> the curling is fine only that for slick o thin hair doesn´t hold curls as I expect it..need to use a lot of product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a beautician or beauty blogger...just a working mom trying to maintain some shred of beauty in the limited time I have to myself. ;). This curling iron is near perfect.  My Hot Tools curling iron died a couple of weeks ago (and I&#x27;m not too sad about that... aside from other problems, it never got hot enough, ironically), so I started scouring amazon for something new.  Hot Tools has the market on mid-priced tools...so it was hard to know what to buy.  I really like this one by babyliss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;*heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;*gets very hot (dial goes up to a 30, and though that might not tell you a whole lot, a 23 is hot enough for my wavy, unruly hair and my old Hot Tools NEVER was hot enough, though it is supposed to be 430 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;*ceramic&lt;br /&gt;*argon infused (I understand the idea but am not real sure how an oil infused iron stays infused with oil...)&lt;br /&gt;* leaves a super shine in your hair&lt;br /&gt;*comes with a tiny bottle of argon oil&lt;br /&gt;*very wide/long clamp for your thumb&lt;br /&gt;*big enough tip cover to protect your hand from getting burned (I didn&#x27;t think this was of any importance until I read reviews on other irons that were missing this feature...so I paid attention this week to how often I touch the end...it&#x27;s more frequently than I thought.  Clearly it&#x27;s a necessity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;*clamp isn&#x27;t very secure (This is better than having it too tight because it won&#x27;t pull your hair, but when doing barrel rolls, I almost don&#x27;t even need to release my hair as i rotate the iron.  My hair just slides out of it at first, all on its own. However, because of this, the curls are a little looser...which I actually like...so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.  But it might be for you.)&lt;br /&gt;*button is easily shut off while I use due to positioning, but now that I&#x27;m aware, I pay more attention to it and it doesn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;*I often accidentally turn the temp up and down while it&#x27;s in use.  As I twirl it, my fingers accidentally turn the temp knob on the side.  This is a pain, but it might only happen because I am left handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great buy for the money!  I&#x27;m very happy with it and so many people have noticed my hair since having bought it.</li>
            <li> Heats up well but clamp seems a bit loose.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after a store-bought one died on the second use.  This one works well for my 11-year old daughter.  She is Asian and has very think and straight black hair.  The curling iron curls her hair just fine... and it continues to work!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, and it is great!  The heat is consistent, and curls my hair really well.  I have fine hair, and I set it to a 20.  It is easy to use and the cool tip is helpful.  I would recommend this to people of all hair types.  Great value!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron even after reading a couple of mediocre reviews because it had all the features I wanted. I have found this to be a very good iron and have not had any of the negative issues. Even with my thick, coarse, and unruly hair I have found the tension on the spring to be just fine, and the location of the controls have not been an issue. I would have no reservation recommending this to a friend.</li>
            <li> It works okay but I&#x27;ve already forgot to turn if off twice and it doesn&#x27;t have auto shut off which is a huge disappointment because I am used to my old curling iron and not worrying if I turned it off. I may return it due to no auto shut off because I am very forgetful.</li>
            <li> But I wished it had an auto-turn off. With my busy life, I&#x27;ve come home discovering I left it on..freaked out! Wondering what could&#x27;ve happened!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is easy to use and feels good in the hand.  The only reason for the 4 star rating is the hair does slide out a little too easily, but that does prevent any breakage.  Nice product and does leave hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> I ordered this curling iron to replace my Hot Tools iron I have had for 8 years.  I thought I would give this one a try because I LOVE all of the &amp;#34;One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil&amp;#34; hair products.  Well....this iron is a big disappointment.  It heats up really quick which is about the only good thing I can say about it.  Now the bad....The clamp mechanism is nowhere near firm enough to hole the hair in place while using the iron.  I could honestly not get a decent curl to form because of this...it was very frustrating.  The tip grip, which is a very important part of the design and usage of this very hot iron, is way to small, thus leading to burning my fingers over and over.  And last...the positioning of the temperature dial is very unfortunate because while in use, one does tend to inadvertently adjust down the temp setting making if somewhat useless until you re-adjust it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent this iron back and ordered the Hot Tools Pink Titanium Curling Iron which is very similar to the one I was replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See it here.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BAT11G/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This arrived today and I am so pleased with my purchase.  There is just no compare quality wise. This iron is just so well made....don&#x27;t even waste your time with the Babyliss Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
            <li> I would have never thought that a curling iron could be so different in the way it styles from similar curling irons. I always bought ceramic plated irons and was absolutely amazed at how awesome this iron is! I only have to have it in my hair for a short amount of time as compared to other irons (at the same heat setting) to make it curl and it lasts all day. I haven&#x27;t noticed the slickness of the handle like others mentioned, but I agree that they need to move the heat setting dial, I&#x27;m constantly moving it while curling my hair. That is the only drawback though and I&#x27;ll gladly take it because I feel like I found a secret to beautiful hair! I realize I sound a bit over the top, but this really is a great curling iron and really not much more than a drugstore one.</li>
