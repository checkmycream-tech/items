            <li>LIKED THAT</li>
            <li>I then decided to switch to a natural dandruff shampoo and this was the best one that I found.</li>
            <li>i was just kind of hoping it would be more of a cure than continuing maintenance.</li>
            <li>it really makes you feel good!</li>
            <li>Thanks Giovanni for making the best organic cruelty free shampoo out there.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best shampoos for oily scalps and it will not dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I got the big bottle of this shampoo at Costco, and thought to myself: \\&quot;This is awesome.</li>

            <li>I love the way it feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li>as I condition wash more than I shampoo wash</li>
            <li>bought this product on Amazon under the impression that this would be a mostly organic product.  </li>
            <li>Love it love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Triple Threat Shampoo.  </li>

            <li>perfect for dry hair</li>
            <li>I love that this product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Giovanni makes great natural haircare products.</li>
            <li>Smells great hair so soft</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and Herbal Essenses Drama Clean.</li>
            <li>It is good for people who are transitioning from relaxed to natural hair because it is sulfate free!</li>
            <li>The smell is very light and minty, love it very much.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair which can be quite brittle at times.</li>
            <li>this fine hair..</li>
            <li>I HAVE FINE, GRAY HAIR</li>
            <li>It makes lots of suds, which surprised me, and you do smell the peppermint, which is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it so much on my hair and scalp, I started using it as a body wash - it gives my body a refreshing tingle!</li>
            <li>It is sulfste free.</li>
            <li>All of their shampoos are free of any parabens, phthalates, SLS, or petrochemicals.</li>
            <li>Anyway,  what it has is a great peppermint fragrance which totally masks</li>
            <li>Iovd the tingle that it gives my head when I am washing my hair, it also has such a great smell</li>
            <li>As far as ingredients in shampoo go, this is fairly benign.  </li>
            <li>I WAS CONCERNED AT FIRST, BECAUSE THOUGH I LOVE TEA TREE PRODUCTS, I AM ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCENT.  </li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, is pretty drying to my hair.</li>
            <li>However my hair is very fine and straight</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and made my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have to use a lot for my hair to feel really clean...</li>
            <li>I used this product for almost a full 4 months.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and am glad I have a way of obtaining it.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I would because I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>But I also have been using it for many years when my hair was normal and even during a time when I colored it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good for my oily scalp and dry ends.  </li>
            <li>This is the 4th conditioner (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE this tea tree shampoo until they changed the color from clear to amber and the fragrance is now a medicinal odor.  </li>
            <li>This natural shampoo makes washing my hair a much more invigorating experience.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is the bomb, you can feel it working right away.</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my scalp feeling cool, clean, &amp; refreshed!</li>
            <li>It really does clean the hair very well.</li>
            <li>Just used this shampoo for the first time today.</li>
            <li>The organic ingredients DO NOT come first.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for years and it consistently cleans without leaving residue.</li>
            <li>Waited a few weeks of using this shampoo to give it a fair rating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuing to alternate using this shampoo with my regular conditioning shampoo as it feels and smells really good.</li>
            <li>or I wouldn&#x27;t be able to comb through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tea tree shampoo is very invigorating and will leave your hair feeling super clean and super soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m thinking that a shampoo with only tea tree oil, rather than being a \\&quot;triple treat,\\&quot; might work better for my particular problem.  </li>
            <li>soft&amp;#34;- basically it&#x27;s super soft but it doesn&#x27;t have any hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just perfect for my old grey dried out hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t, really.  </li>
            <li>It derives its antimicrobial properties not from grapefruit seed, but from toxic chemicals, primarily benzethonium chloride, and to a lesser extent from triclosan and parabens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it too.</li>
            <li>I really like how this product makes my scalp tingle.  </li>
            <li>but it really invigorates my scalp</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>the tea tree oil sent and it&#x27;s very uplifting and invigorating as a scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really cleans your hair well</li>
            <li>I just use the shampoo because I have very \\&quot;thin\\&quot; hair</li>
            <li>AND IT LEAVES IT SOFT AND MANAGABLE!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The point is, though, that the other shampoos that have all the chemicals in them don&#x27;t seem to be any better.</li>
            <li>i was interested in it because it is natural.</li>
            <li>It smelled good, made my scalp feel fresh and tingly when I used it, but it left my hair really dry (for me, dry &#x3D; frizzy).</li>
            <li>When I order again I just hope the lid is taped down better as it had leaked in the bag</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to say that this is now my favorite shampoo, hands down.  </li>
            <li>I have very greasy hair easily &amp; this stuff allows me to wash it every other day or even every two days depending on if I straightened it or not.</li>
            <li>It is a skin sensitizer made of highly processed synthetic chemicals.</li>
            <li>(I also highly recommend the Giovanni Tea Tree Conditioner).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and do leave it in for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I am able to buy these on amazon for less that I can purchase from my local Whole Foods Store.</li>
            <li>I first bought this shampoo at SaSa Beauty Shop in Hong Kong to later discover that it&#x27;s from the States.  </li>
            <li>IT GETS MY HAIR CLEAN AND DOESN&#x27;T DRY OUT MY SCALP!!!</li>
            <li>Just because it is derived from coconuts doesn&#x27;t make this a natural ingredient.</li>
            <li>However, I still have a few light flakes from time to time in spite of always messaging it into the scalp and allowing it to sit for a minute, thus the 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>hair feels very flat too- more than usual.</li>
            <li>Anytime you see something that is hydrolyzed there is a hidden source of MSG that is absorbed into your bloodstream when it comes in contact with your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To all African american women who are going natural, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Grapefruit fresh, with a little zing.</li>
            <li>iy is a little on the dry side and fine.</li>
            <li>great for an itchy scalp but the conditioner knotted my hair so badly</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and my scalp is no longer red and inflamed.  </li>
            <li>I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean and the tangles can easily be removed by running my fingers through or with a brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very minty and slightly tingly and for girls and boys.  </li>
            <li>I use it every other day now, every day seemed to dry my scalp out too much.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It really cleans your hair well</li>
            <li> I just use the shampoo because I have very \\&quot;thin\\&quot; hair</li>
            <li> AND IT LEAVES IT SOFT AND MANAGABLE!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The point is, though, that the other shampoos that have all the chemicals in them don&#x27;t seem to be any better.</li>
            <li> i was interested in it because it is natural.</li>
            <li> It smelled good, made my scalp feel fresh and tingly when I used it, but it left my hair really dry (for me, dry &#x3D; frizzy).</li>
            <li> When I order again I just hope the lid is taped down better as it had leaked in the bag</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say that this is now my favorite shampoo, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I have very greasy hair easily &amp; this stuff allows me to wash it every other day or even every two days depending on if I straightened it or not.</li>
            <li> It is a skin sensitizer made of highly processed synthetic chemicals.</li>
            <li> (I also highly recommend the Giovanni Tea Tree Conditioner).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and do leave it in for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am able to buy these on amazon for less that I can purchase from my local Whole Foods Store.</li>
            <li> I first bought this shampoo at SaSa Beauty Shop in Hong Kong to later discover that it&#x27;s from the States.  </li>
            <li> IT GETS MY HAIR CLEAN AND DOESN&#x27;T DRY OUT MY SCALP!!!</li>
            <li> Just because it is derived from coconuts doesn&#x27;t make this a natural ingredient.</li>
            <li> However, I still have a few light flakes from time to time in spite of always messaging it into the scalp and allowing it to sit for a minute, thus the 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> hair feels very flat too- more than usual.</li>
            <li> Anytime you see something that is hydrolyzed there is a hidden source of MSG that is absorbed into your bloodstream when it comes in contact with your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To all African american women who are going natural, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Grapefruit fresh, with a little zing.</li>
            <li> iy is a little on the dry side and fine.</li>
            <li> great for an itchy scalp but the conditioner knotted my hair so badly</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and my scalp is no longer red and inflamed.  </li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean and the tangles can easily be removed by running my fingers through or with a brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very minty and slightly tingly and for girls and boys.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day now, every day seemed to dry my scalp out too much.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t really last all that long</li>
            <li> I LOVE the cold feeling cooly feeling it gives.</li>
            <li> i was hoping it would be the cure that I have long sought.</li>
            <li> There are other products that work better--such as a simple rinse with apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> so I went on-line and started researching shampoos/conditioners for dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> My dry flaky scalp is clearing up</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to try it for a dry scalp / flaking / itching problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps the dry scalp under control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the shipping to send them back.</li>
            <li> In fact, since I only wash my hair with shampoo once a week, I find it to be a bit harsh.  </li>
            <li> It detangles my long hair and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It cleans thoroughly and has a subtle natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> Sulfate-free shampoos are not supposed to lather as much as other shampoos, but it cleans just as well.</li>
            <li> It is toxic to the immune system and can cause dermatitis and other allergic reactions.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> My opthamologist suggested I use a tea tree oil face wash and shampoo to help with a skin issue I was having due to an eye infection (all cleared up now).</li>
            <li> also use the shampoo as body wash and my pimples and other irritated spots are gone.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending so much money on 8.5 oz of shampoo, but I wanted to try something sulfate-free for once.  </li>
            <li> I ended up watering down my shampoo</li>
            <li> Studies have shown that several major cosmetic companies are using floral waters, hydrosols and other organic \\&quot;infusions\\&quot; to artificially inflate the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; content of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling like shampoo, which is disappointing, but shows that the ingredients are pure.</li>
            <li> There are botanicals down the list but the chemicals outweigh them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon!</li>
            <li> had me get ketoconazole shampoo which only inflamed my scalp even worse.  </li>
            <li> Boy did I waste my money.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes.</li>
            <li> The fragrance by itself makes you want to use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I suffer from an extremely dry, itchy scalp and it&#x27;s been even worse lately.</li>
            <li> I was using Head and Shoulders which leaves a heavy sticky residue and makes your hair very dry and tangled like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my fiance to try, and he said he hated how his hair got all dry and heavy.</li>
            <li> sorry to write  a negative review, should always listen to what customers are evaluating.  </li>
            <li> I guess I was fooled by false advertising.</li>
            <li> It feel very dirty and heavy as soon as I was out of the shower.</li>
            <li> They might be expensive but they are fully organic and your hair will appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 2-3 days to prevent breakage and frizzing, but this can lead to oily hair if using the wrong product.</li>
            <li> This also works with the Curly Girl Method, and is one of the cheaper shampoos that don&#x27;t have scary ingredients.  </li>
            <li> terrible product, beware it will dry your hair after one shampoo.</li>
            <li> it sucks, I hate it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tea Tree Oil shampoos in the past and HATED the way they stripped my hair.</li>
            <li> There is nothing bad about the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had been using that Wen Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner, and was soooo disappointed with it...</li>
            <li> (sorry, but who does?!!)  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was hoping for tea tree smell and qualities... but it smells and feels like there are a lot of mint in there...do not smell like a tea tree and I hope it has tea tree qualities and will work for me</li>
            <li> Waited a few weeks of using this shampoo to give it a fair rating.  I have hair loss from foliculitis and dermatologist had me get ketoconazole shampoo which only inflamed my scalp even worse.  Have been trying a lot of shampoos and my scalp has stayed sore and red.  I love this shampoo and do leave it in for a few minutes.  I have color treated hair and haven&#x27;t noticed any color change.  My hair is soft and my scalp is no longer red and inflamed.  When I order again I just hope the lid is taped down better as it had leaked in the bag they had it in.  Will be reordering!</li>
            <li> Just used this shampoo for the first time today. I suffer from an extremely dry, itchy scalp and it&#x27;s been even worse lately. This shampoo left my scalp feeling cool, clean, &amp; refreshed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I bought it because it was suggested that tea tree oil would help my itchy scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t, really.  There are other products that work better--such as a simple rinse with apple cider vinegar.  I do appreciate that it&#x27;s an organic shampoo.  It makes lots of suds, which surprised me, and you do smell the peppermint, which is pleasant.  However, I&#x27;m thinking that a shampoo with only tea tree oil, rather than being a \\&quot;triple treat,\\&quot; might work better for my particular problem.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got the big bottle of this shampoo at Costco, and thought to myself: \\&quot;This is awesome. An ecofriendly shampoo at bulk price\\&quot;. Boy did I waste my money. Apart from it smelling minty good, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. It feel very dirty and heavy as soon as I was out of the shower. Like I had a lot of residue. Before I threw it away I gave it to my fiance to try, and he said he hated how his hair got all dry and heavy. He gave it back and I ended up throwing it away. My recommendation if you want an organic/natural shampoo and conditioner that actually works get John Masters Organics. They might be expensive but they are fully organic and your hair will appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending so much money on 8.5 oz of shampoo, but I wanted to try something sulfate-free for once.  Sulfate-free shampoos are not supposed to lather as much as other shampoos, but it cleans just as well. In fact, since I only wash my hair with shampoo once a week, I find it to be a bit harsh.  I ended up watering down my shampoo and it still works just as great. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> perfect for dry hair and I love the way this shampoo smells - I feel like I&#x27;m coming out of the spa after using this.</li>
            <li> Going Organic Isn&#x27;t Always a Fool-Proof Way to Avoid Chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic products do not fall under any regulations so use caution when purchasing these products. Studies have shown that several major cosmetic companies are using floral waters, hydrosols and other organic \\&quot;infusions\\&quot; to artificially inflate the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; content of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shopping for organic shampoos there are specific ingredients that shouldn&#x27;t be on the shampoo label. These are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  **Grapefruit Seed Extract - Referred to as a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; preservative, studies have shown it is anything but. It derives its antimicrobial properties not from grapefruit seed, but from toxic chemicals, primarily benzethonium chloride, and to a lesser extent from triclosan and parabens.&lt;br /&gt;  **Cocamidopropyl Betaine - Just because it is derived from coconuts doesn&#x27;t make this a natural ingredient. It is a skin sensitizer made of highly processed synthetic chemicals. It is toxic to the immune system and can cause dermatitis and other allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;  Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein - Anytime you see something that is hydrolyzed there is a hidden source of MSG that is absorbed into your bloodstream when it comes in contact with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;  PEG - Studies have shown that any ingredient that contains PEG in its name can be contaminated with the cancer-causing chemical 1,4-dioxane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS SHAMPOO HAS TWO OF THOSE. Try another shampoo, thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love how it smells and that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients. I would definitely recommend. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling like shampoo, which is disappointing, but shows that the ingredients are pure.</li>
            <li> I had been using that Wen Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner, and was soooo disappointed with it...so I went on-line and started researching shampoos/conditioners for dry scalp issues. Jackpot! This shampoo is the bomb, you can feel it working right away. I found the best price was offered on Amazon. (I also highly recommend the Giovanni Tea Tree Conditioner).</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo on my hair. I love the tingle feeling that it gives you when you wash your hair with this product. It is good for people who are transitioning from relaxed to natural hair because it is sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost a full 4 months. It smelled good, made my scalp feel fresh and tingly when I used it, but it left my hair really dry (for me, dry &#x3D; frizzy). :/</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this shampoo, It cleans well and it is good for all hair types, I am xauxasian with 3b hair. iy is a little on the dry side and fine. I use henna and indigo to color my hair and this sjampoo is good at not dulling my color. It is sulfste free. I bought the conditioner with it this time and I really like it too. It detangles my long hair and does not weigh it down. I am able to buy these on amazon for less that I can purchase from my local Whole Foods Store.</li>
            <li> smells good.  makes scalp feel good.  happy with the product and will get more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I recently relocated from one city to another cross country and I can&#x27;t seem to find this shampoo in stores here so I ordered it online from Amazon. I tried others like it but they are just not the same. I really like this shampoo and am glad I have a way of obtaining it. It&#x27;s just perfect for my old grey dried out hair. But I also have been using it for many years when my hair was normal and even during a time when I colored it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a great all around shampoo and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> I was using DHS Dandruff Shampoo until I discovered that it contained both carcinogenic (cocamide dea) and immune system damaging (zinc pyrithione) ingredients.  I then decided to switch to a natural dandruff shampoo and this was the best one that I found. (J/A/S/O/N Tea Tree did not work well for me). However, I still have a few light flakes from time to time in spite of always messaging it into the scalp and allowing it to sit for a minute, thus the 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great. Scalp feels refreshed after each use.</li>
            <li> Love the minty feel, makes your scalp tingle and the cool air hits your head after a shower and it feels amazing. However my hair is very fine and straight and I feel like it feels &amp;#34;too soft&amp;#34;- basically it&#x27;s super soft but it doesn&#x27;t have any hold. hair feels very flat too- more than usual.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my scalp. And it smells wonderful. It reminds me of Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle shampoo. But because it&#x27;s a clarifying shampoo and I have kinky curly hair (4a hair), I only wash my hair with this once a month. To all African american women who are going natural, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th conditioner (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite. I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean and the tangles can easily be removed by running my fingers through or with a brush. By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean. This Tea Tree Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes. I love that this product is cruelty free. I recommend search around for a lower price on the internet (vitacost has great prices).</li>
            <li> My hair feels very nice when using this product. I have fine, curly hair which can be quite brittle at times. I wash my hair every 2-3 days to prevent breakage and frizzing, but this can lead to oily hair if using the wrong product. This product and the conditioner were very effective for my hair.</li>
            <li> the only shampoo I use&lt;br /&gt;for this fine hair..</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo-conditioner combo from Costco. initially I loved how my hair smelled and felt. But after a couple of washes i started noticing that it had started to suck the color and moisture out of my hair. I had my hair chemically straightened some time ago. My regular shampoo was over so thought of trying this when I saw it at Costco. Big mistake. I am going to return it... crappy product!!!!</li>
            <li> I DISCOVERED THIS SHAMPOO IN THE STORES, BUT THEY DISCONTINUED IT.  THEN I DISCOVERED IT AGAIN AND THEY RAISED THE PRICE, TWICE!!!  THEN I FOUND IT ON AMAZON, FOR A RESONABLE PRICE AND I WAS EXTATIC!!  THIS IS A GREAT SHAMPOO!!!  I HAVE FINE, GRAY HAIR AND IT LEAVES IT SOFT AND MANAGABLE!!!  IT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE ANY RESIDUE!!!  I WAS CONCERNED AT FIRST, BECAUSE THOUGH I LOVE TEA TREE PRODUCTS, I AM ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCENT.  THIS SHAMPOO DOESN&#x27;T HOLD THE TEA TREE SMELL IN MY HAIR.  IT GETS MY HAIR CLEAN AND DOESN&#x27;T DRY OUT MY SCALP!!!</li>
            <li> I like it as a daily daily shampoo. It&#x27;s mild and made my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product makes my scalp tingle.  I&#x27;ve used it only once as I condition wash more than I shampoo wash but it really invigorates my scalp and I like that alot.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE this tea tree shampoo until they changed the color from clear to amber and the fragrance is now a medicinal odor.  They told me they improved it, but I don&#x27;t find these changes improvements at all.  In fact I&#x27;ve changed to another brand of tea tree shampoo.  If they change it back I would use it again, but at this point it&#x27;s like using Listerene on my hair - ICK</li>
            <li> LOVED THE INVIGORATING FEEL ON MY SCALP. KEPT MY HAIR SHINING. LIKED THAT IT IS ORGANIC. WOULD BY AGAIN. THANKS</li>
            <li> If you have an oily scalp, this is the perfect shampoo for you.  I first bought this shampoo at SaSa Beauty Shop in Hong Kong to later discover that it&#x27;s from the States.  I was using Head and Shoulders which leaves a heavy sticky residue and makes your hair very dry and tangled like crazy.  This is one of the best shampoos for oily scalps and it will not dry out your hair. It is amazing and it&#x27;s worth trying!</li>
            <li> Giovanni makes great natural haircare products. All of their shampoos are free of any parabens, phthalates, SLS, or petrochemicals. This tea tree shampoo is very invigorating and will leave your hair feeling super clean and super soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> As far as ingredients in shampoo go, this is fairly benign.  This also works with the Curly Girl Method, and is one of the cheaper shampoos that don&#x27;t have scary ingredients.  Love!</li>
            <li> I like the lather, the fact it has Tea Tree oil, Eucalyptus Oli, and Rosemary extract in it, and it tingles. My dry flaky scalp is clearing up and I would purchase this product again. It even has a space age bottle, neat-0, LOL</li>
            <li> terrible product, beware it will dry your hair after one shampoo. sorry to write  a negative review, should always listen to what customers are evaluating.  would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, is pretty drying to my hair.</li>
            <li> great for an itchy scalp but the conditioner knotted my hair so badly i almost had to cut my hair!</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on this page are incomplete.  The organic ingredients DO NOT come first.  The peppermint is not even organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:  Aqua (Purified Water), Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Polysorbate 20, Phenoxyethanol, Menthol, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, *Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, *Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Oil, *Achillea Millefolium Extract, *Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, *Equisetum Arvense Extract, *Eucalyptus Globulus (Eucalyptus) Oil, *Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Leaf Extract, *Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, *Rosmarinus Officinalus (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, *Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, *Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract, *Tussilago Farfara (Coltsfoot) Flower Extract, *Urlica Diocia (Nettle) Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*USDA Certified Organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product on Amazon under the impression that this would be a mostly organic product.  I guess I was fooled by false advertising.</li>
            <li> This is great. My opthamologist suggested I use a tea tree oil face wash and shampoo to help with a skin issue I was having due to an eye infection (all cleared up now). I&#x27;m continuing to alternate using this shampoo with my regular conditioning shampoo as it feels and smells really good.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  Wasn&#x27;t sure I would because I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of tea tree oil. (sorry, but who does?!!)  Anyway,  what it has is a great peppermint fragrance which totally masks the tea tree oil sent and it&#x27;s very uplifting and invigorating as a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really cleans your hair well and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it.  I&#x27;m going to say that this is now my favorite shampoo, hands down.  Thanks Giovanni for making the best organic cruelty free shampoo out there.  Love it love it love it!!!!</li>
            <li> She has been looking for this for a while, I found it here and now she is happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Been using it for years and it consistently cleans without leaving residue. Grapefruit fresh, with a little zing.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t really last all that long and I feel like I have to use a lot for my hair to feel really clean...and I have short hair so that says something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Triple Threat Shampoo.  This natural shampoo makes washing my hair a much more invigorating experience.  The product thoroughly cleanses my hair without overdrying it.  As someone mentioned earlier, it makes a wonderful summertime shampoo.  I enjoy it so much on my hair and scalp, I started using it as a body wash - it gives my body a refreshing tingle!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and Herbal Essenses Drama Clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to try it for a dry scalp / flaking / itching problem. i was interested in it because it is natural. i was hoping it would be the cure that I have long sought. Here&#x27; s the deal...&lt;br /&gt;It keeps the dry scalp under control. It lathers up nicely, which is good because some dandruff shampoos do not. There is nothing bad about the shampoo. i was just kind of hoping it would be more of a cure than continuing maintenance. But that is not the fault of the shampoo I guess, as it was never stated to be a cure afaik. I do still get flakes though, if i shake my hair I can see them falling. it sucks, I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, though, that the other shampoos that have all the chemicals in them don&#x27;t seem to be any better. I hear the big one to watch out for is Sodium Laureth Sulfate.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It cleans thoroughly and has a subtle natural fragrance. Considering the quality, the price is quite good.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great! Left my hair smelling great! Iovd the tingle that it gives my head when I am washing my hair, it also has such a great smell it really makes you feel good!</li>
            <li> I read about a bug that lives in our pores - it swims in our oil. I also read we don&#x27;t NEED the bug so I started researching how to get rid of it (they did a study and 100% of the people had them - yuck!). Turns out Tea Tree Oil is the only thing that will kill them so I bought this shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried Tea Tree Oil shampoos in the past and HATED the way they stripped my hair. This doesn&#x27;t do that at all. I  do use the conditioner as well or I wouldn&#x27;t be able to comb through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the shampoo as body wash and my pimples and other irritated spots are gone. I highly recommend the shampoo and the conditioner. I use it every other day now, every day seemed to dry my scalp out too much.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!!  It&#x27;s very minty and slightly tingly and for girls and boys.  I use it and I&#x27;m girl and I love it!!!  My brother also likes it and the packaging is unisex.  This is good for my oily scalp and dry ends.  Not too clarifying or drying, not too greasy or moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The list says this:&lt;br /&gt;qua (Purified Water) With Certified Organic Tea Tree (Melaleuca Alternifolia) Oil, Certified Organic Peppermint (Mentha Piperita) Oil, Certified Organic Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus Officinalis) Oil, Certified Organic Rosemary (Rosmarinus Officinalis) Oil, Certified Organic Nettle (Urtica Dioica) Oil, Certified Organic Thyme (Thymus Vulgaris) Oil, Birch Leaf (Butela Alba) Oil, Certified Organic Chamomile (Anthemis Nobilus Flower), Certified Organic Clary (Salvia Sclarea), Certified Organic Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia), Certified Organic Coltsfoot Leaf (Tussilago Farfara), Certified Organic Yarrow (Achillea Millefolium) Oil, Certified Organic Mallow (Malva Sylvestris), Certified Organic Horsetail (Equisetum Arvense) Oil, Certified Organic Soybean Protein (Glycine Soja), C12-14 Olefin Sulfonate (Coconut Derived), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Trace Minerals, Citric Acid (Corn), Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Sodium Chloride (Sea Salt), Grapefruit Seed (Citrus Derived).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BOTTLE says this:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine... You get the idea.  There are botanicals down the list but the chemicals outweigh them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon! Make the seller correct the listing.  It&#x27;s not worth the shipping to send them back.</li>
            <li> I got this product and it&#x27;s great. It really does clean the hair very well. I have very greasy hair easily &amp; this stuff allows me to wash it every other day or even every two days depending on if I straightened it or not. I LOVE the cold feeling cooly feeling it gives. The smell is very light and minty, love it very much. I don&#x27;t use the conditioner I just use the shampoo because I have very \\&quot;thin\\&quot; hair but it works wonders &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair tangly either. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Smells great hair so soft</li>
            <li> The fragrance by itself makes you want to use this everyday!</li>
