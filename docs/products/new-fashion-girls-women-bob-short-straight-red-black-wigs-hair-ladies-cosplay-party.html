            <li>is too light.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is comfortable, realistic (unless you really look close), and good value for the money wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sheds a little when you first brush it, but otherwise, this wig is great!</li>
            <li>Very bulky and the stitching is noticeable on top.</li>
            <li>I got a light Carmal brown with Auburn highlights looks and feels very Natural and wears comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Fun wig.</li>
            <li>I get so much positive feedback on this wig!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely soft and does not seem like it will tangle easily.  </li>
            <li>Way more red hair than pictured.</li>
            <li>I just wish the top was as blended as the back.  </li>
            <li>, I love it, and I wear it more than my more expensive wig.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this wig to anyone interested in getting one.</li>
            <li>The cap part is lighter than the first one.  </li>
            <li>This wig is nice BUT not exactly as it appears.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Other than that,I really liked the wig.</li>
            <li>however, I did get positive feedback from people thinking it was real hair, ect.</li>
            <li>After buying some really crappy, halloween costumer quality wigs, I did not expect much from this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the day comes that my hair loss cannot be covered by my real hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well-made, though.</li>
            <li>Very comfy.  </li>
            <li>This product fits very well.</li>
            <li>I really like how the front bangs are cut.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable.</li>
            <li>looks more natural and feels natural and soft.</li>
            <li>Decent wig for the price</li>
            <li>I would say, the red has a little more pink in it than the photo shows, but it&#x27;s only noticeable in really bright sunlight.  </li>
            <li>The hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a pinkish red instead of a deep red like I was wanting.  </li>
            <li>The wig is pretty, the only problem I have with it is the part in the front.</li>
            <li>I brought this wig because I didn&#x27;t want to be committed to red highlights in my real hair.</li>
            <li>Omg it&#x27;s horrendous, like a very unnatural color red and the wig is for a smaller head.  </li>
            <li>Over the weekend while in the middle of a short hair trim with the clipper, I forgot to put the guard on and shaved a complete bald spot into my head.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little iffy about it</li>
            <li>It shed a little when I first brushed it out, but it has stayed together well.  </li>

            <li> This wig is nice BUT not exactly as it appears.&lt;br /&gt;The Red parts aren&#x27;t distributed thru the wig&lt;br /&gt;the same as in the pic. It&#x27;s more segregated.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was kind of crappy. They should&lt;br /&gt;send product in a small box vs a ziplock type&lt;br /&gt;bag.</li>

            <li> Made my head look square  Shaped. . Very bulky and the stitching is noticeable on top. Poorly made..waste of money</li>

            <li> Easy to maintain. Comfortable. A wig with some spirit. You would think I spent all day at the beauty salon!</li>
            <li> Omg it&#x27;s horrendous, like a very unnatural color red and the wig is for a smaller head.  I&#x27;m very unhappy by this purchase. Grrrrrr...</li>
            <li> After buying some really crappy, halloween costumer quality wigs, I did not expect much from this one.&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, it is as good as in the photo, my husband almost fell over when he saw me in it.&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable, realistic (unless you really look close), and good value for the money wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more wigs from this company</li>
            <li> Perfect for cos play and role-play surprisingly well made and good dollar value be prepared to straighten the wig before styling</li>
            <li> I have alopecia areata so I am buying wigs in case the day comes that my hair loss cannot be covered by my real hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the wig I was most excited about and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.  It&#x27;s extremely soft and does not seem like it will tangle easily.  The bangs are a great length for me and do not hang in my eyes.  The scalp part is a bit light and unnatural looking, but I may be able to fix that. I thought the reddish highlights were nicely distributed in mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the red highlights are not exactly red.  It&#x27;s more of a pinkish red instead of a deep red like I was wanting.  But that&#x27;s not enough for me to shelve this wig.  I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really big; not for a petite person like me. It&#x27;s very well-made, though.</li>
            <li> This piece is a little heavy compared to some of my wigs. but I love the look. received many comps.</li>
            <li> I get so much positive feedback on this wig!  Very comfy.  It shed a little when I first brushed it out, but it has stayed together well.  I think it&#x27;s super cute and sassy.  I just wish the top was as blended as the back.  The top has chunky highlights, but the rest is blended so perfectly.  It&#x27;s just a matter of taste.  Other than that, I love it, and I wear it more than my more expensive wig.</li>
            <li> I got a light Carmal brown with Auburn highlights looks and feels very Natural and wears comfortable.  I would recommend this wig to anyone interested in getting one. Mine is not the red and black but i love the carmal brown with Light Auburn highlights looks more natural and feels natural and soft. Its so pretty and looks great on me.</li>
            <li> Fun wig. Pretty good quality. With the price I paid, I do not expect this wig to last forever. Until then,I just knew this lovely wig will provides lots of fun time for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pushing seventy and my hair colour is similar.  The grey in my hair turns that color red and the rest is dark&lt;br /&gt;Brown and my style is close; but, I have thin hair and it takes so long to do.  To me it looks nothing like the wig.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a wig similar to this for a couple of years.  So glad to have found it again. People think it&#x27;s my hair........&lt;br /&gt;Probably because of my red hair.  The cap part is lighter than the first one.  You have to tighten the under strap&lt;br /&gt;In order to keep it on well.  And I guarantee that you&#x27;ll come across nobody who has it on. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is really cute.  It more anime looking than in the picture but I wore it to work and got lots of compliments.  The hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> This product fits very well. I forget I have it on. I really like how the front bangs are cut. I would buy another one of this product, different color of course.</li>
            <li> a little too bulky and I cut the bangs quite a bit.. however, I did get positive feedback from people thinking it was real hair, ect.</li>
            <li> I love this wig.  It&#x27;s super cute, has great coverage, and looks just like the pictures.  I would say, the red has a little more pink in it than the photo shows, but it&#x27;s only noticeable in really bright sunlight.  So, this is great for an office environment.  It sheds a little when you first brush it, but otherwise, this wig is great!</li>
            <li> I brought this wig because I didn&#x27;t want to be committed to red highlights in my real hair. The wig is pretty, the only problem I have with it is the part in the front. I have dark skin and the scalp color on the wig is too light. I will see if there is some way to not get that front hair part noticed. Other than that,I really liked the wig. Finally, I will start going to a wig shop for hair accessories.</li>
            <li> Over the weekend while in the middle of a short hair trim with the clipper, I forgot to put the guard on and shaved a complete bald spot into my head. Very noticeable. I immediately went to Amazon and began looking for wigs to arrive ASAP before my end of the week meetings. My package was tossed in the door, I ripped it open and VOILA! Instant hair! I absolutely love it and may even leave the house now.</li>
