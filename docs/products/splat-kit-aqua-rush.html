            <li>and I was really impressed.</li>
            <li>color Lusty Lavender is also a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>The color itself was beautiful</li>
            <li>Which is why it&#x27;s great for your hair.</li>
            <li>A happy accident.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Very smooth, very bright.</li>
            <li>It was a really bright red.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The color Aqua Rush looks like a gorgeous color, however, it does not stay.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Liked the way the color looked on the box</li>
            <li>Came damaged but still use able.</li>
            <li>I love the Splat dyes.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Splat for sure.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy meeting all of the people who admire my hair!  </li>
            <li>Washed out too quickly.</li>
            <li>3 stars because while it lasted it was VERY pretty</li>
            <li>I have switched to midnight blue sheets and towels, and bring my own when I travel.</li>
            <li>We often get comments on how great the colors look and how long they last!</li>
            <li>I take a hot shower I use a shower cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first week I carry toner and cotton balls in my purse to clean my neck, and I do not wear white if it is going to rain.</li>
            <li>We decided not to use the bleach with hers since she is still in high school and the color washed out while she was rinsing out the chemical dye!  </li>
            <li>After washing it out, I got a color that was nowhere near the color on the package, but pretty nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t turn out exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The only circumstances under which you will be pleased with this is if you don&#x27;t mind spending 1-2 hours for a dye that will last only one wash.</li>
            <li>Aqua is my favorite color, but doesn&#x27;t last, like the other shades.</li>
            <li>next day I went to a beauty supply store, and bought Panic Manic to cover up the mess that this left, which I am very pleased</li>
            <li>The only positive is it bleaches out</li>
            <li>use it on clean, slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li>If I take care of it, wash it in cold water, use a good shampoo for colored hair, and don&#x27;t overwash, I can keep the color vibrant for 2 months.</li>
            <li>After that, no other color will cover it without turning purple again, even orange.</li>
            <li>It completely covered the red!!!</li>
            <li>The next day I took a shower and it completely rinsed out, leaving my hair a green-tinged yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> For one you have to bleach your hair first, duh, if you want it to stay.</li>
            <li> overall it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have also learned to wash my hair in my laundry sink for the first few weeks,, which means a lot less cleanup.</li>
            <li> Bleaching it only turns it into a neon pink.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is grey, I do not bleach it, I just twist up a hank of hair, and coat it with the dye, to freshen up my color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an intense dye, and it does bleed less than other companies such as Raw.</li>
            <li> Contrary to directions I find it actually lasts longer if my hair is slightly damp.</li>
            <li> The product details did not say it was already partially used, the box was messed up, wet, and</li>
            <li> SOPPING WET CAUSE</li>
            <li> It came out completely blue with a few purple streaks.</li>
            <li> IT WILL STAIN YOU, and careful with the bleach it&#x27;ll torture your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it&#x27;d come out blue with a green tint to it, but as soon as I rinsed it out, it looked green with just a slight blue hue to it.</li>
            <li> After taking the time to prepare and bleach hair, then dye, was a bit disappointed that the hair color did not stay in more than a week.  </li>
            <li> Just got this the other day.</li>
            <li> In fact, I gave it 2 stars initially simply due to the dripping from the consistency of the dye.</li>
            <li> However, the finished product doesn&#x27;t compare to any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I find the Aqua washes out sooner than any of the other colors.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it on anything else, especially your skin, because it&#x27;s some serious business and immediately stains.</li>
            <li> ALL I HAVE IS THE LITTLE COLOR BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> I received this not in box showed but in a bag and the bleach bottle leaked destroying the bleach bottle and packet that came with kit</li>
            <li> This one takes to the hair and stays for a few washes.</li>
            <li> It lightened to a pale green within two weeks.</li>
            <li> When it does fade, which is quite fast, it is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I usually leave the Splat in overnight, and rinse it out in the morning.  </li>
            <li> She was extremely disappointed, and I felt really</li>
            <li> I leave it on overnight and sleep in a shower cap, then rinse it out the next morning with cold water and no shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the way how the color actually looked on my hair.</li>
            <li> if your serious about putting color in your hair get a bleacher and a bottle color.</li>
            <li> After bleaching part of my hair from an auburn color to an ugly yellow color, I applied the dye.  </li>
            <li> When washing it out, even with cold water and no soap, it doesnâ€™t take, except to stain some bits green.</li>
            <li> MAKING THE BLEACH USELESS.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the price I spent</li>
            <li> The bleach if you could call it that was so thin it refused to stay on my hair, and the color was twice as bad</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this purchase.</li>

            <li> My family have used Splat for years. We often get comments on how great the colors look and how long they last! We&#x27;ve done almost every color they have, sometimes mixing them. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d even consider another brand since Splat has proven to be so reliable. We will continue to use Splat for years to come!</li>
            <li> Came damaged but still use able. Color was very similar to picture!</li>
            <li> I got this at Walmart. 3 stars because while it lasted it was VERY pretty but I washed it twice and it was totally gone.</li>
            <li> The color Aqua Rush looks like a gorgeous color, however, it does not stay. When washing it out, even with cold water and no soap, it doesnâ€™t take, except to stain some bits green. The only positive is it bleaches out easily.&lt;br /&gt;The color Lusty Lavender is also a beautiful color. This one takes to the hair and stays for a few washes. When it does fade, which is quite fast, it is very difficult to remove. Bleaching it only turns it into a neon pink. After that, no other color will cover it without turning purple again, even orange.</li>
            <li> I KNOW THERES MORE EXPENSIVE STUFF ON AMAZON FOR CHRIST SAKE BUT I GOT IT IN THE MAIL SOPPING WET CAUSE THE OXIDE SPILLED ALL OVER. MAKING THE BLEACH USELESS. ALL I HAVE IS THE LITTLE COLOR BOTTLE. BUT I AM LEFT WITH MY ROOTS NOW. MY MAIL IS RUINED AND MY HANDS ITCH FROM IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT GET IT</li>
            <li> Unlike the darker blue, this isn&#x27;t runny at all. Very smooth, very bright. Be careful not to get it on anything else, especially your skin, because it&#x27;s some serious business and immediately stains. Which is why it&#x27;s great for your hair.</li>
            <li> After taking the time to prepare and bleach hair, then dye, was a bit disappointed that the hair color did not stay in more than a week.  Washed out too quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the Splat dyes. i use this one and the aqua and the emerald. If I take care of it, wash it in cold water, use a good shampoo for colored hair, and don&#x27;t overwash, I can keep the color vibrant for 2 months. After that it starts to fade a bit, but that is about when I redo my roots anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on clean, slightly damp hair. Contrary to directions I find it actually lasts longer if my hair is slightly damp. I leave it on overnight and sleep in a shower cap, then rinse it out the next morning with cold water and no shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I take a hot shower I use a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it stains everything. The first week I carry toner and cotton balls in my purse to clean my neck, and I do not wear white if it is going to rain. I have switched to midnight blue sheets and towels, and bring my own when I travel. I have also learned to wash my hair in my laundry sink for the first few weeks,, which means a lot less cleanup.</li>
            <li> Just got this the other day. Liked the way the color looked on the box but it didn&#x27;t turn out exactly the same. I was a little disappointed with the way how the color actually looked on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, it is goopy. In fact, I gave it 2 stars initially simply due to the dripping from the consistency of the dye. However, the finished product doesn&#x27;t compare to any other brand I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s such an intense dye, and it does bleed less than other companies such as Raw. Everyone keeps complimenting me on my hair. I will continue to use Splat for sure.</li>
            <li> The bleach if you could call it that was so thin it refused to stay on my hair, and the color was twice as bad it dripped the entire time. The color itself was beautiful but I ended up redoing it 2 weeks later with color n&#x27; rage purple. if your serious about putting color in your hair get a bleacher and a bottle color. I would have used Manic Panic if the store had the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> My sister and I bought to do as a sister bonding activity over spring break.  We decided not to use the bleach with hers since she is still in high school and the color washed out while she was rinsing out the chemical dye!  She was extremely disappointed, and I felt really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am in college I used the included bleach.  After bleaching part of my hair from an auburn color to an ugly yellow color, I applied the dye.  After washing it out, I got a color that was nowhere near the color on the package, but pretty nonetheless.  The next day I took a shower and it completely rinsed out, leaving my hair a green-tinged yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I went to a beauty supply store, and bought Panic Manic to cover up the mess that this left, which I am very pleased with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.  The only circumstances under which you will be pleased with this is if you don&#x27;t mind spending 1-2 hours for a dye that will last only one wash.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens and I was really impressed. I had bleached my hair and used a crimson red. It was a really bright red.&lt;br /&gt;Well I wanted to change it to purple, so I experimented and bought this aqua. It completely covered the red!!! It came out completely blue with a few purple streaks. A happy accident.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t stain your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> For one you have to bleach your hair first, duh, if you want it to stay. For two, if you want it to stay longer than a week or 2 you have to leave it in way longer than it says. Ive used this one, red, purple and others. The red stayed in my hair for a year no lie. I left the red in so long that it glowed in the sun. It looks amazing smells amazing. IT WILL STAIN YOU, and careful with the bleach it&#x27;ll torture your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it&#x27;d come out blue with a green tint to it, but as soon as I rinsed it out, it looked green with just a slight blue hue to it. It lightened to a pale green within two weeks.</li>
            <li> I am 53, I have used a combination of Aqua Rush, Blue Envy, and Lusty Lavender for a couple of years now.  I find the Aqua washes out sooner than any of the other colors.  Since my hair is grey, I do not bleach it, I just twist up a hank of hair, and coat it with the dye, to freshen up my color.  I usually leave the Splat in overnight, and rinse it out in the morning.  Shampoo sparingly.  I really enjoy meeting all of the people who admire my hair!  Aqua is my favorite color, but doesn&#x27;t last, like the other shades.</li>
