            <li>I think the mark of a good shampoo is one that doesn&#x27;t require you to use a conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fuller and has a good shine and softness.</li>
            <li>still if your loosing the good fight.</li>
            <li>Good interim shampoo to keep your hair in shape and stop the breakage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good, but chemical aroma gets in my eyes</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good and cleans good.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because ive been using the leave in spray conditioner from nexxus and loved it</li>

            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they still make this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Excellent  100 % positive</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Its an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say i have results.</li>
            <li>and I recomend because after I use the product my hair chance in good and is more thicker</li>
            <li>I decided to try this shampoo because my sister says it has helped with her own shedding issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my hair looks wonderful and smells very inviting.  </li>
            <li>My thinning hair has slowed, and the shampoo lathers well and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use only once or twice a week with a good condition and get great results!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my hair gets clean without a nice lather!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo I have used for my thinning hair,due to my age.  </li>
            <li>I do have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo by far the best shampoo I have ever</li>
            <li>But mine seems fine!</li>
            <li>Its a very light weight non-foaming shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised, because Nexxus has always been a very good product.</li>
            <li>and I love the product.  </li>
            <li>i think for shampoos it also has DHT inhibitors and think that biotin is better when taken orally as a vitamin supplement.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and in my opinion, \\&quot;IT</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>Love, love, love nexxus brand.</li>
            <li>I however do still use nexxus brand shampoo and conditioner to help keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t they add a better smell?</li>
            <li>Most shampoos, by themselves, are like that--needing conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>On top of this, I&#x27;ve also been using the Nexxus Biotin Scalp Creme, and even combined with that there has been no change in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going to order some more.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from Better Hair &amp; Beauty (through Amazon.com).</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the people at Better Hair &amp; Beauty were able to correct the USPS mistakes and I was able to get another shipment.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m sure this helps.</li>
            <li>I do see a thickness to my hair and better</li>
            <li>I read about it elsewhere and appreciate that it was available here, thank you!</li>
            <li>So I am going to reorder the product. :)</li>
            <li>I think the moracco oil I bought is better?</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li>service was very prompt and package arrived in great condition .i would do business with amazon again for sure .</li>
            <li>but I also don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Had much better results with CREW shampoo&#x27;s,</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo based on the many 5-star reviews on here.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>This really does a great job addressing both.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the product and received the package without any hassale.  </li>
            <li>Have used this shampoo and like the refreshing feeling I get from using it.</li>
            <li>Definitely thickens hair, delightful smell out of bottle with no lingering odor.</li>
            <li>My hair looks sooooo much better, healthier and thicker.</li>
            <li>What more would you like to know?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t want to lose more hair.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know that for sure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from hair loss since I was a teenager, meaning, for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>Also just makes hair look nicer, with more of a wave.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon should be able to confirm that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to stop my hair fall.</li>
            <li>I used it as suggested for more than 2 months</li>
            <li>I am using nioxin 2 system and Nioxin is better.</li>
            <li>Yes, I put conditioner on after shampooing, I use WEN cleansing cream as my conditioner (works great as a conditioner) and it takes care of the tangles, but I just don&#x27;t really like the feeling of the &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; it makes while shampooing.</li>
            <li>Sure wish I could return it, but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My hair was thinning alot and my hair now looks better and grows fuller than it did before.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo on my hair is okay</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this product because it made my hair fall more than it used to before..</li>
            <li>I will continue to use, it leaves my hair feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and clean , helped with breaking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of finding out what to do to combat hair-loss so finding a couple of good shampoos is my first goal.</li>
            <li>it works pretty good..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product.</li>
            <li>I lost my hair to Chemotherapy and after the regrowth began, the shampoo helped along with the Biotin caps to make my hair strong and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li>I feel my hair becoming stronger and fuller.</li>
            <li>I feels like it really gets inside of your hair, you need a really good conditioner to use along with this product.</li>
            <li>But its up there with the best that I can say.. Cleans with some fluff !</li>
            <li>Use daily if you want really good results!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had blood tests and am told everything is fine.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, the scent of the shampoo is not that great; it&#x27;s like sour vanilla, which I don&#x27;t find pleasant.</li>
            <li>Hair is dry after the wash, so a good conditioner is a must!</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my hair is growing beautifully!</li>
            <li>It is worth the money and just make sure you follow the directions..leave it in for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It suds up pretty good on the first &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34</li>
            <li>A good product so far.</li>
            <li>my hair super clean and puffy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this shampoo is helping with my thinning hair problem.</li>
            <li>i really love this shampoo ,it was the first time i used it .</li>
            <li>and I see a significant change in my hair loss.</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference the first time but the reall difference occurs the more you use it.</li>
            <li>When used as directed - massage into hair and scalp and let it stay there for 3 minutes before rinsing - the hair comes out literally &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really clean...</li>
            <li>When you use the shampoo and follow the directions of leaving it in 3 minutes (or longer), your hair will be squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>noticed nothing but clean hair.</li>
            <li>I believe over a longer course of time i will be full in my temple area.</li>
            <li>I started using this shampoo and it stopped reclining and my hair is full and</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll come back in a year or 2 and share my findings but, as of now, all I can say is that my hair looks and feels good after I wash it with Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Nice its not a waste of $$$</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Received openend took pictures and going to ask for full refund!!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to its full effect.</li>
            <li>Seems to really thicken things up, can&#x27;t see through the top of my head anymore.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>My brother and my dad are balding and I&#x27;ve got a receding line, but not nearly as bad as they&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>Once the hair dries, it feels significantly stronger and thicker and it looks significantly healthier and more alive than before the Biotin treatment.</li>
            <li>If you want clean fresh smelling hair you should try this product.</li>
            <li>Feel it does help with the tremendous amount of shedding.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to notice a difference this quick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if your looking for something to make your hair healthy and help with hair regrowth, it did for me.</li>
            <li>which is a huge change (and also a bit funny).</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for several years, and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am also taking Biotin supplements, but noticed a significant increase in gloss after the first use.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo last night and it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>Worth trying.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m a lot more conscious of what washes my hair now than I was 10 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additional facts worth sharing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I love it, it makes my hair shiny and silky soft.</li>
            <li>So far I love this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Of all the shampoo&#x27;s of this type I have purchased, this one is the only one that gave some results on its own</li>
            <li>Their dry shampoo is amazing ( just for anyone looking for a good dry shampoo)</li>
            <li>While more expensive, the Biotin shampoo appears to be the best so far for my hair - for some background, I have a full head of hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for the right product that does what it says</li>
            <li>Got it within a couple days and used it right away.</li>
            <li>Besides, the plastic around the bottle had a leak, and I didn&#x27;t feel that the impact of returning a leaking package was going to send the seller the right</li>
            <li>my hair definately feels REALLY squiky clean with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The little hairs have all grown longer and they look nice and strong.</li>
            <li>My hair had been thinning and I was in search of better products to add to a new healthy hair regimen to help me get my normal thickness back.</li>
            <li>I am positive this maybe the right path for me.</li>
            <li>I really think this is a great shampoo for those of us who have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Personally I like nioxin better</li>
            <li>Thanks Nexxus!</li>
            <li>I no longer use this product now that my hair had grown back out healthy.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 months and it works pretty well considering the price.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate their help!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well for what I can tell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this, I will say this along with the biotin and Grogonics has made a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m wondering who really wrote them, because this shampoo did not deliver on its promises whatsoever!</li>
            <li>I have normally healthy hair, again I only bought it to try to help growth and it did not do this.  </li>
            <li>Over and over I have been using this product since I brought my first one here on amazon ..</li>
            <li>and i am back to report that i do feel lots of volume and cleanliness for sure.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo for 5 days I stopped losing my hair, I just couldn&#x27;t believe the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Has helped with my thinning hair so much!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to fill out the first one since at that time</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>First, I purchased Spring Valley Biotin 5000mcg</li>
            <li>item was descibed exactly as it was in the description.</li>
            <li>Most of the shampoo gets washed out in the shower; it&#x27;s the leave-in conditioner that makes any lasting effects.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does make a difference on my hair when I used it consistently however,</li>
            <li>even I know that washing it doesn&#x27;t get all the biotin nutrients in the hair itself and essentially I&#x27;m just washing most of it away.  </li>
            <li>With this shampoo i see the difference, my hair is definately fluffy and the shampoo smells good unlike others with funky smell.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that this has a marked effect in making hair appear more full, especially in thin/sparse areas.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo, my hair was soft, but the only down fall is that the smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t the best!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look thicker pretty much after the first use.</li>
            <li>If your hair starts feeling dry, make sure you use lots of conditioner.</li>
            <li>It was easy &amp; simple, just how I like it.</li>
            <li>It has a similar scent that I remember from a couple of years before, but it is not as strong as before.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and am mixed.</li>
            <li>The Nexxus VitaTress Biotin shampoo was given me 2 years ago by a friend - I have since re-ordered twice for myself and  for family members as I have found it a real help with restoring strength and lustre to winter/dry hair.</li>
            <li>gives hair lots of volume, lathers up really well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s suppose to do this, but really does try my hair out.</li>
            <li>it basically makes your hair more sluggy and harder to comb..</li>
            <li>might want to try for some real stuff</li>
            <li>the price for this is reasonable...</li>
            <li>and I found it to provide a thorough, gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp and, when used as directed, hair feels stronger, thicker.</li>
            <li>but some money can be saved when ordering the available larger sizes - 33 oz.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Noticed not difference really.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have thinning but not thin hair.  </li>
            <li>My doctor says it&#x27;s probably stress, but I don&#x27;t lead a very stressful life.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has really helped my hair by adding volume and shine.</li>
            <li>I am using the shampoo together with the Nexxus VitaTress Vitamins for 2 months and it really makes in differences in terms of flexibility and even volume.</li>
            <li>VitaTress doesn&#x27;t really have a real conditioner no matter how they are labeled.</li>
            <li>It really gives a lot of volume on my hair.  </li>
            <li>really has made my hair thicker along with Biotin supplements</li>
            <li>and this is really helping, along with the dermaroller.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I really think it has helped my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000EVGOQY NEXXUS Vita Tress Biotin Shampoo Nutrient Rich Formulation for Fragile &amp; Thinning Hair 10.1oz/300ml]]</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today and wow!</li>
            <li>like with many other shampoos from the xyz superstore.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about when they said it smells great, literally it smells like very bitter medicine, must be the ginkgo biloba extract</li>
            <li>I am very hopeful that with use I will be able to see less hair loss.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, full of body, and not only feels thicker but looks thicker.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for over 15 years hard to find in stores has helped me save what hair I have left LOL</li>
            <li>This shampoo causes me to lose MORE hair (in a 24-our period) versus my sodium laurel sulfate-free (SLS-free) shampoo (which makes my hair look fuller and lose less of it in a 24-hour period).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would use less \\&quot;stars\\&quot; for the seller and more \\&quot;stars\\&quot; for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo in particular because my hair was thinning out from stress.</li>
            <li>It definitely creates a fuller feel but it doesn&#x27;t last all day and if joy don&#x27;t wash your hair the next day, it definitely won&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are experiencing this problem.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve quit using this product twice, pretty much because of having to order online, I tried Nioxin and other herbal stuff and my hair pretty much just fell out.  </li>
            <li>and I tell them it is not thick</li>
            <li>I was a bit expensive but a great product.  </li>
            <li>am buying again, because it makes my hair look really glossy and soft.</li>
            <li>I have a thinning area on top of my head and after using this shampoo for a few weeks</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to find out if it made my hair look any better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It does not have a normal &amp;#34;shampoo smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine african american hair.</li>
            <li>I an see new hair growth</li>
            <li>Color does take time to come in for new hair or you can die it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a change and started a new hair regimen which included using Nexxus VitaTress Biotin Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product causes new growth in hair</li>
            <li>I purchased a small bottle and 3 days ago I purchased the big bottle very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have not used this very many times due to the extreme tangling it causes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell amazing and not really a good shampoo</li>
            <li>, this is the first product that has actually made my hair seem fuller and stronger.  </li>
            <li>After a quick glance at her head, I did clearly notice many little tiny hair (about 1/4&amp;#34; long at the time) sprouting from her scalp.</li>
            <li>I had long hair and cut it short trying to growing back healthy.</li>
            <li>With this shampoo here in only two washes noticed less hair in hair pick and mostly on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Either I am a little nuts or this stuff works fantastic.</li>
            <li>This makes me stress less over my thinning hair, so the product is worth the money to me!</li>
            <li>I use it with JASON Natural Biotin Conditioner.</li>
            <li>After a hormone treatment, his dermatologist recommended a shampoo that contains Biotin since he&#x27;s too young to take a supplement.</li>
            <li>I do use this item along with Wild Hair</li>
            <li>It does make your hair soft, too soft for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every type of shampoo and nothing seems to work as far as hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using it because it made me self conscious</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and for me personally, I&#x27;m still losing as much hair as ever.  </li>
            <li>so it works well for natural ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>for my 56 year old mother who is experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li>I felt that my hair fell out even more and dried out what was left.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that soon it will get thick.</li>
            <li>So far he has been very lucky in the fact that it&#x27;s been small bald patches.</li>
            <li>My hair is REALLY straight and always looked like i used the flat iron on it</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>I used a hot iron on my hair before I started using this product so my hair was dry and damaged, and now I still use it and my hair looks like it never seen heat!</li>
            <li>Some hairs grew back transparent.... especially the first week.</li>
            <li>;, no real need to use a palm full or do a double &amp;#34;wash, rinse and repeat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have used other Biotin shampoo&#x27;s, but this is the first one where I have actually noticed the difference that fast.</li>
            <li>My hair is still normal thickness and only growing about 1/2&amp;#34; a month.</li>
            <li>and I have used the shampoo 4 times and my hair is back to normal.  </li>
            <li>My hair was feeling weighed down from other shampoos and falling out more than it ever had.</li>
            <li>while new hair growth did not increase significantly definitely stopped hair loss and brought a healthier look.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans it but doesn&#x27;t strip it and make it dry.</li>
            <li>I lost perhaps 2 tablespoons, not enough to send the whole thing back.</li>
            <li>The dermaroller has really helped in the patchy areas where the extensions ripped out my hair and is finally growing back.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the biotin will help with some hair loss from general anesthesia!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t thickened it and it hasn&#x27;t helped weak areas grow better.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use this long enough to determine if it worked to alleviate the symptoms of my stress induced hair loss because I was too impatient with the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to really dry out my scalp, more so than my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li>What I mean by this is that quantity-wise, I don&#x27;t have a lot of strands of hair on my head (and am losing more and more every day), but I wouldn&#x27;t say that my hair is thin in that each individual strand is not thin or fine, but it&#x27;s rather thick and coarse (Asian hair).  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this and will be purchasing the larger size next.</li>
            <li>&quot; The only problem is, it&#x27;s becoming kinda&#x27; hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use another brand at this point after going to other salon and big box-store brands with less satisfying results.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t really use it long enough to even try and see results.</li>
            <li>It really squeaks if you rub you hand on your wet hair, or it does so for me.</li>
            <li>and I will not go back to my old products.</li>
            <li>but this one left my hair soft but not greasy</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I had barely used it for a week or so.</li>
            <li>I care so much for my hair that I spent a lot on it.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my daughter who has chemical free thick, s-curl hair.</li>
            <li>I can feel the difference (which I think some people might experience as dryness because your hair does feel coarser), but I don&#x27;t really see a difference since my hair strands are already pretty thick to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Just little fuzzies right now,</li>
            <li>while getting your hair clean is the only thing i can say smells bad and did nothing for my thining hair prell works better</li>
            <li>i was having some breakage due to over highlighted hair ,this shampoo really helped my hair .the</li>
            <li>it makes the oils in my hair brittle, and weak, it doesn&#x27;t really make your hair grow, the shampoo smells weird, the product focus more on chemicals than oils, it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not due to damage or breakage; the entire strand falls out, root and all.  </li>
            <li>My thinning spots are less noticeable now thanks to this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made a difference for me in the past, but I never stuck to it for more than a few months.  </li>
            <li>My hair has grown a lot and this shampoo is just a added bonus and it feels super thick</li>
            <li>Super thick and gelatin like.</li>
            <li>The substance is super thick just from appearance and the smell...</li>
            <li>I can see this being beneficial to those with fine, thin hair, but it&#x27;s not helping with my hair fall issue.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning your hair,  a little expensive for that.</li>
            <li>Being an African American woman, my hair can be very unruly, but after only one use my roots felt smoother and my hair was a little softer.  </li>

            <li> Great shampoo for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say i have results.</li>
            <li> and I recomend because after I use the product my hair chance in good and is more thicker</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shampoo because my sister says it has helped with her own shedding issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my hair looks wonderful and smells very inviting.  </li>
            <li> My thinning hair has slowed, and the shampoo lathers well and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use only once or twice a week with a good condition and get great results!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like my hair gets clean without a nice lather!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have used for my thinning hair,due to my age.  </li>
            <li> I do have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo by far the best shampoo I have ever</li>
            <li> But mine seems fine!</li>
            <li> Its a very light weight non-foaming shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised, because Nexxus has always been a very good product.</li>
            <li> and I love the product.  </li>
            <li> i think for shampoos it also has DHT inhibitors and think that biotin is better when taken orally as a vitamin supplement.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and in my opinion, \\&quot;IT</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> Love, love, love nexxus brand.</li>
            <li> I however do still use nexxus brand shampoo and conditioner to help keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t they add a better smell?</li>
            <li> Most shampoos, by themselves, are like that--needing conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> On top of this, I&#x27;ve also been using the Nexxus Biotin Scalp Creme, and even combined with that there has been no change in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to order some more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Better Hair &amp; Beauty (through Amazon.com).</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the people at Better Hair &amp; Beauty were able to correct the USPS mistakes and I was able to get another shipment.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m sure this helps.</li>
            <li> I do see a thickness to my hair and better</li>
            <li> I read about it elsewhere and appreciate that it was available here, thank you!</li>
            <li> So I am going to reorder the product. :)</li>
            <li> I think the moracco oil I bought is better?</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> service was very prompt and package arrived in great condition .i would do business with amazon again for sure .</li>
            <li> but I also don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Had much better results with CREW shampoo&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo based on the many 5-star reviews on here.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job addressing both.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the product and received the package without any hassale.  </li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo and like the refreshing feeling I get from using it.</li>
            <li> Definitely thickens hair, delightful smell out of bottle with no lingering odor.</li>
            <li> My hair looks sooooo much better, healthier and thicker.</li>
            <li> What more would you like to know?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t want to lose more hair.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know that for sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from hair loss since I was a teenager, meaning, for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Also just makes hair look nicer, with more of a wave.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon should be able to confirm that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to stop my hair fall.</li>
            <li> I used it as suggested for more than 2 months</li>
            <li> I am using nioxin 2 system and Nioxin is better.</li>
            <li> Yes, I put conditioner on after shampooing, I use WEN cleansing cream as my conditioner (works great as a conditioner) and it takes care of the tangles, but I just don&#x27;t really like the feeling of the &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; it makes while shampooing.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I could return it, but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning alot and my hair now looks better and grows fuller than it did before.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo on my hair is okay</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because it made my hair fall more than it used to before..</li>
            <li> I will continue to use, it leaves my hair feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and clean , helped with breaking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of finding out what to do to combat hair-loss so finding a couple of good shampoos is my first goal.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product.</li>
            <li> I lost my hair to Chemotherapy and after the regrowth began, the shampoo helped along with the Biotin caps to make my hair strong and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li> I feel my hair becoming stronger and fuller.</li>
            <li> I feels like it really gets inside of your hair, you need a really good conditioner to use along with this product.</li>
            <li> But its up there with the best that I can say.. Cleans with some fluff !</li>
            <li> Use daily if you want really good results!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had blood tests and am told everything is fine.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, the scent of the shampoo is not that great; it&#x27;s like sour vanilla, which I don&#x27;t find pleasant.</li>
            <li> Hair is dry after the wash, so a good conditioner is a must!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my hair is growing beautifully!</li>
            <li> It is worth the money and just make sure you follow the directions..leave it in for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It suds up pretty good on the first &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34</li>
            <li> A good product so far.</li>
            <li> my hair super clean and puffy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this shampoo is helping with my thinning hair problem.</li>
            <li> i really love this shampoo ,it was the first time i used it .</li>
            <li> and I see a significant change in my hair loss.</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference the first time but the reall difference occurs the more you use it.</li>
            <li> When used as directed - massage into hair and scalp and let it stay there for 3 minutes before rinsing - the hair comes out literally &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really clean...</li>
            <li> When you use the shampoo and follow the directions of leaving it in 3 minutes (or longer), your hair will be squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> noticed nothing but clean hair.</li>
            <li> I believe over a longer course of time i will be full in my temple area.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo and it stopped reclining and my hair is full and</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll come back in a year or 2 and share my findings but, as of now, all I can say is that my hair looks and feels good after I wash it with Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Nice its not a waste of $$$</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Received openend took pictures and going to ask for full refund!!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to its full effect.</li>
            <li> Seems to really thicken things up, can&#x27;t see through the top of my head anymore.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> My brother and my dad are balding and I&#x27;ve got a receding line, but not nearly as bad as they&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Once the hair dries, it feels significantly stronger and thicker and it looks significantly healthier and more alive than before the Biotin treatment.</li>
            <li> If you want clean fresh smelling hair you should try this product.</li>
            <li> Feel it does help with the tremendous amount of shedding.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to notice a difference this quick.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if your looking for something to make your hair healthy and help with hair regrowth, it did for me.</li>
            <li> which is a huge change (and also a bit funny).</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for several years, and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am also taking Biotin supplements, but noticed a significant increase in gloss after the first use.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo last night and it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> Worth trying.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a lot more conscious of what washes my hair now than I was 10 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additional facts worth sharing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my hair shiny and silky soft.</li>
            <li> So far I love this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Of all the shampoo&#x27;s of this type I have purchased, this one is the only one that gave some results on its own</li>
            <li> Their dry shampoo is amazing ( just for anyone looking for a good dry shampoo)</li>
            <li> While more expensive, the Biotin shampoo appears to be the best so far for my hair - for some background, I have a full head of hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking for the right product that does what it says</li>
            <li> Got it within a couple days and used it right away.</li>
            <li> Besides, the plastic around the bottle had a leak, and I didn&#x27;t feel that the impact of returning a leaking package was going to send the seller the right</li>
            <li> my hair definately feels REALLY squiky clean with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The little hairs have all grown longer and they look nice and strong.</li>
            <li> My hair had been thinning and I was in search of better products to add to a new healthy hair regimen to help me get my normal thickness back.</li>
            <li> I am positive this maybe the right path for me.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a great shampoo for those of us who have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Personally I like nioxin better</li>
            <li> Thanks Nexxus!</li>
            <li> I no longer use this product now that my hair had grown back out healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and it works pretty well considering the price.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate their help!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for what I can tell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this, I will say this along with the biotin and Grogonics has made a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m wondering who really wrote them, because this shampoo did not deliver on its promises whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I have normally healthy hair, again I only bought it to try to help growth and it did not do this.  </li>
            <li> Over and over I have been using this product since I brought my first one here on amazon ..</li>
            <li> and i am back to report that i do feel lots of volume and cleanliness for sure.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for 5 days I stopped losing my hair, I just couldn&#x27;t believe the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Has helped with my thinning hair so much!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to fill out the first one since at that time</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> First, I purchased Spring Valley Biotin 5000mcg</li>
            <li> item was descibed exactly as it was in the description.</li>
            <li> Most of the shampoo gets washed out in the shower; it&#x27;s the leave-in conditioner that makes any lasting effects.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does make a difference on my hair when I used it consistently however,</li>
            <li> even I know that washing it doesn&#x27;t get all the biotin nutrients in the hair itself and essentially I&#x27;m just washing most of it away.  </li>
            <li> With this shampoo i see the difference, my hair is definately fluffy and the shampoo smells good unlike others with funky smell.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this has a marked effect in making hair appear more full, especially in thin/sparse areas.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo, my hair was soft, but the only down fall is that the smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t the best!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look thicker pretty much after the first use.</li>
            <li> If your hair starts feeling dry, make sure you use lots of conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was easy &amp; simple, just how I like it.</li>
            <li> It has a similar scent that I remember from a couple of years before, but it is not as strong as before.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and am mixed.</li>
            <li> The Nexxus VitaTress Biotin shampoo was given me 2 years ago by a friend - I have since re-ordered twice for myself and  for family members as I have found it a real help with restoring strength and lustre to winter/dry hair.</li>
            <li> gives hair lots of volume, lathers up really well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s suppose to do this, but really does try my hair out.</li>
            <li> it basically makes your hair more sluggy and harder to comb..</li>
            <li> might want to try for some real stuff</li>
            <li> the price for this is reasonable...</li>
            <li> and I found it to provide a thorough, gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp and, when used as directed, hair feels stronger, thicker.</li>
            <li> but some money can be saved when ordering the available larger sizes - 33 oz.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Noticed not difference really.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have thinning but not thin hair.  </li>
            <li> My doctor says it&#x27;s probably stress, but I don&#x27;t lead a very stressful life.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has really helped my hair by adding volume and shine.</li>
            <li> I am using the shampoo together with the Nexxus VitaTress Vitamins for 2 months and it really makes in differences in terms of flexibility and even volume.</li>
            <li> VitaTress doesn&#x27;t really have a real conditioner no matter how they are labeled.</li>
            <li> It really gives a lot of volume on my hair.  </li>
            <li> really has made my hair thicker along with Biotin supplements</li>
            <li> and this is really helping, along with the dermaroller.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I really think it has helped my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000EVGOQY NEXXUS Vita Tress Biotin Shampoo Nutrient Rich Formulation for Fragile &amp; Thinning Hair 10.1oz/300ml]]</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today and wow!</li>
            <li> like with many other shampoos from the xyz superstore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about when they said it smells great, literally it smells like very bitter medicine, must be the ginkgo biloba extract</li>
            <li> I am very hopeful that with use I will be able to see less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, full of body, and not only feels thicker but looks thicker.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 15 years hard to find in stores has helped me save what hair I have left LOL</li>
            <li> This shampoo causes me to lose MORE hair (in a 24-our period) versus my sodium laurel sulfate-free (SLS-free) shampoo (which makes my hair look fuller and lose less of it in a 24-hour period).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would use less \\&quot;stars\\&quot; for the seller and more \\&quot;stars\\&quot; for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in particular because my hair was thinning out from stress.</li>
            <li> It definitely creates a fuller feel but it doesn&#x27;t last all day and if joy don&#x27;t wash your hair the next day, it definitely won&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are experiencing this problem.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve quit using this product twice, pretty much because of having to order online, I tried Nioxin and other herbal stuff and my hair pretty much just fell out.  </li>
            <li> and I tell them it is not thick</li>
            <li> I was a bit expensive but a great product.  </li>
            <li> am buying again, because it makes my hair look really glossy and soft.</li>
            <li> I have a thinning area on top of my head and after using this shampoo for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to find out if it made my hair look any better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It does not have a normal &amp;#34;shampoo smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine african american hair.</li>
            <li> I an see new hair growth</li>
            <li> Color does take time to come in for new hair or you can die it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a change and started a new hair regimen which included using Nexxus VitaTress Biotin Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product causes new growth in hair</li>
            <li> I purchased a small bottle and 3 days ago I purchased the big bottle very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this very many times due to the extreme tangling it causes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell amazing and not really a good shampoo</li>
            <li> , this is the first product that has actually made my hair seem fuller and stronger.  </li>
            <li> After a quick glance at her head, I did clearly notice many little tiny hair (about 1/4&amp;#34; long at the time) sprouting from her scalp.</li>
            <li> I had long hair and cut it short trying to growing back healthy.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo here in only two washes noticed less hair in hair pick and mostly on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Either I am a little nuts or this stuff works fantastic.</li>
            <li> This makes me stress less over my thinning hair, so the product is worth the money to me!</li>
            <li> I use it with JASON Natural Biotin Conditioner.</li>
            <li> After a hormone treatment, his dermatologist recommended a shampoo that contains Biotin since he&#x27;s too young to take a supplement.</li>
            <li> I do use this item along with Wild Hair</li>
            <li> It does make your hair soft, too soft for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type of shampoo and nothing seems to work as far as hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it because it made me self conscious</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and for me personally, I&#x27;m still losing as much hair as ever.  </li>
            <li> so it works well for natural ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> for my 56 year old mother who is experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li> I felt that my hair fell out even more and dried out what was left.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that soon it will get thick.</li>
            <li> So far he has been very lucky in the fact that it&#x27;s been small bald patches.</li>
            <li> My hair is REALLY straight and always looked like i used the flat iron on it</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I used a hot iron on my hair before I started using this product so my hair was dry and damaged, and now I still use it and my hair looks like it never seen heat!</li>
            <li> Some hairs grew back transparent.... especially the first week.</li>
            <li> ;, no real need to use a palm full or do a double &amp;#34;wash, rinse and repeat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used other Biotin shampoo&#x27;s, but this is the first one where I have actually noticed the difference that fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is still normal thickness and only growing about 1/2&amp;#34; a month.</li>
            <li> and I have used the shampoo 4 times and my hair is back to normal.  </li>
            <li> My hair was feeling weighed down from other shampoos and falling out more than it ever had.</li>
            <li> while new hair growth did not increase significantly definitely stopped hair loss and brought a healthier look.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans it but doesn&#x27;t strip it and make it dry.</li>
            <li> I lost perhaps 2 tablespoons, not enough to send the whole thing back.</li>
            <li> The dermaroller has really helped in the patchy areas where the extensions ripped out my hair and is finally growing back.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, the biotin will help with some hair loss from general anesthesia!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t thickened it and it hasn&#x27;t helped weak areas grow better.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this long enough to determine if it worked to alleviate the symptoms of my stress induced hair loss because I was too impatient with the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to really dry out my scalp, more so than my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> What I mean by this is that quantity-wise, I don&#x27;t have a lot of strands of hair on my head (and am losing more and more every day), but I wouldn&#x27;t say that my hair is thin in that each individual strand is not thin or fine, but it&#x27;s rather thick and coarse (Asian hair).  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this and will be purchasing the larger size next.</li>
            <li> &quot; The only problem is, it&#x27;s becoming kinda&#x27; hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use another brand at this point after going to other salon and big box-store brands with less satisfying results.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t really use it long enough to even try and see results.</li>
            <li> It really squeaks if you rub you hand on your wet hair, or it does so for me.</li>
            <li> and I will not go back to my old products.</li>
            <li> but this one left my hair soft but not greasy</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I had barely used it for a week or so.</li>
            <li> I care so much for my hair that I spent a lot on it.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my daughter who has chemical free thick, s-curl hair.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference (which I think some people might experience as dryness because your hair does feel coarser), but I don&#x27;t really see a difference since my hair strands are already pretty thick to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Just little fuzzies right now,</li>
            <li> while getting your hair clean is the only thing i can say smells bad and did nothing for my thining hair prell works better</li>
            <li> i was having some breakage due to over highlighted hair ,this shampoo really helped my hair .the</li>
            <li> it makes the oils in my hair brittle, and weak, it doesn&#x27;t really make your hair grow, the shampoo smells weird, the product focus more on chemicals than oils, it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not due to damage or breakage; the entire strand falls out, root and all.  </li>
            <li> My thinning spots are less noticeable now thanks to this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made a difference for me in the past, but I never stuck to it for more than a few months.  </li>
            <li> My hair has grown a lot and this shampoo is just a added bonus and it feels super thick</li>
            <li> Super thick and gelatin like.</li>
            <li> The substance is super thick just from appearance and the smell...</li>
            <li> I can see this being beneficial to those with fine, thin hair, but it&#x27;s not helping with my hair fall issue.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning your hair,  a little expensive for that.</li>
            <li> Being an African American woman, my hair can be very unruly, but after only one use my roots felt smoother and my hair was a little softer.  </li>
            <li> Well the one thing I must say the combination of this with my castor oil really has thicken my hair and made my hair shed less!</li>
            <li> Will likely try other nexus product in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t do that with this shampoo my hair feels greasy and flat the next day</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very dry and harsh, I am an african woman and my hair is natural, the product seems like it took out my natural oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this shampoo for two weeks now and each time, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels like cotton-candy (not thick and voluminous, just puffy), and that my hair feels more dirty quicker than with other shampoos that I use.</li>
            <li> Now for an African America woman, I had long hair</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see if it works, but I am also taking Biotin supplements now  </li>
            <li> I just started using the biotin creme and its flat out growing hair</li>
            <li> only con is that it leaves my hair very dry as it cleans all oils and access buildup, but again nothing that can&#x27;t be addressed with proper conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> By itself it left my hair too dry and flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde and have been coloring my hair for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry and brittle after the washing, so I rewashed and had to se a ton of conditioner to get some body back.</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair</li>
            <li> I am in my mid fifties and have fine, thin, and slightly graying hair that is brittle and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very gelatinous and hard to spread into hair.</li>
            <li> and she says after washing and blow drying the hair does look and feel healthier and fuller but in terms of long term affect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few years, and the results so far are to my liking.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried about the price for a 10 oz bottle, but I have to use a very small amount to get a full head of frothy foam.  </li>
            <li> I usually only wash every other day or so</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to see if it helps my hair grow, but I do like the way it feels as my hair had become so dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s clear and just as thick as regular</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks, but definitely noticed softer hair and way, way glossier than before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement with my hair, but it only dried them out and left matt.</li>
            <li> This is a disease where you loose patches of hair sporadically.</li>
            <li> I don’t think this shampoo has thickened my hair simply weighs it down as if I used a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I will be getting back to my previous brand (Nexxus Therape).</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second supply plus a small bottle for a friend with similar issues.</li>
            <li> The ends usually get dried out and brittle, this shampoo really does something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to a different shampoo, but when I used this one, my hair fell out a lot less often in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two months now and her hair is definitely falling out less.</li>
            <li> Leave hair very dry.</li>
            <li> , it makes my hair dry and dull, ( I have African American hair )</li>
            <li> so I cut my hair a little above the nape of my neck and started using the shampoo every week</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t given this product enough time to work, but it&#x27;s been a few weeks now</li>
            <li> and I have seen absolutely NO change in my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no feeling of discomfort while using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Although you can&#x27;t buy it in the store, it does make it a bit harder to just go out and buy it whe</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have ridiculously thick hair all of a sudden, but I can definitely tell a difference when using this.</li>
            <li> Not good results for me so far.</li>
            <li> but I mix it with my other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 weeks and it caused extreme breakouts on my hairline and shoulders.</li>
            <li> The other claim, that this shampoo slows or reverses hair loss</li>
            <li> Other ingredients include: Ginseng root extract, Ginkgo Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m using this with a combination of other products and taking biotin for my thinning hair</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning due to menopause</li>
            <li> For the past two months, she has been religiously taking one pill in the morning and another at night.</li>
            <li> Ehh, not worth the money</li>
            <li> Just an average shampoo.</li>
            <li> Its shading back in slowly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> It is good for the hair, but it smells very bad like a rotten egg!</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old with thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other time I wash my hair!</li>
            <li> It gave my hair tons of body and the thinning spots in my hair are less noticable.</li>
            <li> Used it for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m Black)</li>
            <li> It started to drop less and started to regain it&#x27;s moisture</li>
            <li> I am black</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair falling out in the shower etc</li>
            <li> I can tell that my hair is looking a little thicker now, even my mom noticed that.</li>
            <li> After a month of usage, she noticed little hairs growing on her scalp</li>
            <li> Finally it completely dried my hair and caused to dandruff.</li>
            <li> I just received a few samples of Redken IntraForce shampoo and toner for thinning color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> short thin hair</li>
            <li> The directions do call to leave it on the hair for a few minutes before you rinse-I recommend about 5 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to revisit this in a few months</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling heavy</li>
            <li> I gave it a try and what a waste.</li>
            <li> awhile, I tried to save a few bucks and not use the conditioner (just this shampoo).</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> After just a few applications I noticed a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s in the process of thinning and maybe my forehead broadened by half an inch in the past 10 years</li>
            <li> due to the ingredients it has that keep making your hair look thick, but in reality it dries your hair, and damages it.</li>
            <li> Has a very odd smell.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty shocked.</li>
            <li> I swear it has made my hair a little thicker, or at least it feels that way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t sell sample-sizes of things like this so that we don&#x27;t have to throw out a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> But this Biotin stuff is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it helps my hair fall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its helping my scalp</li>
            <li> Need to load up on heavy duty conditioner just to get a comb through it!  </li>
            <li> As a shampoo it works well, but not sure if it is helping thinning yet.</li>
            <li> not sure about that.</li>
            <li> it probably just not good for my type of hair, ( I&#x27;m a black boy with hair )</li>
            <li> long time fan of head and shoulders.. also tried expensive brands..</li>
            <li> I was just getting tired of paying $10.00 per 10oz bottle and Amazon had a company who sold it for alot less.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever, ever write reviews...</li>
            <li> This prroduct was hard to find at stores.</li>
            <li> Nothing fruity or floral or even soapy, it&#x27;s hard to describe</li>
            <li> but this stuff sucks.  </li>
            <li> I bought this prior to cutting it off to see if it would help hair growth.  </li>
            <li> , my complaint is with the seller.</li>
            <li> At least it did not increase my hair fall like Nisim.</li>
            <li> I already have thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair had gotten extremely thick and is growing just the way how I want it.</li>
            <li> I have thick coiling hair that is relaxed</li>
            <li> I have women tell me all the time they wish they had hair as thick as mine</li>
            <li> and I was quite surprised (in addition to being disappointed).</li>
            <li> It has SLS added - not a good thing.</li>
            <li> please do not buy this product, not good at</li>
            <li> What an expensive waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am a board certified MD and have thin hair myself.   </li>
            <li> The idiots at USPS kept routing the package from one &amp;#34;sorting facility&amp;#34; to another for several weeks!!  </li>
            <li> but it was getting thin from me using relaxers and getting color treatment to my hair every now and then.</li>
            <li> I have chemically treated and damaged thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I will try to find something else, its no good fixing your scalp if your hair just breaks off!</li>
            <li> To me this has a subtle, kinda artificial cherry smell which some may like, but I always associate cherry-flavored or cherry-scented anything with cough medicine and am not a fan.</li>
            <li> My hair just feels weird after I use it, like it&#x27;s lifeless.</li>
            <li> For the price, cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Weird texture.</li>
            <li> Some say it left their hair feeling awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
            <li> It drys my hair out, smell is horrid, &amp; leaves a weird texture to my hair, almost waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> Your hair will look dirty after using this product.</li>
            <li> my hair was falling out like crazy now</li>
            <li> but my hair gets unpleasantly oily 6-7 hours after I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Made my hair impossible to brush through</li>
            <li> The article is not so bad, but I did not like.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging was atrocious.</li>
            <li> (I get highlights every 6 months or so to avoid over-processing, maybe I should skip that :()</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product</li>
            <li> oh the smell is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo and packging ever&lt;</li>
            <li> Having an illness than causes hair loss is devastating.</li>
            <li> awful made my hair feel like straw.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ehh, not worth the money</li>
            <li> The price was great and I love the product.  Would purchase again!  Will likely try other nexus product in the near future.</li>
            <li> It has SLS added - not a good thing.</li>
            <li> Personally I like nioxin better i think for shampoos it also has DHT inhibitors and think that biotin is better when taken orally as a vitamin supplement. I am a board certified MD and have thin hair myself.   here is the link:   [...]</li>
            <li> I have fine african american hair. I used this shampoo last night and it smelled amazing. It left my hair squeaky clean,full of body, and volume...I will stick with this for a while.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I an see new hair growth</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for fine hair. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so good to know a place to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say i have results. Has been 22 days. Its shading back in slowly. I believe over a longer course of time i will be full in my temple area. Some hairs grew back transparent.... especially the first week. Color does take time to come in for new hair or you can die it. But all in all it does work. I have fine hair and am mixed.</li>
            <li> Smells good. I do believe it improved my hair but I haven&#x27;t reordered since running out</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I thought it can help me for hair loss but it didn&#x27;t help at all. Finally it completely dried my hair and caused to dandruff.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t given this product enough time to work, but it&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I can&#x27;t stand to use it any longer. It doesn&#x27;t lather, it definitely doesn&#x27;t keep me from needing to use conditioner, as some people have claimed. It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good. My hair just feels weird after I use it, like it&#x27;s lifeless. If you don&#x27;t use enough, it doesn&#x27;t distribute well, and if you use any extra, your hair feels greasy afterward, like it doesn&#x27;t want to rinse out. Definitely no thickening effect that I can see. I do have very fine hair. I just received a few samples of Redken IntraForce shampoo and toner for thinning color-treated hair. I have only used it on and off about 5 times now, and as soon as I blowdry my hair, I can actually feel that my hair just feels thicker, above the nape of my neck. I will probably buy some bottles of that soon. But this Biotin stuff is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I do like this shampoo.  Use it in conjunction with Biotin capsules.  Feel it does help with the tremendous amount of shedding.</li>
            <li> Nexxus is health for all hair.</li>
            <li> The Nexxus VitaTress Biotin shampoo was given me 2 years ago by a friend - I have since re-ordered twice for myself and  for family members as I have found it a real help with restoring strength and lustre to winter/dry hair. .....i.e., hair subjected to a hairdryer on a weekly, sometimes daily basis, when the indoors  is low in humidity.  Thanks Nexxus!</li>
            <li> This treatment shampoo goes perfect with the Vita tress supplement vitamines, within a month you should see the results, go for the biggest bottle, it will last for over three months!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years. My hairline was reclining at one point. I started using this shampoo and it stopped reclining and my hair is full and just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> gives hair lots of volume, lathers up really well.  noticeable difference</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell great but I mix it with my other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Amazing! After using this shampoo, my hair was soft, but the only down fall is that the smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t the best! So I would recommend a smell good conditioner after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and in my opinion, \\&quot;IT ROCKS!\\&quot; The only problem is, it&#x27;s becoming kinda&#x27; hard to find.  I hope they NEVER DISCONTINUE IT!!!  AWESOME for fine hair!</li>
            <li> while new hair growth did not increase significantly definitely stopped hair loss and brought a healthier look.  I use it with JASON Natural Biotin Conditioner. quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> My son has Alopecia Areata. This is a disease where you loose patches of hair sporadically. At times you can go bald. You may grow your hair back, you may not. So far he has been very lucky in the fact that it&#x27;s been small bald patches. After a hormone treatment, his dermatologist recommended a shampoo that contains Biotin since he&#x27;s too young to take a supplement. This shampoo has defiantly made his hair thicker, so it help to hide the bald patches. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo by far the best shampoo I have ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;leaves my hair super clean and puffy! totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and I think it works to make my hair thicker and grow faster.</li>
            <li> smells great but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to realize hair growth</li>
            <li> Love, love, love nexxus brand. I have yet to find another brand that works as well. (I&#x27;ve purchased multiple types of their products) I bought this shampoo in particular because my hair was thinning out from stress. I had long hair and cut it short trying to growing back healthy. I have always had a shedding problem, even when I&#x27;m not under stress. This product helped thicken my hair and get it&#x27;s strength back. I feels like it really gets inside of your hair, you need a really good conditioner to use along with this product. I recommend any of the nexxus conditioners. I no longer use this product now that my hair had grown back out healthy. I however do still use nexxus brand shampoo and conditioner to help keep my hair healthy. Also just a side note. Their dry shampoo is amazing ( just for anyone looking for a good dry shampoo)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and it works pretty well considering the price. I have a thinning area on top of my head and after using this shampoo for a few weeks Ive noticed that area looks fuller. Its not a miracle grow in anyway but def gives thinning hair some weight. For the price, cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Its a very light weight non-foaming shampoo.  I alternate with Therappe.  I think it helps.</li>
            <li> please do not buy this product, not good at all.thank you</li>
            <li> The article is not so bad, but I did not like.</li>
            <li> It is good for the hair, but it smells very bad like a rotten egg! Can&#x27;t they add a better smell?</li>
            <li> Works good and feels good on the scalp</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with no perfume odor - I have allergy problems and this shampoo does not start my eyes watering when I use it.  Cleans my hair well without damaging it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 weeks and it caused extreme breakouts on my hairline and shoulders. The acne went away after discontinuing use. It smells good. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to find out if it made my hair look any better.</li>
            <li> Healing to hair and scalp. Adds volume and luster. Wonderful Jerry Redding product. Good stimulating wake up feeling to scalp. Cures all hair ills.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000EVGOQY NEXXUS Vita Tress Biotin Shampoo Nutrient Rich Formulation for Fragile &amp; Thinning Hair 10.1oz/300ml]]</li>
            <li> In Just one month there is a noticable improvement.  I have used other Biotin shampoo&#x27;s, but this is the first one where I have actually noticed the difference that fast.</li>
            <li> Excellent  100 % positive</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair and I actually notice a difference when using this shampoo. It definitely creates a fuller feel but it doesn&#x27;t last all day and if joy don&#x27;t wash your hair the next day, it definitely won&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a number of years... I was just getting tired of paying $10.00 per 10oz bottle and Amazon had a company who sold it for alot less.  That&#x27;s what convinced me!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair after using this shampoo. I&#x27;m surprised, because Nexxus has always been a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for several years, and I am very pleased with it. It makes my hair look fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product does work. I don&#x27;t have ridiculously thick hair all of a sudden, but I can definitely tell a difference when using this. Even my fiance commented that my hair looks super awesome now. Win.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s suppose to do this, but really does try my hair out. Well the one thing I must say the combination of this with my castor oil really has thicken my hair and made my hair shed less!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to reorder this twice as it has been delivered leaking both times. Good product though.</li>
            <li> This product is good as I can see and feel that my hair is thicker, works well with the Nexxus Biotin Creme also saw palmetto (berry).</li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo three times. By itself it left my hair too dry and flat. Have to use a conditioner to loosen it up. I think the mark of a good shampoo is one that doesn&#x27;t require you to use a conditioner. Most shampoos, by themselves, are like that--needing conditioner afterwards. I&#x27;m in the process of finding out what to do to combat hair-loss so finding a couple of good shampoos is my first goal. It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t sell sample-sizes of things like this so that we don&#x27;t have to throw out a whole bottle. What do I do with a nearly-full bottle of shampoo I don&#x27;t want to use again? Give it to a friend or relative?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product almost daily for 5 months and leaving the shampoo on my head for 3 minutes each time as directed and I have seen absolutely NO change in my hair at all.  It hasn&#x27;t thickened it and it hasn&#x27;t helped weak areas grow better.  On top of this, I&#x27;ve also been using the Nexxus Biotin Scalp Creme, and even combined with that there has been no change in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just more overpriced snake oil with exaggerated claims of helping hair grow.  Save you&#x27;re money.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth, but I have noticed it has helped with my hair thinning. I am going to order some more. I also use Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner, because they haven&#x27;t yet came out with a Nexxus Vitatress Conditioner..when they do I will definately order that in bulk &#x3D;D I&#x27;m pretty sure this shampoo is helping with my thinning hair problem.</li>
            <li> I already have thick hair and I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out from a Bob so I&#x27;ve been taking lots of vitamins. My hair has grown a lot and this shampoo is just a added bonus and it feels super thick and I love it!  I will continue to use it and buy again!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders and has caused my shedding hair to stop.  I do use this item along with Wild Hair&lt;br /&gt;Growth Oil and Biotin.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look thicker pretty much after the first use.</li>
            <li> Weird texture. Super thick and gelatin like. Did nothing for hair loss. Doesn&#x27;t smell amazing and not really a good shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair feels fuller and has a good shine and softness. I wish there was a conditioner (not leave-in) to pair with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Better Hair &amp; Beauty (through Amazon.com). The product was shipped via US Postal Service (USPS). The idiots at USPS kept routing the package from one &amp;#34;sorting facility&amp;#34; to another for several weeks!!  Thankfully, the people at Better Hair &amp; Beauty were able to correct the USPS mistakes and I was able to get another shipment. I really appreciate their help!</li>
            <li> well this is still here.. its under my counter.. it works pretty good.. it basically makes your hair more sluggy and harder to comb.. it sticks it all together so that the hair you do have appears to be in the same area.. still if your loosing the good fight. might want to try for some real stuff but i&#x27;m sure this helps.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo, but only use it once a week. It does make your hair soft, too soft for me.I do see a thickness to my hair and better&lt;br /&gt;texture.  Good interim shampoo to keep your hair in shape and stop the breakage.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have used to date to help with thinning hair. Great lather and non drying saw a notable difference in density and it&#x27;s very mild.</li>
            <li> Nexxus is excellent quality shampoo for me at this time!  I read about it elsewhere and appreciate that it was available here, thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m starting to see the results for my thinning hair. I can tell that my hair is looking a little thicker now, even my mom noticed that. So I am going to reorder the product. :)</li>
            <li> long time fan of head and shoulders.. also tried expensive brands.. the price for this is reasonable... but i will be going back to H&amp;S... no effect here... short thin hair</li>
            <li> Leave hair very dry. I think the moracco oil I bought is better? I am not sure if it helps my hair fall.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean and fluffy.  I was hoping for some regrowth, but that hasn&#x27;t happened.  Have been using for several months.  Worth trying.</li>
            <li> I recently just received my 10.1 Fl. Oz of this shampoo and though I have yet to use it, I can tell I already won&#x27;t like it. The substance is super thick just from appearance and the smell...oh the smell is AWFUL. I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about when they said it smells great, literally it smells like very bitter medicine, must be the ginkgo biloba extract but idk. I can&#x27;t stand the smell yo. But if it does work wonders on my hair then alright great, but I won&#x27;t repurchase because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Biotin shampoo for a couple of months now and I found it to provide a thorough, gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp and, when used as directed, hair feels stronger, thicker. I don&#x27;t believe I will be getting back to my previous brand (Nexxus Therape). While more expensive, the Biotin shampoo appears to be the best so far for my hair - for some background, I have a full head of hair but it&#x27;s in the process of thinning and maybe my forehead broadened by half an inch in the past 10 years :) so I&#x27;m a lot more conscious of what washes my hair now than I was 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin is part of the VitaTress line of products, designed for those whose hair is in the process of thinning. It is claimed that Biotin eliminates excess sebum, strengthens hair and adds thickness and body to it. I concur with these claims. When used as directed - massage into hair and scalp and let it stay there for 3 minutes before rinsing - the hair comes out literally &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;. It really squeaks if you rub you hand on your wet hair, or it does so for me. There is absolutely no feeling of discomfort while using the shampoo. Once the hair dries, it feels significantly stronger and thicker and it looks significantly healthier and more alive than before the Biotin treatment. The other claim, that this shampoo slows or reverses hair loss I can&#x27;t verify. Maybe I&#x27;ll come back in a year or 2 and share my findings but, as of now, all I can say is that my hair looks and feels good after I wash it with Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional facts worth sharing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A bottle this size is likely to last for a couple of months but some money can be saved when ordering the available larger sizes - 33 oz.&lt;br /&gt;- While it&#x27;s not stated anywhere, it seems to act as a conditioner. I would not use a conditioner after Biotin myself.&lt;br /&gt;- For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;- Other ingredients include: Ginseng root extract, Ginkgo Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product. Until then, I am happy with it.Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract and so forth.    I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product. Until then, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I have very thin hair and I have been looking for the right product that does what it says and I founf it. Although you can&#x27;t buy it in the store, it does make it a bit harder to just go out and buy it whe you run out, but I have found it here for a very good price. I love it, it makes my hair shiny and silky soft. I have curly and frizzy hair, it relaxes the curl and frizzy, so it managable. It gave my hair tons of body and the thinning spots in my hair are less noticable. I have been using this product for a month now and I will not go back to my old products. I&#x27;ve tried every type of shampoo and nothing seems to work as far as hair regrowth. I used a hot iron on my hair before I started using this product so my hair was dry and damaged, and now I still use it and my hair looks like it never seen heat! I love it. I highly recommend this product if your looking for something to make your hair healthy and help with hair regrowth, it did for me.</li>
            <li> After applying hair and scalp immediately given impression of freshness. Each  hair filaments  has increased in volume. A very pleasant smell and consistency of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like this item, thank you.</li>
            <li> It does what it says which is thickens the hair.  My thinning spots are less noticeable now thanks to this shampoo.  It can be a bit drying to the hair though but I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever, ever write reviews... but this stuff sucks.  I&#x27;m not sure if its helping my scalp but my hair feels like straw!  Need to load up on heavy duty conditioner just to get a comb through it!  I will try to find something else, its no good fixing your scalp if your hair just breaks off!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shampoo for thinning hair I would recommend this. It makes my hair feel really clean...it isn&#x27;t stopping my hair loss but I think it might be keeping it in check.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for over a year and he loves it.</li>
            <li> i really love this shampoo ,it was the first time i used it . i was having some breakage due to over highlighted hair ,this shampoo really helped my hair .the service was very prompt and package arrived in great condition .i would do business with amazon again for sure .</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for what I can tell</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m using this with a combination of other products and taking biotin for my thinning hair I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this, I will say this along with the biotin and Grogonics has made a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old with thin hair.  This shampoo has given me volume and it also has controlled my frizzies.  I am now on my second bottle.  Great shampoo!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, but chemical aroma gets in my eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product but I also don&#x27;t love it. Noticed not difference really.  Must work different for anyone. Some say it left their hair feeling awful. But mine seems fine! I&#x27;ll just use the rest and try something else afterward.</li>
            <li> Strips the gunk buildup off your scalp and hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky my hair felt once I rinsed the soap out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve gone through chemo and lost your hair this is a great product to help get your hair growing again! I use it everyday and my hair is growing beautifully!</li>
            <li> Love it, really worked for me. Hair was noticably thicker!</li>
            <li> Your hair will look dirty after using this product. Not good results for me so far. Had much better results with CREW shampoo&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> great product...fast shipping</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well. The OGX biotin shampoo I didn&#x27;t like but this one left my hair soft but not greasy and it did seem thicker.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo based on the many 5-star reviews on here. Now I&#x27;m wondering who really wrote them, because this shampoo did not deliver on its promises whatsoever! Firstly, the scent of the shampoo is not that great; it&#x27;s like sour vanilla, which I don&#x27;t find pleasant. Secondly, I&#x27;ve tried washing my hair with this shampoo one day, then another shampoo the next to see if there&#x27;s a difference in hair loss and hair texture/fullness. This shampoo causes me to lose MORE hair (in a 24-our period) versus my sodium laurel sulfate-free (SLS-free) shampoo (which makes my hair look fuller and lose less of it in a 24-hour period). I&#x27;ve tried this shampoo for two weeks now and each time, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels like cotton-candy (not thick and voluminous, just puffy), and that my hair feels more dirty quicker than with other shampoos that I use. Plus, the biggest thing is that it does not prevent hair loss whatsoever (in fact, I feel it promotes it!), so I do not recommend this product. In fact, I&#x27;d recommend quality biotin supplements instead of this.</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product. I have been using it from a year and I see a significant change in my hair loss. It has now reduced and is controlled. The only downside is the dryness. Hair is dry after the wash, so a good conditioner is a must!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and I got a recommendation to try this. As a shampoo it works well, but not sure if it is helping thinning yet. Too early to tell.</li>
            <li> Now for an African America woman, I had long hair but it was getting thin from me using relaxers and getting color treatment to my hair every now and then. I wanted a change and started a new hair regimen which included using Nexxus VitaTress Biotin Shampoo. I wanted to start over so I cut my hair a little above the nape of my neck and started using the shampoo every week and I definately see the difference. My hair had gotten extremely thick and is growing just the way how I want it. When you use the shampoo and follow the directions of leaving it in 3 minutes (or longer), your hair will be squeaky clean. I do condition my hair with Nexxus Humectress conditioner and get a wonderful effect. When using this product do not give up. Keep doing it and you will see the results!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  The shampoo is very gelatinous and hard to spread into hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good and cleans good.  I recently cut 9 inches off of my hair to donate it.  I bought this prior to cutting it off to see if it would help hair growth.  It has not helped growth, it has not made it thicker.  I have normally healthy hair, again I only bought it to try to help growth and it did not do this.  My hair is still normal thickness and only growing about 1/2&amp;#34; a month.</li>
            <li> Over and over I have been using this product since I brought my first one here on amazon .. Can&#x27;t say its the best... (What is? Who can tell.).. But its up there with the best that I can say.. Cleans with some fluff ! Nice its not a waste of $$$</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo-it works for me. I don&#x27;t have any Clinical  knowledge to back that up. It cleans up my hair and that is all I ask.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today and wow! My scalp feels cleaner. My hair looks so much better. My hair has been thinning due to menopause so I have been trying everything to thicken my hair. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to notice a difference this quick. I highly recommend this product. It is worth the money and just make sure you follow the directions..leave it in for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> makes hair feel thicker after just the 2nd or 3rd use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I loved it ! The product made my hair fuller, and it  shined, The price was great . This prroduct was hard to find at stores.</li>
            <li> So far I love this. I feel my hair becoming stronger and fuller.</li>
            <li> That product is excelente and I recomend because after I use the product my hair chance in good and is more thicker</li>
            <li> Used it for about a month and a half. It seemed to really dry out my scalp, more so than my usual shampoo. Even if I&#x27;d use it with conditioner there would be flakes. I had to stop using it because it made me self conscious so I couldn&#x27;t really use it long enough to even try and see results. In the time that I used it however, I didn&#x27;t notice any sort of volumizing or growth. May try it again and edit the review.</li>
            <li> I don’t think this shampoo has thickened my hair simply weighs it down as if I used a conditioner. The smell is pleasant. The packaging was atrocious. Does anybody screw on the cap at the factory? Anyway, someone had the brains to put the bottle inside of a plastic bag upon shipping. The second ingredient is Sodium laureth sulfate a well-known cancer causing agent. If I want to put cancer causing agents on my head I’ll but the $1.00 shampoo at Walmart. I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo.  Makes my hair look and feel thicker.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  I swear it has made my hair a little thicker, or at least it feels that way.  It definitely makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo and packging ever&lt;br /&gt;Received openend took pictures and going to ask for full refund!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all spilled out dont order</li>
            <li> felt like it did damage</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she says after washing and blow drying the hair does look and feel healthier and fuller but in terms of long term affect. not sure about that.</li>
            <li> I have chemically treated and damaged thin hair.  I used this product along with the recommended leave-in conditioner as soon as I received it and saw immediate results.  Being an African American woman, my hair can be very unruly, but after only one use my roots felt smoother and my hair was a little softer.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continuous use.  The two products were fairly priced so I would recommend giving them a try!</li>
            <li> My hair had been thinning and I was in search of better products to add to a new healthy hair regimen to help me get my normal thickness back. I have thick coiling hair that is relaxed (I&#x27;m Black) so the chemicals are a part of the factor in the shedding and constantly unbalanced scalp. I also use this on my daughter who has chemical free thick, s-curl hair.This shampoo helped address almost all of my issues and like another user said-it leaves my our literally squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s clear and just as thick as regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;-It suds up pretty good on the first &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34;, no real need to use a palm full or do a double &amp;#34;wash, rinse and repeat&amp;#34; like with many other shampoos from the xyz superstore. The directions do call to leave it on the hair for a few minutes before you rinse-I recommend about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-It does not have a normal &amp;#34;shampoo smell&amp;#34;. Nothing fruity or floral or even soapy, it&#x27;s hard to describe but it&#x27;s not bad. Plus if you use conditioner or hair products it&#x27;s covered up any how. (I recommend always using a conditioner with this shampoo since it cleans the hair and scalp so thoroughly)&lt;br /&gt;-I had an issue with dandruff and issues with oily hair products building up on my scalp. This really does a great job addressing both.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit expensive and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in a store but for how well it works it&#x27;s worth it (but I will keep my eye open for cheaper prices)&lt;br /&gt;-The only con is that it leaves my hair very dry as it cleans all oils and access buildup, but again nothing that can&#x27;t be addressed with proper conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and will be purchasing the larger size next. I will definitely keep this in arsenal of hair care products!!</li>
            <li> my hair definately feels REALLY squiky clean with this shampoo. I bought it because ive been using the leave in spray conditioner from nexxus and loved it so i thought i would try another nexxus product and i will keep buying this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i have been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks now and i am back to report that i do feel lots of volume and cleanliness for sure. My hair is REALLY straight and always looked like i used the flat iron on it even though i hadnt. With this shampoo i see the difference, my hair is definately fluffy and the shampoo smells good unlike others with funky smell.</li>
            <li> I have thinning but not thin hair.  What I mean by this is that quantity-wise, I don&#x27;t have a lot of strands of hair on my head (and am losing more and more every day), but I wouldn&#x27;t say that my hair is thin in that each individual strand is not thin or fine, but it&#x27;s rather thick and coarse (Asian hair).  My hair has been falling out for several years now, especially during and after a shower.  It&#x27;s not due to damage or breakage; the entire strand falls out, root and all.  I&#x27;ve had blood tests and am told everything is fine.  My doctor says it&#x27;s probably stress, but I don&#x27;t lead a very stressful life.  I have started taking a multivitamin and biotin again.  It hasn&#x27;t made a difference for me in the past, but I never stuck to it for more than a few months.  I decided to try this shampoo because my sister says it has helped with her own shedding issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and for me personally, I&#x27;m still losing as much hair as ever.  However, I can see why some people say that this makes a difference because it does make your hair feel thicker.  It must coat or engorge your hair strands with something temporarily to thicken it up.  I can feel the difference (which I think some people might experience as dryness because your hair does feel coarser), but I don&#x27;t really see a difference since my hair strands are already pretty thick to begin with.  I can see this being beneficial to those with fine, thin hair, but it&#x27;s not helping with my hair fall issue.  I won&#x27;t repurchase after I finish this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. To me this has a subtle, kinda artificial cherry smell which some may like, but I always associate cherry-flavored or cherry-scented anything with cough medicine and am not a fan.</li>
            <li> A good product so far.</li>
            <li> I love the product and received the package without any hassale.  The price was excellent too.  Try it out for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a year now. I began using it because of thinning hair. This shampoo has really helped my hair by adding volume and shine. I highly recommend this product if you are experiencing this problem.</li>
            <li> Has helped in connection with the Biotin capsules.  I lost my hair to Chemotherapy and after the regrowth began, the shampoo helped along with the Biotin caps to make my hair strong and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I do see some improvement in my hair.  Initially, I was taking biotin pills, but stopped. Someone suggested that I buy the shampoo.  I will have to revisit this in a few months</li>
            <li> Was a little worried about the price for a 10 oz bottle, but I have to use a very small amount to get a full head of frothy foam.  Great Stuff!</li>
            <li> Got it within a couple days and used it right away. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my hair. It started to drop less and started to regain it&#x27;s moisture and it&#x27;s thickness</li>
            <li> I am trying to help my hair increase volume and be healthier. This shampoo lathers and cleans well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I Use this with Long-N-Strong and my daughter&#x27;s hair have grown. I am black so it works well for natural ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling weighed down from other shampoos and falling out more than it ever had. With this shampoo here in only two washes noticed less hair in hair pick and mostly on my clothes. If this product only keeps hair from falling out an nothing else I&#x27;m a happy girl but would be nice if helped hair grow too</li>
            <li> Made my scalp itchy.  It may  have something to do with sulfate</li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo and like the refreshing feeling I get from using it. Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see if it works, but I am also taking Biotin supplements now  so hope using both products will help</li>
            <li> I have used this twice in conjunction with Biotin and Omega 3 supplements. After a week, I have seen improvement in my hair. I am looking forward to its full effect.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product. I purchased it so that I may have thicker hair. I actually have baby hair growing and I&#x27;m sure that soon it will get thick.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a wonderful smell and lathers and cleans well. It does &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34; hair by way of making each strand look and feel thicker. It does not grow hair. Over time it tends to build up each hair so that it feels like your hair is thicker. The key is to shampoo, lather up amd let it sit on your hair for a minute or two before rinsing out. You will notice a difference the first time but the reall difference occurs the more you use it. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I just starting using this product. It makes my hair feel great!  I will buy this shampoo again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks, Jenny</li>
            <li> Definitely thickens hair, delightful smell out of bottle with no lingering odor.</li>
            <li> I like the way this shampoo makes my hair feel.  Plus, my hair feels stronger than before.  I reccommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Met all expectations -- great experience!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  My hair was falling out by the handfuls and I have used the shampoo 4 times and my hair is back to normal.  Not only has it stopped falling out but it appears thicker when I style it. Great product and I will continue to use it.  Maxine</li>
            <li> My hair looks sooooo much better, healthier and thicker. I started using it on my 3 yr ild daughter too and I can totally tell a difference.</li>
            <li> What more would you like to know?&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a week and noticed hair loss, not gain.  Perhaps i should have tried it longer but i don&#x27;t want to lose more hair.  That wasn&#x27;t the purpose of my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It contains \\&quot;Sodium Laureth Sulfate\\&quot;, what some consider a possible reason for hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that for sure.  Just something i looked up on Google.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3wks and I have noticed a big difference. my hair was falling out like crazy now it is only a quarter of what it was. I purchased a small bottle and 3 days ago I purchased the big bottle very satisfied.  follow the directions</li>
            <li> the bottle side is perfect for the shower.  lasts about 3 months.  I wish they had a matching conditioner too!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for it. Leaves hair feeling heavy</li>
            <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it is wonderful !! I have women tell me all the time they wish they had hair as thick as mine and I tell them it is not thick it is the hair products I use !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from hair loss since I was a teenager, meaning, for more than 10 years. After using this shampoo for 5 days I stopped losing my hair, I just couldn&#x27;t believe the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Has helped with my thinning hair so much!  Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> wonderful, leaves hair feeling, looking good, hair is becoming fuller and manageable.  The shampoo for me</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this has a marked effect in making hair appear more full, especially in thin/sparse areas. Also just makes hair look nicer, with more of a wave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over 10 years and I don&#x27;t want the rating to reflect my opinion about the Nexxus shampoo. I won&#x27;t use another brand at this point after going to other salon and big box-store brands with less satisfying results. I love this shampoo on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use less \\&quot;stars\\&quot; for the seller and more \\&quot;stars\\&quot; for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, my complaint is with the seller. They left the bottle partly open and so upon arrival there was shampoo in the plastic bubble used to protect the bottle during shipment. I&#x27;ve never had this happen from Amazon before and I was quite surprised (in addition to being disappointed). I lost perhaps 2 tablespoons, not enough to send the whole thing back. Besides, the plastic around the bottle had a leak, and I didn&#x27;t feel that the impact of returning a leaking package was going to send the seller the right message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this will.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid fifties and have fine, thin, and slightly graying hair that is brittle and prone to breakage. (I get highlights every 6 months or so to avoid over-processing, maybe I should skip that :() I am using the shampoo together with the Nexxus VitaTress Vitamins for 2 months and it really makes in differences in terms of flexibility and even volume. I just ordered my second supply plus a small bottle for a friend with similar issues. Amazon should be able to confirm that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am submitting this customer review in response to the second order. I didn&#x27;t want to fill out the first one since at that time I had barely used it for a week or so.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shampoo. what else can I say?</li>
            <li> My hair was still falling out after 2 weeks of using this. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very dry and harsh, I am an african woman and my hair is natural, the product seems like it took out my natural oils.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a great shampoo for those of us who have fine, thin hair.  Even if you do not get the entire system, the shampoo (and the mousse is a fav of mine too) will be helpful.  If your hair starts feeling dry, make sure you use lots of conditioner. VitaTress doesn&#x27;t really have a real conditioner no matter how they are labeled.</li>
            <li> It was easy &amp; simple, just how I like it.</li>
            <li> I just started with this shampoo, I have thinning hair (middle area) and this shampoo seems to make my hair thicker and fuller.  I was a bit expensive but a great product.  I would recommend this product for women who are experiencing thinning.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was a bit to drying. I felt that my hair fell out even more and dried out what was left.</li>
            <li> It has a similar scent that I remember from a couple of years before, but it is not as strong as before.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  It really gives a lot of volume on my hair.  My hair is smooth and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp but my hair gets unpleasantly oily 6-7 hours after I use this shampoo. Wont&#x27; buy this again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to help my hair and I tried it faithfully...but I do have a bateria that is in my system that could have been some of the problem.  &amp;#34;The seller was great</li>
            <li> I recommend this product because it worked for me. You get to notice results with constant use like everything else,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good, thank you for good item service</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to stop my hair fall. I have had 3 hair plantation sessions too. I care so much for my hair that I spent a lot on it. This product is a part of my trails and it does not help. I used it as suggested for more than 2 months and I do not see any thing working. At least it did not increase my hair fall like Nisim.I would not recommend this product if you are looking to stop hair loss.I am using nioxin 2 system and Nioxin is better.</li>
            <li> Never used a product for thinning hair but will def. say that this shampoo does help with the feel of fullness and thickness in your hair as soon as you wash it.</li>
            <li> This works good! I use it every other time I wash my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m losing my hair so am trying this.  It&#x27;s too soon to see if it helps my hair grow, but I do like the way it feels as my hair had become so dry.</li>
            <li> I have not used this very many times due to the extreme tangling it causes. Yes, I put conditioner on after shampooing, I use WEN cleansing cream as my conditioner (works great as a conditioner) and it takes care of the tangles, but I just don&#x27;t really like the feeling of the &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; it makes while shampooing. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I also think it strips my medium auburn hair of the color I have to painstakingly put on every 3-5 weeks. It&#x27;s a no go for me.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair out, smell is horrid, &amp; leaves a weird texture to my hair, almost waxy feeling. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Has the look and feel  of jello and dosn&#x27;t lather at all. I would probaly just get my Biotin from hair and nail vitamins.</li>
            <li> really has made my hair thicker along with Biotin supplements</li>
            <li> Has a very odd smell. Used for a month and saw no difference in this compared to the ones in WalMart. Save your money.</li>
            <li> It works good and my hair is feeling thicker already. I will continue to use, it leaves my hair feeling nice and clean. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try and what a waste. My hair felt dry and brittle after the washing, so I rewashed and had to se a ton of conditioner to get some body back. I have normal to oily hair. Sure wish I could return it, but can&#x27;t. What an expensive waste of money.</li>
            <li> I started trying this about a month a ago and I have seen very good results. It says use daily but I use once every three days. My hair was thinning alot and my hair now looks better and grows fuller than it did before. I used carrot oil along with the shampoo and it does wonders! Use daily if you want really good results!</li>
            <li> I had extensions that thrashed my hair and this is really helping, along with the dermaroller. The dermaroller has really helped in the patchy areas where the extensions ripped out my hair and is finally growing back. Look for the derma roller if you have bald patches from extensions.&lt;br /&gt;I am buying again, because it makes my hair look really glossy and soft. I&#x27;m blonde and have been coloring my hair for a very long time. The ends usually get dried out and brittle, this shampoo really does something. It really cleans it but doesn&#x27;t strip it and make it dry. I have only been using it for a few weeks, but definitely noticed softer hair and way, way glossier than before. I am also taking Biotin supplements, but noticed a significant increase in gloss after the first use. Feels thicker too. Yay!</li>
            <li> Feels nice and clean , helped with breaking</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning your hair,  a little expensive for that. Using this product I didn&#x27;t see any different for helping out thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to a different shampoo, but when I used this one, my hair fell out a lot less often in the shower. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the shampoo didn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> Either I am a little nuts or this stuff works fantastic. I am a guy with some thinning hair and I use this every 3 days. Seems to really thicken things up, can&#x27;t see through the top of my head anymore. Dont know if it is this or the rogaine but something is workin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement with my hair, but it only dried them out and left matt. Searching for a perfect shampoo continues.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff back when it was in the stores.  My brother and my dad are balding and I&#x27;ve got a receding line, but not nearly as bad as they&#x27;ve had.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve quit using this product twice, pretty much because of having to order online, I tried Nioxin and other herbal stuff and my hair pretty much just fell out.  All peoples chemistry is different so not everybody will get the same affects, but both times I switched back to this stuff my hair loss not only stopped but reversed.  I just started using the biotin creme and its flat out growing hair where I haven&#x27;t had any for years.  Just little fuzzies right now, but I&#x27;m pretty shocked. This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for thin hair.  I love this shampoo, my hair looks wonderful and smells very inviting.  You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair fuller</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product at all...</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling like it had not been washed! Would never recommend!</li>
            <li> First, I purchased Spring Valley Biotin 5000mcg for my 56 year old mother who is experiencing hair loss. After doing some research online, I found out Biotin is one of the best supplements for hair regrowth. For the past two months, she has been religiously taking one pill in the morning and another at night. Along with this, she&#x27;s been using Nexxus VitaTress Biotin Shampoo every day, which I also got for her after reading good reviews on Amazon. After three weeks of usage, she noticed that her armpit hair has been growing. She said she didn&#x27;t have to shave the armpit area that often (only once in maybe three months) because hair used to not grow there. Now she has to shave every two weeks which is a huge change (and also a bit funny). After a month of usage, she noticed little hairs growing on her scalp but she wanted me to check in case she was having a placebo effect. After a quick glance at her head, I did clearly notice many little tiny hair (about 1/4&amp;#34; long at the time) sprouting from her scalp. It&#x27;s been two months now and her hair is definitely falling out less. The little hairs have all grown longer and they look nice and strong. Judging from the growth of her armpit hair, I&#x27;d say that biotin pills have definitely helped her a lot since she doesn&#x27;t use the Nexxus shampoo on her armpits. But the combination of Biotin pills and Nexxus VitaTress shampoo is working well for her.</li>
            <li> Just an average shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good product. fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for almost 6 months, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all.</li>
            <li> noticed nothing but clean hair.</li>
            <li> This is slowing my wife&#x27;s hair loss and makes her hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> this product came in on time if not earlier. item was descibed exactly as it was in the description. thanks.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair falling out in the shower etc but my hair also feels greasy - I usually only wash every other day or so and I can&#x27;t do that with this shampoo my hair feels greasy and flat the next day</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus Vitatress shampoo for years and I love it.  I highly recommend it for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> while getting your hair clean is the only thing i can say smells bad and did nothing for my thining hair prell works better</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 15 years hard to find in stores has helped me save what hair I have left LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years, not that store or hair salons don&#x27;t carry this product anymore I now order it through Amazon. If you want clean fresh smelling hair you should try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few years, and the results so far are to my liking. My thinning hair has slowed, and the shampoo lathers well and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For awhile, I tried to save a few bucks and not use the conditioner (just this shampoo). Don&#x27;t kid yourself. Most of the shampoo gets washed out in the shower; it&#x27;s the leave-in conditioner that makes any lasting effects. Use both together if you want results.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchase the shampoo. Read ingredients as well as description.  I am very hopeful that with use I will be able to see less hair loss.  Having an illness than causes hair loss is devastating. I am positive this maybe the right path for me.</li>
            <li> Think it&#x27;s good. Jury is still out re: helping hair grow. I do see some improvement but can&#x27;t delineate between Biotin Shampoo or Biotin orally</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  I really think it has helped my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my hair so shiney! I use it a few times a week. Definitely have to use a conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> This shampoo on my hair is okay, it makes my hair dry and dull, ( I have African American hair ) it makes the oils in my hair brittle, and weak, it doesn&#x27;t really make your hair grow, the shampoo smells weird, the product focus more on chemicals than oils, it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo it probably just not good for my type of hair, ( I&#x27;m a black boy with hair )</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling wonderful. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo for 2 weeks, but it does leave my hair silky and shiny without residue.  Hopefully, the biotin will help with some hair loss from general anesthesia!</li>
            <li> Made my hair impossible to brush through</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have used for my thinning hair,due to my age.  My hair is shiny, full of body, and not only feels thicker but looks thicker. I give this entire line 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now.  After just a few applications I noticed a difference in my hair.  I have been dealing with thinning hair for about 3 years now, this is the first product that has actually made my hair seem fuller and stronger.  The thinner spots where my scalp was showing are not as noticable. I don&#x27;t know if this product causes new growth in hair but it does give your hair body and fullness and seems to reduce the amount of hair loss.  This makes me stress less over my thinning hair, so the product is worth the money to me!</li>
            <li> awful made my hair feel like straw. i&#x27;ll stick to my wen.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair so I have been looking into thickening items.  This shampoo does make a difference on my hair when I used it consistently however, even I know that washing it doesn&#x27;t get all the biotin nutrients in the hair itself and essentially I&#x27;m just washing most of it away.  I know this is paired to go with some biotin vitamins and I may consider adding those to the mix as well and do the double treatment.  Of all the shampoo&#x27;s of this type I have purchased, this one is the only one that gave some results on its own</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this long enough to determine if it worked to alleviate the symptoms of my stress induced hair loss because I was too impatient with the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather.  I don&#x27;t feel like my hair gets clean without a nice lather!</li>
            <li> received as requested</li>
            <li> Use only once or twice a week with a good condition and get great results!  I&#x27;m so glad they still make this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love it...great service.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because it made my hair fall more than it used to before.. due to the ingredients it has that keep making your hair look thick, but in reality it dries your hair, and damages it.</li>
