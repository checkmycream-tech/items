            <li>I can not wait to see how I look after several more weeks of use!</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well!</li>
            <li>Thanks~!!</li>
            <li>Worked better than most lotions to moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it absorbs quickly and makes my face feel really soft.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing non greasy oil, it has made such a difference in my face and hands that I am now trying it on my feet.</li>
            <li>I use one squirt of the rose hip oil, which is just enough to cover my face.</li>
            <li>It is a nice big bottle</li>
            <li>Lotions and creams have stopped working well for me,and I am trying to take a more natural approach with my skin care.</li>

            <li>It is not an overly heavy oil and soaks in very nice.</li>
            <li>Friendly, fast service...</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and does not make your skin feel oily.  </li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of rosehip oil, and chose your product due to good reviews and affordability.</li>
            <li>I think the fine lines look smoother and  feel very  soft .  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have a scent- which is nice because it won&#x27;t mask my perfumes or body sprays I wear daily.  </li>
            <li>has not only been a great oil to add essential oils to</li>
            <li>My Rosehip Oil arrived very well-packaged and quickly.</li>
            <li>to the product such great customer service - follow up - and again - terrific</li>
            <li>The package came quickly and wrapped really well so as not to break.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like silk when I put it on, Not greasy and it absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skeptic with things, but I actually notice my skin looking way better after using this for maybe 4 days.</li>
            <li>but this is my first time with this product.</li>
            <li>I also tried it on my psoriasis spots, it seems to ease the itchiness pretty well.</li>
            <li>I do this in the morning and at night, and my skin has been absolutely glowing!</li>
            <li>It does not leave my skin greasy, but just soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>first time user of this oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks AromaOils!</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and leaves my skin moisturized!</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and the crows feet disappeared with the first use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to aroma oils for the product!</li>
            <li>reasonable and worth it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with these, these are definitely something to&lt;br /&gt;keep around.</li>
            <li>I really love it especially the speed in which it was delivered.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this oil because it is good for scars and stretch marks, and for mature and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many anti-aging products and this one actually has had positive results.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast ,very large bottle.no fragrance to it  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it really is a nice product.</li>
            <li>the small of it is really good.</li>
            <li>Overall I still love this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil, and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves skin looking dewy and soft.</li>
            <li>Love it ,my hands are  dry</li>
            <li>That is kind of odd though for something called Aroma Oils.  </li>
            <li>I wish all oils came in large bottles like this one.  </li>
            <li>However I started using Dudu Osun black soap and its &amp;#34;kind of drying&amp;#34; and I was looking for a good natural moisturizer</li>
            <li>I believe that it has already helped with my facial fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this product again as it has a soft pleasant smell and actually works.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the light honey, or orange color that I am used to with other pure rose hip seed oils I have purchased in the past, such as the NOW Rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li>it does help with fine lines and moisturizes my dry skin, the reason I tried it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Thanks you for offering such a HUGE 4 oz.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The applicator is a pump which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I much prefer using this to using creams with all the additives.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for some time for this oil at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It also allows my skin to breath, so I don&#x27;t feel hot or get clogged pores (although I don&#x27;t normally use it on my face, unless I get sunburned).</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing very soon.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much time to really use this product.</li>
            <li>The shipping on this product was really fast</li>
            <li>I really like the rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>and I really like that it comes with a dropper.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it.</li>
            <li>I feel that the skin is much smoother than before.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes without feeling &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>very mild.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Does not have much of a scent</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS ROSEHIP OIL.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and does not leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>The whole house was fragrant roses.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>Does not go on greasy, has a very faint smell so it mixes well with my essential oils, and feels great on my face.. VERY pleased.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the opportunity to test this item.</li>
            <li>Very good~&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>you so much~</li>
            <li>I really like this oil and will buy it again once I have used this bottle.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, and find it to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>In the morning I wake up to a reflection of a younger, softer version of this old face of mine. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my old lady hands and they look better already after only one week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right weight and feel for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>and it seems to soak right in, leaving the skin soft at pliable.  </li>
            <li>First, I was surprised at how large the bottle is.</li>
            <li>I would never go back to the original skin cream.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin super smooth and silky without feeling oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li>It is an oil that easily absorbs into my skin and has a light and delicate smell.</li>
            <li>I really like how it sinks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t have a strong order.</li>
            <li>good... or not good</li>
            <li>The scent is very faint, which is nice some of the Rose Hip Oils I have had in the past were very strong.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a little at a time to get good results.</li>
            <li>and I think I will keep the new routine!  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with a few other oils and its wonderful as a moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Am using it on my face and really like my new silky skin.</li>
            <li>Product arrived a few days ago and I am loving it so far.</li>
            <li>Especially if the product name is &amp;#34;AromaOils&amp;#34; I was expecting some herbal or exotic scent I can&#x27;t get at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Rosehip Oil for only a short time, but I can tell you it leaves your face feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li>We are going to mix some today up for a facial lotion as the little drops that we used yesterday made the portions of our skin so extremely soft it was amazing!  </li>
            <li>Love that its a large bottle it should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li>Surprised by the large amount.</li>
            <li>the oil is pure and natural.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews say, it is lightweight, not greasy, absorbs easily, and is scent-free.</li>
            <li>First the consistency feels less rich than others I&#x27;ve used and the glass packaging is just so-so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like how soft my face feels after using the oil.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the Aroma Oils Rose Hip Seed Oil feels, applies, absorbs, has the same consistence, and fragrance as generic drug store baby oil.  </li>
            <li>good product except for broken pump</li>
            <li>I find this product to be very rich and long lasting.</li>
            <li>the customer service that I recieved has been crazy good!</li>
            <li>I didnt think I would have such great results for such a small price.  </li>
            <li>The company representative apologized and said she would send me a new pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li>I swear this is a new holy grail prod</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very soft</li>
            <li>I was hesitate at first but after trying it I became a big fan.</li>
            <li>I received a personal email from the owner of the company making sure I received the product timely and in one piece, and we have emailed back and forth with him several times regarding the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed how soft this leaves my skin!</li>
            <li>This oil is exactly what I’ve been looking for, so I will be a regular customer.</li>
            <li>and... wow!</li>
            <li>First off it&#x27;s a BIG bottle!</li>
            <li>So far, this is the same great quality of my more expensive brands!!</li>
            <li>The oil absorbed quickly and did not leave behind any greasy feeling and left my hands feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I recieved a email with detailed ways to use the product which has been extremely helpful!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I can already see an improvement in my skin, after using it only a short time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having some difficulty with the pores on my nose, which have always been large, becoming more clogged lately, but I have not determined that it is from this product since I recently changed a few steps of my skin care routine with the change of weather.</li>
            <li>only reason for knocking half a star is that the packaging box was sealed with two pieces of scotch tape, rather than a more professional closure.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my hands that have been very dry with this cold weather.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Used for a week so far</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy a change from the everyday.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea, so I start with a sulfur based soap, then use a natural toner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it in a DIY Facial Serum and look forward to experiencing its anti-aging properties that I have read so much about.</li>
            <li>I am also using this directly on my face after cleansing it at night</li>
            <li>This oil is not heavy but it does take a while for it to sink in.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy or too light.  </li>
            <li>And the company offers info on how to use it for beginners.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>and it made my face feel so soft</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>After washing and drying, my hair was soft and shining.</li>
            <li>SHE SAID SHE FEEL HER SKIN SOFT AND MOISTURE.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I incorporated this oil into a homemade  skin cream,  and I am  completely hooked.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>bottle says to keep out of direct sunlight</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my face and an old scar.  </li>
            <li>and I have naturally oily skin and deal with breakouts often.</li>
            <li>My bags under my eyes are disappearing slowly but surely, and my skin is softer.</li>
            <li>There is a very slight kind of nutty smell that is completely covered when mixed with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I plan on adding some essential oils, but I love it plain.  </li>
            <li>It has no scent and sinks right in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great and affordable alternative to expensive creams!</li>
            <li>This is such a soft, gentle oil and mixes well with other oils to make a fantastic treatment for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I give this product a low rating for two reasons:  First, I contacted the Aroma Oils immediately when I learned the pump dispenser did not work properly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so, so not sure how it is doing on any wrinkles, but I am enjoying how it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering such high quality oil.</li>
            <li>Its of high quality and only takes a drop or two.</li>
            <li>Also, in just this short amount of time my fine wrinkles have disappeared &amp; dark patches are beginning to vanish too!</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes have definitely become less apparent.</li>
            <li>only about a week later I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>so I was a little wary about using an oil as a face moisturizer, but it&#x27;s really lightweight and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy and makes my skin feel so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how big it was!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing them in the near future.</li>
            <li>I am using it to keep a recent surgery scar soft</li>
            <li>My skin is left feeling soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and it was so refreshing to massage it into my tired feet after a hectic day.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product if you have dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>Although the price is good due to a special going on, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the box was badly torn and taped back together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days on my face, before I apply my other products, and I have already noticed that my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>WOW,  I made a facial serum with it and some essential oils.</li>
            <li>Also, it is clear and rose hip should be reddish orange if it is cold pressed and has not been through a bleaching process.</li>
            <li>A little oily at first but allow it to adsorb.  </li>
            <li>I have used it straight from the bottle and mixed with some shea butter and other goodies.  </li>
            <li>I will deffinately be ordering this same product, from this same company in the near future.</li>
            <li>It has transformed my dry skin into smooth,baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>This particular oil can get extremely pricy, and I&#x27;ve used several types by shopping around.</li>

            <li> Absorbs very well; does not just sit on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> , if applied evenly it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to soak in and your face looks and feels really nice!</li>

            <li> I like that it penetrates quickly into my skin.</li>

            <li> After doing more research on essential oils, I learned a bit more what it is my skin</li>
            <li> It also came in quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>

            <li> I can not wait to see how I look after several more weeks of use!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well!</li>
            <li> Thanks~!!</li>
            <li> Worked better than most lotions to moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it absorbs quickly and makes my face feel really soft.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing non greasy oil, it has made such a difference in my face and hands that I am now trying it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I use one squirt of the rose hip oil, which is just enough to cover my face.</li>
            <li> It is a nice big bottle</li>
            <li> Lotions and creams have stopped working well for me,and I am trying to take a more natural approach with my skin care.</li>
            <li> You can use a variety of useful products are also recommended, we will use</li>
            <li> It is not an overly heavy oil and soaks in very nice.</li>
            <li> Friendly, fast service...</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and does not make your skin feel oily.  </li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of rosehip oil, and chose your product due to good reviews and affordability.</li>
            <li> I think the fine lines look smoother and  feel very  soft .  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have a scent- which is nice because it won&#x27;t mask my perfumes or body sprays I wear daily.  </li>
            <li> has not only been a great oil to add essential oils to</li>
            <li> My Rosehip Oil arrived very well-packaged and quickly.</li>
            <li> to the product such great customer service - follow up - and again - terrific</li>

            <li> Makes your skin smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> My skin feels like silk when I put it on, Not greasy and it absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic with things, but I actually notice my skin looking way better after using this for maybe 4 days.</li>
            <li> but this is my first time with this product.</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my psoriasis spots, it seems to ease the itchiness pretty well.</li>
            <li> I do this in the morning and at night, and my skin has been absolutely glowing!</li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin greasy, but just soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> first time user of this oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks AromaOils!</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and leaves my skin moisturized!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and the crows feet disappeared with the first use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to aroma oils for the product!</li>
            <li> reasonable and worth it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these, these are definitely something to&lt;br /&gt;keep around.</li>
            <li> I really love it especially the speed in which it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this oil because it is good for scars and stretch marks, and for mature and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many anti-aging products and this one actually has had positive results.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast ,very large bottle.no fragrance to it  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it really is a nice product.</li>
            <li> the small of it is really good.</li>
            <li> Overall I still love this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil, and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves skin looking dewy and soft.</li>
            <li> Love it ,my hands are  dry</li>
            <li> That is kind of odd though for something called Aroma Oils.  </li>
            <li> I wish all oils came in large bottles like this one.  </li>
            <li> However I started using Dudu Osun black soap and its &amp;#34;kind of drying&amp;#34; and I was looking for a good natural moisturizer</li>
            <li> I believe that it has already helped with my facial fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product again as it has a soft pleasant smell and actually works.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the light honey, or orange color that I am used to with other pure rose hip seed oils I have purchased in the past, such as the NOW Rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li> it does help with fine lines and moisturizes my dry skin, the reason I tried it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Thanks you for offering such a HUGE 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The applicator is a pump which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I much prefer using this to using creams with all the additives.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some time for this oil at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It also allows my skin to breath, so I don&#x27;t feel hot or get clogged pores (although I don&#x27;t normally use it on my face, unless I get sunburned).</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing very soon.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much time to really use this product.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this product was really fast</li>
            <li> I really like the rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> and I really like that it comes with a dropper.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it.</li>
            <li> I feel that the skin is much smoother than before.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes without feeling &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> very mild.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Does not have much of a scent</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS ROSEHIP OIL.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and does not leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The whole house was fragrant roses.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Does not go on greasy, has a very faint smell so it mixes well with my essential oils, and feels great on my face.. VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the opportunity to test this item.</li>
            <li> Very good~&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> you so much~</li>
            <li> I really like this oil and will buy it again once I have used this bottle.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, and find it to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> In the morning I wake up to a reflection of a younger, softer version of this old face of mine. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my old lady hands and they look better already after only one week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right weight and feel for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> and it seems to soak right in, leaving the skin soft at pliable.  </li>
            <li> First, I was surprised at how large the bottle is.</li>
            <li> I would never go back to the original skin cream.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin super smooth and silky without feeling oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is an oil that easily absorbs into my skin and has a light and delicate smell.</li>
            <li> I really like how it sinks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t have a strong order.</li>
            <li> good... or not good</li>
            <li> The scent is very faint, which is nice some of the Rose Hip Oils I have had in the past were very strong.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little at a time to get good results.</li>
            <li> and I think I will keep the new routine!  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with a few other oils and its wonderful as a moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> Am using it on my face and really like my new silky skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a few days ago and I am loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Especially if the product name is &amp;#34;AromaOils&amp;#34; I was expecting some herbal or exotic scent I can&#x27;t get at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Rosehip Oil for only a short time, but I can tell you it leaves your face feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li> We are going to mix some today up for a facial lotion as the little drops that we used yesterday made the portions of our skin so extremely soft it was amazing!  </li>
            <li> Love that its a large bottle it should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li> Surprised by the large amount.</li>
            <li> the oil is pure and natural.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say, it is lightweight, not greasy, absorbs easily, and is scent-free.</li>
            <li> First the consistency feels less rich than others I&#x27;ve used and the glass packaging is just so-so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like how soft my face feels after using the oil.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the Aroma Oils Rose Hip Seed Oil feels, applies, absorbs, has the same consistence, and fragrance as generic drug store baby oil.  </li>
            <li> good product except for broken pump</li>
            <li> I find this product to be very rich and long lasting.</li>
            <li> the customer service that I recieved has been crazy good!</li>
            <li> I didnt think I would have such great results for such a small price.  </li>
            <li> The company representative apologized and said she would send me a new pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I swear this is a new holy grail prod</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very soft</li>
            <li> I was hesitate at first but after trying it I became a big fan.</li>
            <li> I received a personal email from the owner of the company making sure I received the product timely and in one piece, and we have emailed back and forth with him several times regarding the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how soft this leaves my skin!</li>
            <li> This oil is exactly what I’ve been looking for, so I will be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> and... wow!</li>
            <li> First off it&#x27;s a BIG bottle!</li>
            <li> So far, this is the same great quality of my more expensive brands!!</li>
            <li> The oil absorbed quickly and did not leave behind any greasy feeling and left my hands feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I recieved a email with detailed ways to use the product which has been extremely helpful!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I can already see an improvement in my skin, after using it only a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having some difficulty with the pores on my nose, which have always been large, becoming more clogged lately, but I have not determined that it is from this product since I recently changed a few steps of my skin care routine with the change of weather.</li>
            <li> only reason for knocking half a star is that the packaging box was sealed with two pieces of scotch tape, rather than a more professional closure.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my hands that have been very dry with this cold weather.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Used for a week so far</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy a change from the everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea, so I start with a sulfur based soap, then use a natural toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in a DIY Facial Serum and look forward to experiencing its anti-aging properties that I have read so much about.</li>
            <li> I am also using this directly on my face after cleansing it at night</li>
            <li> This oil is not heavy but it does take a while for it to sink in.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or too light.  </li>
            <li> And the company offers info on how to use it for beginners.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> and it made my face feel so soft</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> After washing and drying, my hair was soft and shining.</li>
            <li> SHE SAID SHE FEEL HER SKIN SOFT AND MOISTURE.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I incorporated this oil into a homemade  skin cream,  and I am  completely hooked.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> bottle says to keep out of direct sunlight</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my face and an old scar.  </li>
            <li> and I have naturally oily skin and deal with breakouts often.</li>
            <li> My bags under my eyes are disappearing slowly but surely, and my skin is softer.</li>
            <li> There is a very slight kind of nutty smell that is completely covered when mixed with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I plan on adding some essential oils, but I love it plain.  </li>
            <li> It has no scent and sinks right in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and affordable alternative to expensive creams!</li>
            <li> This is such a soft, gentle oil and mixes well with other oils to make a fantastic treatment for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I give this product a low rating for two reasons:  First, I contacted the Aroma Oils immediately when I learned the pump dispenser did not work properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so, so not sure how it is doing on any wrinkles, but I am enjoying how it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering such high quality oil.</li>
            <li> Its of high quality and only takes a drop or two.</li>
            <li> Also, in just this short amount of time my fine wrinkles have disappeared &amp; dark patches are beginning to vanish too!</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes have definitely become less apparent.</li>
            <li> only about a week later I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little wary about using an oil as a face moisturizer, but it&#x27;s really lightweight and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy and makes my skin feel so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how big it was!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing them in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am using it to keep a recent surgery scar soft</li>
            <li> My skin is left feeling soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and it was so refreshing to massage it into my tired feet after a hectic day.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product if you have dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Although the price is good due to a special going on, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the box was badly torn and taped back together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days on my face, before I apply my other products, and I have already noticed that my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> WOW,  I made a facial serum with it and some essential oils.</li>
            <li> Also, it is clear and rose hip should be reddish orange if it is cold pressed and has not been through a bleaching process.</li>
            <li> A little oily at first but allow it to adsorb.  </li>
            <li> I have used it straight from the bottle and mixed with some shea butter and other goodies.  </li>
            <li> I will deffinately be ordering this same product, from this same company in the near future.</li>
            <li> It has transformed my dry skin into smooth,baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> This particular oil can get extremely pricy, and I&#x27;ve used several types by shopping around.</li>
            <li> I have used different brands of Rosehip oils and it&#x27;s been very hard to find that right one!</li>
            <li> It is odorless and feels good on my fingertips, however I am afraid to use it and leave on my skin due to there being no seal on it.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural alternative to your average face cream.</li>
            <li> and I think the bottle will last a long time as you only need a couple of drops.  </li>
            <li> hip oil has left my skin dewy,soft and younger looking after a week!Best of all it clears my dry patches</li>
            <li> I am close to my 50&#x27;s and need something that would last all day long to soften my skin and this does.  </li>
            <li> I will be replacing the dropper with a cap seeing that natural oils can break down the plastic in the dropper with time.  </li>
            <li> I live in Northeast Ohio and the winters are quite harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> While the Rosehip oil is advertized for facial skin it was a blessing for my dry skin on my tummy and legs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scary smell like others and it goes on easily.</li>
            <li> spray is easy to use, but has failed to heal was a bit of shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is my go-to eye moisturizer, as it is far less greasy than argan oil and also provokes no allergic response in me.</li>
            <li> The bottle was dark amber with a dropper, however the dropper on mine only fills about a third of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also, when I use it with my body lotion, I felt my body stayed moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft without that heavy greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase another bottle when this one is empty.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see the long term affects</li>
            <li> product is not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;Rapidly absorbed, smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Is neither irritating to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large bottle, I was expecting a very small bottle.  </li>
            <li> I started using it as a carrier oil for other essential oils.  </li>
            <li> After my second child, my face was starting to look a little worn.  </li>
            <li> The bottle should last a long time, because it only takes a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> I had tried other brand rosehip oil before, and their strong weird smell stopped me from using it.</li>
            <li> This person may be used dry.</li>
            <li> Applied to my dry hands as soon as it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> skin was dry cracked leathery</li>
            <li> (It did nothing for her dry skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using this on all my dry skin clients.</li>
            <li> but I am a Senior Citizen and although my skin is dry - I still break out if I am not careful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but my face has a glow to it and has helped with any dry spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mixed it with a few essential oils to hopefully help with my keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> She said I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on products for dry skin and now all I use is rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with a little tea tree oil</li>
            <li> I mixed with just a little coconut oil (because that&#x27;s what I had on hand)</li>
            <li> I am considering blending a little of this in a separate dropper bottle with some essential oils that are beneficial for eyesight.</li>
            <li> I just got empty bottle.</li>
            <li> For the last few days, I&#x27;ve been avoiding moisturizing all the way over my nose with anything, since I have T-zone anyway, and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, and the consistency is thin, but viscous.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s miracles yet because I&#x27;ve only used a few days?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried it before and was curious.  </li>
            <li> Be careful by your eyes though it does take a bit so soak in</li>
            <li> and my kids normally get sick in the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After I cleanse, my face often gets really dry to the point where it feels tight and flaky.</li>
            <li> They are a small company and get a big thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> The other reason I give this product 5 stars is for their customer service.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens when I use it for a longer period and other areas on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my skin every other day.</li>
            <li> When I got it, I mixed it with coconut oil and covered a small area on my skin to test it.</li>
            <li> If you have active acne, this oil might irritate it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, for the record, the bottle I received was dark amber and had dropper, not a pump.</li>
            <li> MY DARK SPOT START  </li>
            <li> DID&#x27;NT FEEL HER DARK  SPOT ANY CHANGE.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is dark.</li>
            <li> I also got a slight sunburn on my face- and decided to use some of this oil on my face-</li>
            <li> I am a little prone to breakouts but did not have a problem with this.  </li>
            <li> I apply it with a little mix of toner in evening.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE LIGHTER,  </li>
            <li> I like Rosehip Oil - 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Organic Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> My face is noticeably softer and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> The pump is helpful and delivers the product , without waste.</li>
            <li> mix with a few drops of jojoba oil for face, Gives my face a glow for about 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to respond in a few weeks to see if it is making a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil now for a few days.......</li>
            <li> , rosehip oil is one of the few oils that prevent aging.</li>
            <li> I usually mix a few drops of lavender oil and the scent is soothing while my skin is being nourished.  </li>
            <li> the dark spot I have is slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> The little lines around my eyes are GONE!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually prone to oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has helped with the wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have been using it in my face wash with a small amount of castille soap.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the origin, but this is the wrong color, consistency and has absolutely no scent (which is not possible for a product that is advertised as cold pressed and unrefined)</li>
            <li> The scent is hardly noticeable and it absorbs so well.  </li>
            <li> you have oily skin and acne prone, I do not suggest this oil, at least not alone.</li>
            <li> I have had insanely crazy dry skin this winter.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> so well - forget those expensive products at the department store (and I used to buy expensive French Products</li>
            <li> Living in the desert,I can get dry patches at times that will look really bad unless I don&#x27;t put any type of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was heart broken.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very subtle scent to the oil, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 64 and have tried everything for my skin, expensive creams and oils.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical on using it on my face bc its an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; and it feels like an oil</li>
            <li> use it for my horrible acne as moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t mess with my face.</li>
            <li> This one is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> so I decided to give this one a try because it was 100% cold pressed with no additives.</li>
            <li> My bottle is dirty</li>
            <li> the pump is not working. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because there was no seal on the product when I received it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just received the Rosehip oil I&#x27;ve tried it two or three times I like the way it feels on my skin haven&#x27;t seen any results yet because I&#x27;ve only used it for two days but I like it so far no smell whatsoever which is great . I will give an update later</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It makes my skin feel silky smooth and I do see a reduction in my wrinkles around my eyes. I did have an issue with the dispenser pump and brought it to Aroma Oils attention. They IMMEDIATELY rectified my problem and sent a replacement. They are a small company and get a big thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> good product except for broken pump&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use oil after washing my face as oil keeps my face moist.</li>
            <li> very good. I like it. it is not greasy and no smell. this is awesome product.</li>
            <li> I use this as a topper. Last step. Wake up and I&#x27;m smoooth</li>
            <li> I give this product a low rating for two reasons:  First, I contacted the Aroma Oils immediately when I learned the pump dispenser did not work properly.  The company representative apologized and said she would send me a new pump dispenser.  It been over a month and I have not received a replacement, working pump dispenser.  Secondly, the Aroma Oils Rose Hip Seed Oil feels, applies, absorbs, has the same consistence, and fragrance as generic drug store baby oil.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how big it was! I&#x27;ve been using it every day on my face as a moisturizer and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will gladly buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!!!  I love this oil so much.  I use it on my face.  I am close to my 50&#x27;s and need something that would last all day long to soften my skin and this does.  I have a scar on my face so I am hoping after time is will not be seen.  This oil does not clog your pores or make your skin oily.  I would never go back to the original skin cream.  I love this oil better.</li>
            <li> Ive never used rosehip oil...thinking this will be a staple in my beauty regime! Love this brand</li>
            <li> OMG! This product is a must have for any woman. I absolutely love it. I have great skin. But this product make it 100% better. I could see the results in one day. I highly recommend this product and would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic with things, but I actually notice my skin looking way better after using this for maybe 4 days. My bags under my eyes are disappearing slowly but surely, and my skin is softer. I&#x27;m going to recommend this for my mom. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great oil.  One of my favorites now!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this oil. I was searching for an oil that has all these qualities and it has worked great for me so far!</li>
            <li> Great product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> My first time using these oils and I am just ecstatic! And for such a great price!?! I will definitely shop again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have had insanely crazy dry skin this winter. While the Rosehip oil is advertized for facial skin it was a blessing for my dry skin on my tummy and legs. I also used on my face and noticed smoother and softer skin but this oil was awesome for my legs and tummy. I would definitely buy this product again as it has a soft pleasant smell and actually works.  The applicator is a pump which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Love it! I was hesitate at first but after trying it I became a big fan. Excellent quality and price :)</li>
            <li> Good product, good seller</li>
            <li> well i don&#x27;t know... good... or not good</li>
            <li> There is no smell really good moisturizer. I like that. This person may be used dry. Thank you good product.</li>
            <li> Reasonable and try to buy again :)</li>
            <li> fluorescent of rose of the product is the most impressive one from the product.&lt;br /&gt;And also, when I use it with my body lotion, I felt my body stayed moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil</li>
            <li> There is no oil. I just got empty bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this and will be buying more! I have been usng it on myself and my son as we both have some eczema. The itchiness is gone and the spots are almost cleared after only using for a week! It&#x27;s a great and affordable alternative to expensive creams!</li>
            <li> The oil is very light and absorbs easily. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. There&#x27;s a very subtle scent to the oil, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, for the record, the bottle I received was dark amber and had dropper, not a pump.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful as both a carrier oil and as a standalone.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> Big size good quality</li>
            <li> This is an amazing non greasy oil, it has made such a difference in my face and hands that I am now trying it on my feet. I love the way it feels!!! I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I an absolutely in love with this oil!! I mix it with jojoba oil,  vitamin&lt;br /&gt;e oil,  and shae butter. This mix I use in my morning routine. Put it on my&lt;br /&gt;face before my shower.  Next I would like to do an activated charcoal, the&lt;br /&gt;oil mix, and sea salt shower soap. I am super excited to use your oil in&lt;br /&gt;that too!!!</li>
            <li> This Rosehip Oil arrived very quickly and I am very happy with the product.  It is light on the skin and I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oil face serum.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> nice oil, light and not too fragrant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and so far I really like it. Like the other reviews say, it is lightweight, not greasy, absorbs easily, and is scent-free. I&#x27;ve been having some difficulty with the pores on my nose, which have always been large, becoming more clogged lately, but I have not determined that it is from this product since I recently changed a few steps of my skin care routine with the change of weather. For the last few days, I&#x27;ve been avoiding moisturizing all the way over my nose with anything, since I have T-zone anyway, and that seems to help. This is a good moisturizer for face and body. You only need to use a little at a time to get good results. The other reason I give this product 5 stars is for their customer service. I received a personal email from the owner of the company making sure I received the product timely and in one piece, and we have emailed back and forth with him several times regarding the product. I appreciate this level of customer service.</li>
            <li> Applied to my dry hands as soon as it arrived.  Worked better than most lotions to moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love it! Great product! Just started using it and already can see a difference. Absorbs quickly and leaves skin looking dewy and soft.</li>
            <li> 4.5 stars. I purchased this oil because it is good for scars and stretch marks, and for mature and dry skin. I&#x27;ve mixed it with a few essential oils to hopefully help with my keratosis pilaris. The oil goes on easily, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin silky with no greasy feel. I&#x27;m also going to mix it with my stretch mark cream. I love the moisturizing properties so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for knocking half a star is that the packaging box was sealed with two pieces of scotch tape, rather than a more professional closure. The bottle was dark amber with a dropper, however the dropper on mine only fills about a third of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is awesome! I use it daily on my face and all over my body. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  only been using this product for a week as a face moisturizer twice a day. My face is noticeably softer and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily. I am amazed so far, can&#x27;t  wait to see more results!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great. You don&#x27;t need much, and the consistency is thin, but viscous. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and hair with great results. It&#x27;s the right weight and feel for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how soft this leaves my skin! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so, so not sure how it is doing on any wrinkles, but I am enjoying how it leaves my skin feeling. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Used for a week so far and I can already tell a huge difference. Skin is softer and brighter. I love it!</li>
            <li> I received your Rosehip oil and I have to say I love it I have used different brands of Rosehip oils and it&#x27;s been very hard to find that right one! Well I have found the one that fits for me. I will continue to use this brand as I love it. I am glad to have found a great and pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Having enjoyed using this oil! Awesome!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My skin has never felt so smooth &amp; not greasy at all! It&#x27;s a different type of sensation that I can&#x27;t explain, but it a wonderful one!!! Don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s miracles yet because I&#x27;ve only used a few days? Regardless, the feel is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. I much prefer using this to using creams with all the additives. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  Goes on light, absorbs well. Does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all.  Gives my face a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Very good~~! Thank you!!! ^^</li>
            <li> Love this! It makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I love this rose hip oil! In the evening I use the rose hip oil in combination with Jojoba and vitamin E oil and it makes my skin feel so soft. I use one squirt of the rose hip oil, which is just enough to cover my face. I like that it penetrates quickly into my skin. Then I follow up with Jojoba oil and dab on Vitamin E oil in spots. In the morning I wake up to a reflection of a younger, softer version of this old face of mine. :-)</li>
            <li> arrived on time nice light oil soaks in fast I&#x27;ve been using it on my old lady hands and they look better already after only one week.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase. First, I was surprised at how large the bottle is. I have been using this type of oil for a while but this is my first time with this product. The scent is very faint, which is nice some of the Rose Hip Oils I have had in the past were very strong. I apply this at night after I wash my face and LOVE it. It is not an overly heavy oil and soaks in very nice.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some time for this oil at a reasonable price. Thank you for offering such high quality oil.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  So I just purchased my second bottle of Rosehip Oil.  I really like this product. My kids and I use it daily.  I normally mix it with &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; and rub it on our feet for an immunity boost- which is great since school just started and my kids normally get sick in the first couple of weeks. I also use it as a carrier oil for my &amp;#34;stress ease&amp;#34; oil as well as &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; oil at bedtime.  It makes my skin super smooth and silky without feeling oily or heavy.  It also allows my skin to breath, so I don&#x27;t feel hot or get clogged pores (although I don&#x27;t normally use it on my face, unless I get sunburned). Overall I still love this product and highly recommend it.  I purchased this item to use on my dry skin.  I&#x27;ve never purchased Rosehip oil before, but I&#x27;m a big fan of essential oils, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  It really doesn&#x27;t have a scent- which is nice because it won&#x27;t mask my perfumes or body sprays I wear daily.  It did soften my skin without making it feel oily.  I also got a slight sunburn on my face- and decided to use some of this oil on my face- and it worked great.  It soaked into my skin rather quickly and didn&#x27;t feel oily at all.  It&#x27;s a nice light pleasant oil.  I would purchase this again for sure. UPDATE TO REVIEW:  I&#x27;ve now been using this oil every day.  I started using it as a carrier oil for other essential oils.  This oil doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, so it works great as a carrier oil for lavender at bedtime.  I&#x27;ve also used it with &amp;#34;thieves oil&amp;#34; on myself and kids.  Works great as a carrier oil- a little bit goes a long way.  I hope to purchase again soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about this oil.  I&#x27;ve never used Rosehip Oil before but I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various oils for moisturizing and face cream replacements.  This oil has made my face feel fantastic!  It&#x27;s smooth and works in quickly.  There is no smell or fragrance and no greasy feeling afterward.  I just had surgery and I will be using this oil to see how it does to help with the scar healing.</li>
            <li> I just received this rosehip oil, and am impressed with everything.  The packaging, the bottle, and definitely the oil!  I love how this goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  This oil is exactly what I’ve been looking for, so I will be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> Very nice dry oil. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> ok...so I got this and was so excited to make some face serum and I dropped the bottle and it shattered!  I was able to salvage about an ounce that was still in the bottom of the bottle.  I ran it through a coffee filter just in case there were glass shards.  I was heart broken.  As far as the product goes, I love it!  The scent is hardly noticeable and it absorbs so well.  I mixed it with a few other oils and its wonderful as a moisturizer!  I will be purchasing very soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing them in the near future.</li>
            <li> I had tried other brand rosehip oil before, and their strong weird smell stopped me from using it. I am glad that I give this one a try. It doesn&#x27;t have a scary smell like others and it goes on easily. I used it on my neck because lines on my neck need a lot of attention. It absorbs fast. I definitely feel the oil on my neck but it is not bothersome. I have used it for 3 days now and I like it so far. I also tried it on my psoriasis spots, it seems to ease the itchiness pretty well. I haven&#x27;t felt itchy for couple days now. I would recommend this rosehip oil. I got this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The above is my unbiased review for this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil.  I love the way it hydrates my skin.  I have used it straight from the bottle and mixed with some shea butter and other goodies.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  Seriously.  I was hesitant but had read good things about rosehip oil.  I use a moisturizer with sunscreen every morning but never anything at night.  After my second child, my face was starting to look a little worn.  I started using this at night before bed and only about a week later I can really tell a difference.  The little lines around my eyes are GONE!  My face feels smoother and I think I will keep the new routine!  I am a little prone to breakouts but did not have a problem with this.  I have combination skin but this oil is light and absorbs quickly.  Works great and I think the bottle will last a long time as you only need a couple of drops.  It&#x27;s a deal compared to anything in the drugstore.  And a bonus is there are no chemicals!</li>
            <li> Love it ,my hands are  dry it has stopped the cracking and they feel so much better and also use on my face and feet  Love it</li>
            <li> This oil is AMAZING! Not only does is make you skin feel incredible but the customer service that I recieved has been crazy good! I recieved a email with detailed ways to use the product which has been extremely helpful! LOVE! I will be recommending to others for sure!</li>
            <li> The rose hip oil comes nicely packaged in a box with the pump separate to help ensure that there is no leakage.  The bottle is safety sealed.  I really like how soft my face feels after using the oil.  There is a very slight kind of nutty smell that is completely covered when mixed with essential oils.  It also mixes well for your DIY face creams.  I would definitely suggest this one and I would purchase it again.  The fine lines around my eyes have definitely become less apparent.</li>
            <li> Lovely texture..not greasy..sinks into skin within seconds. This is my first purchase of rosehip oil, and chose your product due to good reviews and affordability. Thankyou for good service and excellent product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This arrived promptly. It absorbed rapidly and added moisture and a healthy glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is very fresh even though it&#x27;s oil~!! I&#x27;m using this Rosehip oil for massage.</li>
            <li> Surprised by the large amount. I&#x27;ve been using this Rose Hip Oil for just a couple of weeks however, right away I noticed how emollient &amp; soothing it is! My skin is glowing &amp; feels wonderful! During the first week of use many people (including strangers) kept coming up to me to ask what I use on my on my skin &amp; said how radiant, healthy &amp; youthful it looks! Also, in just this short amount of time my fine wrinkles have disappeared &amp; dark patches are beginning to vanish too! I can not wait to see how I look after several more weeks of use! I recommend this product to everyone! The disadvantage is that the pump is not robust.</li>
            <li> Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is suitable for every women.</li>
            <li> Medical Esthetician&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this after evaluating a clients skin.&lt;br /&gt;Her skin was dry cracked leathery so I recommend a diabetic skin product I carry. (It did nothing for her dry skin). She came in to see me last week her skin looked amazing! I asked her what are you using? She said you&#x27;ll never believe it. I said tell me because it&#x27;s obviously working. She said I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on products for dry skin and now all I use is rosehip oil. She sold me! I&#x27;m now using this on all my dry skin clients.</li>
            <li> I love it. First very good price, 2nd very fast delivery</li>
            <li> I use Rosehip regularly from another seller. This one is a disappointment. First the consistency feels less rich than others I&#x27;ve used and the glass packaging is just so-so. Also information on use and benefits is sent in a downloadable PDF which I could not open. Customer support wasn&#x27;t great so I used a printed info from another manufacturer. All in all just an ok product.</li>
            <li> Love this..No smell non greasy</li>
            <li> Product arrived a few days ago and I am loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great oil! I bought this to use in a DIY face serum but haven&#x27;t made it yet. I did try this Rosehip oil out on my hands and was very impressed. The oil absorbed quickly and did not leave behind any greasy feeling and left my hands feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this! It smells so good. Great additive to beauty products. I should have ordered it in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the customer service is even better!</li>
            <li> The product is nice, you can feel it benefit your skin immediately after application. After I cleanse, my face often gets really dry to the point where it feels tight and flaky. I used to add a cream, but that would clog my pores and make my skin overproduce oils. This stuff is light and instantaneously moisturizing. It also soaks in quickly, which is an added bonus, and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my oily skin work overtime. The only thing, I wish it had a scent. I suppose unscented is good for some but I enjoy a change from the everyday.  Especially if the product name is &amp;#34;AromaOils&amp;#34; I was expecting some herbal or exotic scent I can&#x27;t get at the local grocery store. Other than that, it really is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Good products. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing not greasy at all, use it for all kinds of stuff, but mainly to put on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love that this product has to lids. The pump is helpful and delivers the product , without waste. The oil is superb. Absorbs quickly. Thank you .</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  Nice consistency.  Perfect for mixing with my favorite EO!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much time to really use this product. I have used it a couple of times on my face after cleansing as a moisturizer. I love that it absorbs quickly and makes my face feel really soft. The shipping on this product was really fast and I will be ordering more from this company!</li>
            <li> This Rose Hip Oil is scentless and it absorbs very easily without shining or feeling greasy.  I plan on adding some essential oils, but I love it plain.  It makes my face feel very soft.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the rosehip oil.  The oil is very absorbent and perfect for face and hands. I hope to try combine the rosehip with jojoba oil soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your great product.</li>
            <li> I received this product for a discounted price for an honest review, although I was waiting for an aroma when I applied it, I did not get a strong odor, it felt wonderful on the skin and did not leave a slimy greasy feel to my skin, which is a huge plus in my book,I love to use products that feel good on the skin but does not leave you feeling like you have to wash your hands right away after applying!I used this on my hands,feet and elbows and it makes them feel so moisturized.If you are looking for something to use and do not want a strong odor,this one is for you!</li>
            <li> I am 64 and have tried everything for my skin, expensive creams and oils.  I love the way  my  face looks after a week of using rose hips oil.  I think the fine lines look smoother and  feel very  soft .  I didnt think I would have such great results for such a small price.  My husband has more wrinkles  than I and is having good results ,too.  i know  this has become one thing i will keep using.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now as part of my daily skin routine. I have rosacea, so I start with a sulfur based soap, then use a natural toner. I follow that up with hyaluronic acid, then this rosehip oil. The hyaluronic acid helps it absorb more effectively into skin. I do this in the morning and at night, and my skin has been absolutely glowing! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this rosehip oil, it is amazing!</li>
            <li> This oil is very light and super absorbent. My skin feels soft without that heavy greasy feel. It is a nice big bottle and I really like that it comes with a dropper. I only rec&#x27;d it today, so, I only used it once. But, so far I am very pleased. My skin even appears brighter!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is a delight to use. There is no odor and it seems to soak right in, leaving the skin soft at pliable.  It doesn&#x27;t come off onto your clothes. I am using it to keep a recent surgery scar soft and it is doing a good job of that. The bottle should last a long time, because it only takes a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> This oil is OK. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the light honey, or orange color that I am used to with other pure rose hip seed oils I have purchased in the past, such as the NOW Rose hip seed oil. This oil also has no aroma, which is kind of funny since the name of the company is &amp;#34;Aroma Oils&amp;#34;. Although the price is good due to a special going on, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the box was badly torn and taped back together. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this one ever again. Thanks</li>
            <li> My skin looks awesome.  Customer service has been very attentive.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment and Good Quality. Smell was not Strong but good 가성비 좋아요 :D</li>
            <li> Recommended , the best is really good.</li>
            <li> Great item! Nice amount in the bottle. 4 oz doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but it is a good amount. Seems to work pretty well!</li>
            <li> Love this! Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it. I use it to help reduce wrinkles and scars. I have only used this product for three weeks now.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a carrier oil and took a chance with Aroma Oils Rosehip Oil.  I am SO GLAD I did!  This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s not super oily, the quality is great and the size of the bottle is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;This has not only been a great oil to add essential oils to, it has also replaced my face moisturiser as well as body lotion (when mixed with coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;This oil is great for moisturising and is great for fine lines and wrinkles AND a small bit makes a great hair serum!&lt;br /&gt;Will totally purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> Best Quality~!! Thanks~!!</li>
            <li> I just received my Rosehip oil from Aromaoils. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. I live in Northeast Ohio and the winters are quite harsh on my skin. I use Rosehip oil on my face before bed. It&#x27;s very light and feels great on my skin. A little goes a long way. I usually mix a few drops of lavender oil and the scent is soothing while my skin is being nourished.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works on everything! I am learning more and more about it every day!</li>
            <li> It works on me smoothly. Recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is terrific! I like to add a drop of lavender and massage into my face, neck, and shoulders before bed. It does not leave my skin greasy, but just soft and smooth. My Rosehip Oil arrived very well-packaged and quickly. I definitely recommend trying this out. I even add some to my shampoo and to my dog&#x27;s shampoo as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> This works well &amp; smells great</li>
            <li> I apply it with a little mix of toner in evening. I feel that the skin is much smoother than before.</li>
            <li> I have been using this under my makeup every morning. It really moisturizes without feeling &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s nice and light also.</li>
            <li> good~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;fast shiped..</li>
            <li> My wife will be very good. The wife want to buy more.</li>
            <li> Came in a great box.. Leaves my skin feeling very soft I would recommend this to anyone. Doesn&#x27;t effects senstove skin</li>
            <li> first time user of this oil. But I am amazed at the moisturizing benefit from this product. Its of high quality and only takes a drop or two. I use this product as part of my nightly routine and have fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil!! I just received my bottle of AromaOils Rose Hip Seed Oil this week. I&#x27;m using it in a DIY Facial Serum and look forward to experiencing its anti-aging properties that I have read so much about. Rose Hip Seed Oil is also suppose to be good for scar reduction. It is an oil that easily absorbs into my skin and has a light and delicate smell. Thanks AromaOils!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of essential oils and was eager to try this one. The shipment came on time and I was impressed by the size of the bottle. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days on my face, before I apply my other products, and I have already noticed that my skin is looking better. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens when I use it for a longer period and other areas on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is such a soft, gentle oil and mixes well with other oils to make a fantastic treatment for dry skin.  I mixed it with a little tea tree oil and it was so refreshing to massage it into my tired feet after a hectic day.  I am also using this directly on my face after cleansing it at night and I just love how light and gentle it is on my skin.</li>
            <li> great oil. good value!</li>
            <li> very good. very mild.&lt;br /&gt;but the pump is not working. :(</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! It really moisturizes my skin amazingly and it soaks in real good so my skin isn&#x27;t all oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving a review after using this oil for about a week. I have combination skin with a bit of acne scar riddled over my cheek. I bought this oil because I heard rosehip oil is good for acne and acne scar. After doing more research on essential oils, I learned a bit more what it is my skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin and acne prone, I do not suggest this oil, at least not alone. This oil is not heavy but it does take a while for it to sink in. For me, it hydrated my skin throughout the day without making it feel oily. My skin is left feeling soft throughout the day. However, because it is hydrating, it also did nothing to help with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is used for acne scars. If you have active acne, this oil might irritate it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a base oil, this oil is great. I&#x27;ve noticed my acne scars have diminished the week I have used it. I use it at night for my bag and fine lines, and the area around my eyes have gotten lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use this again for scar diminishing. There is no scent too, which I like.</li>
            <li> Great Value!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rosehip oil for quite some time, and this is not Rosehip oil. Not sure of the origin, but this is the wrong color, consistency and has absolutely no scent (which is not possible for a product that is advertised as cold pressed and unrefined) Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Awesome Rosehip oil. Absorbs fast and leaves my skin moisturized! Great product.</li>
            <li> Loved this oil, I use it on my face and neck, makes an excellent moisturizer. I don&#x27;t know why but I assumed that it would smell of heavenly roses, but it doesn&#x27;t, there is not a fragrance to it. I would have loved it with a spray attachment.</li>
            <li> Received this oil today. I am imprewith the quality and can not wait to use it in my products.</li>
            <li> I feel so fortunate to have found this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I love using oil on my skin - but I am a Senior Citizen and although my skin is dry - I still break out if I am not careful.&lt;br /&gt;This oil suits my skin so well - forget those expensive products at the department store (and I used to buy expensive French Products and then even more expensive organic versions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to the product such great customer service - follow up - and again - terrific product!&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic and I have already given samples to my daughters!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to recommend you - this is such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations and thank you for offering this all of us - I am so glad that I found you!</li>
            <li> Love this.  I&#x27;ve never tried it before and was curious.  It soaks right in and does not make your skin feel oily.  I&amp;#34;m using it specifically on my upper lip for smokers lines and it seems to smooth them out just a tad.  I will definitely keep using and am very happy with this particular brand.</li>
            <li> Quality oil! Great for my serums!</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE OUTSTANDING!!! Will buy more when out!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Saw immediate improvement in my face, especially reduced pores.  Great product for use day and night.</li>
            <li> Love it!! And it is working wonders for my skin. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This oil is a wonderful moisturizer and makes my skin so soft and moist w/o feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast ,very large bottle.no fragrance to it  so it&#x27;s not how you would think of roses. Which ive read is normal since this isn&#x27;t rose but the seeds .I was pleased it didn&#x27;t smell floral .  Started using around my eyes for fine lines and see a great improvement in my skins glow ! Very pleased</li>
            <li> I like the feel after application. I have only been using the product for a week. I hope I continue to like it.</li>
            <li> Great oil for your skin!</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion. This oil is wonderful for face and body as well.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I am using it in a blend for my face. So far it is great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Am using it on my face and really like my new silky skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing, light oil! Love it! Great for skin!</li>
            <li> Oil goes on smoothly.  Does not have much of a scent--I am glad about that!  Works great on my face-not oily</li>
            <li> great price.amazing for skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil leaves skin so soft</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail. I&#x27;m very impressed with the size of the bottle and contents. I use Rose hip oil almost exclusively for skin care. Thank you for the great discount price and the opportunity to try your product. This is a honest and unbiased opinion of this product. The PDF has informative information that a first time user of rose hip oil will find very helpful.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this Rosehip oil.  I have used many anti-aging products and this one actually has had positive results.  First it is all natural and there are studies that say some of the ingredients in anti-aging products are really not good to use.  Second it does help with fine lines and moisturizes my dry skin, the reason I tried it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Love the Rose Hip oil! Friendly, fast service...very pleased. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I think this product hits the mark! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Not too heavy or too light.  Absorbs very well; does not just sit on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> Very light and pleasant oil. Nice carrier oil.</li>
            <li> This particular oil can get extremely pricy, and I&#x27;ve used several types by shopping around. So far, this is the same great quality of my more expensive brands!! Won&#x27;t be overspensing on those anymore! And the company offers info on how to use it for beginners.</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect for aging skin. I add some carrot seed oil and apply twice a day to my face and neck. It soaks so you won&#x27;t have an oily finish. I also put it on scars to minimize their appearance. A must for any good skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because there was no seal on the product when I received it. It is odorless and feels good on my fingertips, however I am afraid to use it and leave on my skin due to there being no seal on it. Also, it is clear and rose hip should be reddish orange if it is cold pressed and has not been through a bleaching process.</li>
            <li> Great oil for nighttime use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually prone to oily skin so I was a little wary about using an oil as a face moisturizer, but it&#x27;s really lightweight and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy and makes my skin feel so smooth and soft!  I especially like the way it feels going on as an eye moisturizer.  After just one application, my skin already looks nice and hydrated and smooth.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this oil and will be buying more for sure!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this rose hip oil. I&#x27;d suggest this to anyone. I&#x27;m using it on my face as a moisturizer and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes a wonderful moisturizer for my face. Makes my skin feel soft to the touch. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy. My skin feels and looks good.</li>
            <li> I started using this on my face as soon as I got it and it made my face feel so soft, if applied evenly it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to soak in and your face looks and feels really nice!</li>
            <li> Love this oil... it&#x27;s a great substitute for lotions.  Keeps my babies moist... and smell pleasant.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my skin every other day. It gives me a nice healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these.  I am really happy with this purchase and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS ROSEHIP OIL.  DOES NOT LEAVE YOUR SKIN OILY, IT ABSORBS INTO YOUR SKIN.  SO FAR SO GOOD.  SHIPPED AND ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY.  VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Since using this I have noticed my face seems smoother and the dark spot I have is slowly diminishing. It absorbs fast and does not leave my face feeling greasy. I use it twice a day, morning and evenings</li>
            <li> The pump does not work.</li>
            <li> I love rose hip oil!Onhad read so many reviews on how it is the best moisturizer for your face so I decided to give this one a try because it was 100% cold pressed with no additives.It has transformed my dry skin into smooth,baby soft skin.Living in the desert,I can get dry patches at times that will look really bad unless I don&#x27;t put any type of moisturizer.Lotions and creams have stopped working well for me,and I am trying to take a more natural approach with my skin care.This rose hip oil has left my skin dewy,soft and younger looking after a week!Best of all it clears my dry patches and I don&#x27;t have to worry about side effects!I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural alternative to your average face cream.</li>
            <li> Satisfactory quality and price.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil.  I am using it on my face and neck and the softness is immediate and not greasy.  You also don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil, I love how fresh my face looks after. I&#x27;m not sure if it has helped with the wrinkles but my face has a glow to it and has helped with any dry spots. Be careful by your eyes though it does take a bit so soak in and I end up with it in it.</li>
            <li> using it still thank you</li>
            <li> Really like this product, it has a great texture and I was looking for an organic product  to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Very good experience and wonderful company to do business with!  Enjoying my Rosehip Oil very much.  I love how it goes on my skin and isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> Rose bought really liked. The whole house was fragrant roses.</li>
            <li> mix with a few drops of jojoba oil for face, Gives my face a glow for about 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> Starting from the product inde satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;Rapidly absorbed, smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Is neither irritating to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like spray is easy to use, but has failed to heal was a bit of shine.&lt;br /&gt;That was not the product is good to be a problem.</li>
            <li> Fantastic oil.  Non greasy, no odor.  I love using this for my home made cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on a couple of scars that I have and it has improved the appearance of the scars.  I don&#x27;t like it on my face as it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well on my face.  I also like that there is no scent.  That is kind of odd though for something called Aroma Oils.  The size of this bottle is great.  I wish all oils came in large bottles like this one.  I will definitely purchase another bottle when this one is empty.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Oil is wonderful.  It leaves your skin so soft.  A little oily at first but allow it to adsorb.  You will love it!  I highly recommend it to anyone! I use it on my body and esp my face!  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Just received yesterday and I used it before I went to bed. I mixed with just a little coconut oil (because that&#x27;s what I had on hand) it felt wonderful on my face. I think this is going to be a regular for me.</li>
            <li> No scent detectible, a smooth application, and I have found it does indeed improve the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great ,would buy again.</li>
            <li> The Aroma Rose His Seed oil is wonderful on my skin!</li>
            <li> LOVE this carrier oil! Does not go on greasy, has a very faint smell so it mixes well with my essential oils, and feels great on my face.. VERY pleased. Love that it is in a  glass bottle with a dropper to get the right amount out that I need. It also came in quickly.</li>
            <li> The oil has a light refreshing fragrance and absorbs quickly into my skin.  I look forward to using this as a part of some healing essential oil formulations.  Very happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  Very Pretty light scent and so luxurious to use.  I believe that it has already helped with my facial fine lines and wrinkles.  Thanks you for offering such a HUGE 4 oz. bottle as an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Using to help dimish scars.</li>
            <li> Large bottle, I was expecting a very small bottle.  Works great,  use it for my horrible acne as moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t mess with my face.</li>
            <li> This came yesterday and already my daughter and I are in love with it.  We are going to mix some today up for a facial lotion as the little drops that we used yesterday made the portions of our skin so extremely soft it was amazing!  We most assuredly will be buying this product again and again.  Thank you so much for the opportunity to test this item.</li>
            <li> I used it for hair conditioner, leaving it on for about 30 min. After washing and drying, my hair was soft and shining.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product! I&#x27;ve had it about a week and can definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS ROSEHIP OIL FOR MYSELF.  IT WORKING FOR MYSELF.  SINCE I USE THIS ROSEHIP, MY DARK SPOT START  A LITTLE LIGHTER,  SO I BOUGHT ANOTHER BOTTLE FOR MY MOM.  SHE SAID SHE FEEL HER SKIN SOFT AND MOISTURE.  BUT SHE DID&#x27;NT FEEL HER DARK  SPOT ANY CHANGE. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and was fully sealed when delivered. This product came with a dropper.  I will be replacing the dropper with a cap seeing that natural oils can break down the plastic in the dropper with time.  When I got it, I mixed it with coconut oil and covered a small area on my skin to test it. I have sensitive skin so I always test a small area first. No reaction.  So I only placed it on one arm to see how it would make my skin feel.  The next day, my arm was softer and my complexion looked clearer. There was no greasy feel.  I will be using this great product every day.</li>
            <li> the oil is pure and natural. no gmo or fillers added.  I use it on my face and the crows feet disappeared with the first use.  I am using it in my make up and creams that i make.  I love this product and the size of the bottle is 4 oz. a lot for the money an excellent product.  I will be buying his again.  Thanks to aroma oils for the product!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was packaged very nicely. The oil is light and goes on my skin very smoothly. I&#x27;ll have to respond in a few weeks to see if it is making a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - great for skin ( specifically when mixed with emu oil) I have been using it in my face wash with a small amount of castille soap. I also found that this is the best thing to remove my super waterproof mascara. my eyes lashes seem healther and longer.</li>
            <li> I incorporated this oil into a homemade  skin cream,  and I am  completely hooked.  The oil made the cream silky without leaving my skin oily. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;Useful Products</li>
            <li> This is probably the best thing I have ever used on my face.  As soon as I put it on, it begins to soften my skin.  It goes on easy, and the skin just drinks it in and immediately feels hydrated, smooth and not greasy.  I use it in the morning under makeup and again at night after washing my face before going to bed. I am also putting it on the tops of my hands.  It has helped the dryness and wrinkles already.  This is a wonderful product and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Very good~&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much~</li>
            <li> Love love love this product I use it under my makeup and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good to use! reasonable and worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this with my diffuser!! strongly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised and has been great.  The oil is absorbed into my skin and never feels greasy!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my hands that have been very dry with this cold weather. I like it also because it does not leave them feeling greasy. Blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is my go-to eye moisturizer, as it is far less greasy than argan oil and also provokes no allergic response in me. I am considering blending a little of this in a separate dropper bottle with some essential oils that are beneficial for eyesight. This is also effective as a nail and cuticle moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very nice and light but moisturizing oil. My whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil now for a few days.......WOW,  I made a facial serum with it and some essential oils. My skin feels like silk when I put it on, Not greasy and it absorbs very fast. Will be buying again and telling my friends about it!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil and will buy it again once I have used this bottle.  It absorbs quickly and I can already see an improvement in my skin, after using it only a short time.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I used it on my face after my shower.  It is not greasy and there is no scent so it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume.  It made my skin feel soft.  I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! I&#x27;m in love with these, these are definitely something to&lt;br /&gt;keep around.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I really love it especially the speed in which it was delivered.</li>
            <li> I have received the Rosehip oil and use it twice a day on my face and&lt;br /&gt;neck.  I love how it absorbs so quickly into my skin and does not clog&lt;br /&gt;pores. It leaves my skin moisturized, smooth and smelling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says to keep out of direct sunlight so I&#x27;ve put the oil in a&lt;br /&gt;brown glass bottle. I also dispense it with a dropper which I find to be&lt;br /&gt;easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has become a necessity for my skin care needs and I look&lt;br /&gt;forward to seeing results of continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for creating and distributing such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Rosehip Oil for only a short time, but I can tell you it leaves your face feeling silky smooth! It absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.  Highly recommend this product if you have dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Great Product! one of my favorite oils!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. Aroma Oils is super at getting shipments out fast, and have been great at communicating with me. I would definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> My bottle is dirty But i like it. Because this rosehipoil absorbs very quickly and have a week scent. I think It will be good if it was cheaper. Thank you for good promotion and good product</li>
            <li> I find this product to be very rich and long lasting. I only use it for my face after every wash, which is every day and I am happy with how soft and healthy my skin feels through out the day. The delivery was fast. I will deffinately be ordering this same product, from this same company in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very light oil. It absorbs into the skin very quickly. So I don&#x27;t have to worry about making my pillows yellow or my hair oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, rosehip oil is one of the few oils that prevent aging.</li>
            <li> This is not Rosehip Oil...Rosehip oil is dark. I don&#x27;t know what oil this is...</li>
            <li> I hav only used this product for a day and... wow! I dont think im gonna need moisturizer anytime soon. . My skin is so dewy and illuminated. I swear this is a new holy grail prod</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> First off it&#x27;s a BIG bottle! So great amount for the price!! I really like how it sinks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t have a strong order. Makes your skin smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Wonderful essential oil.  Works great to diminish scars.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It has no scent and sinks right in.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my face and an old scar.  Love that its a large bottle it should last a very long time.</li>

            <li> I have never used this oil but I have read about it and wanted to try. I was skeptical on using it on my face bc its an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; and it feels like an oil and I have naturally oily skin and deal with breakouts often. However I started using Dudu Osun black soap and its &amp;#34;kind of drying&amp;#34; and I was looking for a good natural moisturizer and I think ive found it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Rosehip Oil, my daughter and I have both been using it since it arrived. The pump on the bottle makes it so easy to use, ever so handy. The Rosehip Oil is very light, not greasy feeling at all, and has a very light fragrance. We have used it on our faces and hands, with noticeable results. I highly recommend this oil, and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Great for diluting my essential oils. I also love the feel of my skin after using this.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I feel thankful to use this product. I want to recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Really nice and light conditions well. Love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> You can use a variety of useful products are also recommended, we will use</li>
            <li> This oil is very light, and absorbs quickly. I use it on my face, and find it to be very moisturizing.</li>
