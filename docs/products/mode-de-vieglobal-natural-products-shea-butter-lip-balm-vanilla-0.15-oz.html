            <li>This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Best lip stuff ever...</li>
            <li>It is truly the best-</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is really wonderful-</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a superior product, you&#x27;ve found it!</li>
            <li>this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great for chapped lips season.  </li>
            <li>but this one is the one that works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>I had read that shea butter is supposed to be really good for chapped lips</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I buy lip balms often, but I have not found anything as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I had stopped buying Karite Lips for a while because I found a good lip balm for a lower price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always in the market for something good and effective.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely too.</li>
            <li>After doing loads of research, and finding sulfate, or what have you, is an ingredient in majority of popular name-brands, I was determined to go all-natural and hope all these reviews were honest.</li>
            <li>A great product that is worth the money!</li>
            <li>It provides great moisturizing properties to my full lips.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant light neutral scent.</li>
            <li>go on very easy during winter months because the wax hardens up</li>
            <li>Most amazing lip balm that&#x27;s why I buy 10 at a time</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lip stuff I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>It used to have so much more Shea butter and a really delicious natural vanilla flavor.  </li>
            <li>moisture is very important.</li>
            <li>I think I would be pretty happy if I didn&#x27;t know how much better used to be.</li>
            <li>after years of dependency on inferior drugstore balms, i was able to ween myself off of lip balm in all but the coldest winter months.  </li>
            <li>Only chapstick that I don&#x27;t have to keep re-applying, the best!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lip balms and I think this is the best.</li>
            <li>my lips more supple.</li>
            <li>and when I wake up, it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm of all time.  </li>
            <li>Love the vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth, not waxy.  </li>
            <li>This is my #1 favorite lip balm of all time.</li>
            <li>Now it feels/smells like mostly wax.  </li>
            <li>Meh okay, way overpriced</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li>Hands down best lip balm I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>In the 20+ years of using ALL manners of lip glosses, lip balms and lip sticks, this is the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is perfectly acceptable but not fantastic.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light feel, this is not your product.</li>
            <li>This made my lips ubber smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent though, not too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel the original leaves</li>
            <li>After a misunderstanding on my part, Nutricity(the seller) was more than willing to ensure customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Mode de vie is the most amazing chap stick I have ever used, this product is second to none</li>
            <li>It smells good, goes on smoothly &amp; lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Recently had to substitute with another brand which does not have the vanilla &amp; it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>Tastes and smells slightly sweet without being offensive.  </li>
            <li>Even though the product title says 0.15 oz, most people don&#x27;t know what 0.15 oz really looks like.</li>
            <li>I actually have had a lot of people ask about it because of how good it smells.</li>
            <li>feel most comfortable using natural lip balm considering that it goes on our lips</li>
            <li>It has replaced all of my other lip products because aside from being good for your lips it smells amazing!It goes on thick and brings out the best of your lips.</li>
            <li>Ihave tried many lip balms, but MODE DE VIE far surpasses them all!</li>
            <li>This is my second tube of this balm, I love it!</li>
            <li>This is still a good product for sure, but you can find comparable or better for the same price or less.</li>
            <li>Winter or summer, no matter, it&#x27;s great for year round use.  </li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love the shea butter, as it provided natural sunscreen and moisture.  </li>
            <li>But if you ignore the price, the product itself is great and definitely keeps my lips soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I find this product works much better than the natural beeswax-based balms out there.</li>
            <li>This used to be my all-time favorite lip balm until they changed the ingredients, made it smaller and significantly raised the price.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t anything like it out right now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to track it down on amazon!</li>
            <li>Thanks I am  loyal customer.</li>
            <li>These are definitely as good as it, but the price is little bit overkill.</li>
            <li>i bought the first stick over 3 years ago and it has lasted until now.  </li>
            <li>I put this lip balm on my lips at night and in the morning I have soft, smooth  lips.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes great and last a long time without having to reapply.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Looks exactly like Chapstick.</li>
            <li>but This product wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had in mind.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, something has changed.  </li>
            <li>; teen sons have given up their &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; Chapstick in favor of this Karite Lips because they say it just works better.</li>
            <li>As good as it is, I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t quite remember where I first scored a tube.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a .15oz tube, but I can&#x27;t say I regret buying it at all, as my lips have genuinely never been more smooth or grateful for this product.</li>
            <li>I believe I first discovered it at a Whole Foods store.</li>
            <li>There is a slight vanilla scent, but it dissipates very quickly, so there is no annoying flavor lingering on the lips.  </li>
            <li>have rather large lips</li>
            <li>This lip balm moisturize your lips effectively and you will not have to keep reapplying the lip balm on your lips because just a little bit applied to your lips</li>
            <li>This amazing balm healed me within a few days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the Vanilla as much as the regular/original with no scent.</li>
            <li>I had tried everything including straight Neosporin and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>The formula is thicker than a gloss thus stays on for much longer.</li>
            <li>I am a flight attendant so</li>
            <li>The photo is also very misleading.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have used this lip balm for more than 6 years now and haven&#x27;t used anything else (despite trying other brands).  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, I highly recommend this particular seller!</li>
            <li>Lip Balm that isn&#x27;t sticky, makes my lips smooth, and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Always smooth, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Ever since I discovered this shea butter lip balm (vanilla) by Mode de Vie, I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with any other lip balm!</li>
            <li>so I was looking for something with that as the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>Highly emollient.  </li>
            <li>Many lip balms have peppermint oil, which can actually irritate the lips, or other flavors, so it is hard to find a good unflavored one like Karite Lips.  </li>
            <li>but normally would be a 5</li>
            <li>My lips do not feel soothed by this product with the new formula.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>They should change the photo to show the new tube.  </li>
            <li>But the product is completely different now; it has a harder, more waxy texture.  </li>
            <li>Soft normal lips all day.</li>
            <li>But since it&#x27;s the exact same shape and size as Chapstick, every time I look at it, I think I&#x27;m paying $8 for Chapstick even though I know it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>the ingredient list is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>In fact the picture and all the writing on the tube is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>KISSABLY soft (smooch)!  </li>
            <li>One of the very few lip balms on the market that my lips love.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried, with a high percentage of shea butter and a couple of other natural ingredients, including real vanilla.</li>
            <li>I compared the exterior of the tubes of the old and new and</li>
            <li>I scrape out old tubes of this before I buy new ones because I can&#x27;t stand the idea of wasting any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if you truly want soft lips mode</li>
            <li>This product used to be soft, soothing and emollient.  </li>
            <li>I used to pay under $5 18 years ago at a local food store and paid almost $10 at Whole Foods when they carried it.  </li>
            <li>They have been sensitive to both of these products AND as you may know, EVERY lip balm has either one or both of these bases.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and leaves my lips soft even after it has worn off.</li>
            <li>It shows the old packaging, which was almost twice the amount of product for a lower price.</li>
            <li>Karite uses shea butter which is a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Kissably soft for your guy ladies.</li>
            <li>* contain petroleum, which is in a lot of balms but can actually end up drying out the lips more in a vicious cycle; shea butter is the best for moisture since it actually absorbs into the skin and has healing properties.</li>
            <li>It lasts for hours and it doesn&#x27;t have any funky ingredients, which is important since I&#x27;ll end up eating small amounts of it by having it on my lips.</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t taste horrible, the smell isn&#x27;t sickeningly sweet but a simple vanilla-ish smell and it keeps them moisturized most of the day - unless it&#x27;s winter which requires more reapplications from all my tea</li>
            <li>yet they last a pretty long while.</li>
            <li>I feel bad posting a less-than-glowing review for this, since so many people love it, but it just did NOT live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low locally to buy this product to no avail.  </li>
            <li>Really moisturizing and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Then my lips became so sensitive and peeled constantly.</li>
            <li>I tried 9 different &amp;#34;chapsticks&amp;#34; (all natural ones) to no avail.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because it is moisturizing and natural which is great, but way too expensive and not special enough for me to buy again.</li>
            <li>Very soft lips and lips stay moisturizer for a long period.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, but I&#x27;ve never reacted to vanilla fragrances or true vanilla (by which I mean diluted vanilla essential oil).</li>
            <li>First, this balm is waxy and heavy.</li>
            <li>and they end up rather dry and wind beaten, especially in winter here in New England.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a highly healing lip moisturizer without evil petroleum or other drying additives, then this product is definitely a best buy!</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Looks exactly like Chapstick.</li>
            <li> but This product wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had in mind.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, something has changed.  </li>
            <li> ; teen sons have given up their &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; Chapstick in favor of this Karite Lips because they say it just works better.</li>
            <li> As good as it is, I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t quite remember where I first scored a tube.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a .15oz tube, but I can&#x27;t say I regret buying it at all, as my lips have genuinely never been more smooth or grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> I believe I first discovered it at a Whole Foods store.</li>
            <li> There is a slight vanilla scent, but it dissipates very quickly, so there is no annoying flavor lingering on the lips.  </li>
            <li> have rather large lips</li>
            <li> This lip balm moisturize your lips effectively and you will not have to keep reapplying the lip balm on your lips because just a little bit applied to your lips</li>
            <li> This amazing balm healed me within a few days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the Vanilla as much as the regular/original with no scent.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything including straight Neosporin and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> The formula is thicker than a gloss thus stays on for much longer.</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant so</li>
            <li> The photo is also very misleading.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this lip balm for more than 6 years now and haven&#x27;t used anything else (despite trying other brands).  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, I highly recommend this particular seller!</li>
            <li> Lip Balm that isn&#x27;t sticky, makes my lips smooth, and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Always smooth, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered this shea butter lip balm (vanilla) by Mode de Vie, I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with any other lip balm!</li>
            <li> so I was looking for something with that as the main ingredient.</li>
            <li> Highly emollient.  </li>
            <li> Many lip balms have peppermint oil, which can actually irritate the lips, or other flavors, so it is hard to find a good unflavored one like Karite Lips.  </li>
            <li> but normally would be a 5</li>
            <li> My lips do not feel soothed by this product with the new formula.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> They should change the photo to show the new tube.  </li>
            <li> But the product is completely different now; it has a harder, more waxy texture.  </li>
            <li> Soft normal lips all day.</li>
            <li> But since it&#x27;s the exact same shape and size as Chapstick, every time I look at it, I think I&#x27;m paying $8 for Chapstick even though I know it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> the ingredient list is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> In fact the picture and all the writing on the tube is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> KISSABLY soft (smooch)!  </li>
            <li> One of the very few lip balms on the market that my lips love.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried, with a high percentage of shea butter and a couple of other natural ingredients, including real vanilla.</li>
            <li> I compared the exterior of the tubes of the old and new and</li>
            <li> I scrape out old tubes of this before I buy new ones because I can&#x27;t stand the idea of wasting any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if you truly want soft lips mode</li>
            <li> This product used to be soft, soothing and emollient.  </li>
            <li> I used to pay under $5 18 years ago at a local food store and paid almost $10 at Whole Foods when they carried it.  </li>
            <li> They have been sensitive to both of these products AND as you may know, EVERY lip balm has either one or both of these bases.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and leaves my lips soft even after it has worn off.</li>
            <li> It shows the old packaging, which was almost twice the amount of product for a lower price.</li>
            <li> Karite uses shea butter which is a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Kissably soft for your guy ladies.</li>
            <li> * contain petroleum, which is in a lot of balms but can actually end up drying out the lips more in a vicious cycle; shea butter is the best for moisture since it actually absorbs into the skin and has healing properties.</li>
            <li> It lasts for hours and it doesn&#x27;t have any funky ingredients, which is important since I&#x27;ll end up eating small amounts of it by having it on my lips.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t taste horrible, the smell isn&#x27;t sickeningly sweet but a simple vanilla-ish smell and it keeps them moisturized most of the day - unless it&#x27;s winter which requires more reapplications from all my tea</li>
            <li> yet they last a pretty long while.</li>
            <li> I feel bad posting a less-than-glowing review for this, since so many people love it, but it just did NOT live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low locally to buy this product to no avail.  </li>
            <li> Really moisturizing and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Then my lips became so sensitive and peeled constantly.</li>
            <li> I tried 9 different &amp;#34;chapsticks&amp;#34; (all natural ones) to no avail.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it is moisturizing and natural which is great, but way too expensive and not special enough for me to buy again.</li>
            <li> Very soft lips and lips stay moisturizer for a long period.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, but I&#x27;ve never reacted to vanilla fragrances or true vanilla (by which I mean diluted vanilla essential oil).</li>
            <li> First, this balm is waxy and heavy.</li>
            <li> and they end up rather dry and wind beaten, especially in winter here in New England.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a highly healing lip moisturizer without evil petroleum or other drying additives, then this product is definitely a best buy!</li>
            <li> my mouth stretched open.</li>
            <li> will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Suffice to say, I&#x27;ll buy it as long as they make it because nothing I try compares to it.</li>
            <li> I also find the ingredients list questionable, because the vanilla scent (\\&quot;vanilla extract\\&quot; on the label) is very strong and extremely artificial; additionally, I felt a mild stinging with repeat applications.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> The packaging is also a little different than what is pictured.</li>
            <li> I hope my relationship with this product turns out to be lifelong.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product shipped is not the same as what I have received in the past from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm where other balms middlingly deliver.</li>
            <li> Other Amazon reviewers have noticed this too.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering for a few months from severely dry, chapped, peeling and cracked lips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a slight vanilla scent, it last VERY LONG (less reapplying means it lasts longer) and its vegan too!!!</li>
            <li> All other lip balms have failed to really prevent chapped lips</li>
            <li> Now it feels different and has a hard oily/waxy feel.  </li>
            <li> They must be putting less Shea butter into it.  </li>
            <li> and we probably end up ingesting a little of it.</li>
            <li> There a few sugar granules that help exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago fell victum to lip plumper.</li>
            <li> Something is not accurate though.  </li>
            <li> But after guilting myself into purchasing less expensive brands and being unhappy with the slimy texture, or just plain feeling like crap from the petroleum, I simply buy it and remain happy.</li>
            <li> Not quite as bad as old-school chapstick, but pretty close.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive for a lip balm, but it does keep my usually dry lips supple.</li>
            <li> unlike other balms which promoted acne near my lips and caused a vicious cycle of application and drying, karite lips actually enabled my lips to heal.  </li>
            <li> One winter, it was so cold that no other lip product I tried helped my chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is subtle and fades a lil&#x27; while post-application.  </li>
            <li> But earlier this year I started to have a bad chapped lip problem, so I thought I should return to Karite Lips.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive.</li>
            <li> It was EXPENSIVE ($8 or $9), but after reading and re-reading the ingredients, I decided to try it</li>
            <li> It is expensive though.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s almost impossible to find a non-beeswax product that has SPF.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the cure for those painful cracks&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holy crap</li>
            <li> And I hate Chapstick</li>
            <li> The sides of my mouth were cracked and at worst times, bleeding every time I opened my mouth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Mode de vie is the most amazing chap stick I have ever used, this product is second to none there isn&#x27;t anything like it out right now if you truly want soft lips mode de vie is what your looking for.</li>
            <li> The product shipped is not the same as what I have received in the past from the manufacturer. This actually irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Most amazing lip balm that&#x27;s why I buy 10 at a time</li>
            <li> This lip balm is the best ever.  It smells good, goes on smoothly &amp; lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a problem with the tube breaking once but I will still continue using it.  Recently had to substitute with another brand which does not have the vanilla &amp; it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good.  Can&#x27;t wait until it is back in stock at my local place.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm where other balms middlingly deliver. Used Karite Lips to help heal a lip cut that kept reopening and splitting everytime my mouth stretched open. It helped soften the cut area so that the wound would remain supple and flexible while healing properly. Excellent by any measure.</li>
            <li> A great product that is worth the money! Ihave tried many lip balms, but MODE DE VIE far surpasses them all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to Chapstick. The sides of my mouth crack and bleed, and the skin around my lips becomes inflamed. I dont get that reaction with this at all. It absorbs nicely too.</li>
            <li> unlike other balms which promoted acne near my lips and caused a vicious cycle of application and drying, karite lips actually enabled my lips to heal.  after years of dependency on inferior drugstore balms, i was able to ween myself off of lip balm in all but the coldest winter months.  i bought the first stick over 3 years ago and it has lasted until now.  this is one of the best products i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Only chapstick that I don&#x27;t have to keep re-applying, the best!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lip balms and I think this is the best.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is perfectly acceptable but not fantastic.  The packaging is also a little different than what is pictured.</li>
            <li> I put this lip balm on my lips at night and in the morning I have soft, smooth  lips. It is a little expensive for a lip balm, but it does keep my usually dry lips supple.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of this balm, I love it! It moisturizes great and last a long time without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> This lip balm works, simple as that. I was looking for a lip balm that contained Shea butter in it and that a lot of reviewers here on Amazon recommended. This lip balm moisturize your lips effectively and you will not have to keep reapplying the lip balm on your lips because just a little bit applied to your lips will last for a long time. I definitely recommend this lip balm for those of you all out there who likes Shea butter and vanilla too because this lip balm has some vanilla in it too.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars maybe a 3.5  but normally would be a 5.....I don&#x27;t like the Vanilla as much as the regular/original with no scent. I feel the original leaves my lips more supple.</li>
            <li> I had read that shea butter is supposed to be really good for chapped lips so I was looking for something with that as the main ingredient. I came upon this and gave it a try. Holy crap this stuff is great. I put it on before I go to sleep and when I wake up, it&#x27;s like magic. Soft normal lips all day. So why 4 stars? Because it looks like Chapstick but costs $8. It totally works so I guess it&#x27;s worth it. In fact I&#x27;ll probably buy it again. But since it&#x27;s the exact same shape and size as Chapstick, every time I look at it, I think I&#x27;m paying $8 for Chapstick even though I know it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;This is the cure for those painful cracks&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave gunky residue on lips&lt;br /&gt;Not glossy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t go on very easy during winter months because the wax hardens up&lt;br /&gt;Looks exactly like Chapstick. And I hate Chapstick</li>
            <li> Lip Balm that isn&#x27;t sticky, makes my lips smooth, and lasts for a long time.  Tastes and smells slightly sweet without being offensive.  There a few sugar granules that help exfoliate.  Great for chapped lips season.  I have used this lip balm for more than 6 years now and haven&#x27;t used anything else (despite trying other brands).  LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering for a few months from severely dry, chapped, peeling and cracked lips. The sides of my mouth were cracked and at worst times, bleeding every time I opened my mouth. I had tried everything including straight Neosporin and nothing helped. This amazing balm healed me within a few days. Within 24 hours I had about 80% improvement. I am shocked at just how good it is. Hands down best lip balm I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> I feel bad posting a less-than-glowing review for this, since so many people love it, but it just did NOT live up to my expectations. First, this balm is waxy and heavy. Not quite as bad as old-school chapstick, but pretty close. It made my lips feel gummy and almost (but not quite) sticky. I also find the ingredients list questionable, because the vanilla scent (\\&quot;vanilla extract\\&quot; on the label) is very strong and extremely artificial; additionally, I felt a mild stinging with repeat applications. I do have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, but I&#x27;ve never reacted to vanilla fragrances or true vanilla (by which I mean diluted vanilla essential oil). This was a dud for me.</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this balm. It has replaced all of my other lip products because aside from being good for your lips it smells amazing!It goes on thick and brings out the best of your lips.</li>
            <li> After a misunderstanding on my part, Nutricity(the seller) was more than willing to ensure customer satisfaction. I&#x27;ve been using the Karite lip balm almost ten years. If you&#x27;re looking for a superior product, you&#x27;ve found it! Furthermore, I highly recommend this particular seller!</li>
            <li> Good but This product wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had in mind. There was another Shea butter lipgloss by mode de vie which looks similar but this is a different formula I think.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since about 1997.  It was the best lip balm I had ever found.  I was reading that customers say the formula has changed.  I decided to order some anyway.  Sure enough, something has changed.  This product used to be soft, soothing and emollient.  Now it feels different and has a hard oily/waxy feel.  My lips do not feel soothed by this product with the new formula.  I compared the exterior of the tubes of the old and new and the ingredient list is exactly the same.  In fact the picture and all the writing on the tube is exactly the same.  Something is not accurate though.  It is an entirely different product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased from this seller several times and will continue to.  I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm for about 18 years and the formula has changed a couple times but it&#x27;s the ONLY lip balm I can&#x27;t do without.  I used to pay under $5 18 years ago at a local food store and paid almost $10 at Whole Foods when they carried it.  Suffice to say, I&#x27;ll buy it as long as they make it because nothing I try compares to it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive. But after guilting myself into purchasing less expensive brands and being unhappy with the slimy texture, or just plain feeling like crap from the petroleum, I simply buy it and remain happy. The formula is thicker than a gloss thus stays on for much longer. You should still feel moisturized in the morning after applying before lights out. My hubby loves the texture and fragrance,and seeks out kisses if I&#x27;ve recently applied. My &amp;#34;all boy&amp;#34; teen sons have given up their &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; Chapstick in favor of this Karite Lips because they say it just works better. If you are looking for a light feel, this is not your product. But if you are looking for a highly healing lip moisturizer without evil petroleum or other drying additives, then this product is definitely a best buy!</li>
            <li> After years of using Petroleum and Beeswax based lip balms, my lips revolted! They have been sensitive to both of these products AND as you may know, EVERY lip balm has either one or both of these bases. Then I discovered this gem. I believe I first discovered it at a Whole Foods store. It was EXPENSIVE ($8 or $9), but after reading and re-reading the ingredients, I decided to try it and I AM HOOKED! In the 20+ years of using ALL manners of lip glosses, lip balms and lip sticks, this is the best, hands down. I am beginning to stockpile :-)&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight vanilla scent, it last VERY LONG (less reapplying means it lasts longer) and its vegan too!!! suuuweet!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for years. I have very dry lips and this is the best balm that I have every found. I buy lip balms often, but I have not found anything as good as this one. It is moisturizing and leaves my lips soft even after it has worn off.</li>
            <li> This product used to come in a lipstick type container but now looks like chapstick. It was a softer smoother consistency that glided on but now feels again like chapstick. I give it 4 stars because it is moisturizing and natural which is great, but way too expensive and not special enough for me to buy again.</li>
            <li> Not the same as it used to be, but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li> One of the very few lip balms on the market that my lips love. Pleasant light neutral scent. Very soft lips and lips stay moisturizer for a long period. This is definitely not one of those lip balms that you have to repeatedly put on again and again. Use it and you don&#x27;t have to think about it for several hours. I have purchased several of these to have on hand yet they last a pretty long while.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm of all time.  I will die if they ever stop making it. Always smooth, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing and long lasting!</li>
            <li> I was at the point of thinking no lip balm could save my chapped, peeling lips. After doing loads of research, and finding sulfate, or what have you, is an ingredient in majority of popular name-brands, I was determined to go all-natural and hope all these reviews were honest. And, by golly, they were. I have to say, it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a .15oz tube, but I can&#x27;t say I regret buying it at all, as my lips have genuinely never been more smooth or grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> After being introduced to this product by Andre&#x27; 3000 It has been my go to product for my lips. It keeps them moist and as a female you never want lip trash and with this Shea Butter Lip Balm you will never have lips trash. I am a flight attendant so moisture is very important. Thanks I am  loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used!  Highly emollient.  Love the vanilla scent.  A little pricey but lasts a long time.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm ever! I&#x27;m so glad I was able to track it down on amazon!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  This made my lips ubber smooth. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm since the 1990s.  (It is called &amp;#34;Karite Lips&amp;#34; on the tube.)  One winter, it was so cold that no other lip product I tried helped my chapped lips.  My homeopathic doctor recommended this lip balm; it worked like a charm and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  It goes on nice and smooth, not waxy.  There is a slight vanilla scent, but it dissipates very quickly, so there is no annoying flavor lingering on the lips.  Many lip balms have peppermint oil, which can actually irritate the lips, or other flavors, so it is hard to find a good unflavored one like Karite Lips.  I use it every day, either by itself or under lipstick.  I would recommend it to anyone.  UPDATE 2016:  I had stopped buying Karite Lips for a while because I found a good lip balm for a lower price.  But earlier this year I started to have a bad chapped lip problem, so I thought I should return to Karite Lips.  But the product is completely different now; it has a harder, more waxy texture.  They must be putting less Shea butter into it.  Other Amazon reviewers have noticed this too.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low locally to buy this product to no avail.  I was very happy to find it here on Amazon.  I love the shea butter, as it provided natural sunscreen and moisture.  This is my #1 favorite lip balm of all time.</li>
            <li> This used to be my all-time favorite lip balm until they changed the ingredients, made it smaller and significantly raised the price. It used to have so much more Shea butter and a really delicious natural vanilla flavor.  Now it feels/smells like mostly wax.  This is still a good product for sure, but you can find comparable or better for the same price or less. The photo is also very misleading. It shows the old packaging, which was almost twice the amount of product for a lower price. They have now made it the size of a Chapstick tube (0.15 oz). They should change the photo to show the new tube.  Even though the product title says 0.15 oz, most people don&#x27;t know what 0.15 oz really looks like. I think I would be pretty happy if I didn&#x27;t know how much better used to be.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s not sticky, tacky or greasy. It lasts for hours and it doesn&#x27;t have any funky ingredients, which is important since I&#x27;ll end up eating small amounts of it by having it on my lips.</li>
            <li> I got these in hopes of finding something similar to the Korres Shea Butter Lip Balm that Korres no longer sells. These are definitely as good as it, but the price is little bit overkill. $9 for a tube of chapstick is a bit ludicrous. As good as it is, I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the price. But if you ignore the price, the product itself is great and definitely keeps my lips soft and moisturized. All other lip balms have failed to really prevent chapped lips but this one is the one that works great.</li>
            <li> A few years ago fell victum to lip plumper. I tried a drug-store brand, and ended up looking like Lisa Rena. Then my lips became so sensitive and peeled constantly. I tried 9 different &amp;#34;chapsticks&amp;#34; (all natural ones) to no avail. Until I found Karite Lips. It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend is allergic to beeswax, so I introduced this to him. (It&#x27;s almost impossible to find a non-beeswax product that has SPF.) Karite uses shea butter which is a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Meh okay, way overpriced</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 15 years and won&#x27;t be without it. It is expensive though.</li>
            <li> Best lip stuff ever... I scrape out old tubes of this before I buy new ones because I can&#x27;t stand the idea of wasting any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rather large lips and they end up rather dry and wind beaten, especially in winter here in New England. This is by far the best lip stuff I&#x27;ve ever come across. Plus it doesn&#x27;t taste horrible, the smell isn&#x27;t sickeningly sweet but a simple vanilla-ish smell and it keeps them moisturized most of the day - unless it&#x27;s winter which requires more reapplications from all my tea drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for quite some time in my arsenal of lip balms and chapsticks.  Can&#x27;t quite remember where I first scored a tube.  I&#x27;m always in the market for something good and effective.  This lip balm does the trick and I have just placed an order for a second tube &amp;lt;first one 75% gone&gt;.  The vanilla scent is subtle and fades a lil&#x27; while post-application.  It provides great moisturizing properties to my full lips.  Kissably soft for your guy ladies. KISSABLY soft (smooch)!  There is a bit of sheen to it but it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy -nor have I ever thought it to leave a waxy feel.  Winter or summer, no matter, it&#x27;s great for year round use.  I hope my relationship with this product turns out to be lifelong.  I say buy-it, try-it, you might &amp;lt;should&gt; like it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered this shea butter lip balm (vanilla) by Mode de Vie, I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with any other lip balm! It is truly the best- it moisturizes better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried, with a high percentage of shea butter and a couple of other natural ingredients, including real vanilla. The vanilla scent is really wonderful- I actually have had a lot of people ask about it because of how good it smells. It&#x27;s a light scent though, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel most comfortable using natural lip balm considering that it goes on our lips and we probably end up ingesting a little of it. This does *not* contain petroleum, which is in a lot of balms but can actually end up drying out the lips more in a vicious cycle; shea butter is the best for moisture since it actually absorbs into the skin and has healing properties. I find this product works much better than the natural beeswax-based balms out there.</li>
