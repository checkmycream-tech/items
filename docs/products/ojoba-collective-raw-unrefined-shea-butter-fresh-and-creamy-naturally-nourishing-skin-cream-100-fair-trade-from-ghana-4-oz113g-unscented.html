            <li>The \\&quot;raw\\&quot; and \\&quot;unrefined\\&quot; components make for a MUCH more effective product.</li>

            <li>It has a pleasant nutty smell and melts between my palms quite quickly for an even and quick application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be sure to update this review as more time passes, but so far, I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! :-)</li>
            <li>my skin is usally very dry even on summer this product is an excellent Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li>While using shea butter is not like using other lotions and creams I have found that for me it works more effectively and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Logistically, my order was a breeze -- package came right away, nicely packaged and wrapped in tissue.  </li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>I use it all over for a great winter moisturizer and love what it has done for my facial lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>B004RBZ9R2 Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream 4 Ounces]] or</li>
            <li>and I bring it on every trip we go on - even when we&#x27;re trying to pack light.</li>
            <li>You really need to warm it up with your hands well to soften it.</li>
            <li>This product arrived fast and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>B005UEB96K Aquaphor Baby Healing Ointment, Advanced Therapy, 14 Ounce Jar]]</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it</li>
            <li>It was promptly delivered fast and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a video of ojoba women in Ghana making this shea butter, so I decided to search it here on amazon and thank God it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;am so happy to know we can all help each other:)</li>
            <li>Despite drinking a ton of water each day, eating clean, avoiding alcohol and slathering on products like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Smooth , mild smell...good for skin and hair.............</li>
            <li>This shea butter is fabulous and it arrived quickly and contained information about the people who harvest this, which I found interesting and gave a nice personal touch.</li>
            <li>Not only is this place Fair Trade, their website says they employ a women&#x27;s group.  </li>
            <li>Extra woman-friendly bonus is that this product is Fair Trade and made by a collective of WOMEN in Ghana.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, only thing is that it doesnt say it is organic on lable</li>
            <li>This product was true to everything it said it was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural and feels great so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit.</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant and am using it to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I did end up ordering this product directly from their web site because they had free shipping for orders of 2 tins or more.</li>
            <li>bought this brand due to the previous good reviews, and I concur that it is a very good product.</li>
            <li>When they say raw, they are being honest - it smells like it came from the nut of a warm, tropical tree.</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that is very natural.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more of this product!</li>
            <li>It is up to consumers to demand that products AND their production processes are ethical and harm free.   </li>
            <li>After my last pedicure, and being told to use Vasoline on my feet, I started slathering this shea butter on my feet then covering with socks at night and this, too, works great; my feet stay relatively soft all day.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and many products in the beauty aisle can irritate my skin or give me acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use cream-based products on my face, even the ones created for sensitive skin (forget sunscreen) without breaking out.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth 5 stars, but kids will not wear this (I believe).</li>
            <li>Luxuriously moisturizers but also soaks right in.</li>
            <li>It is certified fair trade product that is also cruelty free, which is hard to find in the cosmetics industry.  </li>
            <li>Very real shea butter.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin and Ojoba Collective Shea Butter is so great it actually makes my skin look better instead of breaking out my skin like other lotions do.  </li>
            <li>I just had my second child and luckily am able to breastfeed this time around</li>
            <li>but my hands were still chapped because I didn&#x27;t want to use regular hand cream (which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Entirely natural,  chemical free and luxorious.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry winter hands...have used for several years now.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be helping the dry skin of my hands better than any of the many commercial hand creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>(Vitellaria paradoxa to be exact, but then you really don&#x27;t care, do you?)</li>
            <li>but that evaporates pretty quickly and leaves a silky smooth covering that sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin super soft and restores skin elasticity.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to waste this, I began using it under my eyes and on my lips at night and was amazed at how hydrating it was; best night time eye cream hands down.  </li>
            <li>Unscented, Unrefined &#x3D; Pure Product.    </li>
            <li>but that is the nature of pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and most products</li>
            <li>I really like the ethic of the company, too.  </li>
            <li>One tin works for my whole body.  </li>
            <li>This product was better than expected.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>The product comes ready to use it is creamy and glides on the body..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too much under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I guess you are really paying for the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If looking for real  shea butter</li>
            <li>I used this shea butter last night and my fingertips are smooth again.</li>
            <li>Very good for people with excessive dry skin.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I had contacted the seller regarding what turned out to be a very minor matter; the seller was courteous, helpful and offered to do anything necessary to address my request.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product for only a few days, my lips are in the best condition they have ever been and the dry areas of my \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot; now feel normal.  </li>
            <li>This product has a light nutty smell (which is normal, so I&#x27;ve read), but it is not unpleasant and dissipates within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish I had paid more attention to previous reviews about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried it overnight so far, and I can&#x27;t believe how moisturized and smooth my skin feels this morning.</li>
            <li>I blend this with inferior creams that claim to be high in shea butter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Product is high quality.</li>
            <li>So pure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>unrefined.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent mosturizer use on any part of the body really makes my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>A physician writing there suggested it would work better for dry skin than commercial cream mixes.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is made in a very natural process in Africa.</li>
            <li>Very professional.</li>
            <li>(my cuticles are literally soft as if I just got a manicure!).</li>
            <li>Pure shea butter was recommended in a recent edition of Consumer Reports&#x27; \\&quot;On</li>
            <li>, i hope this product would help me clear them.</li>
            <li>For years, it&#x27;s been my go-to moisturizer after doing dishes, gardening or if I&#x27;ve been washing my hands frequently (often during cold/flu season).</li>
            <li>No added scents, just natural moisturizing.</li>
            <li>also i noted that my psoriatic area become much softer and without the extra skin</li>
            <li>No odd smell, didn&#x27;t need to be softened, and came in professional packaging.</li>
            <li>Great texture, doesn&#x27;t break me out (and that is rare - most facial products do, because of all the awful irritating or clogging ingredients they contain), and the smell seems just fine to me.</li>
            <li>Tribal women work very hard to collect and extract  Shea butter from their native trees,  I am glad they are getting reimbursed for the work so they can live and feed their families.</li>
            <li>Seriously, my skin has never looked so healthy and radiant.  </li>
            <li>Just rub small amount in hands or between finger tips to heat up so goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to use on my face after washing with African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li>You can also pretty it up in other ways.</li>
            <li>, this is a major turn off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the expense side but worth it.</li>
            <li>I barely even notice one.</li>
            <li>Of course, I noticed how soft my hands and cuticles were getting with the twice daily application of this product</li>
            <li>As long as I could control the flare-ups, I thought the texture was something I would always have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other brands and this is the real deal -- pure shea butter instead of 50% shea butter diluted down with coconut-scented vegetable oil or something.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive facial skin, but I don&#x27;t have to buy different creams for my hands, feet, lips and face.  </li>
            <li>It was expensive &amp; quickly used up but very high quality.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As it turned out, nothing further needed to be done, but I was very pleased and impressed by the seller&#x27;s offer to help.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting it to be very smooth instead of whipped and grainy.</li>
            <li> Not so strong smelling as some others, feels nice on skin once it soaks in.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it comes in a reusable tin.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly for lips, nails, skin, feet, etc... with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a durable circular tin that fits wonderfully into bags and purses and will not spill or pop open accidentally while biking, flying, busing, or hiking around.  </li>
            <li> The Ojoba Collective business model is inspiring and progressive and that makes my moisturizing moments even more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer -</li>
            <li> What happened is that I took some out, rubbed between my hands to make it smooth and shiny/oily looking and then spread on my daughters scaly and crusty (eww!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> The leftover smell helped me to be able to almost stand this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Also my grand daughter had a rash on her arm</li>

            <li> Very clean.</li>
            <li> I love the container it comes in makes easy to carry with you if needed.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant nutty smell and melts between my palms quite quickly for an even and quick application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be sure to update this review as more time passes, but so far, I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! :-)</li>
            <li> my skin is usally very dry even on summer this product is an excellent Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> While using shea butter is not like using other lotions and creams I have found that for me it works more effectively and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Logistically, my order was a breeze -- package came right away, nicely packaged and wrapped in tissue.  </li>
            <li> Sweet!</li>
            <li> I use it all over for a great winter moisturizer and love what it has done for my facial lines and wrinkles.</li>

            <li> and I bring it on every trip we go on - even when we&#x27;re trying to pack light.</li>
            <li> You really need to warm it up with your hands well to soften it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and was packaged nicely.</li>

            <li> I enjoy using it</li>
            <li> It was promptly delivered fast and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a video of ojoba women in Ghana making this shea butter, so I decided to search it here on amazon and thank God it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am so happy to know we can all help each other:)</li>
            <li> Despite drinking a ton of water each day, eating clean, avoiding alcohol and slathering on products like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Smooth , mild smell...good for skin and hair.............</li>
            <li> This shea butter is fabulous and it arrived quickly and contained information about the people who harvest this, which I found interesting and gave a nice personal touch.</li>
            <li> Not only is this place Fair Trade, their website says they employ a women&#x27;s group.  </li>
            <li> Extra woman-friendly bonus is that this product is Fair Trade and made by a collective of WOMEN in Ghana.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, only thing is that it doesnt say it is organic on lable</li>
            <li> This product was true to everything it said it was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural and feels great so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit.</li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant and am using it to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I did end up ordering this product directly from their web site because they had free shipping for orders of 2 tins or more.</li>
            <li> bought this brand due to the previous good reviews, and I concur that it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> When they say raw, they are being honest - it smells like it came from the nut of a warm, tropical tree.</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that is very natural.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more of this product!</li>
            <li> It is up to consumers to demand that products AND their production processes are ethical and harm free.   </li>
            <li> After my last pedicure, and being told to use Vasoline on my feet, I started slathering this shea butter on my feet then covering with socks at night and this, too, works great; my feet stay relatively soft all day.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and many products in the beauty aisle can irritate my skin or give me acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use cream-based products on my face, even the ones created for sensitive skin (forget sunscreen) without breaking out.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s worth 5 stars, but kids will not wear this (I believe).</li>
            <li> Luxuriously moisturizers but also soaks right in.</li>
            <li> It is certified fair trade product that is also cruelty free, which is hard to find in the cosmetics industry.  </li>
            <li> Very real shea butter.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin and Ojoba Collective Shea Butter is so great it actually makes my skin look better instead of breaking out my skin like other lotions do.  </li>
            <li> I just had my second child and luckily am able to breastfeed this time around</li>
            <li> but my hands were still chapped because I didn&#x27;t want to use regular hand cream (which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Entirely natural,  chemical free and luxorious.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry winter hands...have used for several years now.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be helping the dry skin of my hands better than any of the many commercial hand creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> (Vitellaria paradoxa to be exact, but then you really don&#x27;t care, do you?)</li>
            <li> but that evaporates pretty quickly and leaves a silky smooth covering that sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves skin super soft and restores skin elasticity.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to waste this, I began using it under my eyes and on my lips at night and was amazed at how hydrating it was; best night time eye cream hands down.  </li>
            <li> Unscented, Unrefined &#x3D; Pure Product.    </li>
            <li> but that is the nature of pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and most products</li>
            <li> I really like the ethic of the company, too.  </li>
            <li> One tin works for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> This product was better than expected.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> The product comes ready to use it is creamy and glides on the body..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too much under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I guess you are really paying for the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If looking for real  shea butter</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter last night and my fingertips are smooth again.</li>
            <li> Very good for people with excessive dry skin.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I had contacted the seller regarding what turned out to be a very minor matter; the seller was courteous, helpful and offered to do anything necessary to address my request.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product for only a few days, my lips are in the best condition they have ever been and the dry areas of my \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot; now feel normal.  </li>
            <li> This product has a light nutty smell (which is normal, so I&#x27;ve read), but it is not unpleasant and dissipates within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish I had paid more attention to previous reviews about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it overnight so far, and I can&#x27;t believe how moisturized and smooth my skin feels this morning.</li>
            <li> I blend this with inferior creams that claim to be high in shea butter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Product is high quality.</li>
            <li> So pure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> unrefined.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent mosturizer use on any part of the body really makes my hands soft.  </li>
            <li> A physician writing there suggested it would work better for dry skin than commercial cream mixes.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is made in a very natural process in Africa.</li>
            <li> Very professional.</li>
            <li> (my cuticles are literally soft as if I just got a manicure!).</li>
            <li> Pure shea butter was recommended in a recent edition of Consumer Reports&#x27; \\&quot;On</li>
            <li> , i hope this product would help me clear them.</li>
            <li> For years, it&#x27;s been my go-to moisturizer after doing dishes, gardening or if I&#x27;ve been washing my hands frequently (often during cold/flu season).</li>
            <li> No added scents, just natural moisturizing.</li>
            <li> also i noted that my psoriatic area become much softer and without the extra skin</li>
            <li> No odd smell, didn&#x27;t need to be softened, and came in professional packaging.</li>
            <li> Great texture, doesn&#x27;t break me out (and that is rare - most facial products do, because of all the awful irritating or clogging ingredients they contain), and the smell seems just fine to me.</li>
            <li> Tribal women work very hard to collect and extract  Shea butter from their native trees,  I am glad they are getting reimbursed for the work so they can live and feed their families.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my skin has never looked so healthy and radiant.  </li>
            <li> Just rub small amount in hands or between finger tips to heat up so goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use on my face after washing with African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> You can also pretty it up in other ways.</li>
            <li> , this is a major turn off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the expense side but worth it.</li>
            <li> I barely even notice one.</li>
            <li> Of course, I noticed how soft my hands and cuticles were getting with the twice daily application of this product</li>
            <li> As long as I could control the flare-ups, I thought the texture was something I would always have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other brands and this is the real deal -- pure shea butter instead of 50% shea butter diluted down with coconut-scented vegetable oil or something.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive facial skin, but I don&#x27;t have to buy different creams for my hands, feet, lips and face.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive &amp; quickly used up but very high quality.</li>
            <li> There is not a strong or very noticeable scent, but I would not say it is odorless either.</li>
            <li> This one does not, and using it regularly has soothed my dry skin.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve had problems with dry lips and dry areas on the outside parts of my face.  </li>
            <li> I like the organization, and alot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick and really helps dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It also helps repair cracks and splits on my hands and fingertips from dry air in the winter.</li>
            <li> I will not be going back to any other moisturizer, ever!</li>
            <li> I usually suffer with cracked skin on my hands and feet during the winter, but I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter once daily on my hands and feet and have only had one occurrence of cracked skin on one finger.</li>
            <li> product seemed to be a bit creamier and less gritty than others I have used.  </li>
            <li> so I only use it at night and NOT every night (I started breaking out a little on my legs</li>
            <li> It makes my hands feel hydrated and my cuticles have vastly improved with just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Although the scent is not beautiful, it doesn&#x27;t bother me, is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shea butter works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and I do not know if I would break out if I used it on my face.</li>
            <li> This shea butter works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Our little guy has really dry skin</li>
            <li> but because it is so expensive for such a small amount, I would use the whole tin in a week, so I ration it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very smooth and buttery</li>
            <li> , my skin still felt parched and a little bumpy due to chronic eczema.</li>
            <li> The scent is natural so you definitely won&#x27;t be smelling any artificial fragrances you might be used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars for quality, but if your purpose is to use on your children you might want to remember the smell is not very appealing.  </li>
            <li> I had tried numerous products designed to heal cracked heels with disappointing results and this is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> feels greasy or are to heavily scented for me.</li>
            <li> I was very wary about ordering shea butter after reading a bunch of online reviews that were unfavorable, but this was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I checked out amazon and found Ojoba Collective Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and bought that instead.</li>
            <li> Save whatever money you would spend on lotions and creams and get this raw, unrefined shea butter.  </li>
            <li> ordered Ojoba Collective, Raw Unrefined Shea Butter on Monday and received it Wednesday.</li>
            <li> its raw so be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> This will be my go-to site until I can find a farmer&#x27;s market in my area that sells raw shea.</li>
            <li> weird, my son loves the very slight odor (that dissipates after a short time)</li>
            <li> Like the name implies, it is a thick spread, so you have to rub it in or you may be a little sticky.</li>
            <li> My daughter has these weird, thick, dry patches on her knees and after 8 months of trying practically everything to get rid of them, I was about to buy a \\&quot;french\\&quot; company&#x27;s shea butter.</li>
            <li> but it is just as hard to melt this as it is the unwhipped, unrefined, unscented shea butter that I have used.</li>
            <li> It has completely healed the heel cracks that were so bad they were bleeding</li>
            <li> and I must wait at least 15 minutes before I put on clothes.</li>
            <li> Now, it is quite thick</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in it that I passed it on to my dad.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell but it moisturizers well</li>
            <li> The smell is the worst.</li>
            <li> contains all kinds of nasty chemicals) and risk her accidentaly ingesting it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I like this shea butter.  It has a nice, nutty fragrance and it works well as a moisturizer.  I also love that it comes in a reusable tin.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  Both my husband and I use this product regularly for lips, nails, skin, feet, etc... with excellent results.  And great collective - happy to support it!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use on my face after washing with African Black Soap.  I used it once on my face but it&#x27;s not very smooth and buttery so I stopped.  Not wanting to waste this, I began using it under my eyes and on my lips at night and was amazed at how hydrating it was; best night time eye cream hands down.  After my last pedicure, and being told to use Vasoline on my feet, I started slathering this shea butter on my feet then covering with socks at night and this, too, works great; my feet stay relatively soft all day.  I love the fair trade concept and enjoyed the card that came with this shea butter informing me of the women&#x27;s cooperative.</li>
            <li> This shea butter works extremely well. For years, it&#x27;s been my go-to moisturizer after doing dishes, gardening or if I&#x27;ve been washing my hands frequently (often during cold/flu season). It also helps repair cracks and splits on my hands and fingertips from dry air in the winter. I love that it&#x27;s fair trade. That adds a good feeling every time I use it. I keep a tin in my purse and my husband and I bring it on every trip we go on - even when we&#x27;re trying to pack light.</li>
            <li> Ojoba Collective Shea Butter is hands-down the best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other brands and this is the real deal -- pure shea butter instead of 50% shea butter diluted down with coconut-scented vegetable oil or something.  I have sensitive skin and Ojoba Collective Shea Butter is so great it actually makes my skin look better instead of breaking out my skin like other lotions do.  Seriously, my skin has never looked so healthy and radiant.  Best of all, it absorbs quickly so my skin doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  I use this stuff all over -- face, hands, feet.  It&#x27;s like a miracle drug.    I really like the ethic of the company, too.  Not only is this place Fair Trade, their website says they employ a women&#x27;s group.  Awesome for gender equality!    Logistically, my order was a breeze -- package came right away, nicely packaged and wrapped in tissue.  Couldn&#x27;t have been easier.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell but it moisturizers well so I&#x27;m dealing with it.  You really need to warm it up with your hands well to soften it.</li>
            <li> 1. I can put Shea butter everywhere.  I have extremely sensitive facial skin, but I don&#x27;t have to buy different creams for my hands, feet, lips and face.  One tin works for my whole body.  Amazing.  2. Unscented, Unrefined &#x3D; Pure Product.    3. It is certified fair trade product that is also cruelty free, which is hard to find in the cosmetics industry.  It is up to consumers to demand that products AND their production processes are ethical and harm free.   4. It is perfect for toting around. It comes in a durable circular tin that fits wonderfully into bags and purses and will not spill or pop open accidentally while biking, flying, busing, or hiking around.  I can moisturize anywhere, anytime.   5. The Ojoba Collective business model is inspiring and progressive and that makes my moisturizing moments even more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is absolutely wonderful.  I use it all over for a great winter moisturizer and love what it has done for my facial lines and wrinkles. Will definitely be ordering more of this product!</li>
            <li> I have had this brand of Shea Butter for only a short while but can state I am extremely pleased with it.  For as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve had problems with dry lips and dry areas on the outside parts of my face.  Since using this product for only a few days, my lips are in the best condition they have ever been and the dry areas of my \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot; now feel normal.

As it turned out, nothing further needed to be done, but I was very pleased and impressed by the seller&#x27;s offer to help.</li>
            <li> This product has been great to reduce the appearance of my stretchmarks. I&#x27;ve been using it after the shower for the last 1 1/2 months. This product was better than expected. My skin looks a lot better. I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my face and on my lips. There&#x27;s something addicting about - I have to keep myself from applying it to often, because it feels good to rub it on. Great texture, doesn&#x27;t break me out (and that is rare - most facial products do, because of all the awful irritating or clogging ingredients they contain), and the smell seems just fine to me. I barely even notice one.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this daily, she loves it!</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal. I blend this with inferior creams that claim to be high in shea butter. You can also pretty it up in other ways. When they say raw, they are being honest - it smells like it came from the nut of a warm, tropical tree. Which it did. (Vitellaria paradoxa to be exact, but then you really don&#x27;t care, do you?)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3+ years -- I love it!!!  This is the best item I know for face/hands/feet</li>
            <li> I received the Ojoba Shea Butter and I did not like the smell or the fact that it is grainy. I did like the fact that it is whipped. I did not like the smell of the shea butter. I guess I was expecting it to be very smooth instead of whipped and grainy. I understand that you have to melt it into the palms of of your hands but it is just as hard to melt this as it is the unwhipped, unrefined, unscented shea butter that I have used. Also, it did not smell like the nutty unrefined shea butter smell that I am used too. I was so disappointed in it that I passed it on to my dad. My dad actually loved the shea butter and it moisturizes his skin well. I am giving it five stars because my dad loves it.</li>
            <li> Not so strong smelling as some others, feels nice on skin once it soaks in.  It supports a good cause too!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer - it&#x27;s thick and really helps dry skin.  I have sensitive skin, and many products in the beauty aisle can irritate my skin or give me acne. This one does not, and using it regularly has soothed my dry skin. My husband has eczema that causes the skin on his hands to crack and bleed, but this product helps alleviate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an earthy smell that may take some getting used to, but I find it rather pleasant.  Like the name implies, it is a thick spread, so you have to rub it in or you may be a little sticky.</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and was packaged nicely.The product comes ready to use it is creamy and glides on the body..I&#x27;m pregnant and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit.I put it on my face, children, baby bump and all lol . There&#x27;s alot of shea butter floating around on Amazon..I&#x27;am very happy I found this one...because it is great! May God bless the women that make this product..I&#x27;am so happy to know we can all help each other:)</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter!! I am 7 months pregnant and am using it to prevent stretch marks. It leaves skin super soft and restores skin elasticity.</li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing. My daughter has these weird, thick, dry patches on her knees and after 8 months of trying practically everything to get rid of them, I was about to buy a \\&quot;french\\&quot; company&#x27;s shea butter. I checked out amazon and found Ojoba Collective Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and bought that instead. The \\&quot;raw\\&quot; and \\&quot;unrefined\\&quot; components make for a MUCH more effective product. Not to mention at a FRACTION of the cost (vs. like $40!). Anyway, although my daughter thought it smelled a bit nutty/weird, my son loves the very slight odor (that dissipates after a short time) and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. What happened is that I took some out, rubbed between my hands to make it smooth and shiny/oily looking and then spread on my daughters scaly and crusty (eww!) knees. Voila! It doesn&#x27;t sting or make her itch and it&#x27;s improved the look of her knees over the last 10 days. Of course, I noticed how soft my hands and cuticles were getting with the twice daily application of this product and now it&#x27;s in my nightstand for evening hand application (my cuticles are literally soft as if I just got a manicure!). I even put some on my lips and face at night. Genius! I&#x27;m ordering more now. Extra woman-friendly bonus is that this product is Fair Trade and made by a collective of WOMEN in Ghana. So it supports women in impoverished regions. Sweet!</li>
            <li> Save whatever money you would spend on lotions and creams and get this raw, unrefined shea butter.  It&#x27;s better than anything else I have tried.  Ever.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but that evaporates pretty quickly and leaves a silky smooth covering that sinks into your skin.  I might try putting a couple of drops of lavendar oil in the container and see if that helps.  My dogs keep trying to lick this off my hands and feet.  It makes my hands feel hydrated and my cuticles have vastly improved with just a few uses.  I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is superior. I have always struggled with the texture of my skin. Despite drinking a ton of water each day, eating clean, avoiding alcohol and slathering on products like [[ASIN:B004RBZ9R2 Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream 4 Ounces]] or [[ASIN:B005UEB96K Aquaphor Baby Healing Ointment, Advanced Therapy, 14 Ounce Jar]], my skin still felt parched and a little bumpy due to chronic eczema. I&#x27;ve never been able to use cream-based products on my face, even the ones created for sensitive skin (forget sunscreen) without breaking out. As long as I could control the flare-ups, I thought the texture was something I would always have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Ojoba Collective, Raw Unrefined Shea Butter on Monday and received it Wednesday. I&#x27;ve only tried it overnight so far, and I can&#x27;t believe how moisturized and smooth my skin feels this morning. It&#x27;s incredible! I will be sure to update this review as more time passes, but so far, I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! :-)</li>
            <li> Its not a refined product its raw so be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get it to melt its great.&lt;br /&gt;Support the collective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month. I have seen no change in my skin . It stays sticky after I put it on and I must wait at least 15 minutes before I put on clothes. The smell is the worst.I couldn&#x27;t stand it until I put the cream into another jar that held Rooting Bear Rub. The leftover smell helped me to be able to almost stand this product!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had paid more attention to previous reviews about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I will be able to finish this jar and feel that I have wasted my money!</li>
            <li> No added scents, just natural moisturizing. I have very dry skin and most products feels greasy or are to heavily scented for me.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for awhile and I love it.  I also buy this for my daughter.  She likes to use it on her feet after her shower.  I use this everywhere.  I also use it as a night cream and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face during the day because I have oily skin and it&#x27;s too much under my makeup.  It melts like butter into your skin. I highly recommend.  I will be buying this again.  Fast Shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face my hands, my dogs sore spot he had by his tail and within a couple days it cleared up. Also my grand daughter had a rash on her arm i put this on it before she went to bed and in the morning it was gone..i love this stuff. It is also great for chapped lips...has a strong odor but that is the nature of pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> I just do not like how it smells, I can&#x27;t use it, this is a major turn off. I guess buying on the internet is always like buying a cat in the sack.</li>
            <li> Love this product. You can tell it is made in a very natural process in Africa. There is not a strong or very noticeable scent, but I would not say it is odorless either. I enjoy using it but because it is so expensive for such a small amount, I would use the whole tin in a week, so I ration it. I guess you are really paying for the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li> Smooth , mild smell...good for skin and hair.............wish I got more for the price.again love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li> Product is high quality. I keep it in the fridge to prevent rancidity. This product seems to be helping the dry skin of my hands better than any of the many commercial hand creams I have tried. Pure shea butter was recommended in a recent edition of Consumer Reports&#x27; \\&quot;On Health\\&quot; magazine. A physician writing there suggested it would work better for dry skin than commercial cream mixes. This product has a light nutty smell (which is normal, so I&#x27;ve read), but it is not unpleasant and dissipates within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brand due to the previous good reviews, and I concur that it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> What a great product, I use it for my hands, lips and hair. I have extremely oily skin, and I do not know if I would break out if I used it on my face. I do love the fact that is very natural. Although the scent is not beautiful, it doesn&#x27;t bother me, is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I will wait for the winter to use it on my face and will update my review. So far so GOOD!</li>
            <li> Just received my shea butter moments ago. It was promptly delivered fast and packaged nicely. I just put it on and I finally feel hydrated. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. I kind of like the smell too because it&#x27;s not fragrant. It&#x27;s very natural and feels great so far. I am hoping it will work nicely on my eczema.</li>
            <li> These women have a wonderful product. This Shea butter is worth every penny. You won&#x27;t regret buying this skin care product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good Shea Butter, it has done wonders for by hair and body. It&#x27;s a little on the expense side but worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all of the wonderful reviews and now I&#x27;m going to add my own wonderful review for this great product. I usually suffer with cracked skin on my hands and feet during the winter, but I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter once daily on my hands and feet and have only had one occurrence of cracked skin on one finger. It has completely healed the heel cracks that were so bad they were bleeding and I often had to have band aids on both my feet and fingers...but not anymore! I had tried numerous products designed to heal cracked heels with disappointing results and this is the only product that has worked for me. This shea butter is fabulous and it arrived quickly and contained information about the people who harvest this, which I found interesting and gave a nice personal touch. I&#x27;m going to make sure I never run out of it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a video of ojoba women in Ghana making this shea butter, so I decided to search it here on amazon and thank God it&#x27;s available. I love how it moisturize my skin.  I have some acne blemishes and pimple scars, i hope this product would help me clear them. Thank you to Ojoba Women..</li>
            <li> Great for dry winter hands...have used for several years now. It is the best!</li>
            <li> Our little guy has really dry skin and I wanted somthing without chemicals and this is perfect!  He likes it too!</li>
            <li> Quality.  I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars for quality, but if your purpose is to use on your children you might want to remember the smell is not very appealing.  I still think it&#x27;s worth 5 stars, but kids will not wear this (I believe).</li>
            <li> Very good for people with excessive dry skin.  Try it I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. So pure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Luxuriously moisturizers but also soaks right in. Unscenred. Lasts for hours. Softens my skin. And happy to support a cooperative. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I started using shea butter about a year ago as my regular facial and body moisturizer and I have tried several products.  While using shea butter is not like using other lotions and creams I have found that for me it works more effectively and feels great on my skin.  Shea butter might not be for everyone but if you are a shea butter fan this is a great on to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seemed to be a bit creamier and less gritty than others I have used.  It has a pleasant nutty smell and melts between my palms quite quickly for an even and quick application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, who scoffed at me using shea butter instead of traditional lotions, has started stealing my Ojoba butter to moisturize his beard and face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a product quite like this one. It has literally made my skin irresistible to my husband. Now, it is quite thick so I only use it at night and NOT every night (I started breaking out a little on my legs but I have oily skin to begin with). Still, with that being said I think this is the most legit Shea Butter out there. I just wish they sold larger quantities.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, no chemicals pure unrefined.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent mosturizer use on any part of the body really makes my hands soft.  I love the container it comes in makes easy to carry with you if needed.  Just love this product! Out of all the ones I have tried this is the best and will continue to use.  Just rub small amount in hands or between finger tips to heat up so goes on smooth. If looking for real  shea butter this is a great product</li>
            <li> Its awesome, it comes in a tin jar which makes it easily accessible and cute. I used it for everything, but not internally of course. It is a good product, only thing is that it doesnt say it is organic on lable and thats what I wanted, but it works well still. I like the organization, and alot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was very wary about ordering shea butter after reading a bunch of online reviews that were unfavorable, but this was exactly what I wanted. No odd smell, didn&#x27;t need to be softened, and came in professional packaging. This will be my go-to site until I can find a farmer&#x27;s market in my area that sells raw shea.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product when I had my oldest daughter. My hands were cracked and bleeding because I was washing tons of bottles. I just had my second child and luckily am able to breastfeed this time around but my hands were still chapped because I didn&#x27;t want to use regular hand cream (which I&#x27;m sure contains all kinds of nasty chemicals) and risk her accidentaly ingesting it. I used this shea butter last night and my fingertips are smooth again. I love it! The scent is natural so you definitely won&#x27;t be smelling any artificial fragrances you might be used to. I also like the concept of teaching a man (or woman) how to fish... This collective is helping women in a developing country to provide for their families and not rely as much on aid, which is wonderful. I did end up ordering this product directly from their web site because they had free shipping for orders of 2 tins or more. I will not be going back to any other moisturizer, ever!</li>
            <li> This skin care product is amazing, makes my skin look better. This shea butter works extremely well. Just love this butter!</li>
            <li> Best treatment you can give to your skin- head to toes.  Entirely natural,  chemical free and luxorious.  Trully  man can not compete with nature&#x27;s/God&#x27;s creation.  Tribal women work very hard to collect and extract  Shea butter from their native trees,  I am glad they are getting reimbursed for the work so they can live and feed their families.</li>
            <li> my skin is usally very dry even on summer this product is an excellent Moisturizer. also i noted that my psoriatic area become much softer and without the extra skin</li>
            <li> Very professional. Very clean. Very real shea butter. This product was true to everything it said it was. It was expensive &amp; quickly used up but very high quality.</li>
