            <li>Breakouts almost eliminated, no over-drying, and my face just feels clean.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more once I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li>The facial cleanser works great, does not dry out my skin and even smells pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>I tried several natural, gentle washes, and this one was perfect for me!</li>
            <li>It really cleanses the skin well, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than other cleansers suitable for my uppity skin, so I ordered it immediately.</li>
            <li>Love that it natural and made from hemp....</li>
            <li>Went looking for a more natural approach and found this.  </li>
            <li>when I bought I thought it would be more of a natural product.</li>
            <li>so healthy smooth and soft thanks will definitely buy more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, and I don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser</li>
            <li>My wife uses this facial cleanser and she loves it, much better than the cleanser from the body shop with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>This cleanser comes in a pretty bottle, smells lovely, and is creamy white.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cleanser, but the size of the bottle is SO SMALL!</li>
            <li>This is overall a great product, and definitely does NOT dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews as a gentle cleanser -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Gentle yet cleanses the skin very well.  </li>
            <li>Good for my combinational skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big note: use less&lt;br /&gt;You would not need a big squeeze, like some other face washes.  </li>
            <li>When I opened it , it smelled highly processed and &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really wash off makeup, so I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a natural makeup remover (I use Jojoba oil) to use before this product.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is very perfumy, it does not smell like a natural scent.</li>
            <li>liked the smell and texture of this cleanser, but after about a week I stopped using it because it seemed to be making me break out (several little pimples around my nose/cheeks), and I had changed nothing else in my routine.</li>
            <li>My skin is left soft and smooth, never dry or flaky.</li>
            <li>, i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount to create a nice, creamy lather.</li>
            <li>, I use a BufPuf with mine and leave your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also sensitive to SLS.</li>
            <li>I feel like this product cleans without being too abrasive and leaves my skin so soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>She has oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For soft water, it works quite well.</li>
            <li>made me break out, not non-comedogenic as far as I could see.</li>
            <li>Which doesn&#x27;t really make sense considering it&#x27;s a facial cleanser</li>
            <li>My skin feels extra soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, it really dried out my face the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty clear, but when I had sudden unusual breakouts (due to moving to a different climate)</li>
            <li>Not so much for harder water.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, prone to being too dry after a wash.</li>

            <li> I bought this based on the reviews as a gentle cleanser - I usually just do an acne facial wash at night, but that can be too drying during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell and texture of this cleanser, but after about a week I stopped using it because it seemed to be making me break out (several little pimples around my nose/cheeks), and I had changed nothing else in my routine. Might have been this cleanser, might have been something else.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and they seem to dry out my skin even when they are not supposed to.  The facial cleanser works great, does not dry out my skin and even smells pretty nice.  I like hemp products and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cleanser, but the size of the bottle is SO SMALL!</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is great..doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and the scent is wonderful. I plan to buy more once I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser..rinses off great, I use a BufPuf with mine and leave your skin soft and supple. Love that it natural and made from hemp....</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing, no weird smell or residue. My skin feels extra soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to help my skin post-pregnancy, even the expensive department store brands.  Couldn&#x27;t control my breakouts.  Went looking for a more natural approach and found this.  LOVE IT!  Breakouts almost eliminated, no over-drying, and my face just feels clean.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this product, when I bought I thought it would be more of a natural product. When I opened it , it smelled highly processed and &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve developed a sensitivity to fatty alcohols (benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, etc.) I&#x27;m also sensitive to SLS. Trying to find a cleanser that contains neither of these was near impossible. I ran across this one while searching literally every single cleanser sold on Amazon.

            <li> My wife uses this facial cleanser and she loves it, much better than the cleanser from the body shop with tea tree oil. She has oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! Leaves skin soft but not greasy; does a great job cleaning while moisturizing. A little drop goes a long way. Sometimes I add a drop of aveeno skin brightening daily scrub for a bit of exfoliation without drying. Good stuff; great value!</li>
            <li> A good cleanser but not for my combination skin</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used! I used to use the Boscia purifying cleanser, which also works well for me, but I think this one is even better. Gentle, refreshing smell, for a good clean feeling. My skin is pretty clear, but when I had sudden unusual breakouts (due to moving to a different climate) I tried several natural, gentle washes, and this one was perfect for me! Ordering my second bottle now!</li>
            <li> I threw it away after using it twice! Does not clean well at all!</li>
            <li> The facial cleanser does not work as well as the bcBud Body wash in my opinion. Though, bcBud products are fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product is okay, it really dried out my face the first few times I used it. Then it stopped and now all the sudden its drying out my face again:( Not very happy, i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used this for quite a while and I can say this about multiple water systems. For soft water, it works quite well. Not so much for harder water. Also, the smell is very perfumy, it does not smell like a natural scent. But effectively cleans.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My skin was a bit bla from winter and lack of sleep.  within one week, I was back to my glow. Priced well for amount received, really a great find.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Gentle yet cleanses the skin very well.  My skin has improved since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This face cleanser is very good for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now and iI luv it!!! Just order my mother and I another bottle. denfinitely a 5 STAR!!!</li>
            <li> Could take it or leave it. Has a male scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser! I have very sensitive skin, prone to being too dry after a wash. This cleanser comes in a pretty bottle, smells lovely, and is creamy white. You only need a little bit. It accomplishes something really simple, that other brands just can&#x27;t seem to get right; It cleans your skin without irritating it. It&#x27;s very gentle, and I don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer afterwards. It reduces redness and flaking and breakouts. Love it. Big ups, BcBud.</li>
            <li> makes your skin glow!</li>
            <li> made me break out, not non-comedogenic as far as I could see. Which doesn&#x27;t really make sense considering it&#x27;s a facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Not what I hoped for. Leaves face glistening.</li>
            <li> This product was just awesome it makes my face feel so healthy smooth and soft thanks will definitely buy more</li>
