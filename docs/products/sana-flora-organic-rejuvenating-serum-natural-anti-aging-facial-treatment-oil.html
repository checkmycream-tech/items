            <li>I have a prescription from the doctor for some more aggressive patches, but the skin under my eyes, on my scalp and on the tops of my ears also show symptoms.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with this serum, I&#x27;ve been using it for several months</li>
            <li>or maybe it is the fact that the myriad list of ingredients are pure and undiluted with fillers; You are getting a high potency shot of real essential oils which is awesome!</li>
            <li>I love the hint of lavender that stays with me all day, I love calming sensation that last all day.</li>
            <li>I turned to Sana Flora as an alternate treatment and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Finally I got most of that figured out with tons of doctors  and medication, but I havnt  used much on my face in years until a kind friend  introduced sana  to me and put it in my hands and say try this.</li>
            <li>I love the clean natural smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clearly has improved my fine lines and gives your skin a radiant glow!</li>

            <li>That being said I am in my early 20s</li>

            <li> I also had my son use this on a rash he was continually having on his nose and after only several weeks his nose is completely clear and the skin is smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft, less oily which I have also delt with forever.</li>
            <li> Would apply at night &amp; face would be dry by morning.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and flakes all day long... and have tons of break outs.</li>
            <li> It has also been working wonders on dry heels!</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of facial products, and have had little to no results.</li>
            <li> Give this a try if you&#x27;re curious</li>
            <li> My flaking has gone down substantially and the areas are much less red than they used to be.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the cumin oil which I have never seen in any other product before</li>
            <li> Definitely getting a few as stocking stuffers this year!</li>
            <li> For as long as I remember I have had bad facial issues, acne, scaring, probably since I was about 9 years old.</li>
            <li> Will have to use for a little longer to decide if I want to purchase again.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 6 to 8 weeks to see full results from skincare, but the company sends numerous emails so you will review their product, which is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Winters in the Midwest will destroy your face.</li>
            <li> I have been putting a few drops on my hands a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> I will never use anything else on my face  besides this, water, and a few bits of makeup.</li>
            <li> After a long day of cold and dry weather I come insider and use this.</li>
            <li> You are missing out if you don&#x27;t  take up this opportunity!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s extremely expensive and the amount of essential oils in this product may be irritating to some people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is slowly become clearer.</li>
            <li> A very small amount keeps my face and hands</li>
            <li> Cold winds dry the skin and leave you with itchy and reddened</li>
            <li> I have had bad skin for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks horrible and feels even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is definitely the best oil I have used yet. Maybe it is the cumin oil which I have never seen in any other product before or maybe it is the fact that the myriad list of ingredients are pure and undiluted with fillers; You are getting a high potency shot of real essential oils which is awesome! Whatever it is, this product makes your skin so soft, improves it&#x27;s tone and just feels good to use. I also love that it is made by people with a sincere desire to bring a product to people that doesn&#x27;t use shortcuts and who value health and well-being. All-around good product. Yay!</li>
            <li> I love Sana Flora Organic Facial Nectar!  I love the clean natural smell.  I love how it absorbs super quick.  I love how soft my face feels.  I actually want to use it on my legs as well. :)  Thanks Sana Flora!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff a lot.  I&#x27;m not usually one for organic lotions like this, but a friend of mine swears by it so I thought I would try it out.  It&#x27;s fantastic, much better than the store-bought name brands - my skin feels great.  Definitely getting a few as stocking stuffers this year!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and absolutely love it! I put it on before Preventage and Lip and Eye Cream.  It makes my skin so much softer and vibrant!</li>
            <li> Winters in the Midwest will destroy your face. Cold winds dry the skin and leave you with itchy and reddened checks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks horrible and feels even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I decided to take action and order a bottle of Sana Flora Organic Facial Nectar for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has helped immensely. After a long day of cold and dry weather I come insider and use this. My skin has been revitalized and I don&#x27;t suffer from wind burn any more.</li>
            <li> Didnt see any real difference in fine lines/wrinkles.  Would apply at night &amp; face would be dry by morning.  Was looking for an anti aging night time moisturizer that would last all day.</li>
            <li> I have been putting a few drops on my hands a few times a day.  They are suffering from winter dryness. It seems to help.  I also like the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I have had bad skin for as long as I can remember. Skin problems did not just plague me as an adolescent it followed me into adulthood with constant break outs. Sana Flora Organic Facial Nectar has made a really difference in my skin. My skin is slowly become clearer. I get compliments now on how clear my skin is. My skin has become softer to the touch, and it just cleaner and healthier to me. I have tried a number of facial products, and have had little to no results. I will keep using this serum because it works, and it is at an affordable price. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product; don&#x27;t like the smell and neither does my husband, but my daughters say it is just an herbal smell.  However, I like the product so well that I will continue to order it and just pat on some cologne to cover the herbal smell!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week.  So far, I really like it.  I was going to order more but it has gone up $10.00 from my original order two weeks ago.  Will have to use for a little longer to decide if I want to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product! This oil easily absorbs into the skin and does not make your face look oily. Also I&#x27;ve found it helps with dry/flakey skin without clogging pores or causing any breakouts. I use it daily after washing my face, leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love this product and how it moisturizes and smells nice.have ordered several bottles of it..this product has tightened my pores and has hydrated all with safe non chemical ingredients.. I also had my son use this on a rash he was continually having on his nose and after only several weeks his nose is completely clear and the skin is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is very quick in getting a response back on questions. Very pleased and will continue to order Sana Organics!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this serum, I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and it&#x27;s clearly has improved my fine lines and gives your skin a radiant glow!</li>
            <li> I love Sana Flora! A very small amount keeps my face and hands ( I use it on the back of my hands as well ) moisturized all day, and is giving my a skin a healthy more youthful appearance! Its so much better for my skin, than others I have used in the past, I love that it&#x27;s Organic! Did I mention, better for my budget?? The departments store brands don&#x27;t work as well, most aren&#x27;t Organic and cost up to 10 times more!! I&#x27;m hooked and will be ordering more :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I have both been using Sana Flora and love it. I never considered putting an oil on my face with fear my face would break out but this stuff makes my skin soft and not greasy at all! It has also been working wonders on dry heels!</li>
            <li> It takes at least 6 to 8 weeks to see full results from skincare, but the company sends numerous emails so you will review their product, which is a little annoying. Anyway, I&#x27;ve only had this oil for a week and it&#x27;s light, sinks right in, and hasn&#x27;t broken me out. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> The formulators of this new product know what they&#x27;re doing! I am blown away with the quality ingredients used. They nailed the blend by covering every area one may need to have great results for different skin types. Very excited to share it with my friends and family!</li>
            <li> wonderful product really helps with my skin during the summer months!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to find Sana Organics for sale on Amazon prime. I orderd and received my order of Flora in 5 days, that&#x27;s fantastic service.&lt;br /&gt;  I USE Flora on my face and neck. Flora works wonderful for me. I love the hint of lavender that stays with me all day, I love calming sensation that last all day. I love the soft touch. Thank you Sana Organics</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to find a more natural treatment for my plaque psoriasis. I have a prescription from the doctor for some more aggressive patches, but the skin under my eyes, on my scalp and on the tops of my ears also show symptoms. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable medicating those because the skin is thinner on these areas and topical steroids may thin the skin. I turned to Sana Flora as an alternate treatment and have been very pleased with the results. My flaking has gone down substantially and the areas are much less red than they used to be. In addition, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the effects of unnatural products on my skin because this product is organic. I really enjoy the feel of Sana Flora on my skin and will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is organic and (for me) locally made, however this wasn&#x27;t ground breaking for me. It is very moisturizing and smells great but beyond that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rejuvenate&amp;#34;. That being said I am in my early 20s so I don&#x27;t need too much in the anti-aging department just yet. Give this a try if you&#x27;re curious but it&#x27;s extremely expensive and the amount of essential oils in this product may be irritating to some people&#x27;s skin. *Tip: apply at night because it take quite some time to soak in.</li>
            <li> For as long as I remember I have had bad facial issues, acne, scaring, probably since I was about 9 years old. Finally I got most of that figured out with tons of doctors  and medication, but I havnt  used much on my face in years until a kind friend  introduced sana  to me and put it in my hands and say try this. I COULD NOT be HAPPIER with the results I have gotten, at first I broke out a bit but I use it after ever time I shower  and kept using it and my skin is so soft, less oily which I have also delt with forever. This product is beyond wonderful I will never use anything else on my face  besides this, water, and a few bits of makeup. You are missing out if you don&#x27;t  take up this opportunity! It&#x27;s all of the good stuff and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product that delivers incredible results.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and flakes all day long... and have tons of break outs. Just with one application I can already see the glow coming back in my skin.. I can not see what a week will do with my skin. :) feeling excited that I finally found something that I can see immediate results!!</li>
            <li> Lovely oil. Feels wonderful and my sensitive skin is very happy with it!</li>
