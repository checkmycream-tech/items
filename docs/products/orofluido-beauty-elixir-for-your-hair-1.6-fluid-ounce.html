            <li>Smells fantastic but didn&#x27;t do anything positive for my hair except make it smell good.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other hair oils, this is incredibly lightweight and makes your hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>

            <li>(their description is pretty accurate).  </li>

            <li>I love the calming effect it has on my hair, and I love the smell so much I use extra drops as perfume before going out.  </li>

            <li>tames my perm very well...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s very long</li>
            <li>so I could enjoyed my expensive and certainly better real argan oils.  </li>
            <li>but if your problem is that you need new hair: then the answer is not a product.</li>

            <li>Only new hair is new hair.</li>
            <li>I bought other hyped argan oils as well and used this one first</li>
            <li>The packaging mentions the scent in detail, but I barely notice it in the bottle or on my hair.</li>

            <li> I use this prior to blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> This  size will last you quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Trust me: mid shaft to end and a bit after flat iron or blow dry</li>
            <li> I might consider buying a smaller bottle next time, simply because i had a previous bottle that &amp;#34;went bad&amp;#34; before i could use it all.  </li>
            <li> The 50 ml bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The oil got cloudy and lost it scent, and took on a strange odor.  </li>

            <li> You can use whenever, but I apply before going out or after using a hair straightener to soothe the dry ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Puts life back into hair that&#x27;s been blow dried and straightened will always repurchase</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way on towl dried hair and can be used on dry hair too.</li>
            <li> A lot of argan oil type products will weigh my hair down or make it greasy, and I have yet to have this problem with Orofluido.</li>
            <li> but you know it&#x27;s naturally a mess.</li>
            <li> Using just a few drops of this a day, my bottle has held up for 5 months and isn&#x27;t half gone yet.</li>
            <li> I was given a few samples at one of these shows.</li>
            <li> And I have thick wavey hair..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells fantastic but didn&#x27;t do anything positive for my hair except make it smell good.  I never succeeded in finding that perfect amount to use that would give me noticeable results without making my fine hair limp and greasy.  The ends of my hair aren&#x27;t damaged, so only applying it there didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry hair and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Feels like silk and the fragrances is lovely.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this oil. Does nothing to help frizzes.</li>
            <li> Really helps taming the frizz.  A big plus is I cut my hair blow-drying time to almost a third.  The 50 ml bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this prior to blow drying and flat ironing. Leaves my hair soft but not greasy and frizz-free for days.</li>
            <li> soft and shiny on hair&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> smells so good! keeps my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin 2a-2b hair, and this product is great for (a.) applying to wet or damp hair for natural waves (b.) applying before heat-styling for straight hair, and (c.) touch-ups on dry hair to de-frizz. The packaging mentions the scent in detail, but I barely notice it in the bottle or on my hair. A lot of argan oil type products will weigh my hair down or make it greasy, and I have yet to have this problem with Orofluido.</li>
            <li> It is just ok. Is not a miracle for me. I prefer use coconut, avocado, olive or another natural oil.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. It smells great (their description is pretty accurate).  This  size will last you quite a long time.  Makes my hair very soft and helps to calm the curls and make my dry hair shinny.</li>
            <li> Love this product, leaves your hair smelling great! Puts life back into hair that&#x27;s been blow dried and straightened will always repurchase</li>
            <li> is amazing on your skin too. I use it on my face and it makes it so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, provides good shine.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since using it while in Europe.  It works great to smooth my curls and cut down on the frizz.  SMELLS FANTASTIC TOO.  A little goes a long way on towl dried hair and can be used on dry hair too.</li>
            <li> I love the calming effect it has on my hair, and I love the smell so much I use extra drops as perfume before going out.  My husband is not a perfume guy and he loves it as well.  I might consider buying a smaller bottle next time, simply because i had a previous bottle that &amp;#34;went bad&amp;#34; before i could use it all.  The oil got cloudy and lost it scent, and took on a strange odor.  That doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening with this bottle, but if it happens again i would just buy a smaller size.  Using just a few drops of this a day, my bottle has held up for 5 months and isn&#x27;t half gone yet.</li>
            <li> I worked beauty shows for 8 years all over the US for a company that sells...hair extensions.  I was given a few samples at one of these shows. I bought other hyped argan oils as well and used this one first so I could enjoyed my expensive and certainly better real argan oils.  Well, this one worked waaaaaay better than my expensive and known argan oil brands. I can&#x27;t believe is here. Trust me: mid shaft to end and a bit after flat iron or blow dry and it will look beautifully healthy.  Do not missenterpret me: this is no &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; revival. If your hair is damaged: it&#x27;s damaged. Best answer for that: chop it off and start fresh. Don&#x27;t make te same mistakes. Nothing fixes a torn paper. It will always be torn and same for damaged hair. You can make it look better but you know it&#x27;s naturally a mess. This product is great to seal your opened cuticles and give it nice, weightless shine and softness when styling and after. And to keep your ends from splitting. It will make the hair you care for, better but if your problem is that you need new hair: then the answer is not a product. Only new hair is new hair. Out with the old damage, stop all you are doing: color/ roots/ blow dry/ flat iron. Change of &amp;#34;hair life style&amp;#34;. Chop chop and just patiently nurture new hair to reality. I did it. Took b@lls but now as it is growing virgin is thick, healthy and I&#x27;m adding this product to nurture it as it grows, without heat and chemicals. This is a tool for ensuring and marauding  healthy hair. Not a shortcut miracle.</li>
            <li> I loved this product! It seems like an oil, but si much &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;. My hair is shining, and no frizz at all!</li>
            <li> tames my perm very well... keeps from being flyaway</li>
            <li> I first tried Orofluido when I was given a free sample by my hair stylist as a gift. That tiny sample lasted me two years. You just need a very tiny bit, depending on the length and thickness of your hair. I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s very long so I use a dime-sized amount and apply to the ends of my hair and underneath by the roots. It smells amazing--like vanilla! And the smell stays all day. Every time I would flip my hair someone would comment on the nice smell. Unlike other hair oils, this is incredibly lightweight and makes your hair shiny and healthy looking. You can use whenever, but I apply before going out or after using a hair straightener to soothe the dry ends of my hair. It&#x27;s especially effective if you dye your hair, as this can repair some of the damage done.This is the only product I will ever use on my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders to my hair. And I have thick wavey hair.. And all I have to do it put it on and go to go</li>
