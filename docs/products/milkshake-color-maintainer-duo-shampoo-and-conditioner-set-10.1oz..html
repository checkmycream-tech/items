            <li>I mostly use it as a change of pace shampoo from my real favorite, Neuma purple.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>i have purchased milk shake products in salons before and liked the product</li>
            <li>I used them many years ago and loved the way they made my hair smell.</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo with an interesting smell.  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Decided to try after being a absolute #1 fan of the Milk_shake Incredible Milk leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>My color still looks great after washing my hair 5 to 6 times since receiving this product on the first of August.</li>
            <li>Wife and daughter love this product and the smell.</li>

            <li>Love the duo shampoo &amp; conditioner set.</li>
            <li>She said my hair looked healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and they do mostly what they say they will.  </li>
            <li>but I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so grateful they offer this product as it is easily sold out at hair salons.</li>
            <li>My own mother noticed a difference on the first time I used it without knowledge that I had switched brands.</li>
            <li>The Shampoo and conditioner duo are fine.  </li>
            <li>After 6 weeks of using it, my hair still looks as great as it did when I left the salon.</li>
            <li>Smells great color last longer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not as good as their other products like the leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>So far I am thrilled with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair stays clean and fresh much longer.</li>
            <li>I am a consistent user as is my wife.  </li>
            <li>It was highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Product smelled great, but left my hair dry and oily.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>But the conditioner doesn&#x27;t detangle very well.</li>
            <li>I may have used too much, but it made my hair feel greasy, and I don&#x27;t want that at all</li>
            <li>Fast shipper..</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I definitely will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and have been looking for something that will work with high humidity.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product and all the Milkshake</li>
            <li>these products leave my hair soft and shining!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, not sure I would buy againâ€¦my color has faded in 1 week</li>
            <li>Your hair feels soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>is so soft.  </li>
            <li>Thanks no thanks.</li>
            <li>My hair is the one of the thickest hair including strands and volume plus it is amazingly dry and course from years of coloring since I started graying early in life.</li>
            <li>I am a natural red head and at 48 my hair is long and needs all the help it can get.</li>

            <li> Your hair feels soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> is so soft.  </li>
            <li> Thanks no thanks.</li>
            <li> My hair is the one of the thickest hair including strands and volume plus it is amazingly dry and course from years of coloring since I started graying early in life.</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head and at 48 my hair is long and needs all the help it can get.</li>
            <li> There is a big difference from the dry or damage hair conditioner and the color treated hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is nothing special, and the conditioner is very weak.</li>
            <li> One wash, blow dry and straightener</li>
            <li> I prefer the dry or damaged one.</li>
            <li> They do switch out from this one to one other that I buy on Amazon on occasion.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The conditioner that came with the shampoo doesn&#x27;t tame the frizz that I have in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not entirely sure why, I dont ask -</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo a lot, not sure about the conditioner yet.  </li>
            <li> You have to use a lot of product to soften and de tangle your hair - and my hair isn&#x27;t thick</li>
            <li> Not overpowering or fake smelling.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These products are terrific.  Your hair feels soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Smells good!! The conditioner does not detangle well. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> great product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> Love Milkshake!  Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat course and frizzy blonde hair. Not anymore! One wash, blow dry and straightener and I felt like I just left the salon. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful products with lovely scent!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is pricey but has been great for my colored hair.  It smells amazing too!</li>

            <li> i have purchased milk shake products in salons before and liked the product but this one ruined my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells DELICIOUS!!! Works great!</li>
            <li> Great product, And Great company!</li>
            <li> These products are wonderful! I used them many years ago and loved the way they made my hair smell. Once I started dying my hair, I needed something that would help keep the color (I went red) and this does the trick! After 6 weeks of using it, my hair still looks as great as it did when I left the salon.</li>
            <li> wonderful product for color treated hair.  it is shiny, not frizzy and is so soft.  i highly recommend it to every one.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair has been fried by processing and coloring, and this stuff paired with the leave in conditioner has brought my hair back to life. It also smells incredible, like angel food cake! I HIGHLY recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it the seller did a great job</li>
            <li> Product smelled great, but left my hair dry and oily. It&#x27;s my fault for wanting to get a salon product for not salon prices. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter love this product and the smell. They do switch out from this one to one other that I buy on Amazon on occasion. Not entirely sure why, I dont ask - I just get them more when they need it. I like the smell as well. Not overpowering or fake smelling.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is nothing special, and the conditioner is very weak. You have to use a lot of product to soften and de tangle your hair - and my hair isn&#x27;t thick so iI feel that it shouldn&#x27;t need a lot of product. If I wanted my money back, the company I purchased it from said I&#x27;d have to talk to Anazon. Thanks no thanks.</li>
            <li> these products leave my hair soft and shining!</li>
            <li> Love the duo shampoo &amp; conditioner set. Decided to try after being a absolute #1 fan of the Milk_shake Incredible Milk leave in conditioner. My hair is the one of the thickest hair including strands and volume plus it is amazingly dry and course from years of coloring since I started graying early in life. I am a natural red head and at 48 my hair is long and needs all the help it can get. I&#x27;m so happy that I ordered the shampoo and conditioner set. My own mother noticed a difference on the first time I used it without knowledge that I had switched brands. She said my hair looked healthy and shiny. That was the best testimony I could have.

            <li> Works great and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>

            <li> Love this product. This was the best price I could find anywhere for it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product!  I like the shampoo a lot, not sure about the conditioner yet.  I think I like Milk Shake incredible milk leave in conditioner better!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, not sure I would buy againâ€¦my color has faded in 1 week</li>
            <li> Smells great color last longer</li>
            <li> Great product!  Smells great!  Prompt service!</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and conditioner duo are fine.  I love the fragrance and they do mostly what they say they will.  The conditioner that came with the shampoo doesn&#x27;t tame the frizz that I have in my hair.  I also ordered the leave-in conditioner which is not pictured.  I may have used too much, but it made my hair feel greasy, and I don&#x27;t want that at all and my hair was still frizzy.  I live in a very humid climate and have been looking for something that will work with high humidity.  So, I&#x27;ll stick with the shampoo/conditioner duo but will not order the leave-in conditioner again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper.. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> There is a big difference from the dry or damage hair conditioner and the color treated hair conditioner. I prefer the dry or damaged one.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Wish it came in a bigger size!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not as good as their other products like the leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My color still looks great after washing my hair 5 to 6 times since receiving this product on the first of August. So far I am thrilled with the shampoo and conditioner. I am looking forward to trying other products in this line.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo with an interesting smell.  It definitely smells like a milkshake.  I mostly use it as a change of pace shampoo from my real favorite, Neuma purple.</li>
            <li> It is a good shampoo and conditioner set to match the hair color so it lasts longer. It did not come in the set box that I&#x27;m used to but I&#x27;m so grateful they offer this product as it is easily sold out at hair salons. Would recommend this product to anyone out there who needs a color maintaining shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love it!! It was highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. My hair stays clean and fresh much longer.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Can&#x27;t find it locally. It came as described.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Made hair look and smell great!</li>
            <li> If I use conditioner and shampoo plus the leave my hair feels greedy sometimes but I love the way it smells. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Great smell, good for all hair types</li>
