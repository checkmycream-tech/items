            <li>This kind of lip gloss sticks around.  </li>
            <li>This stays on and has a wonderful color that looks natural not</li>
            <li>, makes them look natural and healthy !!!</li>
            <li>It glides on very smooth and is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I use lip stains almost exclusively and love them, so I have some experience in this area.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the color</li>
            <li>I love this lip stain.</li>
            <li>I love these lips stains.</li>
            <li>many better lip glosses out there...</li>
            <li>It doesnt really show color wise on my lips.</li>
            <li>On its own its really pretty and its not sticky.</li>
            <li>and i love combining it with other lipsticks to create beautiful shades.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just too light a shade</li>
            <li>It stays on longer than others and is comfortable and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more, as it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been wanting for years without wasting money.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice soft feel!</li>
            <li>This would be a good idea, IF it actually worked which it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It works like a gloss, but the color is definitely richer, and I would say it&#x27;s good for people like me who want to try lipstick but don&#x27;t quite know where to start.</li>
            <li>however it does get super tacky on my lips.</li>
            <li>If you want shine, you&#x27;d have to apply this over and over just like a regular gloss...or apply your own gloss over this stain.</li>
            <li>it really does stay on, feels good on my lips, and doesn&#x27;t dry them out.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful on and last on the lips for a long time.</li>
            <li>Maybe 1 star for pretty package.</li>
            <li>so it sounded better than a traditional stain..</li>
            <li>Infallible Never Fail Lipcolour, Amethyst]]</li>
            <li>Love the lip stain and have ordered several colors.</li>
            <li>I actually wear lipstick under it &amp; then put this on top.</li>
            <li>wears off and leaves a nice pink stain.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll use it but it won&#x27;t be the first thing i reach for.</li>
            <li>I give it one star for pretty plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>Says it lasts 6 hours, most stains last much longer than that.  </li>
            <li>This was ok, not as sticky as most lip stains, but the color didn&#x27;t stay very long (pink rebellion).  </li>
            <li>Also seems to ware off fast</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Also, as others have said it doesn&#x27;t come safety sealed like most other lip products I use.</li>
            <li>The color was different than how it looks in the tube (I got pink rebellion), which is actually probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>At first I thought someone had mailed to me a used tube that had water added, but water is the key ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Stains provide immediate color and don&#x27;t usually have to \\&quot;set\\&quot; for more than a minute or so.</li>
            <li>I thought this sounded nice, as I knew stains last but can be dry, so it said it was wet shine</li>
            <li>Does not feel natural on the lips, sticky and waxy.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely less bold than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Only reason I bought this was because I wanted a bright summery pink, hard to find in stains.  </li>
            <li>IT IS JUST NOT A GOOD FIT FOR ME...</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and a little bit watery.</li>

            <li> It is very moisturizing and a little bit watery.</li>
            <li> Although the product picture would lead one to believe that the gloss would have a nice, bright pink color to it, I was very disappointed to note that what I actually got was actually a dull, mauve hue.</li>
            <li> And the color is very natural, which I can wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> if you lips are  just a little bit tinted already naturally</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my lips as other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> Smells old ladyish, but not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drug store, as someone who NEVER wears lipstick but loves the look on other people.</li>
            <li> so it could dry...</li>
            <li> I wiped it off my lips (easily) after a few minutes and my lips were left feeling very dry and took a while for chemical taste to go away, it&#x27;s expensive for amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH OR SHINY ENOUGH.  </li>
            <li> Does not last and the pale pink had no color after 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I want to try other colors to see how they look.</li>
            <li> Looks pink on the little wand, but what little color there is goes on as a purplish mauve.</li>
            <li> If I could give it less than 1 star, I would have.</li>
            <li> Oddly, they don&#x27;t like to mix well.</li>
            <li> it hardly shows up on your lip &amp; is gone in a sec.....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lips stick together, and color stays for a few hours without coming off on eveything that touches my lips.  </li>
            <li> My lips looked dead - as in the lips of the dead body on the slab on CSI.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t waste your money and just buy</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  </li>
            <li> I have very very small lips, therefore I am always having to reapply my lip gloss/stain.</li>
            <li> but alas, it never stopped being sticky, and it started separating into thick clumps.</li>
            <li> I returned it once thinking something was wrong with it, but this is just the way it is.  </li>
            <li> mad that I bought 2..</li>
            <li> i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i like how it feels on my lips but i&#x27;m a Latina w fair skin and i feel that my lips look the same with this on. i do like it but i ended up giving it to my mom the color was the color of my lips i was hoping for what was in the image. i was disappointed. if you lips are  just a little bit tinted already naturally i suggest go for a different color</li>
            <li> At first I thought someone had mailed to me a used tube that had water added, but water is the key ingredient.  This stain is the best lip color I&#x27;ve ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t make my lips stick together, and color stays for a few hours without coming off on eveything that touches my lips.  I will be ordering more, as it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been wanting for years without wasting money.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> If I could give it less than 1 star, I would have. Maybe 1 star for pretty package. Purchased this at CVS for $10, might as well have put a match to that $10 bill!  Advertised as stain and gloss in one. This is NOT a stain. I use lip stains almost exclusively and love them, so I have some experience in this area. Only reason I bought this was because I wanted a bright summery pink, hard to find in stains.  Looks pink on the little wand, but what little color there is goes on as a purplish mauve. My lips looked dead - as in the lips of the dead body on the slab on CSI. Stains provide immediate color and don&#x27;t usually have to \\&quot;set\\&quot; for more than a minute or so. Even after 15 minutes of \\&quot;setting\\&quot; I could wipe this off entirely with a damp tissue.  Does not feel natural on the lips, sticky and waxy.  Says it lasts 6 hours, most stains last much longer than that.  I didn&#x27;t find this to last at all.  This would be a good idea, IF it actually worked which it doesn&#x27;t.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  L&#x27;Oreal will be hearing from this consumer.&lt;br /&gt;If you want inexpensive stains and/or longlasting lipsticks, Cover Girl has a number of excellent products that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> This is definitely less bold than I anticipated. It also is just a simple lip stain...there is no &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; involved. If you want shine, you&#x27;d have to apply this over and over just like a regular gloss...or apply your own gloss over this stain. On the plus side, it is not at all drying like some lip stains I have tried.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH OR SHINY ENOUGH.  IT IS JUST NOT A GOOD FIT FOR ME... THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT A STAR.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as i thought. It doesnt really show color wise on my lips. Also seems to ware off fast</li>
            <li> It goes on like water.  Does not last and the pale pink had no color after 10 minutes.  I returned it once thinking something was wrong with it, but this is just the way it is.  Terrible product.  Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drug store, as someone who NEVER wears lipstick but loves the look on other people. I was overwhelmed by the choices and didn&#x27;t know what to choose. I thought this sounded nice, as I knew stains last but can be dry, so it said it was wet shine so it sounded better than a traditional stain.. And it&#x27;s even better than I thought it would be! The color was different than how it looks in the tube (I got pink rebellion), which is actually probably a good thing. It works like a gloss, but the color is definitely richer, and I would say it&#x27;s good for people like me who want to try lipstick but don&#x27;t quite know where to start. The color stays for a while, and it doesn&#x27;t get on your teeth! I want to try other colors to see how they look.</li>
            <li> This was ok, not as sticky as most lip stains, but the color didn&#x27;t stay very long (pink rebellion).  Maybe it was just too light a shade</li>
            <li> this lip stain is great, i love it.&lt;br /&gt;they mosturize your lips, makes them look natural and healthy !!!&lt;br /&gt;Excelent</li>
            <li> I am in love with the color and i love combining it with other lipsticks to create beautiful shades. On its own its really pretty and its not sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain. I have very very small lips, therefore I am always having to reapply my lip gloss/stain. That is not the case with this. I can apply it once and I know it will still be there hours later. It does not dry out my lips as other reviews stated. It glides on very smooth and is not sticky at all. I am really happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This kind of lip gloss sticks around.  It doesn&#x27;t bleed out at all, and itlayers well for intensity.  I do not recommend blending colors on the lip though.  Oddly, they don&#x27;t like to mix well.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me to this product. It is very moisturizing and a little bit watery. I personally don&#x27;t like lip product that is too sticky. And the color is very natural, which I can wear it everyday. So it&#x27;s good for me! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start from the beginning of the \\&quot;product trial\\&quot;.... I cleaned my lips off for maximum adherence, swiping the product on twice (to make the color pop), and sat still with my mouth open for 2-3 min. so it could dry... but alas, it never stopped being sticky, and it started separating into thick clumps. I was left with a stain line that only lined my lips (didn&#x27;t stain the rest) and the slimy clumps that migrated to my teeth when I started talking. L&#x27;oreals infallible lasts eons longer than this... so don&#x27;t waste your money and just buy [[ASIN:B001H99Z9A L&#x27;Oreal Paris Infallible Never Fail Lipcolour, Amethyst]] (there are over a dozen colors) and they stay on 5hrs+</li>
            <li> Although the product picture would lead one to believe that the gloss would have a nice, bright pink color to it, I was very disappointed to note that what I actually got was actually a dull, mauve hue. It turned out to be quite the opposite effect that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love the lip stain and have ordered several colors. It stays on longer than others and is comfortable and not sticky.</li>
            <li> This stays on and has a wonderful color that looks natural not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;You can kiss someone and they don&#x27;t have your lipstick on!</li>
            <li> I thought finally a lip stain that will give me that gloss look. But there just isn&#x27;t enough color for me. I actually wear lipstick under it &amp; then put this on top. It helps to give that glossy look. But I don&#x27;t know that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely totally positively LOVE this color and lip stain!  it really does stay on, feels good on my lips, and doesn&#x27;t dry them out.</li>
            <li> I love these lips stains. They are beautiful on and last on the lips for a long time. I bought several for me and my sister</li>
            <li> Smells old ladyish, but not a huge deal. i don&#x27;t mind that it goes on sheer (the color is buildable). doesn&#x27;t feel sticky when going on. after maybe 20-30 min however it does get super tacky on my lips. really didn&#x27;t like it. wears off and leaves a nice pink stain. eh. i&#x27;ll use it but it won&#x27;t be the first thing i reach for.</li>
            <li> Has a nice soft feel!</li>
            <li> Hated it. It smells like nail polish. It made my lips feel like they were burning.  I actually thought for a minute that maybe I had made mistake and it wasn&#x27;t meant for the lips! Chemical taste and smell. I wiped it off my lips (easily) after a few minutes and my lips were left feeling very dry and took a while for chemical taste to go away, it&#x27;s expensive for amount of product you get. Bought at CVS for $9.99 I will be returning it. Also, as others have said it doesn&#x27;t come safety sealed like most other lip products I use. I give it one star for pretty plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> Nothing like th ecommercial shows it to be....many better lip glosses out there...don&#x27;t waste your $. it hardly shows up on your lip &amp; is gone in a sec.....mad that I bought 2..</li>
