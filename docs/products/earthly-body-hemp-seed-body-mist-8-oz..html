            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>smells wonderful ,, even my children love the smell ,they say it reminds them of the boardwalk.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Earthly Glow Oil, Nag Champa and it smells awesome if your a Nag Champa lover you will love this oil</li>
            <li>Love love this oil!!!  </li>
            <li>smells so good.</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>It feels good on your face as well.</li>
            <li>A friend used to make nag champa soap and oil that I loved, but she&#x27;s gotten out of the business.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, it is probably me not the product.</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful, genuine nag champa scent.  </li>
            <li>But for me that is a good thing because I&#x27;ve used body oils that stained clothing</li>
            <li>Glow Oil its the perfect touch to add a powdery light scent</li>
            <li>For me it has been superior to just using HEMP oil alone</li>
            <li>It smells SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, and makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li>Silky, absorbs beautifully, all natural/ chemical free, NOT tested on animals, made in the U.S.A.!  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful at first, then fades away, but the moisture lasts!</li>
            <li>and I was so impressed by the way the oil smelled and how it was absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the lotion, so I figured the oil would be just as amazing.</li>
            <li>The value cannot be beat but most importantly, it feels and smells great!</li>
            <li>This body oil is among my favorite products I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>love nag champa!</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of Nag Champa incense, you will love this!</li>
            <li>Love how it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue as well!</li>
            <li>This goes on smooth and has a scent that sticks with you!!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of Nag Champa, you will LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Honestly could not get any better!</li>
            <li>Bottle looks did then this pic but still amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing</li>
            <li>It would be amazing to use for a massage.</li>
            <li>This scent is also amazing.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is probably a reaction to your own body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice tho.</li>
            <li>The oil is nice and no problems, just the scent is not what I remembered.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light smell and works great for after the shower.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and the smell is wonderful!!  </li>
            <li>Did not smell like nag champa, smells like linseed oil for painting, kind of like a vegetable oil smell.</li>
            <li>I hope over time this oil plays nicely with my skin because I truly want to always wear it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an earthy, musky kind of smell</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this item!! :-)</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful in summer, to lightly rub this oil over freshly shaven legs, and shoulders and arms too, to show off a beautiful glow when wearing a tank top or a strapless dress.</li>
            <li>this  bright bottle love the packaging love the smell.</li>
            <li>also, the reason I love it so much, is that my skin feels GREAT after I use this!</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and with in minutes gave me</li>
            <li>This is very strong stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is pleasant and unique.  </li>
            <li>Nice body oit, but the Dreamsicle scented Glow Oil works better,</li>
            <li>Honestly I think this smells a LOT more like baby powder than Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li>Instead of using lotion, this is the best natural alternative for a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful &amp; keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>and it goes on very smooth, and not oily,</li>
            <li>I so love the smell of Nag Champa, this scent is gentle and I feel moisture is great for my skin.</li>
            <li>so every time I use it I have to unscrew the bottle top and pour some in my palm to apply.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from a store I shall not name for a better price</li>
            <li>I love the product in the bottle</li>
            <li>but when you spray out of the top, it&#x27;s just a stream of oil that comes shooting out and bounces off your skin everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>It smells just like the incense, but a tad more powdery.</li>
            <li>I can see where some people would love this product, but it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li>I just felt that the oil was too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>so you can still wear your favorite perfume or body mist.</li>
            <li>I use it as a scent on top of lotion.</li>
            <li>As someone else pointed out, the fragrance more resembles baby powder.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and figured ok give it a try.</li>
            <li>Even better than the nag champa incense(if</li>
            <li>I smell the jojoba oil the most when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I love Nag Champa!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>It smells 10,000x better than I could even imagine.</li>
            <li>If you love nag champa, get it.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more for gift-giving -</li>
            <li>Love the Nag Champa scent on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the face that it comes in a spray bottle</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>We look better too.</li>
            <li>I love Nag Champa</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if this is the way this stuff is to smell, but I sure would not wear this on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best.. especially after exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I love it on me.  </li>
            <li>Love the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I love the Nag Champa scent - but I grew up in the 70s and still burn the Nag Champa incense.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out or maybe more before then just to share with someone.</li>
            <li>I love this Nag Champa Hemp oil.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS product.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I love the Nag Champa fragrance</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so exotic.</li>
            <li>Stuff smells great, is a bit strong and of course oily haha</li>
            <li>Smells so good, i love it so much and super cheap for how good it smells</li>
            <li>While the spray-on factor seems like a good idea, I think I&#x27;d really prefer a pump bottle or flip top cap.  </li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite great buy for the quantity and quality</li>
            <li>Smells like the incense which I love but its mostly just cheap oil with some added fragrance</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Nag Champa and now I can enjoy it all day.  </li>
            <li>Although, the hemp seems to be the top note of the fragrances, I still enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>so I can gift this to my free spirited friends.</li>
            <li>An exotic  fragrance which smells more sweet perfumey than its incense counterpart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good service, thanks.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because the oil is right on scent!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, even if you don&#x27;t really like nag champa, the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>About five minutes later, my grandfatherly dentist said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s YOU that smells so good!  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it gives you a nice soft glow.</li>
            <li>Traps moisture in and smells great at the same time. :)</li>
            <li>Besides the wonderful scent it really does work wonders to make skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>Like really, really strong Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and easy to apply with zero oiliness.</li>
            <li>It applies easily and is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with this oil soaking into my skin without leaving an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might be the hemp seed oil, but I&#x27;m fine with that.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>The oil does soak in very well though and makes your skin look really nice.  </li>
            <li>your money perfume will last you months great buy</li>
            <li>Well this goes on smoothly and does smell a touch like Nag Champa</li>
            <li>However, if you like that smell, you will defiantly be happy with this Glow oil because it does last for a looooong time!</li>
            <li>In combination with serum and moisturizer I feel finally like Ive reached a point that I am reasonably happy about-</li>
            <li>And the fact that it is in a carrier oil that is smooth and light and wont clog your pores are a plus.  </li>
            <li>I carry it everywhere and even put it in my hair to smooth my frizzies.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and has a light powdery sent that</li>
            <li>My skin feel soft, the oil smell good (not over powering)</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>This is a definite favorite!!</li>
            <li>and the price is so worth it, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my first order was four bottles because I never want to be without this oil again.  </li>
            <li>But it absorbs quickly and my husband myself and our kids enjoy it.</li>
            <li>What is that?&amp;#34;  When I went back, his assistant told me she had ordered the oil and shampoo and her fiance loved.</li>
            <li>The Nag Champa scent is delicate and wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is a definite feel good product.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job, without making you feel greasy and gross.</li>
            <li>I almost threw this hemp oil out because the odor is overwhelmingly flowery (to me) and only appropriate for a woman.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>&quot; It definitely helps me feel more comfortable in my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty but not so light that you can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li>Oil is ok but it has too heavy and kind of cheap perfume smell</li>
            <li>Perfect balance between a light and strong scent (and too much or too little can ruin a nag champa scent), doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily, just soft.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the nice light scent with you all day long.</li>
            <li>I have fair and dry skin</li>
            <li>It is pretty strong at first, so I use just one spritz on the wrist and rub it in.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how similar the scent smells to the incense.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and definitely lingers.</li>
            <li>I love Nag Champa, but I can&#x27;t apply too much of this straight from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her it&#x27;s &amp;#34;an old hippie scent.&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li>After many (many, many, many) failed attempts at finding something with the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; nag champa scent, this is it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use perfume, so I get essential oils to add to unsented lotion to make my own scented body lotion.  </li>
            <li>Not too sure about the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; part of the oil because it is not greasy at all and thus, really doesn&#x27;t leave much of a shine on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This oil combination is extremely effective for facial moisturization -</li>
            <li>The scent is so pretty and sweet but not in a cloying way.</li>
            <li>So you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>I totally would recommend buying this product to all that love the true scent of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and keeps your skin soft and smooth throughout the day unlike most lotions which contain alcohol and actually dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li>, I mean you are not going to get a beauty product of any sort that smells exactly like an incense, but this is very close, and it does have a very nice smell, and it subtle, so it is not to strong, but just strong enough, which is perfect!</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and moisturized really well.</li>
            <li>Super fast service.</li>
            <li>It soaks right into your skin, leaving it soft and smooth, not greasy and oily.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, I love nag champa, and I usually use baby oil, so I thought I would at least give this a try, and I am so very glad that I did!</li>
            <li>when I first order the oil</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of this glow oil.</li>
            <li>I love Nag Champa and burn the incense regularly.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so I really like that it isn&#x27;t all oily and greasy!</li>
            <li>I love that it is in a spray form as you can spray your back too!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered two different scents and love them both.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly, lasting throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with my favorite body cream</li>
            <li>Great product, expected a different aroma from this oil.</li>
            <li>Stays on for a long time, moisturizers and smells just like nag champa incense :)))).</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Earthly Body!</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin, and this just doesn&#x27;t alleviate it - though the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really matter, though, because the fragrance is very light and will certainly stay with you long.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>only beef is that the spray nozzle does get clogged easily.  </li>
            <li>It goes on and absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>I only gave 3 stats because the fragrance is not as strong as it used to be</li>
            <li>I use this nag champa glow oil just after I get out of the shower and my skin stays soft and smells nice all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and absorbs into your skin quickly without too much residue, leaving your skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for several months now as a body oil, and my skin has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li>In fact, I plan to refill the spray bottle with my much cheaper supply of pure hemp seed oil.</li>
            <li>you have to purchase this if you love the smell it lasts for a few hours and make my skin super soft and gives my legs an osm glow when wearin shorts  also make hair shiny too ships vey fast and so worth</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love!!super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>too much on the sweeter side, rather than spicey , for me.  </li>
            <li>then I took a shower and spray myself with it (not too much)</li>
            <li>and I have never used anything that made my skin so soft and fresh....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to nag champa lovers!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel when used on wet skin.</li>
            <li>I like the way it smells too, very relaxing.</li>
            <li>This oil&#x27;s scent is very woody</li>
            <li>So much so that I can forgo perfume and just wear this instead.  </li>
            <li>but...to me it does haha.</li>
            <li>I absolutely ADORE this product.</li>
            <li>I use a whole bottle in a bout months.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and it sprays on.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the simple and natural ingredients as well :)</li>
            <li>It is strong, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>love nag champa incense and other nag champa oils</li>
            <li>(at first it is oily, I rub it in just a little most of the time, you wouldn&#x27;t have to though, and the oiliness is gone in about 3 to 5 mins, so that isn&#x27;t a problem).</li>
            <li>For those reviews that said they thought this smelled like baby powder... obviously those people aren&#x27;t familiar with the smell of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>And if the price remains as low as it is now, I&#x27;ll likely add-on a bottle with most of my large Amazon orders.  </li>
            <li>Running it under hot water will clear the nozzle, but every time you do that, you run the risk of introducing water or bacteria into the rest of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for such a large selection!!  </li>
            <li>Also, the scent lasts a while-- which I would like if it smelled more like Nag Champa and less like a grandma.</li>
            <li>I continue to use a light lotion to keep my dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>but I use it mainly for moisturizing after the shower.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly after a shower and massage it on my hips and buttocks.</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and will buy it again (and again.....).</li>
            <li>The oil is gentle and not greasy and blends into the skin well and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and use body oil to stay hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in other scents.</li>
            <li>It has potential, but it smells funny.</li>
            <li>I have never seen nor felt my skin this soft, EVER!</li>
            <li>The oil itself is a nice moisturizer, but one could achieve the same thing with any other inert essential vegetable, seed, or nut oil.</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The spray bottle is ok, but I think I would like a squeeze bottle instead since oil is hard to spread on the skin.</li>
            <li>and this stuff makes me soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It smells like avacados and old baby oil.</li>
            <li>But a few hours later, there&#x27;s still a lovely scent lingering.</li>
            <li>Instead I used it only at night and was very pleasantly surprised at how rich a  glow and deeply moisturized my face looked the next day-</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a Nag Champa oil scent and this one was right on the money just as its other reviews said.</li>
            <li>The Earthly Body Glow Oil, Nag Champa,Hemp Seed is a fast drying oil that makes even very dry skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavy but does eventually sink in and leaves your skin super moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my legs and arms after showering and it is the only thing that consistently helps my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>First the packaging is now a black bottle so you can&#x27;t see the product.</li>
            <li>sent is mild, not overwhelming to me</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin was much softer with much less redness and irritation as I continued to use this product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> smells wonderful ,, even my children love the smell ,they say it reminds them of the boardwalk.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Earthly Glow Oil, Nag Champa and it smells awesome if your a Nag Champa lover you will love this oil</li>
            <li> Love love this oil!!!  </li>
            <li> smells so good.</li>
            <li> Feels good.</li>
            <li> It feels good on your face as well.</li>
            <li> A friend used to make nag champa soap and oil that I loved, but she&#x27;s gotten out of the business.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, it is probably me not the product.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful, genuine nag champa scent.  </li>
            <li> But for me that is a good thing because I&#x27;ve used body oils that stained clothing</li>
            <li> Glow Oil its the perfect touch to add a powdery light scent</li>
            <li> For me it has been superior to just using HEMP oil alone</li>
            <li> It smells SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Silky, absorbs beautifully, all natural/ chemical free, NOT tested on animals, made in the U.S.A.!  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful at first, then fades away, but the moisture lasts!</li>
            <li> and I was so impressed by the way the oil smelled and how it was absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the lotion, so I figured the oil would be just as amazing.</li>
            <li> The value cannot be beat but most importantly, it feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> This body oil is among my favorite products I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> love nag champa!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of Nag Champa incense, you will love this!</li>
            <li> Love how it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue as well!</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth and has a scent that sticks with you!!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of Nag Champa, you will LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Honestly could not get any better!</li>
            <li> Bottle looks did then this pic but still amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing</li>
            <li> It would be amazing to use for a massage.</li>
            <li> This scent is also amazing.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is probably a reaction to your own body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice tho.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice and no problems, just the scent is not what I remembered.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light smell and works great for after the shower.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and the smell is wonderful!!  </li>
            <li> Did not smell like nag champa, smells like linseed oil for painting, kind of like a vegetable oil smell.</li>
            <li> I hope over time this oil plays nicely with my skin because I truly want to always wear it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an earthy, musky kind of smell</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this item!! :-)</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> It looks beautiful in summer, to lightly rub this oil over freshly shaven legs, and shoulders and arms too, to show off a beautiful glow when wearing a tank top or a strapless dress.</li>
            <li> this  bright bottle love the packaging love the smell.</li>
            <li> also, the reason I love it so much, is that my skin feels GREAT after I use this!</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and with in minutes gave me</li>
            <li> This is very strong stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is pleasant and unique.  </li>
            <li> Nice body oit, but the Dreamsicle scented Glow Oil works better,</li>
            <li> Honestly I think this smells a LOT more like baby powder than Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li> Instead of using lotion, this is the best natural alternative for a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful &amp; keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> and it goes on very smooth, and not oily,</li>
            <li> I so love the smell of Nag Champa, this scent is gentle and I feel moisture is great for my skin.</li>
            <li> so every time I use it I have to unscrew the bottle top and pour some in my palm to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a store I shall not name for a better price</li>
            <li> I love the product in the bottle</li>
            <li> but when you spray out of the top, it&#x27;s just a stream of oil that comes shooting out and bounces off your skin everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> It smells just like the incense, but a tad more powdery.</li>
            <li> I can see where some people would love this product, but it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li> I just felt that the oil was too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> so you can still wear your favorite perfume or body mist.</li>
            <li> I use it as a scent on top of lotion.</li>
            <li> As someone else pointed out, the fragrance more resembles baby powder.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and figured ok give it a try.</li>
            <li> Even better than the nag champa incense(if</li>
            <li> I smell the jojoba oil the most when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this company.</li>
            <li> It smells 10,000x better than I could even imagine.</li>
            <li> If you love nag champa, get it.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more for gift-giving -</li>
            <li> Love the Nag Champa scent on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the face that it comes in a spray bottle</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> We look better too.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is the way this stuff is to smell, but I sure would not wear this on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best.. especially after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I love it on me.  </li>
            <li> Love the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champa scent - but I grew up in the 70s and still burn the Nag Champa incense.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I run out or maybe more before then just to share with someone.</li>
            <li> I love this Nag Champa Hemp oil.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champa fragrance</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so exotic.</li>
            <li> Stuff smells great, is a bit strong and of course oily haha</li>
            <li> Smells so good, i love it so much and super cheap for how good it smells</li>
            <li> While the spray-on factor seems like a good idea, I think I&#x27;d really prefer a pump bottle or flip top cap.  </li>
            <li> but this is by far my favorite great buy for the quantity and quality</li>
            <li> Smells like the incense which I love but its mostly just cheap oil with some added fragrance</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Nag Champa and now I can enjoy it all day.  </li>
            <li> Although, the hemp seems to be the top note of the fragrances, I still enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> so I can gift this to my free spirited friends.</li>
            <li> An exotic  fragrance which smells more sweet perfumey than its incense counterpart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good service, thanks.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the oil is right on scent!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, even if you don&#x27;t really like nag champa, the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> About five minutes later, my grandfatherly dentist said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s YOU that smells so good!  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it gives you a nice soft glow.</li>
            <li> Traps moisture in and smells great at the same time. :)</li>
            <li> Besides the wonderful scent it really does work wonders to make skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> Like really, really strong Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and easy to apply with zero oiliness.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fine with this oil soaking into my skin without leaving an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might be the hemp seed oil, but I&#x27;m fine with that.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> The oil does soak in very well though and makes your skin look really nice.  </li>
            <li> your money perfume will last you months great buy</li>
            <li> Well this goes on smoothly and does smell a touch like Nag Champa</li>
            <li> However, if you like that smell, you will defiantly be happy with this Glow oil because it does last for a looooong time!</li>
            <li> In combination with serum and moisturizer I feel finally like Ive reached a point that I am reasonably happy about-</li>
            <li> And the fact that it is in a carrier oil that is smooth and light and wont clog your pores are a plus.  </li>
            <li> I carry it everywhere and even put it in my hair to smooth my frizzies.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and has a light powdery sent that</li>
            <li> My skin feel soft, the oil smell good (not over powering)</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li> This is a definite favorite!!</li>
            <li> and the price is so worth it, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my first order was four bottles because I never want to be without this oil again.  </li>
            <li> But it absorbs quickly and my husband myself and our kids enjoy it.</li>
            <li> What is that?&amp;#34;  When I went back, his assistant told me she had ordered the oil and shampoo and her fiance loved.</li>
            <li> The Nag Champa scent is delicate and wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a definite feel good product.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job, without making you feel greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> I almost threw this hemp oil out because the odor is overwhelmingly flowery (to me) and only appropriate for a woman.</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> &quot; It definitely helps me feel more comfortable in my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but not so light that you can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> Oil is ok but it has too heavy and kind of cheap perfume smell</li>
            <li> Perfect balance between a light and strong scent (and too much or too little can ruin a nag champa scent), doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily, just soft.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the nice light scent with you all day long.</li>
            <li> I have fair and dry skin</li>
            <li> It is pretty strong at first, so I use just one spritz on the wrist and rub it in.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how similar the scent smells to the incense.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and definitely lingers.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa, but I can&#x27;t apply too much of this straight from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her it&#x27;s &amp;#34;an old hippie scent.&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li> After many (many, many, many) failed attempts at finding something with the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; nag champa scent, this is it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use perfume, so I get essential oils to add to unsented lotion to make my own scented body lotion.  </li>
            <li> Not too sure about the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; part of the oil because it is not greasy at all and thus, really doesn&#x27;t leave much of a shine on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This oil combination is extremely effective for facial moisturization -</li>
            <li> The scent is so pretty and sweet but not in a cloying way.</li>
            <li> So you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> I totally would recommend buying this product to all that love the true scent of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and keeps your skin soft and smooth throughout the day unlike most lotions which contain alcohol and actually dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li> , I mean you are not going to get a beauty product of any sort that smells exactly like an incense, but this is very close, and it does have a very nice smell, and it subtle, so it is not to strong, but just strong enough, which is perfect!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and moisturized really well.</li>
            <li> Super fast service.</li>
            <li> It soaks right into your skin, leaving it soft and smooth, not greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, I love nag champa, and I usually use baby oil, so I thought I would at least give this a try, and I am so very glad that I did!</li>
            <li> when I first order the oil</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this glow oil.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa and burn the incense regularly.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> so I really like that it isn&#x27;t all oily and greasy!</li>
            <li> I love that it is in a spray form as you can spray your back too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two different scents and love them both.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly, lasting throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with my favorite body cream</li>
            <li> Great product, expected a different aroma from this oil.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time, moisturizers and smells just like nag champa incense :)))).</li>
            <li> Thanks so much Earthly Body!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin, and this just doesn&#x27;t alleviate it - though the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really matter, though, because the fragrance is very light and will certainly stay with you long.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> only beef is that the spray nozzle does get clogged easily.  </li>
            <li> It goes on and absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> I only gave 3 stats because the fragrance is not as strong as it used to be</li>
            <li> I use this nag champa glow oil just after I get out of the shower and my skin stays soft and smells nice all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy and absorbs into your skin quickly without too much residue, leaving your skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for several months now as a body oil, and my skin has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> In fact, I plan to refill the spray bottle with my much cheaper supply of pure hemp seed oil.</li>
            <li> you have to purchase this if you love the smell it lasts for a few hours and make my skin super soft and gives my legs an osm glow when wearin shorts  also make hair shiny too ships vey fast and so worth</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love!!super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> too much on the sweeter side, rather than spicey , for me.  </li>
            <li> then I took a shower and spray myself with it (not too much)</li>
            <li> and I have never used anything that made my skin so soft and fresh....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to nag champa lovers!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel when used on wet skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells too, very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This oil&#x27;s scent is very woody</li>
            <li> So much so that I can forgo perfume and just wear this instead.  </li>
            <li> but...to me it does haha.</li>
            <li> I absolutely ADORE this product.</li>
            <li> I use a whole bottle in a bout months.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and it sprays on.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the simple and natural ingredients as well :)</li>
            <li> It is strong, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> love nag champa incense and other nag champa oils</li>
            <li> (at first it is oily, I rub it in just a little most of the time, you wouldn&#x27;t have to though, and the oiliness is gone in about 3 to 5 mins, so that isn&#x27;t a problem).</li>
            <li> For those reviews that said they thought this smelled like baby powder... obviously those people aren&#x27;t familiar with the smell of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> And if the price remains as low as it is now, I&#x27;ll likely add-on a bottle with most of my large Amazon orders.  </li>
            <li> Running it under hot water will clear the nozzle, but every time you do that, you run the risk of introducing water or bacteria into the rest of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for such a large selection!!  </li>
            <li> Also, the scent lasts a while-- which I would like if it smelled more like Nag Champa and less like a grandma.</li>
            <li> I continue to use a light lotion to keep my dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> but I use it mainly for moisturizing after the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly after a shower and massage it on my hips and buttocks.</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and will buy it again (and again.....).</li>
            <li> The oil is gentle and not greasy and blends into the skin well and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and use body oil to stay hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more in other scents.</li>
            <li> It has potential, but it smells funny.</li>
            <li> I have never seen nor felt my skin this soft, EVER!</li>
            <li> The oil itself is a nice moisturizer, but one could achieve the same thing with any other inert essential vegetable, seed, or nut oil.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is ok, but I think I would like a squeeze bottle instead since oil is hard to spread on the skin.</li>
            <li> and this stuff makes me soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It smells like avacados and old baby oil.</li>
            <li> But a few hours later, there&#x27;s still a lovely scent lingering.</li>
            <li> Instead I used it only at night and was very pleasantly surprised at how rich a  glow and deeply moisturized my face looked the next day-</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a Nag Champa oil scent and this one was right on the money just as its other reviews said.</li>
            <li> The Earthly Body Glow Oil, Nag Champa,Hemp Seed is a fast drying oil that makes even very dry skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy but does eventually sink in and leaves your skin super moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my legs and arms after showering and it is the only thing that consistently helps my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> First the packaging is now a black bottle so you can&#x27;t see the product.</li>
            <li> sent is mild, not overwhelming to me</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was much softer with much less redness and irritation as I continued to use this product.</li>
            <li> It has completely removed the dry kin from my feet and elbows!!!</li>
            <li> I had been wanting it for a long time and finally decided to purchase.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this particular product again, and I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone simply because of that weird smell.</li>
            <li> I use raw Black African Soap and this applied right after showering helps keep me from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> They all agreed, the oil smells weird but the lotion smells fine.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of this oil, and would have given 5 stars if the spray nozzle wasn&#x27;t so ridiculously straight and squirts up everywhere in a hard stream..</li>
            <li> and I hope Amazon sells it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I use it after a shower or just if I feel dry.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face after a shower and sometimes use it like a lotion if my elbows are dry.</li>
            <li> My son says I smell like a Hippy, but I don&#x27;t have dry flakey skin on my legs</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helping stave off dry skin in the summer.</li>
            <li> I use it while still wet after my shower then pat dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I go through a lot of oils and lotions, but wanted something a little different.  </li>
            <li> so I use a little only on my legs and feet.</li>
            <li> a terrible headache.&lt;br /&gt;The spray is great and works well</li>
            <li> Living in an arid climate, winter is rough on skin.  </li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> (although do I REALLY want to share my secret???</li>
            <li> I will say a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I have used Nag Champa body oil before but only has a small roll on.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the scent wears off after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I need to add it to sesame oil and that brings it down a notch.  </li>
            <li> The spray I&#x27;ve used in the past has always left behind an oily residue that gets on your clothes and hair and never seems to dry.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift for my little hippy chick and she keeps asking for more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint (which for me isn&#x27;t really a complaint)</li>
            <li> After a few uses</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday and have had a lot of compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> I had a few people smell the lotion and then the oil.</li>
            <li> help oil base absorbs into skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like usually from Nag Champa-</li>
            <li> Also, I prefer a spray tip that puts out a finer spray, like a mist, over what this one does- almost a small stream.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming, but has staying power.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if maybe the scent will improve as I wear it</li>
            <li> little gift that brought me lots of rewards!!</li>
            <li> No nice fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> The scent remains but is very delicate.</li>
            <li> It does not leave behind residue.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what people mean about the bad smell.  </li>
            <li> But, not even half way through the spray bottle, it no longer sprays :(  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday! !!!</li>
            <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like hemp oil idea, hence the 2 stars, but the smell is too overpowering and somewhat artificial</li>
            <li> The lotion stinks to me</li>
            <li> Got a really bad body rash all over that required a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> ( To my bad luck ).</li>
            <li> ewwww smells bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I so love the smell of Nag Champa, this scent is gentle and I feel moisture is great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of this oil, and would have given 5 stars if the spray nozzle wasn&#x27;t so ridiculously straight and squirts up everywhere in a hard stream.. so every time I use it I have to unscrew the bottle top and pour some in my palm to apply.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Nag Champa and now I can enjoy it all day.  The smell is not over powering, just perfect.  The spray bottle is ok, but I think I would like a squeeze bottle instead since oil is hard to spread on the skin.</li>
            <li> I like hemp oil idea, hence the 2 stars, but the smell is too overpowering and somewhat artificial</li>
            <li> Nice body oit, but the Dreamsicle scented Glow Oil works better, no idea why. Good service, thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a store I shall not name for a better price and I was so impressed by the way the oil smelled and how it was absorbed by my skin. I use it on my skin and in my hair. Although, the hemp seems to be the top note of the fragrances, I still enjoy the scent. Its not over powering at all. I have not tried the Nag Champa oil yet but I will if they run out of Moroccan Nights. This is a really great product and I hope Amazon sells it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This body oil is among my favorite products I&#x27;ve ever tried! I&#x27;ve been using it daily for several months now as a body oil, and my skin has never looked or felt better! It&#x27;s not too greasy and absorbs into your skin quickly without too much residue, leaving your skin soft and hydrated. After a few uses I noticed my skin was much softer with much less redness and irritation as I continued to use this product. The scent is wonderful and it also works great as a massage oil!</li>
            <li> Honestly I think this smells a LOT more like baby powder than Nag Champa.  The oil does soak in very well though and makes your skin look really nice.  Also, the scent lasts a while-- which I would like if it smelled more like Nag Champa and less like a grandma.</li>
            <li> I love the product in the bottle but when you spray out of the top, it&#x27;s just a stream of oil that comes shooting out and bounces off your skin everywhere else.  It should have a different spout.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It smells just like the incense, but a tad more powdery. My only complaint is that the oil feels pretty heavy on my skin at first.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Bottle looks did then this pic but still amazing. Smells awesome. Love!!super fast shipping. Great packaging. Nicer service. Very happy!!</li>
            <li> Earthly Body Glow Oil, Nag Champa, Hemp Seed, 8-Ounce - Very nice!  I love it!  Thank you for asking.  judy.mcclelland@att.net</li>
            <li> love nag champa! yummy</li>
            <li> I can see where some people would love this product, but it&#x27;s not for me.  I just felt that the oil was too overwhelming.  You have to use it on your entire body and I was just not feeling the scent of it.</li>
            <li> Not quite the earthy smell I like usually from Nag Champa- too much on the sweeter side, rather than spicey , for me.  I will say a little goes a long way...it&#x27;s strong. I&#x27;ve used it around the house instead of as a body oil. Also, I prefer a spray tip that puts out a finer spray, like a mist, over what this one does- almost a small stream.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell that lasts. Leaves your skin feeling like it glows! My sister recommended this product, and I recommend it also!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. smells so good. Feels good. I will be reordering</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of Nag Champa incense, you will love this! This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it!</li>
            <li> when I first order the oil I didn&#x27;t know what to expect then I took a shower and spray myself with it (not too much) OMG... My skin feel soft, the oil smell good (not over powering) so you can still wear your favorite perfume or body mist. The only problem is I can&#x27;t get my daughter to keep her hands of my spray. I will place my order for a second bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin, and this just doesn&#x27;t alleviate it - though the smell is fantastic. I use it as a scent on top of lotion.</li>
            <li> I use raw Black African Soap and this applied right after showering helps keep me from getting too dry. I use it while still wet after my shower then pat dry. I continue to use a light lotion to keep my dry skin moisturized. I think it smells and feels great. It feels good on your face as well. I subscribe&amp;save ordering every 4 months and that has seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li> Does NOT smell like nag champa. As someone else pointed out, the fragrance more resembles baby powder. It doesn&#x27;t really matter, though, because the fragrance is very light and will certainly stay with you long. The oil itself is a nice moisturizer, but one could achieve the same thing with any other inert essential vegetable, seed, or nut oil. In fact, I plan to refill the spray bottle with my much cheaper supply of pure hemp seed oil.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this glow oil. LOVE IT. The smell is amazing and I have never used anything that made my skin so soft and fresh....I will be purchasing this for Christmas gifts....</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and figured ok give it a try. The smell is very strong and with in minutes gave me a terrible headache.&lt;br /&gt;The spray is great and works well but I had to cut the smell using another oil.</li>
            <li> Instead of using lotion, this is the best natural alternative for a body moisturizer. It really does a great job, without making you feel greasy and gross. It smells wonderful at first, then fades away, but the moisture lasts! It would be amazing to use for a massage.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!! I receive compliments on how great it smells when i wear it all the time. It is strong, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes your skin really soft. I only gave 3 stats because the fragrance is not as strong as it used to be</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!!! Even better than the nag champa incense(if that&#x27;s even possible)!!! Love how it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue as well! The spray I&#x27;ve used in the past has always left behind an oily residue that gets on your clothes and hair and never seems to dry. This goes on smooth and has a scent that sticks with you!! Well worth the price!!! Will definitely purchase again!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure what people mean about the bad smell.  I think the smell is probably a reaction to your own body chemistry.  I smell the jojoba oil the most when I use it.  Makes my skin super soft.  I know they say this is for &amp;#34;mature skin&amp;#34; but I am 32 and this does wonders.  It goes on easily and keeps your skin soft and smooth throughout the day unlike most lotions which contain alcohol and actually dry your skin out.  This is a definite favorite!!</li>
            <li> Got a really bad body rash all over that required a dermatologist. It smells nice tho. Sorry I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, smells great and leaves my skin feeling, looking &amp; smelling so good. But, not even half way through the spray bottle, it no longer sprays :(  I tried cleaning the sprayer but it didn&#x27;t help. You might as well just get it without the sprayer mist. I&#x27;ll order the pour on type next time.</li>
            <li> This is very strong stuff.  I love Nag Champa, but I can&#x27;t apply too much of this straight from the bottle.  I need to add it to sesame oil and that brings it down a notch.  It does not smell like baby powder as some suggest.  It definitely smells like Nag Champa.  Like really, really strong Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> yummy smelling stuff!!</li>
            <li> I use this nag champa glow oil just after I get out of the shower and my skin stays soft and smells nice all day long.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  Living in an arid climate, winter is rough on skin.  I go through a lot of oils and lotions, but wanted something a little different.  A friend used to make nag champa soap and oil that I loved, but she&#x27;s gotten out of the business.  This oil smells just like what she used to make:  wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The help oil base absorbs into skin quickly.  The smell is not overwhelming, but has staying power.  I used some on morning after a shower, then had a dentist appointment later that day.  Both the dentist and his assistant said they smelled something that smelled &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; but could figure out what it was or where it was coming from.  About five minutes later, my grandfatherly dentist said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s YOU that smells so good!  What is that?&amp;#34;  When I went back, his assistant told me she had ordered the oil and shampoo and her fiance loved. it.  I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her it&#x27;s &amp;#34;an old hippie scent.&amp;#34;  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef is that the spray nozzle does get clogged easily.  While the spray-on factor seems like a good idea, I think I&#x27;d really prefer a pump bottle or flip top cap.  Running it under hot water will clear the nozzle, but every time you do that, you run the risk of introducing water or bacteria into the rest of the bottle.  Not a deal-breaker, but something to remember.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa and burn the incense regularly. I have used Nag Champa body oil before but only has a small roll on. I love this! It is smooth and easy to apply with zero oiliness. The value cannot be beat but most importantly, it feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> love nag champa incense and other nag champa oils but this is by far my favorite great buy for the quantity and quality you have to purchase this if you love the smell it lasts for a few hours and make my skin super soft and gives my legs an osm glow when wearin shorts  also make hair shiny too ships vey fast and so worth your money perfume will last you months great buy this hippy girl is very happy</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high for this product. I had been wanting it for a long time and finally decided to purchase. First the packaging is now a black bottle so you can&#x27;t see the product. I picked the Nag Champa scent because I ran out of an oil I had purchased while on vacation and wanted the same scent. Well this goes on smoothly and does smell a touch like Nag Champa but I am also getting a hint of Raid cockroach spray smell. Not sure if maybe the scent will improve as I wear it but I am disapointed to be smelling like bug spray.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected. The oil is nice and no problems, just the scent is not what I remembered. To be fair, it is probably me not the product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It has a nice light smell and works great for after the shower.  Keeps the nice light scent with you all day long.</li>
            <li> It smells perfectly like Nag Champa. It is pretty strong at first, so I use just one spritz on the wrist and rub it in. But a few hours later, there&#x27;s still a lovely scent lingering. It is amazing how similar the scent smells to the incense. I can&#x27;t wait until the holidays so I can gift this to my free spirited friends.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is the best oil!  I use it after a shower or just if I feel dry. The smell is awesome!  I love Nag Champa!&lt;br /&gt;My husband doesn&#x27;t usually like oils, but he likes this one ;-)</li>
            <li> Smells intoxicating,  just like it&#x27;s counterpart, the incense, nag champa!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The smell is amazing and it gives you a nice soft glow. I would highly recommend it to nag champa lovers!</li>
            <li> This is the best oil ever!  It soaks right into your skin, leaving it soft and smooth, not greasy and oily. The Nag Champa scent is delicate and wonderful. I did not find it overpowering at all. I wear this everyday and have had a lot of compliments on the scent. Again, the scent is wonderful with staying power but not overpowering by any means. I love this company. I will definitely be ordering more in other scents.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments for this scent and it feels great on my skin! I appreciate the simple and natural ingredients as well :)</li>
            <li> make it in bigger bottles please. I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel when used on wet skin. Traps moisture in and smells great at the same time. :)</li>
            <li> expectations were met! service excellent</li>
            <li> After many (many, many, many) failed attempts at finding something with the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; nag champa scent, this is it. It smells 10,000x better than I could even imagine. Now I see why they asked if I wanted to sign up to have it delivered every month ;) If you love nag champa, get it. Perfect balance between a light and strong scent (and too much or too little can ruin a nag champa scent), doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily, just soft.  And of course your skin will feel wonderful too.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, i love it so much and super cheap for how good it smells</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month now. I have fair and dry skin and it seems to help. I like the way it smells too, very relaxing. I put it on my face after a shower and sometimes use it like a lotion if my elbows are dry.</li>
            <li> I bathe in this stuff. It smells heavenly and feels luxurious. Absorbs quickly and moisturized really well. My only complaint is that the scent wears off after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> WHOA - this oil is just delicious! I took a gamble and now I am hooked!! I will be ordering more for gift-giving - (although do I REALLY want to share my secret??? hmmmm)....</li>
            <li> Love the Nag Champa scent on my skin. It applies easily and is silky smooth. The scent remains but is very delicate.</li>
            <li> I ordered the oil but got the lotion.  The lotion stinks to me and I can&#x27;t stand using it on my hands or anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li> I loved the lotion, so I figured the oil would be just as amazing. It has potential, but it smells funny. I had a few people smell the lotion and then the oil. They all agreed, the oil smells weird but the lotion smells fine. I won&#x27;t buy this particular product again, and I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone simply because of that weird smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, expected a different aroma from this oil.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this stuff makes me soft and moisturized. This scent is also amazing. I just ordered the lotion to go with it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, I love nag champa, and I usually use baby oil, so I thought I would at least give this a try, and I am so very glad that I did! I love the face that it comes in a spray bottle, that helps a lot! and it goes on very smooth, and not oily, (at first it is oily, I rub it in just a little most of the time, you wouldn&#x27;t have to though, and the oiliness is gone in about 3 to 5 mins, so that isn&#x27;t a problem). so I really like that it isn&#x27;t all oily and greasy! and the smell is similar to nag champa, I mean you are not going to get a beauty product of any sort that smells exactly like an incense, but this is very close, and it does have a very nice smell, and it subtle, so it is not to strong, but just strong enough, which is perfect! I highly recommend this, even if you don&#x27;t really like nag champa, the smell is very pleasant. and the oil is great. also, the reason I love it so much, is that my skin feels GREAT after I use this! I have now got this on my subscribe and save, so that I can continue to receive it and always have it. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it! and the price is so worth it, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It smells wonderful &amp; keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Stuff smells great, is a bit strong and of course oily haha because you know its oil. But it absorbs quickly and my husband myself and our kids enjoy it. We look better too. Also once your soaked in the smell levels off. Skin glows.</li>
            <li> I love the way your skin feels and smells after using this oil!!!  Very moisturizing and the smell is wonderful!!  I love that it is in a spray form as you can spray your back too!  I love Nag Champa and I do not find this overbearing at all!  I have now ordered four bottles in total of this.  I never want to run out!!</li>
            <li> I use this after showering.  This scent is incredible.  It is pleasant and unique.  It seems to last throughout the day.  It goes on and absorbs quickly and completely.  It does not leave behind residue.  It is my go to moisturizer!  I love it!</li>
            <li> The Earthly Body Glow Oil, Nag Champa,Hemp Seed is a fast drying oil that makes even very dry skin so soft.Snow is gone and it&#x27;s time for short and sleeveles shirts.I wish I had found this sooner.The pump spray is perfect to apply all over.My son says I smell like a Hippy, but I don&#x27;t have dry flakey skin on my legs and I like the smell! Thank you Amazon for such a large selection!!  Sue!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the body oil after having used the lotion.  I now use the body oil daily after showering.  I love the scent and it&#x27;s helping stave off dry skin in the summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use perfume, so I get essential oils to add to unsented lotion to make my own scented body lotion.  Perfect for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
            <li> I love this! I want to order a case! This oil&#x27;s scent is very woody so if you are not into that sort of fragrance don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift for my little hippy chick and she keeps asking for more.&lt;br /&gt;The sent is mild, not overwhelming to me and she loves how it makes her skin feel when she uses it after her shower.&lt;br /&gt;A little gift that brought me lots of rewards!!</li>
            <li> Did not smell like nag champa, smells like linseed oil for painting, kind of like a vegetable oil smell. No nice fragrance at all. Don&#x27;t know if this is the way this stuff is to smell, but I sure would not wear this on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It&#x27;s the best.. especially after exfoliating. Super fast service. Recommended this to my bestie who adores nag champa. This is a definite feel good product.</li>
            <li> Smells like the incense which I love but its mostly just cheap oil with some added fragrance so I use a little only on my legs and feet.</li>
            <li> It smells like avacados and old baby oil. Definitely not Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this item!! :-)</li>
            <li> ewwww smells bad! The two stars for the power of the scent lasting ( To my bad luck ). However, if you like that smell, you will defiantly be happy with this Glow oil because it does last for a looooong time!</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful, genuine nag champa scent.  Silky, absorbs beautifully, all natural/ chemical free, NOT tested on animals, made in the U.S.A.!  Honestly could not get any better!</li>
            <li> This body oil is divine.  I love it on me.  It leaves my skin very soft.  Not too sure about the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; part of the oil because it is not greasy at all and thus, really doesn&#x27;t leave much of a shine on my skin.  But for me that is a good thing because I&#x27;ve used body oils that stained clothing so I&#x27;m fine with this oil soaking into my skin without leaving an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And goodness, it smells wonderfully.  So much so that I can forgo perfume and just wear this instead.  An exotic  fragrance which smells more sweet perfumey than its incense counterpart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m glad my first order was four bottles because I never want to be without this oil again.  And if the price remains as low as it is now, I&#x27;ll likely add-on a bottle with most of my large Amazon orders.  I hope over time this oil plays nicely with my skin because I truly want to always wear it.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and use body oil to stay hydrated.  The oil has a slightly different scent from the cream.  It might be the hemp seed oil, but I&#x27;m fine with that.  I use it in conjunction with the Nag Champa Hand &amp; Body Lotion. Love the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two different scents and love them both.  I put it on my legs and arms after showering and it is the only thing that consistently helps my dry skin.  I love the Nag Champa scent - but I grew up in the 70s and still burn the Nag Champa incense.</li>
            <li> Glow Oil its the perfect touch to add a powdery light scent this  bright bottle love the packaging love the smell. Great product for the price. I will buy more when I run out or maybe more before then just to share with someone. I&#x27;m hooked. Made in the U.S.A too. Recyclable bottle. No animal testing.</li>
            <li> I almost threw this hemp oil out because the odor is overwhelmingly flowery (to me) and only appropriate for a woman. Instead I used it only at night and was very pleasantly surprised at how rich a  glow and deeply moisturized my face looked the next day- This oil combination is extremely effective for facial moisturization - For me it has been superior to just using HEMP oil alone In combination with serum and moisturizer I feel finally like Ive reached a point that I am reasonably happy about-</li>
            <li> I love this Nag Champa Hemp oil. It is vegan, not tested on animals and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the oil is right on scent!! I have been searching for a Nag Champa oil scent and this one was right on the money just as its other reviews said. And the fact that it is in a carrier oil that is smooth and light and wont clog your pores are a plus.  I totally would recommend buying this product to all that love the true scent of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! Some have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t smell like ti but...to me it does haha. It&#x27;s pretty but not so light that you can&#x27;t smell it. I don&#x27;t find it the best moisturizer  and if thats what you want this for- a moisturizer that smells like Nag Champa then this is NOT the product for you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely ADORE this product. The scent is so pretty and sweet but not in a cloying way. The oil is gentle and not greasy and blends into the skin well and makes your skin soft. I would bathe in this if I could. It smells SO GOOD. It also arrived quickly! I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. The smell is heavenly, lasting throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with my favorite body cream so it&#x27;s easier to apply to skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an earthy, musky kind of smell and I cannot get enough of it.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of Nag Champa, you will LOVE this product! For those reviews that said they thought this smelled like baby powder... obviously those people aren&#x27;t familiar with the smell of Nag Champa. Because of how affordable this product is, I use it for both my legs and my upper body. It looks beautiful in summer, to lightly rub this oil over freshly shaven legs, and shoulders and arms too, to show off a beautiful glow when wearing a tank top or a strapless dress. The scent seems to lasts for a 2-3 hours. I highly recommend this product, and will buy it again (and again.....). :-D</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Lovely fragrance. I use a whole bottle in a bout months. Goes a long way for me. My hubby uses it too. Great for massage but I use it mainly for moisturizing after the shower.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS product. I carry it everywhere and even put it in my hair to smooth my frizzies. Stays on for a long time, moisturizers and smells just like nag champa incense :)))).</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly. it smells like baby smell, and the skin seems silky</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy but does eventually sink in and leaves your skin super moisturized.  The smell is amazing and definitely lingers. The spray bottle is a bit spritizy but I expect that with an oil.</li>
            <li> Oil is ok but it has too heavy and kind of cheap perfume smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this (and the lotion) for several wks. I am HIGHLY impressed with this oil and its lotion counterpart. I have never seen nor felt my skin this soft, EVER! There isn&#x27;t one inch of my body that doesn&#x27;t get covered with this oil. It is amazing! The only complaint (which for me isn&#x27;t really a complaint) someone may have with this product is the fragrance used, it, for me, is associated with head shops. I&#x27;ve had to bite the bullet and say, \\&quot;the heck with what ppl may think!\\&quot; It definitely helps me feel more comfortable in my skin! Thanks so much Earthly Body!</li>
            <li> Love love this oil!!!  It has completely removed the dry kin from my feet and elbows!!! I love the Nag Champa fragrance it&#x27;s so exotic. I use it everyday! !!!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of body oils but this one is the best. Besides the wonderful scent it really does work wonders to make skin soft and supple. I use it mainly after a shower and massage it on my hips and buttocks. It doesn&#x27;t take much and it sprays on. The bottle will last a long time. So you get your moneys worth. I also mix it with my body lotion and massage this on my legs and feet. Great body oil. Will definitely keep purchasing this and give as gifts.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful ,, even my children love the smell ,they say it reminds them of the boardwalk.  lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I ordered the Earthly Glow Oil, Nag Champa and it smells awesome if your a Nag Champa lover you will love this oil it goes on smooth and has a light powdery sent that last all-day.. And their customer service is a 10!!! Great to do business with and will recommend to family and friends...</li>
