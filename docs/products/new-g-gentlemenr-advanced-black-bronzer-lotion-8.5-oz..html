    <ol>
            <li>Best smelling tanning lotion for a man.</li>
            <li>About 20$ cheaper than my gym and perfect if you have a lot of tats.</li>
            <li>This works perfect to prevent me from burning as well as protects the tattoo.</li>
            <li>Great lotion!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned with a tattoo on my shoulder.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works great!</li>
            <li>It works great to have a bronze tan even though I am part Cherokee and tan very good.  </li>
            <li>great lotion and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>good product great delivery will order again</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and manly.</li>
            <li>This lotion does smell good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product and more of a cologne smell for men.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a nice lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as others.</li>
            <li>The color guard is nice as it helps to protect tattoos from fading from exposure.</li>
            <li>If it truly works would take a lot of time to test, but the thought of it protecting your tattoos is nice.</li>
            <li>The smell was nice, but did not give me any color.</li>
            <li>For use as a lotion it made my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>awesome results, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Just an all around nice product</li>
            <li>and you get nice and brown instead of orange.  </li>
            <li>it smells really nice</li>
            <li>Very nice, feels really good on your skin and it smells more like cologne or mens fragrance instead of smelling like coconut or vanilla like normal tanning lotion</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had a bit more bronzing.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and the smell is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>The bronzer didn&#x27;t really stain my hands so that was nice.  </li>
            <li>it smells like he is wearing a cheap cologne but not like burnt skin.</li>
            <li>fantastic smell</li>
            <li>While it does smell nice, I will probably go back to HD Mann lotion as it smells slightly better after you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>While the tanning benefit may be psychological, this stuff smells great and is worth it as a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
            <li>It is also nice that it is in a soft bottle as it makes it easier to squeeze the right amount out.</li>
            <li>My new favorite lotion</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Now if my husband goes tanning and does not shower right away</li>
            <li>, the bronzers are nice too, other lotions can be darker</li>
            <li>I am building up slow and so far all good!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sort of pointless when it just washes off, this is good on your skin</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband he absolutely loves this brand.</li>
            <li>Was not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Came in as expected and it gives a much better color than the other two in the series.</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly when it was expected to.</li>
            <li>I have used other products in the past with much better results,  I would not purchase again.</li>

            <li> This product performs as expected.  This is my second year of using this product and I believe I am darker than previous years.</li>
            <li> Was actually the product that I expected and not acid or chocolate syrup.</li>
            <li> good product great delivery will order again</li>
            <li> Came in as expected and it gives a much better color than the other two in the series.</li>
            <li> Best smelling tanning lotion for a man.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband he absolutely loves this brand. It has a manly smell to it. It arrived exactly when it was expected to.</li>
            <li> Used for a tanning in a tanning bed.  It works great to have a bronze tan even though I am part Cherokee and tan very good.  needless to say I am dark all over.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great!</li>
            <li> This lotion does smell good. It is also nice that it is in a soft bottle as it makes it easier to squeeze the right amount out. While it does smell nice, I will probably go back to HD Mann lotion as it smells slightly better after you get out of the tanning bed. This leaves a slightly burnt smell after tan. The color guard is nice as it helps to protect tattoos from fading from exposure. If it truly works would take a lot of time to test, but the thought of it protecting your tattoos is nice. So it&#x27;s a nice lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as others.</li>
            <li> Was not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> About 20$ cheaper than my gym and perfect if you have a lot of tats. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It performs as advertised</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned with a tattoo on my shoulder. This works perfect to prevent me from burning as well as protects the tattoo. I am building up slow and so far all good!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for indoor salon tanning using the standup tanner.  This product worked well with the tanner as expected.  Minutes in tanning beds will give different results for everyone.  I applied generously to entire body before tanning and I was satisfied.  I don&#x27;t use for everyday use or outdoor use.  I may try once at the outdoor pool to see results.</li>
            <li> The smell was nice, but did not give me any color. For use as a lotion it made my skin feel nice. Other then that there were no bronzer benifits. I have used other products in the past with much better results,  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a bit more bronzing.</li>
            <li> awesome results, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Smells fantastic. Just does not get you as dark as some. Will definitely buy it again. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product and more of a cologne smell for men.  Just an all around nice product</li>
            <li> Very nice, feels really good on your skin and it smells more like cologne or mens fragrance instead of smelling like coconut or vanilla like normal tanning lotion, the bronzers are nice too, other lotions can be darker but it&#x27;s sort of pointless when it just washes off, this is good on your skin and you get nice and brown instead of orange.  I like it a lot, it&#x27;s a little more expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  My new favorite lotion</li>
            <li> this black bronzer made me go reverse Michael Jackson....it smells really nice and im tanner than you&lt;br /&gt;Gym, Tan, Laundry for life</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright.  Not great but not bad.  The bronzer didn&#x27;t really stain my hands so that was nice.  The smell is pleasant and manly.</li>
            <li> While the tanning benefit may be psychological, this stuff smells great and is worth it as a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and the smell is pretty good.  Now if my husband goes tanning and does not shower right away it smells like he is wearing a cheap cologne but not like burnt skin.</li>
            <li> great lotion and speedy delivery. fantastic smell</li>
