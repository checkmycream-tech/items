            <li> I love this perfume.  Nothing else compares for ME!!  The ingredients are numerous.  What am I to do now that this wonderful perfume is no longer made?</li>
            <li> The original Realities by Liz is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent and I love it on her.

            <li> FAB! I love this scent and so happy I can still buy it! The perfume is priced fairly, as well!</li>
            <li> Love love love this liz claiborne on my wife! She has worn this fragrance for over 30 years and still receives compliments where ever she goes! I sincerely hope it never is discontinued for her sake! If so many people love the scent why is it so hard to get, except online?  My wife gladly announces her fragrance is Liz, as she is often asked! Great advertisement i would think.</li>
            <li> Product was a TESTER - NOT FOR RESALE - after several complaints I was refunded money.&lt;br /&gt;If item is not for resale - it should not be sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> She liked the perfume since it is not sold in stores anymore</li>
            <li> This has been my fragrance for over 20 years, and this is the first bottle of it I have ever gotten that loses its aroma almost immediately upon spraying it on.  I am highly disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance for every day. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and was thrilled to see it here on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
            <li> i gave this a 5 star because i was absolutely thrilled to find it.  my daughter&#x27;s fav. fragrance.  keep it coming.</li>
            <li> Realities was my favourite scent growing up and I was really excited to receive my parcel which was delivered within the timeframe. Unfortunately, my joy of receiving my parcel turned to bitter disappointment when I sprayed it eagerly waiting for the memories to come flooding back. Instead, the scent that wafted out was nothing of what I know the original Realities smelt like. There is no way you can tell me that this is the Original Realities. Being in NZ meant I had to pay quite a bit to have this shipped out, so I feel like I have been ripped off. In fact, I wish I read some of the comments that other buyers have made where they too felt like they were ripped off. I wanted so much to like this ... I would still like to buy the original Realities, so if anyone knows a reliable source please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this product an get my money back because I don&#x27;t feel that I got what I was promised. However, not if it means I have to fork out for the shipping costs again ..</li>
            <li> I have used Realities for years.  It is my favorite scent.  People always comment on it,&lt;br /&gt;wondering what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Keep carrying this perfume!</li>
            <li> This is not the product I received.  I received the all blue cap, by Elizabeth Arden.&lt;br /&gt;I am still looking for the original Liz Claiborne, as photographed here, with gold cap.&lt;br /&gt;The last two orders I received were wrong.</li>
