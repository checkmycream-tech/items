            <li>I was really happy with the purchase,a and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I wish I could give it more stars.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I discovered Amazon carries it now.</li>
            <li>...reminds me of European shops and great trips!  </li>
            <li>Nivea doesn&#x27;t distribute this product to US stores, so I was really pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love Nivea roll on deodorants</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this deoderant would work.</li>
            <li>stock up on more.</li>
            <li>The Pearl version is my favorite</li>
            <li>I love how smoothly this goes on--and residue free!  </li>
            <li>wish it were more widely available in the US.</li>
            <li>love the smell, love the roll on deodorant; keeps me fresh all day; would buy it again and recommend it to others</li>
            <li>Luckily I found it on Amazon :)  </li>
            <li>deodorant not only keeping my smelling good all day but keep me nice and DRY!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the $8 per deodorizer.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick</li>
            <li>I wish it was available in stores in the U.S.</li>
            <li>So fresh smelling!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO happy to find it available to me here in the states, as Nivea products are not as widely distributed here like in Europe.  </li>
            <li>As far as deodorants go, this one is better than most.  </li>
            <li>This three pack is such a good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the plastic bottles, they&#x27;re much lighter than the glass</li>
            <li>This just kind of soaks in and naturally fades away by the end of 24...</li>
            <li>It dries relatively quickly, never feels sticky, has a clean smell, doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on clothing, and best of all, it keeps me dry and smelling good!</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This deliverer had a very long shipment time, but the product was good</li>
            <li>but this variety is good for men and women and keeps me dry and reacts well with my body.  </li>
            <li>But I definitely love Dry Comfort :)  </li>
            <li>The smell is very delicate which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I love these deodorants, smell so good, I don&#x27;t buy any other brand and they don&#x27;t sell them where I live</li>
            <li>Saving money and smelling fresh ...</li>
            <li>shipping is much longer than I&#x27;m used to  with Amazon purchases.... but definitely much cheaper &amp; quicker than having to get it from overseas myself :)</li>
            <li>It takes a while to arrive from shipper, but it is worth it if you are like me and like using Nivea deodorant but don&#x27;t have access.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product that really does not cause allergies,&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is mild but pretty and reminds me of their &amp;#34;original scent&amp;#34; hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>Its very easy to come by in all British supermarkets</li>
            <li>and  you smell nice all day long.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not heavy but clean in a pretty, European kind of way.  </li>
            <li>Nivea deodorant works far better than any brand I&#x27;ve ever found, and it smells WONDERFUL - just a simple clean smell (similar to other Nivea products), not chemically and gross like most deodorants.</li>
            <li>I bought this in July and am still on my first bottle (it&#x27;s October).  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty and it lasts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second favorite deodorant now.</li>
            <li>I love the roll on so much more than a stick that is hard to wash off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Even though it has a light scent it is not overwhelming or strong!</li>
            <li>The formulation and scent seem to be the same - a pleasant, non-overpowering scent that won&#x27;t interfere with your other scents.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>but they were really pricey.</li>
            <li>and I actually originally discovered it when I was out shopping in a store in the Middle East of all places!</li>
            <li>, it just works way, way better than every other deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li>Familiar product, used for a long time,&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>But I love that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, rolls on pretty much clear and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the active ingredient is in these Nivea roll-on deodorants, but the entire line is incredibly effective at controlling sweat.</li>
            <li>I can actually smell the fresh smell of the deodorant working and not &amp;#34;stank&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I live in the Southeast and this stuff holds up in 100F heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li>I live in the hot, steamy south so deodorants get a real workout here; this one keeps me dry on the hottest days.  </li>
            <li>This product has a fresh clean scent, goes on in a thin but powerful layer, and works all day long.  </li>
            <li>So I was surprised and a bit horrified that I can&#x27;t get it in the US.</li>
            <li>and it really works for a long time.</li>
            <li>It does keep me feeling clean without the itching and irritation I usually have with American deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Americans should use more roll on deodorant instead of those horrible &#x27;sticks&#x27; that are so popular here.</li>
            <li>On hot summer days however this falls a little short and by the evening you may need to intervene again.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting or feel heavy</li>
            <li> It works well for me, but not sure how well it would work for sweaty and/or smelly folks.</li>
            <li> Nivea is not popular deodorant in the Usa</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m a stress sweater</li>
            <li> This deodorant roll on is difficult to find in the states.  </li>
            <li> You may be working with kids, going to the gym, or dancing like crazy on the weekend</li>
            <li> With all the crap they put on the shelves...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 10 years, and was very disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores when I moved to the US.</li>

            <li> I was so thrilled to find this on Amazon!

Love love love love it! I wish I could give it more stars.</li>

            <li> This is the only deodorant I use back home in Britain. In fact, it&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve used for the last 12 years! Its very easy to come by in all British supermarkets and I actually originally discovered it when I was out shopping in a store in the Middle East of all places! So I was surprised and a bit horrified that I can&#x27;t get it in the US. My parents did post some out to me here but I&#x27;m glad I discovered Amazon carries it now. It is easily the best roll on deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, so smooth and no residue. Americans should use more roll on deodorant instead of those horrible &#x27;sticks&#x27; that are so popular here.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the purchase,a and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I use.  Does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the active ingredient is in these Nivea roll-on deodorants, but the entire line is incredibly effective at controlling sweat. American deodorants don&#x27;t even come close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I am not unhappy to pay such an exhorbitant price for what is essentially a common supermarket deodorant in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were more widely available in the US.</li>
            <li> love the smell, love the roll on deodorant; keeps me fresh all day; would buy it again and recommend it to others</li>
            <li> This is not bad but it&#x27;s the best I can find. Not enough of it comes out so you&#x27;ll have to roll up and down a few times before you get anything. The smell is very delicate which is perfect for me. I used to use the cream one which cannot be found on this side of the ocean but I&#x27;m thankful I have this alternative. On hot summer days however this falls a little short and by the evening you may need to intervene again.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product before in the Phils and have no doubt at all..it keeps me dry all day.. 👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t keep me dry.  It does keep me feeling clean without the itching and irritation I usually have with American deodorants.  Sadly, I&#x27;m a stress sweater and it doesn&#x27;t seem to combat that at all.  But I love that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, rolls on pretty much clear and last a long time.  I bought this in July and am still on my first bottle (it&#x27;s October).  I think I saw one that deals with stress sweating ... I&#x27;ll have to check it out.  But I definitely love Dry Comfort :)  Saving money and smelling fresh ...</li>
            <li> I found this product while in the U.K. once and now I stock up everytime I&#x27;m there.  I&#x27;m SO happy to find it available to me here in the states, as Nivea products are not as widely distributed here like in Europe.  This creamy, light fragrance deodorant is the best I&#x27;ve ever found!  I live in the hot, steamy south so deodorants get a real workout here; this one keeps me dry on the hottest days.  And the fragrance is a plus...reminds me of European shops and great trips!  I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this great product.....</li>
            <li> So fresh smelling! No sweating and it really works for a long time. I use it once a day and it still smells good at the end of the day! I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This deodorant roll on is difficult to find in the states.  Its a great product and the price was right on target.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product in Singapore some years ago and have been hooked ever since.  Nivea doesn&#x27;t distribute this product to US stores, so I was really pleased to find it on Amazon.  This product has a fresh clean scent, goes on in a thin but powerful layer, and works all day long.  It doesn&#x27;t sting or feel heavy and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea roll on deodorants and I miss them on the USA market.They don&amp;#34;t leave white marks on your t shirt and  you smell nice all day long.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this deoderant would work. I am happy to say it does. The scent is great also. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant. I&#x27;ve used this for 10 years, and was very disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores when I moved to the US. Luckily I found it on Amazon :)  This deliverer had a very long shipment time, but the product was good when it finally arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to buying these in glass bottles, and the ones I got now was plastic, so not quite what I expected. But the product is still good.</li>
            <li> I started using this deodorant when I was abroad and I loved it, so I was very disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere in the States. I did find some on Amazon later one but they were really pricey. This three pack is such a good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was a lot quicker than I expected so it&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;ll def. stock up on more.</li>
            <li> Why do they not sell Nivea deodorant in the USA? Why? Why? Why???? I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in all the Nivea deodorants, it just works way, way better than every other deodorant I have tried. Every time I go abroad I try to bring like ten or 15 of these back.</li>
            <li> These is a product that my wife likes and i got also hooked up with the men version&lt;br /&gt;awesome . Like the product says it defintlely lasts for 24 hrs</li>
            <li> Amazing! We&#x27;ve always had to get these from the middle east or Europe. Can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re on amazon!  Love the plastic bottles, they&#x27;re much lighter than the glass I&#x27;m used to. Perfectly/lightly scented. Works so well that I sometimes forget I didn&#x27;t put deodorant on the second day (especially during campouts) because it works for that long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping is much longer than I&#x27;m used to  with Amazon purchases.... but definitely much cheaper &amp; quicker than having to get it from overseas myself :)</li>
            <li> I love these deodorants, smell so good, I don&#x27;t buy any other brand and they don&#x27;t sell them where I live so I always order them online. Love them!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I tried this Deodorant.  It smells pretty and it lasts.  I live in the Southeast and it works all day, plus when I am working out hard and sweating I can actually smell the fresh smell of the deodorant working and not &amp;#34;stank&amp;#34;.  It makes me feel confident when I am sweating and knowing that I still smell like a lady! :-)  The smell is mild but pretty and reminds me of their &amp;#34;original scent&amp;#34; hand lotion.  Very happy and will order more when I need it.</li>
            <li> As far as deodorants go, this one is better than most.  Does not leave any white spots and seems to work well.  It took a while to get it, but I knew that when I purchased it.  It&#x27;s my second favorite deodorant now.</li>
            <li> Good roll-on deodorant.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to arrive from shipper, but it is worth it if you are like me and like using Nivea deodorant but don&#x27;t have access. The bottles are plastic, unlike the others I have purchased which have been glass. This is good as they are lighter. The formulation and scent seem to be the same - a pleasant, non-overpowering scent that won&#x27;t interfere with your other scents. It works well for me, but not sure how well it would work for sweaty and/or smelly folks.</li>
            <li> Nivea is not popular deodorant in the Usa and I have no idea why! With all the crap they put on the shelves...&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant not only keeping my smelling good all day but keep me nice and DRY!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the $8 per deodorizer.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick</li>
            <li> I love how smoothly this goes on--and residue free!  The Pearl version is my favorite but this variety is good for men and women and keeps me dry and reacts well with my body.  I love the roll on so much more than a stick that is hard to wash off in the shower.  This just kind of soaks in and naturally fades away by the end of 24...perhaps even 48 hours.</li>
            <li> i like the product a lot and receive very short time thank you</li>
            <li> My only negative is that I have to mail order as it is not sold in the US.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it! finally a deodorant that lasts. Even though it has a light scent it is not overwhelming or strong!</li>
            <li> Familiar product, used for a long time,&lt;br /&gt;  Overall a good product that really does not cause allergies,&lt;br /&gt; Strongly recommend,&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does the trick of making you smell nice from morning till night.  You may be working with kids, going to the gym, or dancing like crazy on the weekend and this product will protect the olfactory bulbs in the noses of those around you. Woo!</li>
