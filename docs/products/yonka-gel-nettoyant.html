            <li>but it is not the best for taking off eye make up.</li>

            <li>This stuff is the best.  </li>

            <li>I got introduced to this brand by a salon in Florida and loved the Creme 93.  </li>
            <li>1 star for good eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Fairly priced and like how it lathers.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is perfect - it cleanses well, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin squiky clean, which is an unnatural state.</li>
            <li>Great price and quickly shipped!!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>I use it with a Clairsonic and on its own.  </li>
            <li>It came within a fast time period and in perfect condition!  </li>
            <li>I loved being able to order it from Amazon and have it delivered to my house.  </li>
            <li>I personally love their cremes and lotions as well, but this cleanser does amazing things for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Spraying Yon-Ka lotion afterwards is also a lovely beauty ritual :)</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and more healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I love what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>Best facial wash I have found</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use Cetaphil for sensitive skin and it works great though it doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup all that well.</li>
            <li>Since using it, my skin has a better texture and is more consistent.</li>
            <li>It is a great cleanser and does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>Especially great for mature skin or for people who, like me have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and works well if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I am familiar with this product that I first purchased at a spa in Houston TX.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and have been very satisfied with its gentle cleansing properties, especially since I suffer with rosacea..</li>
            <li>Each time I squeeze out the gel, because there is no lid, I always need to wash of some of the gel residue that gets left on the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gentle enough to be used as an eye makeup remover for people with contacts, and for those of us with contacts, finding the right eye makeup remover can be challenging.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s good both for female and male skin alike.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but weak in terms of cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>She really likes it, so</li>
            <li>I like it more than other brands...</li>
            <li>Still love the product as I&#x27;ve less blemishes on my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s &amp; have developed oilier skin over the years, which has resulted in my being more prone to getting black heads on my nose &amp; chin.  </li>
            <li>I have read many negative reviews about the new container and wanted to get my hands on the last of the old stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with an occasional break-out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still gentle enough for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I purposely bought Yonka from this specific seller because it was one of the last ones who had the old Yonka container as the product picture.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> ... use very little and it leaves really clean feeling...not tight or filmy.</li>
            <li> Very helpful and anxious to please.</li>
            <li> Finally, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with that dry, stripped feeling - nor does it make you feel like you still have a layer of dirt or lotion on your face.  </li>

            <li> A lot of cleansers that I had used before to wash my face dried the skin, making it even more prone to break-outs and bringing an uncomfortable feeling overall.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Yonka product and when I did not receive it as expected, I contacted the seller.</li>
            <li> I paid quite a bit for this and based on reviews expected it to work.</li>
            <li> It melts ALL my makeup off, I have a dark complexion and after I dry my face</li>
            <li> This product helps stabilize my skin to reduce the oil production before it starts, resulting in less black heads.  </li>
            <li> It seems to leave my skin a little cleaner</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that has helped me with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and although I like it for acne prevention, it does an awful job of removing makeup so after trying several OTC brands of face wash and having little success</li>

            <li> /&gt;Very, very disappointed when the shipment arrived and saw that it was the new container.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you try any of it.</li>

            <li> Great price&lt;br /&gt;Great service&lt;br /&gt;As usual</li>
            <li> I got introduced to this brand by a salon in Florida and loved the Creme 93.  I use Proactiv and although I like it for acne prevention, it does an awful job of removing makeup so after trying several OTC brands of face wash and having little success, I thought I&#x27;d try the Yonka brand and I LOVE IT!!  It melts ALL my makeup off, I have a dark complexion and after I dry my face there&#x27;s no trace of makeup - not on my eyes either.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it too!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a Yonka product and when I did not receive it as expected, I contacted the seller. They determined that it was lost in shipment and immediately sent out a replacement. Very helpful and anxious to please.</li>
            <li> This item did NOT completely take off my makeup as promised nor did it lather up as promised!! And it was expensive for nothing!! I hate this product and will never order it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for the past 4 years and I&#x27;m loving it. I have sensitive skin with an occasional break-out. A lot of cleansers that I had used before to wash my face dried the skin, making it even more prone to break-outs and bringing an uncomfortable feeling overall. This cleanser is perfect - it cleanses well, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin squiky clean, which is an unnatural state. Spraying Yon-Ka lotion afterwards is also a lovely beauty ritual :)&lt;br /&gt;Also my boyfriend started using this cleanser as well and got rid of the blackheads he used to have on his nose. So it&#x27;s good both for female and male skin alike.</li>
            <li> Of all Yon-ka products, THIS is the one you have to buy!  I personally love their cremes and lotions as well, but this cleanser does amazing things for my skin.  I have combination skin prone to breakouts.  I wear mineral make up and mascara/eyeliner that is often hard to remove.  I used Cetaphil for years until I started using this cleanser.  A tiny amount literally melts my makeup, dirt and mascara on contact.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, it smells wonderful and it rinses beautifully.  Finally, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with that dry, stripped feeling - nor does it make you feel like you still have a layer of dirt or lotion on your face.  I love this cleanser, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that has helped me with my oily skin.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s &amp; have developed oilier skin over the years, which has resulted in my being more prone to getting black heads on my nose &amp; chin.  This product helps stabilize my skin to reduce the oil production before it starts, resulting in less black heads.  Thank goodness!</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing! I was introduced to it at the Glen Ivy Spa in Manhattan Beach a couple of years ago and have been using it since.   It noticeably smoothes lines and evens complexion.  My skin is brighter and more healthy looking.  Especially great for mature skin or for people who, like me have sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s well worth the price.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My daughter has to use this because of allergies.  She really likes it, so I like buying it for her!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It isn&#x27;t drying, and doesn&#x27;t take a lot for each use.  I use it with a Clairsonic and on its own.  Since using it, my skin has a better texture and is more consistent. I love what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for taking the make up off you face with a cloth but it is not the best for taking off eye make up. Still love the product as I&#x27;ve less blemishes on my skin</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I have found... use very little and it leaves really clean feeling...not tight or filmy.</li>
            <li> I purposely bought Yonka from this specific seller because it was one of the last ones who had the old Yonka container as the product picture.

Each time I squeeze out the gel, because there is no lid, I always need to wash of some of the gel residue that gets left on the top.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash!  It came within a fast time period and in perfect condition!  I would recommend it to anyone, along with the seller.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am familiar with this product that I first purchased at a spa in Houston TX.  It is a great cleanser and does not dry out your skin.  The Yonka Gel spray toner is a perfect compliment to the gel and is used before moisterizer.  I loved being able to order it from Amazon and have it delivered to my house.

            <li> Favorite face wash ever!!  Great price and quickly shipped!!</li>
            <li> THis cleanser is very mild and lathers beautifully!  Would definitely order this product again and again!  Just try it and you&#x27;ll see....</li>
            <li> 1 star for good eye makeup remover. zero stars for anything else. I paid quite a bit for this and based on reviews expected it to work. Unfortunately it left me a bunch of breakouts and irritation. Perhaps I&#x27;m allergic to one of the ingredients. I would say if you are prone to breaking out or have allergies think twice about buying this. I use Cetaphil for sensitive skin and it works great though it doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup all that well. And this you can buy at Target for under $10.</li>
            <li> Awesome product line. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you try any of it. Fairly priced and like how it lathers.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but weak in terms of cleaning your skin.  Definitely need to wash your face twice with this if you are on the oiler side, which is what gel cleansers were made for.</li>
            <li> YONKA has always great products</li>
            <li> I have also tried the cream cleanser from Yonka.  I definitely prefer the gel.  It seems to leave my skin a little cleaner but it&#x27;s still gentle enough for my dry skin.  It&#x27;s also gentle enough to be used as an eye makeup remover for people with contacts, and for those of us with contacts, finding the right eye makeup remover can be challenging.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin but cleans well.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and works well if you have sensitive skin. It does not dry out your skin. I love it.</li>
