            <li> It is a little citrusy...</li>
            <li> The gift set was approximately 48% less here versus my local retail store.</li>
            <li> IN THE BEHIND</li>
            <li> I HATE the Styrofoam peanuts.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!</li>

            <li> I was concerned about this product being a fake, but &amp;#34;it is the real thing&amp;#34;.  It lasts until the shirt is washed.  I will buy it again when I run out.  Great price!</li>
