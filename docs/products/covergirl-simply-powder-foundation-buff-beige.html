            <li>It holds up better in heat and humidity, too.</li>
            <li>too light as opposed to picture!</li>
            <li>Simply love the Cover Girl</li>
            <li>I love this make-up.</li>

            <li>I normally wear the pocket powder in buff beige</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I try different brands of all price levels, I always come back to this simply powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>My original color choice was classic beige, but have gone to buff beige since I can&#x27;t seem to find the classic lately.</li>
            <li>The stores stopped selling Buff Beige, so I&#x27;m gong to have to stock up before it disappears completely on me.  </li>
            <li>I use a little cover-up first.</li>

            <li> I use a little cover-up first.</li>
            <li> If you want a true foundation and not a light fluffy touch this may be the one for you.</li>
            <li> but I think I will be going back to my other powder.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to try Simply Powder a few years ago, and I will never go back to messy liquid again.</li>
            <li> Coverage is a little heavier than regular powder, but that because you don&#x27;t need to use foundation with it.  </li>
            <li> IT IS DARKER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> The package seemed damaged and the color was darker than expected</li>
            <li> so odd</li>
            <li> It was too heavy of a powder for me and too chalky, not light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even going back to the expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I only have to touch-up if I blow my noise too often during the cold season or after a teary moment.  </li>

            <li> I was a user of Cover Girl liquid foundation for many, many years! Finally decided to try Simply Powder a few years ago, and I will never go back to messy liquid again.

            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite foundation!  works well.  I only have to touch-up if I blow my noise too often during the cold season or after a teary moment.  Love it!</li>
            <li> MY MOTHER LOVES IT. AND THE PRICE IS GOOD.</li>
            <li> Is good i like it and I use it every day</li>
            <li> I LIKED IT IS DARKER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive brands and always come back to this one.  It works so well with great coverage.  I&#x27;m not even going back to the expensive brands.  I&#x27;m sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> too light as opposed to picture!</li>
            <li> perfect shade, use all the time</li>
            <li> no matter how many times I try different brands of all price levels, I always come back to this simply powder foundation.  Coverage is a little heavier than regular powder, but that because you don&#x27;t need to use foundation with it.  The stores stopped selling Buff Beige, so I&#x27;m gong to have to stock up before it disappears completely on me.  It was cheaper on Amazon anyway!</li>
            <li> Simply love the Cover Girl Simply Powder Foundation.  Makes my skin so smooth.  It is a nice finishing touch to my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quick! This is the perfect shade I needed, thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!! great price, and great quality!!! must buy!!</li>
            <li> great, cheaper than the store</li>
            <li> The package seemed damaged and the color was darker than expected</li>
            <li> Looks good, like makeup should.</li>
            <li> Must be selling defected products...my mirror was on backwards ...so odd</li>
            <li> My skin gets oily during the day so this compact on my face start showing caky. No too happy with it.  I need to find something else for my oily skin</li>
            <li> I sent it back.  It was too heavy of a powder for me and too chalky, not light.  If you want a true foundation and not a light fluffy touch this may be the one for you.</li>
            <li> I normally wear the pocket powder in buff beige but this was on sale so I gave it a try. The coverage seems pretty good and the color matched my skin. The only thing i missed was it didn&#x27;t seem to go on a smooth as the pocket powder does. In a pinch i think this would do fine but I think I will be going back to my other powder.</li>
            <li> I love this make-up. When I was younger I usedbit without foundation. Now that I have more wrinkles I use a little cover-up first. Very light weight and doesn&#x27;t get all built up in my wrinkles. Easy to blend into skin. Sometimes 20 is hard to find in store - maybe it&#x27;s to popular of a color.</li>
