            <li>Be charming works but the spray helped alot.</li>

            <li>Has good smell.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best body spray for men and at a great price!</li>
            <li>Amazing product worked immediately....  </li>
            <li>the smell is really nice</li>
            <li>Nice smell, mixes well with TrueEssence.  </li>
            <li>maybe its the confidence of knowing i am wearing it also, but it never hurts to smell nice when your gearing up to talk to that cutie</li>
            <li>Nice body Spray girls love the smell</li>
            <li>firstly it smells great.</li>
            <li>this is a great product and will certainly buy more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I never used pheromones spay products before, the scent is my favorite smell.</li>
            <li>Nice light smell.</li>
            <li>A buck deer in the fall won&#x27;t think twice about challenging a hunter caught off guard who foolishly smeared &amp;#34;deer scent&amp;#34; on himself from head to toe.</li>
            <li>probably but more soon</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>There was threes really cute girl in my foods class that I couldn&#x27;t work up the courage to talk to.</li>
            <li>I was noticed more than I could imagine buy this product</li>
            <li>it helped me feel more comfortable with myself</li>
            <li>This is the perfect complement to either your collection of Pheromones or a great starter product for those of you that are still skeptical and don&#x27;t want to spend good money for some of the higher priced products.</li>
            <li>smells great and drives my woman WILD</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, smells good.</li>
            <li>but right away I noticed women&#x27;s heads turning!!  </li>
            <li>Whenever I wear this all the women I interact with are a lot more friendly.</li>
            <li>personally enjoy the smell though</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I wanted to try them having studied in school the important roll they play in the animal kingdom.</li>
            <li>Fantastic smell.</li>
            <li>If you want everyone to look at you with more respect and the women to want to get close to you, smile at you, talk to you, as well as boosting your own self confidence, then stop looking around for other stuff that works, because I am telling you from a 320lb good looking man that has used them all.</li>
            <li>nOTHING SPECTACULAR HERE IN THIS PRODUCT OTHER THAN IT SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li>wow this was amazing, its not messy like most phermone sprays, this one is more like a mist.</li>
            <li>And didn&#x27;t notice anything special around me, so probably doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>Try mixing and matching the true pheromone oil products and the spray.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to test it much among others.</li>
            <li>its very strong smelling, not discreet at all, completely unfit to use in business environment.</li>
            <li>Without feeling &amp;#34;drugged&amp;#34; in any way I became more sociable and willing to engage others in conversation that just seemed to flow quite naturally.</li>
            <li>Not having had much luck in the past with supplements of any kind I purchased some True Pheromones with a healthy dose of skepticism.</li>
            <li>If you want something to help your love life, work life and all around social interaction with the world!</li>
            <li>a 49 year old man and this female waitress was probably 25-28 years old and absolutely beautiful.  </li>
            <li>think I set my expectations at a moderate level and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Women are starting to pay more attention to me.</li>
            <li>it was noticed first time I used it.</li>
            <li>And the first day I use this stuff, she comes up to me and asked me or on a date.</li>
            <li>first time using pheromones, but all in all...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve been eyeing all semester ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice women&#x27;s are taking a second look at me every time I walk pass them also they seem to be more friendlier when I&#x27;m talking to them with this spray...</li>
            <li>it is nothing more than a cheap body spray u can get at any grocery store for less that $3......</li>
            <li>positive comments</li>
            <li>This is a spray and go Pheromone you don&#x27;t have to know anything about mixing and dose amount, they have done it for you in this easy to use daily body spray!</li>
            <li>I really like this body spray</li>
            <li>My wife loves the smell and that helps start our intimate sessions.</li>
            <li>whatever the green kind is)</li>
            <li>and I have been short on cash lately, so knowing how good True Pheromones Inc. is when it comes to ordering and getting your stuff before the arrival date.</li>
            <li>The same was true for folks I came in contact with throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, I live it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Sure, that is a little sketchy, but that is why I waited about 30 days after receiving it to offer my review.</li>
            <li>I recommend giving it a try if only for the fun you might have.</li>
            <li>I have noticed clearly interest from women when I wear this, they start coversations!</li>
            <li>Those who were likely to say hi in passing before often stopped for a brief friendly conversation now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting a little more attention from my female colleagues, hmmmmm.</li>
            <li>Already received several compliments which is the whole point.</li>
            <li>I am gay so very curious how it works attracting the same sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well as you may have guessed, I was pleasantly surprised to see a noticeable change in those I interact with on a regular basis, but also a subtle change in my own behavior.</li>
            <li>cheap and small way over priced</li>
            <li>Not really noticing much,  </li>
            <li>Nothing changed smells good but definitely a disappointment</li>

    <ol>
            <li> wow this was amazing, its not messy like most phermone sprays, this one is more like a mist. the smell is really nice and im already getting second looks from women.  this is a great product and will certainly buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, mixes well with TrueEssence.  I would buy it again</li>
            <li> i bought it because i believed all the other reviews, and then it came with a small discrete mono print paper that asked me to give the product a positive review and they&#x27;ll give me my money back.....that&#x27;s when i knew all the reviews were phony.  it is nothing more than a cheap body spray u can get at any grocery store for less that $3......</li>
            <li> Is this mic on?Right firstly it smells great. The Axe kilo was spot on. Now for the pheromones part. It does work. You also get the boost of confidence when you approach a woman. The only drawback is that you have to spray it periodically. Sometimes you have to let it off a few days but it does work. Try mixing and matching the true pheromone oil products and the spray. I literally got grabbed,phone number and quite a few stares. Be charming works but the spray helped alot.</li>
            <li> Not really noticing much,  but it does smell good anyway.</li>
            <li> Fairly good product. I never used pheromones spay products before, the scent is my favorite smell.</li>
            <li> nOTHING SPECTACULAR HERE IN THIS PRODUCT OTHER THAN IT SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li> Nice light smell. So far subtle indications effectiveness. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> My dog started humping my leg every time I put it on, so there be something in there..</li>
            <li> I just started using your product and I&#x27;m getting a little more attention from my female colleagues, hmmmmm.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in when I wear it not. So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering this again, or telling my buddies about it.</li>
            <li> Horrible do not buy it</li>
            <li> I doubt there&#x27;s any pheromones in this, it smells like axe orion (or whatever the green kind is)</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to test it much among others. I am gay so very curious how it works attracting the same sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally enjoy the smell though and it goes perfectly with any of my colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am already planning on ordering the &amp;#34;Gilroy Patch&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t wait to see how that works.</li>
            <li> It works or I&#x27;m getting younger as I age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to loose in trying this solution.  I have no dog on the hunt here.  Just a consumer.</li>
            <li> I really like this body spray it helped me feel more comfortable with myself have got great compliments when wearing it</li>
            <li> Nothing changed smells good but definitely a disappointment</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell and that helps start our intimate sessions.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I have been using Pheromones for years and I have been short on cash lately, so knowing how good True Pheromones Inc. is when it comes to ordering and getting your stuff before the arrival date. I took a chance on this product! Well very happy I did. This is hands down the best body spray for men and at a great price! If you want something to help your love life, work life and all around social interaction with the world! Then go no further get yourself two bottles! One for the house after you shower and one for the car or gym bag! This is a spray and go Pheromone you don&#x27;t have to know anything about mixing and dose amount, they have done it for you in this easy to use daily body spray! If you want everyone to look at you with more respect and the women to want to get close to you, smile at you, talk to you, as well as boosting your own self confidence, then stop looking around for other stuff that works, because I am telling you from a 320lb good looking man that has used them all. This is the perfect complement to either your collection of Pheromones or a great starter product for those of you that are still skeptical and don&#x27;t want to spend good money for some of the higher priced products. You will be very happy you took my advice! Mark my words~</li>
            <li> Not having had much luck in the past with supplements of any kind I purchased some True Pheromones with a healthy dose of skepticism. Nevertheless, I wanted to try them having studied in school the important roll they play in the animal kingdom. A buck deer in the fall won&#x27;t think twice about challenging a hunter caught off guard who foolishly smeared &amp;#34;deer scent&amp;#34; on himself from head to toe. Well as you may have guessed, I was pleasantly surprised to see a noticeable change in those I interact with on a regular basis, but also a subtle change in my own behavior. Without feeling &amp;#34;drugged&amp;#34; in any way I became more sociable and willing to engage others in conversation that just seemed to flow quite naturally. The same was true for folks I came in contact with throughout the day. Those who were likely to say hi in passing before often stopped for a brief friendly conversation now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I set my expectations at a moderate level and am quite pleased with the results. I recommend giving it a try if only for the fun you might have.</li>
            <li> Works as expected... probably but more soon</li>
            <li> I tried the product today at lunch...WOW!  I thought my waitress was going to sit down next to me at the table!  I am a 49 year old man and this female waitress was probably 25-28 years old and absolutely beautiful.  She must have returned to my table 15 times over the course of my 30 minute lunch.  I have been waited on her before and she didn&#x27;t even give me the time of day.  I definitely say give this product a try!</li>
            <li> good deodorant that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> Folks, I have purposely not reviewed this until way past 10 days after receiving the product. Medina argued the reviews are phony due to the printed note. Sure, that is a little sketchy, but that is why I waited about 30 days after receiving it to offer my review. Yes it smells a bit like Axe. But I have struggled with being an &amp;#34;average joe&amp;#34; all my life. I&#x27;m a very nice guy, but wasn&#x27;t blessed with looks. I decided I had nothing to lose so I bought the product. My luck has drastically turned around and I have had to start turning women away. It is insane. I&#x27;m getting numbers from women way out of my league. No, I can&#x27;t prove whether or not there are truly pheromones in the product...but I don&#x27;t care...I&#x27;m finally getting dates and I&#x27;m truly living the dream!</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful. Fantastic smell. Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. not what I was expecting, but smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol wich is what I like. Women are starting to pay more attention to me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Already received several compliments which is the whole point.</li>
            <li> Actually i bought it before i read the negative comments....based on all the (apparently paid for!) positive comments i was convinced the product was good so i bought 2 pc.&lt;br /&gt;But its very strong smelling, not discreet at all, completely unfit to use in business environment. And didn&#x27;t notice anything special around me, so probably doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Good product!</li>
            <li> I have women talking to me that would never talk to me otherwise.</li>

            <li> This stuff really works, I live it. There was threes really cute girl in my foods class that I couldn&#x27;t work up the courage to talk to. And the first day I use this stuff, she comes up to me and asked me or on a date. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> great job shipping thru the post office versus oops, or fed up, when applying it ,it is best to put it where you brush or make contact with your skin in order to keep it warm and aromatic .it works well when combined with other cologne and has noticeable effects on those around you.</li>
            <li> first time using pheromones, but all in all... i must say that this one was a great start. maybe its the confidence of knowing i am wearing it also, but it never hurts to smell nice when your gearing up to talk to that cutie you&#x27;ve been eyeing all semester ;)</li>
            <li> Best Value For Money Body Spray of its type in market for the given range.&lt;br /&gt;Effective and pleasant fragrance.</li>
