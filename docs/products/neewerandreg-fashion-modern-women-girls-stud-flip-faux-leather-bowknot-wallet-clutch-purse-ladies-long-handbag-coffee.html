            <li>Material from inside tore right away.</li>
            <li>but overall it is a pretty nice wallet.</li>
            <li>It was nice and color was good on the outside but did not hold as much of my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; as I had hoped  and it was quite stiff, but I will keep it as a gift for my daughter</li>

            <li>The coin purse part doesn&#x27;t close completely.</li>
            <li>The style was exactly what I had been looking for, but my ID cards did not fit into the pockets.</li>

            <li> Secondly, the snap is hard to catch.  </li>
            <li> is deep, and hard to get the card out.</li>
            <li> so i guess ill be using this when im not carring much around</li>
            <li> The cards can slide all the way down into the wallet.</li>
            <li> Fell apart in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when you put your driving license in or any credit cards on the same side the leather is so tight you cannot get them out.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to close and hard to put your credit card and ID&#x27;s into wallet, it s to small and need.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the purse was not that deep on the inside as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> it extremely poorly made.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating, not happy with it at all, but threw all the stuff away no knowing I would not like it.</li>

            <li> The style was exactly what I had been looking for, but my ID cards did not fit into the pockets. I was very disappointed and returned the wallet.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately when you put your driving license in or any credit cards on the same side the leather is so tight you cannot get them out.  Secondly, the snap is hard to catch.  Sometimes if I am in a hurry I just have to throw it in my pocketbook and fool with the snap when I have time.  Very frustrating, not happy with it at all, but threw all the stuff away no knowing I would not like it.</li>
            <li> The wallet is very flimsy and is already falling apart. The change purse section has no floor, so the coins slide over the bottom unrestricted, and are virtually unretrieveable. I have resorted to using my old wallet which despite wear and tear is still in better shape</li>
            <li> to small lol point blank cant fit jack in this little wallet but its cute i like the bow in the front so i guess ill be using this when im not carring much around</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful wallet and amazing price i recomend this product. Until now i&#x27;ve not had problems with this wallet.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this wallet its a beautiful color and textured. I love the compartments inside and it matches perfectly with a purse I brought.</li>
            <li> Its durable and gave it to my sis as a christmas present and she loved it ans it matched a purse of hers - worked out perfectly</li>
            <li> Its hard to close and hard to put your credit card and ID&#x27;s into wallet, it s to small and need.  You change falls out of the wallet ALL the time.</li>
            <li> Love this wallet minus the fact that you can&#x27;t fill all credit card slots or the wallet won&#x27;t stay clasped shut. It is very cute and I really like the soft texture.  I might even buy another in a different color.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected but usable.</li>
            <li> The color was a little different from what I have imagined. But I love the design, and it still cute</li>
            <li> Fell apart in less than a month.</li>
            <li> So happy with my purchase! Good quality and super cute! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this wallet, it is pretty spacious but the change part is hard to open the first time, after that it&#x27;s smooth sailing! Love it so much, wish there were more colors though.</li>
            <li> Looks great but it has already started to fall apart after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> The bow on the wallet I received was not the same color as the band, it was gold. It did not look good or even close to what the picture implied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife did not like it. Haha</li>
            <li> I did not realize that the bow on the outside was gold, and I didn&#x27;t really like that but overall it is a pretty nice wallet.</li>
            <li> The wallet showed up on time for the lady&#x27;s b day . She wasn&#x27;t too happy about the accordion look .</li>
            <li> this was an excellent choice , definaly in the future i wil buy more items like this. i love it.</li>
            <li> Love this wallet. There is one pouch for where you put your cards in that is deep, and hard to get the card out. Don&#x27;t carry to much change in it or it will bulge and break.  Ver cute and stylish.</li>
            <li> Terrible wallet.  it extremely poorly made. It was already falling apart upon opening. The set up does not make sense.</li>
            <li> very poorly made. The cards can slide all the way down into the wallet. There is no stop to keep them where you can reach them. The coin purse part doesn&#x27;t close completely. I would have returned but had kept it without trying it for a while.</li>
            <li> Material from inside tore right away.</li>
