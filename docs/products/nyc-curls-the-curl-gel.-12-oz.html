            <li>This gel is perfect for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful - ginger and bamboo!</li>
            <li>The gel is awesome.  </li>
            <li>If my curls are happy, I am happy!  </li>
            <li>Used with the NYC Curls Conditioner it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This curl gel is great on my hair.  </li>
            <li>NYC Curls is perfect for my curls and leaves a nice, spicy ginger fragrance.</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled!</li>
            <li>I used the curl cleanser (which is wonderful) with the conditioner, and right after this \\&quot;magic\\&quot; gel,</li>
            <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Carlos Flores has cut my hair when I was in NYC and he is amazing with curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I really liked all three products in the range (cleanser, conditioner and styling gel).</li>
            <li>Blends in nicely in the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky film like others do.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff; I use the Cleanser, the Conditioner and the Gel.</li>
            <li>Scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li>but NYC Curls is much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel.  </li>
            <li>Will not try any more of these products from NYC Curls</li>
            <li>Also no curl definition even when leaving in most of the conditioner and using the gel as recommended.</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>I ordered all 3 products in the line hoping that it would work on my very fine, super frizzy but corkscrew curly hair.</li>
            <li>The products seem to moisturize nicely, but the frizz is out of control - like really out of control!</li>
            <li>OMG it was like I added super glue to my hair, what in the !</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Maybe I will come back and add a star in a week or so (lol)</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I am glad all his years of  &#x60;trial and error&#x27; with other products has paid off and allowed him to create these great products.</li>
            <li>You can get them delivered here from his own website but the delivery charges are v high (not his fault).</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try for all those Deva ladies out there!</li>
            <li>A nice light gel that allows curls to shape naturally and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling all crunchy when it dries.</li>
            <li>A big plus is that it smells a lot better than the products I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>I really love that it contains Flax Seed gel which really helps with the final texture.</li>
            <li>Holds curls for extended length of time, with a nice little bounce to it.</li>
            <li>Also very drying.</li>
            <li>Works really well too.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s something important: leave plenty of conditioner left in your hair.</li>
            <li>Combination works for the whole day.</li>
            <li>I have superfine, soft naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I find that it really leaves my hair kind of stiff</li>
            <li>after this gel there were no more curls my hair was like a brillo pad texture with frizz static all over, I won&#x27;t recommend this product to no one with protein issue hair, be aware of the amount of protein of this product.</li>
            <li>This is a decent gel and did well with the frizz, but my curls did not have as much definition and body as I get with my Deva Curl Gel, and my hair wasn&#x27;t very soft</li>
            <li>Most hairdressers do it wet and totally mis-judge things.</li>
            <li>It creates a very natural hold.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Deva Curl Light Gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not stiff at all</li>
            <li>The product is not heavy or sticky and leaves my curls bouncy and manageable.</li>
            <li>Too much build-up left in hair.  </li>
            <li>I have short 2c hair that was really, really frizzy.  </li>
            <li>After leaving in coditioner and doing its deep conditioning as instructed on NYC Curls.com, you do not need much of this to hold the curls.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Eco Styler since I started my natural hair care routine</li>
            <li>- do not try to put on your hair directly.  </li>
            <li>As a &#x27;deva curl&#x27; girl, I am always looking for new product to switch out with what I am currently using.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your hair crunchy, slimy or just generally yucky as cheaper over the counter anti-friz products do.  </li>
            <li>my hair is naturally curly (big curls)</li>

            <li> The product does what it is supposed to.  The bottle is too hard and large and is very hard to squeeze the product out of.  Needs to be redesigned for women.</li>
            <li> This is a decent gel and did well with the frizz, but my curls did not have as much definition and body as I get with my Deva Curl Gel, and my hair wasn&#x27;t very soft either so I&#x27;m switching back.</li>
            <li> This curl gel is great on my hair.  I have superfine, soft naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> A nice light gel that allows curls to shape naturally and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling all crunchy when it dries.</li>
            <li> Excellent gel for my curls! As a &#x27;deva curl&#x27; girl, I am always looking for new product to switch out with what I am currently using. NYC Curls is perfect for my curls and leaves a nice, spicy ginger fragrance. The product is not heavy or sticky and leaves my curls bouncy and manageable.</li>
            <li> Too much build-up left in hair.  Also very drying.</li>
            <li> This gel is perfect for curly hair.  It&#x27;s not sticky but still keeps the curls under control.  And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Deva Curl Light Gel. I&#x27;m going back to Deva Curl. Although it didn&#x27;t workout for me, it might workout for others. I just prefer how my hair looks with the Deva Curl Gel</li>
            <li> I love this stuff; I use the Cleanser, the Conditioner and the Gel. A big plus is that it smells a lot better than the products I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> I really liked all three products in the range (cleanser, conditioner and styling gel). Carlos comes to London 3-4 times a year to cut my hair. I trust him as he has had curls himself. He is also one of the few to cut curls when they are dry. Most hairdressers do it wet and totally mis-judge things. I am glad all his years of  &#x60;trial and error&#x27; with other products has paid off and allowed him to create these great products. I had a friend visit NY so I had them delivered to the hotel as its not possible to get them delivered to London (at the moment via Amazon) but hopefully that will change soon. You can get them delivered here from his own website but the delivery charges are v high (not his fault).</li>
            <li> I go to Carlos - the curl master behind these products - for my hair cuts. He&#x27;s fantastic. So when this came out, I had to try it. It smells wonderful - ginger and bamboo! Even my husband noticed I was using something different. Works really well too. Blends in nicely in the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky film like others do. Definitely worth a try for all those Deva ladies out there!</li>
            <li> I have short 2c hair that was really, really frizzy.  After leaving in coditioner and doing its deep conditioning as instructed on NYC Curls.com, you do not need much of this to hold the curls.  I now have defined curls.  It does not leave your hair crunchy, slimy or just generally yucky as cheaper over the counter anti-friz products do.  I am so thrilled!</li>
            <li> I had been a devoted DevaCurl user until I discovered NYC Curls.  The products-- used together-- are amazing.  I never thought I would only need a gel but you really only need this gel!  It&#x27;s not stiff at all and it provides plenty of curl and hold.  (I felt like the Deva Angel product was leaving my hair dry.)  I even use a touch of the curl gel on dry hair.  Scent is lovely.  Here&#x27;s something important: leave plenty of conditioner left in your hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling dry. Didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eco Styler since I started my natural hair care routine and I find that it really leaves my hair kind of stiff so I was looking for a product with similar hold but one that would allow me to keep the bounce in my hair. This product is fantastic. I really love that it contains Flax Seed gel which really helps with the final texture. I have only used it once and that is the ONLY reason I haven&#x27;t given it five stars. Maybe I will come back and add a star in a week or so (lol) Great product so far. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Deva products for years...but NYC Curls is much better.  The gel is awesome.  I only with the bottles came in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  It creates a very natural hold.  Hair does not feel sticky or stiff.  The smell is fabulous.  It is now the only gel I want to use.  Carlos Flores has cut my hair when I was in NYC and he is amazing with curly hair.  I can&#x27;t find anyone else like him (and I&#x27;ve tried) so I go to him in NYC when I can get there.</li>
            <li> This product not only smells terrible, it did not help my curls. Made them feel hard and weighed down. Will not try any more of these products from NYC Curls</li>
            <li> Horrible texture, reviews are swayed, thick curly hair, hoping for softness NOT!  Sticky, heavy, over priced, overly promoted on Amazon</li>
            <li> Used with the NYC Curls Conditioner it works beautifully.  Key is to rub on your hands and then massage in to hair - do not try to put on your hair directly.  Combination works for the whole day.</li>
            <li> It was just  what I was looking for. Holds curls for extended length of time, with a nice little bounce to it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I switched to NYC Curls a few months ago.  Since then people come up to me to comment on my curls.  No more dry frizzy curls - now they glisten.  If my curls are happy, I am happy!  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered all 3 products in the line hoping that it would work on my very fine, super frizzy but corkscrew curly hair. I have used the NYC Curls products for a few days and am very disappointed. The products seem to moisturize nicely, but the frizz is out of control - like really out of control! Also no curl definition even when leaving in most of the conditioner and using the gel as recommended. I am returning all 3 products for a refund. Back to DevaCurl and DevaCare I go...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to a person which hair is not made for protein, I didn&#x27;t realized my hair was like that until I used this product, what a big mistake!!! I used the curl cleanser (which is wonderful) with the conditioner, and right after this \\&quot;magic\\&quot; gel, OMG it was like I added super glue to my hair, what in the !@#$%^ my hair is naturally curly (big curls) after this gel there were no more curls my hair was like a brillo pad texture with frizz static all over, I won&#x27;t recommend this product to no one with protein issue hair, be aware of the amount of protein of this product.</li>
