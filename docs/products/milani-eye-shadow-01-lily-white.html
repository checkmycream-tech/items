            <li> I love the glitter flecks in this eye shadow. The white is pretty and looks good with many outfits. I would recommend to others who like a little shine in their lives without being overdone.</li>
            <li> Been using for several years and yes I love it.</li>
            <li> theres no pigment t this color i have to keep layering it to even get it to show a ittle but its good i youwant to add some sparkle to some lite eyeshadow otherwise its crap</li>
            <li> I do love this shadow. It does exactly what it says - dry it goes on light and wet you get a deeper more vibrant coverage.  I&#x27;ve got #03 Bronze Doll - works with everything.  I don&#x27;t use the sponge application tool that comes with it - I use the simple semi-flat Professional Eyeshadow brush made by E.L.F.  You&#x27;ll find using it wet on this shadow makes a very easy to apply barely wet emulsion.  If you&#x27;re used to buying cheaper shadows, spend a little extra on this one - it seems to last forever.  To your unique beauty - inside and out, Lena Banks</li>
            <li> You can barely see the color unless you apply lots.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> All received and product good!</li>
