            <li> Great conditioner!  Leaves my hair soft and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great everyday conditioner, keeps my hair in super healthy condition.</li>
            <li> Great weekly conditioning treatment for my color treated hair.  First used it on a salon visit and glad I was able find it online.</li>

            <li> Buyer beware of Amazon and eBay counterfeits!&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Penetraitt conditioner is used by many cosmetology schools and salons. It&#x27;s one of the best conditioners and conditioning treatments (massage in hair, put on cap, put under salon bonnet heat dryer). I strongly suggest going online to Sally Beauty and spending $90 for the &amp;#34;Modern Elements 1875W Ionic Pro Rollabout Tourmaline Dryer&amp;#34;. Your hair will be so amazingly soft. Just five minutes, up to fifteen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About counterfeits. I have bought from eBay sellers and Amazon sellers who are authorized Amazon Prime dealers. There will be about 1/6th left that will not come out of the bottle. I get lazy. Put six of those in a closet and was going to use a box cutter to get the rest out. One day I opened a new bottle from a cosmetology school that sold me one. I had used other bottles, but those didn&#x27;t work as well. I thought these other bottles might be counterfeit. A friend of mine gets calls from a customer who makes custom shampoos, conditioners, soaps for some big name product lines when they need more capacity or if a customer wants a custom made solution and bottling. This customer told my friend that he can counterfeit any brand shampoo or conditioner. These guys are chemists. So I did some digging online to find out if there was a way to check if mine were real or not. Nothing. Not even the hair care manufacturer will help you out! Sebastian people said I should only by from an authorized reseller off their website. The website I found,  checkcosmetic-dot-net checks the tiny print on the side and bottom of your bottles for &amp;#34;manufactured on&amp;#34; dates so you can figure out the shelf life. So one recent bottle I bought on eBay FROM AMAZON said it was expired by eleven months. On these bottles, look at the bottom of the bottle. Two lines of numbers. Only input the first top row. I returned this bad bottle and my replacement ended up being good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Code: 4267030200&lt;br /&gt;Date of manufacture: 25 of September, 2014&lt;br /&gt;General shelf life: 36 months&lt;br /&gt;OK Valid at least for the next 30 monthsacture: 25 of September, 2014&lt;br /&gt;General shelf life: 36 months&lt;br /&gt;OK Valid at least for the next 30 months</li>
