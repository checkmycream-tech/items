    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The look is very nice.</li>
            <li>as a moisturizer it works - it&#x27;s not the best, but it keeps my skin from drying or becoming too oily.</li>
            <li>What I like best is the light color/</li>
            <li>the tube directions say it&#x27;s good for that.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it was a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use foundation you may be very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>If you are adept at blending color this may work until you have to reapply every two hours.</li>
            <li>It did look really nice and glowing on the skin, it just did agree with my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has a warm glow when I use it.</li>
            <li>I need to give an honest review on this product and that&#x27;s why&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice try, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea to be able to do all that with one application, but it leaves me wanting more sun protection, better flaw coverage, and a lighter feeling moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It spreads fine, absorbs good, with no noticeable oder.</li>
            <li>I do like it a bit better when used under foundation rather than on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;An hour later, still looking good, no color change, and best of all, NO settling into any fine lines, which adds years to your face.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I like BB creams to even out my skin tone and make my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>I thought the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Skin Care Youth Code Illuminator was more of a BB cream.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a sunscreen/moisturizer more than anything else.</li>
            <li>so, maybe I would like the dewier finish more during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be able to see the tan color as you rub the lotion</li>
            <li>love the scent.  </li>
            <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;--My cheapo Suave lotion did a better job of hydrating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li>In concept, I love this product because I need sunscreen on my face when I go to the beach, pool or for walks and don&#x27;t like to bother with makeup</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t hep my skin look better or</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed and satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love how this moisturizer feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really love the scent, and wish I could find a body lotion that smells just like this.</li>
            <li>- if I do that, I have to make sure I take another sunscreen or one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve make-up caked on, or I can wear it as is and have a light coverage, which is great on a hot day.</li>
            <li>Sounds too good to be true right?</li>
            <li>, I think this product might work better on someone a great deal younger than I</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the application and the nice, warm color, but the longer I left it on my face, the itchier it got.</li>
            <li>At first, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>despite being in my fifties, I have nose pores that are so huge you could drill for oil.</li>
            <li>a light make</li>
            <li>I see this being something light you can even use at the beach or pool.  </li>
            <li>However, I do like light non-greasy moisturizers</li>
            <li>It is light.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to replace Neutrogena light tint moisturizer that I used for years but is no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this lotion because it feels and smells great.</li>
            <li>As I said...in my fifties, with fine lines and crater pores, fair skin that is combination but getting more dry with each rapidly passing year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread easily or sink into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Very fair people may find the color is a bit too dark for them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a foundation user mostly because I don&#x27;t like laying on a product that often runs in hot weather when I sweat.</li>
            <li>Be prepared that the tint rubs off very easily, and the product does have the same greasy residue as most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I think this would be useful at the beach or somewhere sunny where you would like light makeup with a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have enough tinting power to do anything to my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>But for many people this product will come up short in one or more areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try new products I am most worried about breaking out in pimples.  </li>
            <li>I try new products I am most worried about breaking out in pimples.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer isn&#x27;t the best, the sunscreen is just o.k., and the tint is easily forgettable because it isn&#x27;t easy to work with and won&#x27;t work with a lot of skin tones.</li>
            <li>This product wants to be a moisturizer, sunscreen, and light make-up.  </li>
            <li>moisturizer component is o.k., but frankly the cream I have been using as a moisturizer is lighter and far better.</li>
            <li>But I have a history of being allergic to most sunscreens, so I&#x27;m sure many women won&#x27;t have a negative reaction.</li>
            <li>It felt nice on my skin while I was wearing it, but I got redness and rash by the next morning.</li>
            <li>so I expected it to have some kind of light reflecting qualities.</li>
            <li>Yes, but this one is worth looking into</li>
            <li>It comes out of the tube a nice clean white color, but after you start to smooth it into your skin the color changes slightly, giving the skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to watch the color change as you use it.</li>
            <li>It is fun to watch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Has a perfume scent to it, I would like it better unscented for my sensitive face skin</li>
            <li>However, if you wear foundation to give your skin significant extra color and glow, you may still  need to add something more foundattion-wise after applying this  (I do).</li>
            <li>Also, I want to tell you that I love your lipsticks and other products - this one was just NOT my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I tried putting my makeup on over it, which helped, but I still didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>This is all well and good, as long as you don&#x27;t need much color.</li>
            <li>Be prepared that the tint rubs off very easily, and the product does have the same greasy residue as most sunscreens.need a mild tint in their daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This wonderful moisturizer comes out of the tube like a typical bead of white moisturizer but once rubbed onto the skin, turns color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, but just doesn&#x27;t do much for my needs.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was home for the day and was able to wash my face, if I had been at work, I would have used wet paper towels to get it off -</li>
            <li>My skin is fair, except I have a little bit of tan right now, as it is summer as I am writing this.  </li>
            <li>Most people probably won&#x27;t notice the color on their skin, because most people are not this pale.</li>
            <li>As a lotion, it has that kind of greasy residue that is common among sunscreens and less ideal in a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks fresher like it did immediately after putting on the first time, but it is not covering the redness any better than it did earlier today.</li>
            <li>It looks fresher like it did immediately after putting on the first time, but it is not covering the redness any better than it did earlier today.</li>
            <li>I left it on all day in the hopes that it was get better.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t even see the tint at first.  </li>
            <li>As a sunscreen, the SPF is relatively low compared to what most people would want.  </li>
            <li>I think for most people the SPF is just too low to rely on this product as your dedicated sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>First, the package says it&#x27;s tinted.</li>
            <li>It comes out looking like sunscreen--white--and goes on like it, smoothly with SPF20 which is not bad coverage although it means you need to reapply if you are actually in the sun for longer than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>What is nice about this tinted moisturizer is that the color sinks into my skin.</li>
            <li>A bit sticky feeling, I&#x27;m aware of it on my face.</li>
            <li>that L&#x27;OREAL also owns Lancome, Maybelline and&lt;br /&gt;Biotherm and as you make all those great products, this one negative review won&#x27;t hurt you much.</li>
            <li>While it looks like a yellowish tan color as I am first applying it on my face, the color quickly blends well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a bad product for those who really need a mild tint in their daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>SO WEARING IT IS NO BIG DEAL EVERY MORNING, STAY COOL WITH GOLDBOND!</li>
            <li>very high end</li>
            <li>If the moisture is too much for my skin, I will break out.  </li>
            <li>If the moisture is too much for my skin, I will break out.  </li>
            <li>The box exudes: &amp;#34;Instantly illuminate your complexion with a burst of intense hydration and help correct imperfections with just 1 product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of illumination, my face looked and felt oily.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>So the result is that it gives a healthy natural bit of color for the beach or wherever, and applying this is no different than taking the time to apply sunscreen- which I need to do</li>
            <li>in all, I would recommend this for dry skin and those who need only the barest coverage, otherwise a true tinted moisturizer is going to be a better bet.</li>
            <li>I use the word slight because I really couldn&#x27;t see much difference in terms of making my skin more even.</li>
            <li>If you only have money for one product, want to have less clutter on the vanity table, or want one bottle for travel, this is a good product to buy.</li>
            <li>I am a blonde with fair skin so this will work for me unless I have managed to get a slight tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the first use of this product the age spots on my face diminished nearly 80%.</li>
            <li>The Youth Code Illuminator provided coverage for my skin better than no make up, but is not dark enough to completely cover any but the smallest of blemishes.  </li>
            <li>The LOreal seems to absorb better and less greasy.</li>
            <li>So if you are mainly using as makeup another layer is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you are mainly using as makeup another layer is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it stands this does three things, yet it doesn&#x27;t do anything particularly well.</li>
            <li>It looks like &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in this particular case, it did not change color or anything like that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need tone adjustments for my skin, so I cannot address this particular benefit of the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no streaking or major blending involved, it looks perfectly natural and gives just enough color for a healthy look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After putting a dab in my palm and swirling to apply, it did indeed turn orange, but I dutifully applied it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;After smoothing it on, the orange went right to a natural soft finish on my face, hurrah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but it was a huge fail for me.</li>
            <li>As for sunscreen, normally all need to be reapplied every two hours.</li>
            <li>In my case, it&#x27;s a little bit yellow at first and then mostly blends well, and</li>
            <li>What you get is a small purse-sized tube of suntan lotion with a very light tint to it.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on - 2 hours later</li>
            <li>And the SPF 20 is more than enough protection for just about anyone if you&#x27;re reapplying every two hours- only women who burn in 6 minutes or less would need a higher SPF (6 minutes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a perfect skin-tone match, but it&#x27;s pretty good (maybe a hint on the yellow side).</li>
            <li>I have used other L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code products in the past and really like them, so I was thrilled to use this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Surprised to read others reporting “flecks of powder;” I did not have that experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too oily, and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>Clearly, I was sensitive to something in this product, but that may not be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old to have to figure out beforehand what I am going to use this product for.  </li>
            <li>At first having this much dewy glow looks like you have a slight sheen on your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odd that it comes out of the tube white, but has a light tint when you spread it on your face.</li>
            <li>Today when I went to use it for the 3rd time, my skin was clear and soft and youthful looking.</li>
            <li>have very light skin and the foundations that match are typically ivory or pale in color.</li>
            <li>I used it as a sunscreen yesterday but only for a short time as I live in the&lt;br /&gt;Tropics</li>
            <li>The directions recommend reapplying every 2 hours, which is pretty typical unless a sunscreen is a waterproof formula.</li>
            <li>Other than the itch, I&#x27;m really impressed with the concept and the product and am disappointed I won&#x27;t get to use this for recreational sun exposure.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the tube white and vanishes on the skin (at least, it does on my light skin.</li>
            <li>(Oh, I meant Texas) and 108 degrees is a little hot for sunbathing.  </li>
            <li>also like it as a tinted moisturizer for wearing alone on hot days when foundation seems too heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are to “apply daily to clean skin in the AM and reapply at least every 2 hours when used as a sunscreen.”  </li>
            <li>My skin does immediately look &amp;quot;fresher&amp;quot; (what I call the dewy glow) when I use it, but hard to tell if it did those other things due to other products I use on my face to reduce redness and smooth my skin or that this product significantly helped.</li>
            <li>The oily nature of the lotion REALLY enhanced each and every little red bump.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s fun to watch the color change as you use it.</li>
            <li> It is fun to watch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Has a perfume scent to it, I would like it better unscented for my sensitive face skin</li>
            <li> However, if you wear foundation to give your skin significant extra color and glow, you may still  need to add something more foundattion-wise after applying this  (I do).</li>
            <li> Also, I want to tell you that I love your lipsticks and other products - this one was just NOT my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I tried putting my makeup on over it, which helped, but I still didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> This is all well and good, as long as you don&#x27;t need much color.</li>
            <li> Be prepared that the tint rubs off very easily, and the product does have the same greasy residue as most sunscreens.need a mild tint in their daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This wonderful moisturizer comes out of the tube like a typical bead of white moisturizer but once rubbed onto the skin, turns color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, but just doesn&#x27;t do much for my needs.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I was home for the day and was able to wash my face, if I had been at work, I would have used wet paper towels to get it off -</li>
            <li> My skin is fair, except I have a little bit of tan right now, as it is summer as I am writing this.  </li>
            <li> Most people probably won&#x27;t notice the color on their skin, because most people are not this pale.</li>
            <li> As a lotion, it has that kind of greasy residue that is common among sunscreens and less ideal in a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks fresher like it did immediately after putting on the first time, but it is not covering the redness any better than it did earlier today.</li>
            <li> It looks fresher like it did immediately after putting on the first time, but it is not covering the redness any better than it did earlier today.</li>
            <li> I left it on all day in the hopes that it was get better.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t even see the tint at first.  </li>
            <li> As a sunscreen, the SPF is relatively low compared to what most people would want.  </li>
            <li> I think for most people the SPF is just too low to rely on this product as your dedicated sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> First, the package says it&#x27;s tinted.</li>
            <li> It comes out looking like sunscreen--white--and goes on like it, smoothly with SPF20 which is not bad coverage although it means you need to reapply if you are actually in the sun for longer than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> What is nice about this tinted moisturizer is that the color sinks into my skin.</li>
            <li> A bit sticky feeling, I&#x27;m aware of it on my face.</li>
            <li> that L&#x27;OREAL also owns Lancome, Maybelline and&lt;br /&gt;Biotherm and as you make all those great products, this one negative review won&#x27;t hurt you much.</li>
            <li> While it looks like a yellowish tan color as I am first applying it on my face, the color quickly blends well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a bad product for those who really need a mild tint in their daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> SO WEARING IT IS NO BIG DEAL EVERY MORNING, STAY COOL WITH GOLDBOND!</li>
            <li> very high end</li>
            <li> If the moisture is too much for my skin, I will break out.  </li>
            <li> If the moisture is too much for my skin, I will break out.  </li>
            <li> The box exudes: &amp;#34;Instantly illuminate your complexion with a burst of intense hydration and help correct imperfections with just 1 product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of illumination, my face looked and felt oily.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> So the result is that it gives a healthy natural bit of color for the beach or wherever, and applying this is no different than taking the time to apply sunscreen- which I need to do</li>
            <li> in all, I would recommend this for dry skin and those who need only the barest coverage, otherwise a true tinted moisturizer is going to be a better bet.</li>
            <li> I use the word slight because I really couldn&#x27;t see much difference in terms of making my skin more even.</li>
            <li> If you only have money for one product, want to have less clutter on the vanity table, or want one bottle for travel, this is a good product to buy.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with fair skin so this will work for me unless I have managed to get a slight tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the first use of this product the age spots on my face diminished nearly 80%.</li>
            <li> The Youth Code Illuminator provided coverage for my skin better than no make up, but is not dark enough to completely cover any but the smallest of blemishes.  </li>
            <li> The LOreal seems to absorb better and less greasy.</li>
            <li> So if you are mainly using as makeup another layer is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you are mainly using as makeup another layer is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it stands this does three things, yet it doesn&#x27;t do anything particularly well.</li>
            <li> It looks like &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in this particular case, it did not change color or anything like that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need tone adjustments for my skin, so I cannot address this particular benefit of the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no streaking or major blending involved, it looks perfectly natural and gives just enough color for a healthy look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After putting a dab in my palm and swirling to apply, it did indeed turn orange, but I dutifully applied it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;After smoothing it on, the orange went right to a natural soft finish on my face, hurrah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but it was a huge fail for me.</li>
            <li> As for sunscreen, normally all need to be reapplied every two hours.</li>
            <li> In my case, it&#x27;s a little bit yellow at first and then mostly blends well, and</li>
            <li> What you get is a small purse-sized tube of suntan lotion with a very light tint to it.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on - 2 hours later</li>
            <li> And the SPF 20 is more than enough protection for just about anyone if you&#x27;re reapplying every two hours- only women who burn in 6 minutes or less would need a higher SPF (6 minutes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect skin-tone match, but it&#x27;s pretty good (maybe a hint on the yellow side).</li>
            <li> I have used other L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code products in the past and really like them, so I was thrilled to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li> Surprised to read others reporting “flecks of powder;” I did not have that experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too oily, and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Clearly, I was sensitive to something in this product, but that may not be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old to have to figure out beforehand what I am going to use this product for.  </li>
            <li> At first having this much dewy glow looks like you have a slight sheen on your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd that it comes out of the tube white, but has a light tint when you spread it on your face.</li>
            <li> Today when I went to use it for the 3rd time, my skin was clear and soft and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> have very light skin and the foundations that match are typically ivory or pale in color.</li>
            <li> I used it as a sunscreen yesterday but only for a short time as I live in the&lt;br /&gt;Tropics</li>
            <li> The directions recommend reapplying every 2 hours, which is pretty typical unless a sunscreen is a waterproof formula.</li>
            <li> Other than the itch, I&#x27;m really impressed with the concept and the product and am disappointed I won&#x27;t get to use this for recreational sun exposure.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube white and vanishes on the skin (at least, it does on my light skin.</li>
            <li> (Oh, I meant Texas) and 108 degrees is a little hot for sunbathing.  </li>
            <li> also like it as a tinted moisturizer for wearing alone on hot days when foundation seems too heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are to “apply daily to clean skin in the AM and reapply at least every 2 hours when used as a sunscreen.”  </li>
            <li> My skin does immediately look &amp;quot;fresher&amp;quot; (what I call the dewy glow) when I use it, but hard to tell if it did those other things due to other products I use on my face to reduce redness and smooth my skin or that this product significantly helped.</li>
            <li> The oily nature of the lotion REALLY enhanced each and every little red bump.  </li>
            <li> So this product is very cool because it&#x27;s a 20 SPF sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection that comes out white, but as you distribute it over your face a natural tint emerges that&#x27;s subtle (at least on my skin) and doesn&#x27;t look like makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reapplication is pretty common sunscreen advice.  </li>
            <li> I normally use year round.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the oddball person who had no problem with PABA even though it made virtually the rest of the world allergic, yet I can&#x27;t even wear neutrogena for sensitive skin sunscreen and have found just a few products that work for me without a reaction.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that looks white when you squeeze it out, then tiny micro beads of pigment burst as you rub it in to provide a slight tint.</li>
            <li> a sunscreen, I was concerned that it recommended using other sunscreens at the same time.  </li>

            <li> Moisturizer is a bit of a surprise in that it comes out of the tube white (mostly white, there&#x27;s a few colored flecks) and then changes color when it&#x27;s applied to your skin.</li>
            <li> one product works for every single face, but it did for me.</li>
            <li> and down the price and brand spectrum, I think I&#x27;ve probably tried over 25 different CCs, BBs, and other tinted and non tinted self balancing and corrective</li>
            <li> For those women who have absolutely no color at all, perhaps this might brighten their appearance in a noticeable way.  </li>
            <li> The little red bumps burned, and the other places on my face that hadn&#x27;t been irritated before, burned.  </li>
            <li> Over the time I used it, I did not see pimples due to this product which is a relief.  </li>

            <li> product is visually white with small specs of tint.</li>
            <li> If I was L&#x27;Oreal, I would make it one thing or the other.  </li>
            <li> It certainly is not strong enough like they claim to cover redness, dark spots, and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> As for the tint/foundation, this is plain strange.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and white and does not do any tinting other than a whitish sunscreen look.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the color.</li>
            <li> When I put this lotion on my face, it turns dark and looks muddy on me.</li>
            <li> I have also worn it under the mousse foundation I usually wear, which is dry &amp; not oily, and it works well underneath that product as well.</li>
            <li> Even my wrinkles were less</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, though, because it has an odd, plastic like texture.</li>
            <li> I covered them with this by using a clockwise and then counter-clockwise motion, and those pesky pores are WAY less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has some slight color that brightens skin slightly as it  moisturizes and protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> Unless what they mean is to use other sunscreens on other parts of your body to be fully covered?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like BB creams to even out my skin tone and make my skin look healthy. I thought the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Skin Care Youth Code Illuminator was more of a BB cream. I think it&#x27;s a sunscreen/moisturizer more than anything else. It&#x27;s odd that it comes out of the tube white, but has a light tint when you spread it on your face. Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t seem too illuminate my skin. I think this would be useful at the beach or somewhere sunny where you would like light makeup with a sunscreen. It&#x27;s not a bad product, but just doesn&#x27;t do much for my needs.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that looks white when you squeeze it out, then tiny micro beads of pigment burst as you rub it in to provide a slight tint. I use the word slight because I really couldn&#x27;t see much difference in terms of making my skin more even. It is illuminating though, but for me in the summer time, it stayed a bit too tacky feeling...so, maybe I would like the dewier finish more during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this for dry skin and those who need only the barest coverage, otherwise a true tinted moisturizer is going to be a better bet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for a product to do one thing, let alone three at the same time.  This product wants to be a moisturizer, sunscreen, and light make-up.  If you only have money for one product, want to have less clutter on the vanity table, or want one bottle for travel, this is a good product to buy. Over the weeks I have now used this it does seem to do these things as well as buying three separate products.  What I like best is the light color/glow it gives my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a light make up/skin illuminator:&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a dewy glow.  Definitely not a matte finish like the make-up I normally use year round.  It is a golden yellow base, not a rose base in case that helps you decide.  I see this being something light you can even use at the beach or pool.  I have used it over the summer on a daily basis.  At first having this much dewy glow looks like you have a slight sheen on your face.  However, It does eventually subside/absorb into your skin.  My skin is fair, except I have a little bit of tan right now, as it is summer as I am writing this.  The Youth Code Illuminator provided coverage for my skin better than no make up, but is not dark enough to completely cover any but the smallest of blemishes.  It certainly is not strong enough like they claim to cover redness, dark spots, and dark circles.  That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. I will give them imperfections as there was some smoothing and covering of my skin during use.  It does say that your skin improves over time and use of the product (immediately vs 8 hours vs 1 month).  I have now given it over a month. My skin does immediately look &amp;quot;fresher&amp;quot; (what I call the dewy glow) when I use it, but hard to tell if it did those other things due to other products I use on my face to reduce redness and smooth my skin or that this product significantly helped. Cat least it didn&#x27;t hurt it by making me break out. When you first put it on - 2 hours later and the glow is still there.  I tested the claim you need to do every 2 hours.  I put another layer on just to see if any difference in coverage.  It looks fresher like it did immediately after putting on the first time, but it is not covering the redness any better than it did earlier today. So if you are mainly using as makeup another layer is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer:&lt;br /&gt;When I try new products I am most worried about breaking out in pimples.  I have sensitive combination skin.  If the moisture is too much for my skin, I will break out.  I didn&#x27;t immediately have a bad reaction (instant redness and/or tightness) which has happened with some products.  Over the time I used it, I did not see pimples due to this product which is a relief.  It definitely feels like the moisturizer is there working, when I touch my face and it is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sunscreen, I was concerned that it recommended using other sunscreens at the same time.  Not a good sign L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al.  It says on the container that this is SPF 20, but use with other products of at least SPF 15.  Why, if your products works so well, would you say that?  Unless what they mean is to use other sunscreens on other parts of your body to be fully covered?  I think they need to clarify that or the confusion might cause people to think the product is not good like I have seen on other reviews.  I don&#x27;t think I ever got burned on my face since using this so I would say it works as a suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend the product.d the claim you need to do every 2 hours.

            <li> The box exudes: &amp;#34;Instantly illuminate your complexion with a burst of intense hydration and help correct imperfections with just 1 product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of illumination, my face looked and felt oily.  Instead of hydrated, it felt waxy.  It didn&#x27;t correct any of my facial imperfections.  I left it on all day in the hopes that it was get better.  It didn&#x27;t.  In fact, by time I removed this moisturizer my forehead and chin had several pimples that weren&#x27;t there before.  I hate how it looks and feels on my face.</li>
            <li> What you get is a small purse-sized tube of suntan lotion with a very light tint to it.  You won&#x27;t even see the tint at first.  The lotion comes out white but if you apply it to an exceptionally pale area (I used the inside of my forearm) you&#x27;ll be able to see the tan color as you rub the lotion around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The tube doesn&#x27;t come sealed, but the box does.&lt;br /&gt;--I love the scent.  It smells like suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;--The lotion left my fingers stickie.&lt;br /&gt;--I had gotten into something that made my forehead break out in a rash.  The oily nature of the lotion REALLY enhanced each and every little red bump.  I didn&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;--The lotion &#x27;burned&#x27;.  The little red bumps burned, and the other places on my face that hadn&#x27;t been irritated before, burned.  It&#x27;s possible that there&#x27;s something in this lotion that I&#x27;m allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;--My cheapo Suave lotion did a better job of hydrating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;Way too oily and sticky.  Also pricey so I can&#x27;t recommend it--at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for an instant miracle in a tube or a bottle. That&#x27;s why I am almost always disappointed and often broke because a promised miracle is always pricier than one basic promise.&lt;br /&gt;This product is visually white with small specs of tint. It is a moisturizer, sunscreen, and sort of foundation. I&#x27;m not a foundation user mostly because I don&#x27;t like laying on a product that often runs in hot weather when I sweat. However, I do like light non-greasy moisturizers and I always use a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer component is o.k., but frankly the cream I have been using as a moisturizer is lighter and far better. As for sunscreen, normally all need to be reapplied every two hours. As for the tint/foundation, this is plain strange. There are little micro particles of tint that need to be blended in the creamy white base. If you are adept at blending color this may work until you have to reapply every two hours. However, there is also an issue with the tint. It is light. I am a blonde with fair skin so this will work for me unless I have managed to get a slight tan.&lt;br /&gt;As it stands this does three things, yet it doesn&#x27;t do anything particularly well. The moisturizer isn&#x27;t the best, the sunscreen is just o.k., and the tint is easily forgettable because it isn&#x27;t easy to work with and won&#x27;t work with a lot of skin tones.</li>
            <li> Like a dummy I didn&#x27;t read where this is a sunscreen. Oh well, I&#x27;ll just use it as a night time cream around my eyes and forehead. It spreads fine, absorbs good, with no noticeable oder.</li>
            <li> In concept, I love this product because I need sunscreen on my face when I go to the beach, pool or for walks and don&#x27;t like to bother with makeup yet my skin is drab and pale. So this product is very cool because it&#x27;s a 20 SPF sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection that comes out white, but as you distribute it over your face a natural tint emerges that&#x27;s subtle (at least on my skin) and doesn&#x27;t look like makeup. So the result is that it gives a healthy natural bit of color for the beach or wherever, and applying this is no different than taking the time to apply sunscreen- which I need to do anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no streaking or major blending involved, it looks perfectly natural and gives just enough color for a healthy look. The directions recommend reapplying every 2 hours, which is pretty typical unless a sunscreen is a waterproof formula. And the SPF 20 is more than enough protection for just about anyone if you&#x27;re reapplying every two hours- only women who burn in 6 minutes or less would need a higher SPF (6 minutes x 20 SPF&#x3D; 120 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#x27;s one unfortunate issue for me-this makes my skin itch (though it does not give me a rash). But I have a history of being allergic to most sunscreens, so I&#x27;m sure many women won&#x27;t have a negative reaction. I&#x27;m the oddball person who had no problem with PABA even though it made virtually the rest of the world allergic, yet I can&#x27;t even wear neutrogena for sensitive skin sunscreen and have found just a few products that work for me without a reaction. So I&#x27;m only taking one star off because while this may bother some women, I&#x27;m probably in the minority. Other than the itch, I&#x27;m really impressed with the concept and the product and am disappointed I won&#x27;t get to use this for recreational sun exposure.</li>
            <li> At first, I really liked this product. But then, after just a few days, it started leaving flecks of residue on my face immediately after applying it. This made it impossible to use, so I had to throw it out. Not recommend.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Skin Care Youth Code Illuminator Tinted All-in-1 Moisturizer is a premium niche product that may meet the needs of a small demographic.  But for many people this product will come up short in one or more areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is marketed as a makeup product that will enhance your youthful appearance.  Yet in addition to being a moisturizer, it can also be used as a sunscreen with an SPF of 20.  As a sunscreen, the SPF is relatively low compared to what most people would want.  As a lotion, it has that kind of greasy residue that is common among sunscreens and less ideal in a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the “skin illuminator” claim is the hardest aspect of the product to accept. For those women who have absolutely no color at all, perhaps this might brighten their appearance in a noticeable way.  For me it seems to have no visible impact.  The only time I saw the tint was when I had to wipe my brow with a napkin and it was stained.  And that is probably my biggest complaint.  Women may be used to the messiness of makeup.  But it seems impractical to me to have a tinted product that doesn’t really change your appearance and yet results in messy stains on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are to “apply daily to clean skin in the AM and reapply at least every 2 hours when used as a sunscreen.”  The product just looks like a white lotion when you are applying it.  Surprised to read others reporting “flecks of powder;” I did not have that experience. Perhaps this has something to do with shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reapplication is pretty common sunscreen advice.  I think for most people the SPF is just too low to rely on this product as your dedicated sunscreen.  And the fact that it’s not really ideal for beach going is also a limitation.  Truth be told, even the “waterproof” sunscreens tell you to reapply when you get out of  the water anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a bad product for those who really need a mild tint in their daily moisturizer.  Be prepared that the tint rubs off very easily, and the product does have the same greasy residue as most sunscreens.need a mild tint in their daily moisturizer.  Be prepared that the tint rubs off very easily, and the product does have the same greasy residue as most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> After using this product I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I will only keep using it as sunscreen for my face.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything else well enough, and as I reapply sunscreen about every 2 hours anyways (when outside all day), it&#x27;s the same idea with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed that it helps even my skin tone or illuminate it.  It doesn&#x27;t have enough tinting power to do anything to my fair skin.  It doesn&#x27;t look like I have anything on at all and it didn&#x27;t hep my skin look better or me feel like I could skip foundation at all.  I know the idea isn&#x27;t to look like I have makeup on, but this just looked like I washed my face and that was it.  If you have darker skin, this will not do anything for you.</li>
            <li> It looks like &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in this particular case, it did not change color or anything like that, it simply made my skin look whitish, like a titanium dioxide or zinc oxide sunscreens often do. It did even out my skin tone, making me look a bit paler. It felt nice on my skin while I was wearing it, but I got redness and rash by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace Neutrogena light tint moisturizer that I used for years but is no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not change the color of my skin at all. I am still searching for a replacement for Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> On the first use of this product the age spots on my face diminished nearly 80%. Today when I went to use it for the 3rd time, my skin was clear and soft and youthful looking. Even my wrinkles were less prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed and satisfied. This will be in my arsenal of skin care items forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of this product. First, the package says it&#x27;s tinted. It&#x27;s not. It comes out of the tube white and vanishes on the skin (at least, it does on my light skin. I suppose there is a chance it shows on darker skin tones). Also, it claims &#x27;instant illumination&#x27; so I expected it to have some kind of light reflecting qualities. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work as sun protection and as a moisturizer. I don&#x27;t like it, though, because it has an odd, plastic like texture. It doesn&#x27;t spread easily or sink into the skin quickly. It leaves my with a sticky feeling. I like a face product that vanishes and leaves my skin feeling velvety- like the silicone based ones. This one has some silicone but also oil and glycerin.</li>
            <li> Yes, but this one is worth looking into and here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up and down the price and brand spectrum, I think I&#x27;ve probably tried over 25 different CCs, BBs, and other tinted and non tinted self balancing and corrective products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the type that is white  when it comes out of the tube, and then self adjusts to your skintone.&lt;br /&gt;Many of those are a roll of the dice.&lt;br /&gt;One very high end one felt like it had sand in it and turned my face orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting a dab in my palm and swirling to apply, it did indeed turn orange, but I dutifully applied it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;After smoothing it on, the orange went right to a natural soft finish on my face, hurrah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An hour later, still looking good, no color change, and best of all, NO settling into any fine lines, which adds years to your face.&lt;br /&gt;And despite being in my fifties, I have nose pores that are so huge you could drill for oil. I covered them with this by using a clockwise and then counter-clockwise motion, and those pesky pores are WAY less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one product works for every single face, but it did for me. As I said...in my fifties, with fine lines and crater pores, fair skin that is combination but getting more dry with each rapidly passing year.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering another tube of this.</li>
            <li> I love how this moisturizer feels on my skin. It&#x27;s not too oily, and it makes my skin feel soft. Makeup glides on over it, so it&#x27;s easier to get a smoother look. I really love the scent, and wish I could find a body lotion that smells just like this. My only complaint is the color. I wear the palest shade of porcelain foundation that I can find. I&#x27;m very pale. When I put this lotion on my face, it turns dark and looks muddy on me. I tried putting my makeup on over it, which helped, but I still didn&#x27;t look right. Most people probably won&#x27;t notice the color on their skin, because most people are not this pale. I would definitely recommend this lotion because it feels and smells great. However, if you are paler than porcelain, you might want to pass it up.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but it was a huge fail for me. I have used other L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code products in the past and really like them, so I was thrilled to use this product. It comes out of the tube a nice clean white color, but after you start to smooth it into your skin the color changes slightly, giving the skin a nice glow. Very fair people may find the color is a bit too dark for them. I was pleased with the application and the nice, warm color, but the longer I left it on my face, the itchier it got. Fortunately I was home for the day and was able to wash my face, if I had been at work, I would have used wet paper towels to get it off - it was that uncomfortable. Clearly, I was sensitive to something in this product, but that may not be the case for everyone. It did look really nice and glowing on the skin, it just did agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a tinted moisturizer which supposedly changes to match any skin type. Sounds too good to be true right? Well, trust your instincts and skip this if you want any tinting. The cream is thick and white and does not do any tinting other than a whitish sunscreen look. I was very disappointed in this and it&#x27;s going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> This product is a moisturizer with tint built into it. As you rub it on it activates the color. It&#x27;s fun to watch the color change as you use it. The look is very nice. My skin has a warm glow when I use it. It can look a little shiny --maybe a bit too shiny for my taste. My skin feels a tad oily when I use it. I do like it a bit better when used under foundation rather than on its own.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use foundation you may be very pleased with this. It comes out looking like sunscreen--white--and goes on like it, smoothly with SPF20 which is not bad coverage although it means you need to reapply if you are actually in the sun for longer than 20 minutes.  However, if you wear foundation to give your skin significant extra color and glow, you may still  need to add something more foundattion-wise after applying this  (I do). It has some slight color that brightens skin slightly as it  moisturizes and protects from the sun. This is all well and good, as long as you don&#x27;t need much color. Otherwise, you might stick with colored foundation with SPF protection.</li>
            <li> This wonderful moisturizer comes out of the tube like a typical bead of white moisturizer but once rubbed onto the skin, turns color. It is fun to watch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin and the foundations that match are typically ivory or pale in color. What is nice about this tinted moisturizer is that the color sinks into my skin. While it looks like a yellowish tan color as I am first applying it on my face, the color quickly blends well with my natural skin tone. It appears as though it disregards of the hue of my skin and blends in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like it as a tinted moisturizer for wearing alone on hot days when foundation seems too heavy. I have also worn it under the mousse foundation I usually wear, which is dry &amp; not oily, and it works well underneath that product as well. I don&#x27;t need tone adjustments for my skin, so I cannot address this particular benefit of the product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the tint, still pretty close to white although a shade darker than Olay regenerist luminous. I picked this LOreal skin illuminati because I was using the Olay at SPF 15 and the LOreal is 20 SPF. They have similar ingredient lists, in varying amounts. The LOreal seems to absorb better and less greasy. Has a perfume scent to it, I would like it better unscented for my sensitive face skin but it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation, I like it.</li>
            <li> SO WEARING IT IS NO BIG DEAL EVERY MORNING, STAY COOL WITH GOLDBOND! DANCING WITH THE STARS,WHO WILL DANCE NEXT?</li>
            <li> Now, let&#x27;s see.....where do I put this product on my vanity table?  Do I put it with the sunscreens - if I do that, I have to make sure I take another sunscreen or one that&#x27;s waterproof with me if I&#x27;m going to the pool.  Well, I can put it with the moisturizers cause  the tube directions say it&#x27;s good for that.  Or, how about I put it with the skin illuminators (not that I have a boatload of&lt;br /&gt;those on hand) and maybe it will even out skin discolorations.  I need to give an honest review on this product and that&#x27;s why&lt;br /&gt;I am in dilemna - I&#x27;m not sure what this product is.  I used it as a sunscreen yesterday but only for a short time as I live in the&lt;br /&gt;Tropics (Oh, I meant Texas) and 108 degrees is a little hot for sunbathing.  I used it on my arms after my shower but I felt it left my skin sorta sticky.  I used it on my hands and I thought it was a good moisturizer but it&#x27;s expensive for just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I think this product might work better on someone a great deal younger than I - I&#x27;m too old to have to figure out beforehand what I am going to use this product for.  If I was L&#x27;Oreal, I would make it one thing or the other.  Also, I want to tell you that I love your lipsticks and other products - this one was just NOT my favorite.  I also like the products in your other&lt;br /&gt;ownerships...YSL and Louis Vuitton.  And, I think I read somewhere that L&#x27;OREAL also owns Lancome, Maybelline and&lt;br /&gt;Biotherm and as you make all those great products, this one negative review won&#x27;t hurt you much.</li>
            <li> Blends into the skin leaving little skin color change. A bit sticky feeling, I&#x27;m aware of it on my face. So it&#x27;s a little bit sunscreen (SPF20), a little bit makeup, and a little bit moisturizer. It&#x27;s a great idea to be able to do all that with one application, but it leaves me wanting more sun protection, better flaw coverage, and a lighter feeling moisturizer. Nice try, though.</li>
            <li> As someone with pale skin, I&#x27;m always worried when I see &#x27;tinted&#x27; in regards to make-up. L&#x27;Oreal Paris Skin Care Youth Code Illuminator Tinted All-in-One Moisturizer is a bit of a surprise in that it comes out of the tube white (mostly white, there&#x27;s a few colored flecks) and then changes color when it&#x27;s applied to your skin. In my case, it&#x27;s a little bit yellow at first and then mostly blends well, and as a moisturizer it works - it&#x27;s not the best, but it keeps my skin from drying or becoming too oily. I can wear this with my foundation and primer and not feel like I&#x27;ve make-up caked on, or I can wear it as is and have a light coverage, which is great on a hot day. It&#x27;s not a perfect skin-tone match, but it&#x27;s pretty good (maybe a hint on the yellow side).</li>
