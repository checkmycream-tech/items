            <li>The mask smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Ordering was easy and it shipped in not time!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>

            <li>the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li>and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li>I love them smell of these products...</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>After buying the Herstyler hair serum which I love, my sister told me about the Hair Mask.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>i just love it</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels after words... if ur looking for a mask for  your hair</li>
            <li>I love how it make my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>hair mask is what l love....</li>
            <li>masl  was just ok.</li>
            <li>I can say is my hair feels so soft and looks great after using it.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li>, it just doesn&#x27;t have the same great affect and doesn&#x27;t wash out well when you do.</li>
            <li>I mostly love the fresh clean smell that stays in your hair through out the day.</li>
            <li>detangles and has a clean scent.</li>
            <li>well i just didnt see anything special about this hair</li>
            <li>Great price and works well on fine hair..adds body without weighing down.</li>
            <li>and I still love it so much.</li>
            <li>You can find good deals on this and similar products at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>i have try lots of products and i have to say I LOVE this product it really works</li>
            <li>I do not blow dry my hair so that I can reduce the amount of heat that is on my hair and with this mask and one good heating tool-</li>
            <li>I use it once or twice a week instead of regular conditioner and my hair has never been this shiny and healthy looking!  </li>
            <li>I love the Her Styler line of Products, Makes hair soft and it smells divine!</li>
            <li>After leaving it in for 7 minutes my usually dry hair is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Instantly I knew that it was an amazing product for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use oils (well rarely use oils).  </li>
            <li>My hair is curly and tends to get kind of brittle on the ends before my next cut, but ever since I tried this mask, I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  </li>
            <li>to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li>it made my hair so soft that my hair stylist even comment on it vs the product i got from her : )  is worth the price</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>Using this makes my hair incredibly easy to straighten, super soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I paid $27 for this product (it&#x27;s $19.99 as I&#x27;m writing this) and must say that the \\&quot;original price\\&quot; is unjustifiably high.  </li>
            <li>my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, very fast shipping</li>
            <li>They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li>I think some of their people use the serum first.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells good or bad, but it wouldn&#x27;t matter, the results are wonderful, especially over time.</li>
            <li>would like to see a more firmer consistency, as it seems too fluid.</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple of times now exactly the same way I did with the mall samples, and it leaves my hair feeling nowhere near as nice.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time swimming in the summer which really dries oit my hair.  </li>
            <li>It deep conditions from the roots to the ends and makes hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Other products you have to wait 15 minutes, this one is more convenient</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s main ingredient is an oil.</li>
            <li>The masque that she gave me smells like the serum, which I love, but the one I bought here at a discount price was not the same product, looked and smelled different.</li>
            <li>I finally found a product that really makes my coarse unruly hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I realize now the product I received was not the same as original now, my friend bought me the real thing and the smell is completely different!</li>
            <li>but it does make hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves Hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>The hair mask that I bought at the was more expensive but it got the job done, my hair was soft and full of body.</li>
            <li>This product offers little more than a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth, it protects my hair after I blow dry or flat iron</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good treatment for hair that is then air dried and flat ironed or blown dry.</li>
            <li>I use this and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, it leaves my hair feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>This products keeps it soft and silky through out the day</li>
            <li>It has a slightly odd smell to it, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so pretty and soft without weighing it down</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair mask to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long, very curly, dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I identify as black and have wavy, curly, think, soft, volumious hair that is unprocessed and have to be very intentional about the products I use on my hair.</li>

            <li> My hair is very long, very curly, dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I identify as black and have wavy, curly, think, soft, volumious hair that is unprocessed and have to be very intentional about the products I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> I my girlfriend had a flat iron party</li>
            <li> Suggestions: Do not let this sit too long</li>
            <li> My mom bought it in the mall a long time ago with the straightener.</li>
            <li> A tub lasts soooo long.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review not to long ago about this masque that I&#x27;d purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and Native American female with thick curly kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer who said this product is not the same as the one she got from the mall.</li>
            <li> I finally found a product where I just use this after my color, and it feels like soft, subtle hair again.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too, not only with this product, but, with the others that I have tried as well.</li>
            <li> It has helped cut my straightening time in half (now only one hour).</li>
            <li> I am in a dry climate and the water is harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> It nourishes my hair and helps cut down on the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> I have previously bought the Herstyler mask at the mall and paid a lot for it.  </li>
            <li> It will leave hair softer and slightly easier to comb through, but not any less frizzy or damaged.  </li>
            <li> I thought from looking at the picture that this was the black colored tub which has the dead sea minerals in it, instead it came in a brown tub</li>
            <li> I have very thick wiry hair, that needs a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended to use once a week, but after being in the pool a few times a week I use it two to three time a week.  </li>
            <li> i actuallu pay full price over at the mall :(  </li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> This one is not too perfume smelling, and also keeps penetrating the hair long after others fail.      </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like buying products worrying if it&#x27;s real or not:(</li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> This product my hair was hard and brittle after use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the equivalent of a regular conditioner :(</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> would--maybe even worse.</li>
            <li> The product does smell chemically or something, but your hair doesn&#x27;t smell weird after, just not like apples or flowers.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank you Amazon.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and it smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> Works good but smells like a sewer. I have to put conditioner on after wards to get the smell out but it does make hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I am in a dry climate and the water is harsh on my hair. I use this and it makes my hair soft. It has a slightly odd smell to it, but it&#x27;s worth it. Other products you have to wait 15 minutes, this one is more convenient you only wait 5-8 minutes. I highly recommend this hair mask to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have previously bought the Herstyler mask at the mall and paid a lot for it.  When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled!!!  (Especially when I saw the price!)  I spend a lot of time swimming in the summer which really dries oit my hair.  It&#x27;s recommended to use once a week, but after being in the pool a few times a week I use it two to three time a week.  My hair feels like silk after I style it.  You wlll love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have been color treating my hair for years and years.  I finally found a product where I just use this after my color, and it feels like soft, subtle hair again. I have very thick wiry hair, that needs a deep conditioner.  This one is not too perfume smelling, and also keeps penetrating the hair long after others fail.      I have never ever found a product I could use at home with the same results as a salon deep conditioner till now.    I have purchased about three of these from amazon.  One from the mall kiosk where they sell the herstyler products (beware they rip people off at the mall).    LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I identify as black and have wavy, curly, think, soft, volumious hair that is unprocessed and have to be very intentional about the products I use on my hair. I like treatments for my hair that help it retain moisture because my hair dries out and I don&#x27;t use oils (well rarely use oils).  I use this once a week, always before I straighten my hair. Using this makes my hair incredibly easy to straighten, super soft, and shiny. I love it and everyone thinks I have a relaxer after I have used this. It has helped cut my straightening time in half (now only one hour). I do not blow dry my hair so that I can reduce the amount of heat that is on my hair and with this mask and one good heating tool- my hair looks like those informercial ladies&#x27;.  The product does smell chemically or something, but your hair doesn&#x27;t smell weird after, just not like apples or flowers.  I like to get in the shower, wash my hair and put on the mask, then was the rest of my body and I make this a shaving day and facial scrub or something day so that by the time I finish with the rest of me I can wash the conditioner out and be done.  A good thing to use too after you finish is their serum- a great finisher. I think some of their people use the serum first.  Suggestions: Do not let this sit too long, it just doesn&#x27;t have the same great affect and doesn&#x27;t wash out well when you do. Make sure you rinse it all out. Comb through your hair once you put the conditioner in and before you wash it out.</li>
            <li> I love this!  The fragrance is wonderful and it makes even the frizziest hair smooth and really, really healthy!  My hair is curly and tends to get kind of brittle on the ends before my next cut, but ever since I tried this mask, I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  I use it once or twice a week instead of regular conditioner and my hair has never been this shiny and healthy looking!  And if you purchase it on Amazon, you get a great deal.  I stocked up!</li>
            <li> I thought from looking at the picture that this was the black colored tub which has the dead sea minerals in it, instead it came in a brown tub and it&#x27;s main ingredient is an oil. It&#x27;s the equivalent of a regular conditioner :(</li>
            <li> I love this product. Every time I use it, it leaves my hair feeling so soft. This is the second time I have bought this. I also like the smell. Some people may not like the smell though. Great product</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  I mostly love the fresh clean smell that stays in your hair through out the day.</li>
            <li> I love the Her Styler line of Products, Makes hair soft and it smells divine! A little goes a long way, too, not only with this product, but, with the others that I have tried as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner. My mom bought it in the mall a long time ago with the straightener. Once I used that bottle, I just never bought anymore. I finally recently remembered this stuff and I still love it so much. It makes my hair so pretty and soft without weighing it down and it makes my hair smell really nice.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the same herstyle mask that I have always purchased even teh smell and consistancy was different. Not happy</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that really makes my coarse unruly hair soft and healthy. Love it! You should try it.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Leaves Hair feeling very soft. With the appearance of healthy looking hair. Overall a must have purchase. love.</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> I have used this product from the kiosh in the mall and I was skeptic about ordering but I am so glad I did!  Same product but now I can afford to use it!  Ordering was easy and it shipped in not time!</li>
            <li> HerStyler Nourishing &amp; Moisturizing Intensive Hair Conditioning Mask is a wonderful product. It deep conditions from the roots to the ends and makes hair silky smooth. It&#x27;s a good treatment for hair that is then air dried and flat ironed or blown dry. Herstyler Hair Mask is an essential part of my regimen twice a week.  I leave it on for about ten minutes, then rinse it out.  It nourishes my hair and helps cut down on the frizzies.  Highly recommended.  You can find good deals on this and similar products at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> When i recieved this product in Box.&lt;br /&gt;the product doesn&#x27;t good packaged also the product when i opened....hmmmm&lt;br /&gt;It was like fake product....doesn&#x27;t have cover seal...&lt;br /&gt;never again</li>
            <li> A kind salesperson gave me a tub of Her Styler a couple of years ago. Instantly I knew that it was an amazing product for my hair. I try to use it about once a week or every two weeks. A tub lasts soooo long. The smell is different. I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells good or bad, but it wouldn&#x27;t matter, the results are wonderful, especially over time. I have shared it, thinking that it is a miracle worker. Not everyone has been as impressed as I am. My hair is very long, very curly, dry and frizzy. Her Styler softens my curls, prevents the friz and reduces breakage. Thank you, Shay for sharing Her Styler with me! -Faith</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t quite smell like the tubes of conditioner, smells a bit off</li>
            <li> shipment was superfast however the product is different from the one that I bought in the mall, it smells differently. The hair mask that I bought at the was more expensive but it got the job done, my hair was soft and full of body. This product my hair was hard and brittle after use</li>
            <li> smells great and does the job. would like to see a more firmer consistency, as it seems too fluid.</li>
            <li> I paid $27 for this product (it&#x27;s $19.99 as I&#x27;m writing this) and must say that the \\&quot;original price\\&quot; is unjustifiably high.  This product offers little more than a regular conditioner.  It will leave hair softer and slightly easier to comb through, but not any less frizzy or damaged.  After using it twice a week for 2 months, I am disappointed with the outcome.  The mask smells nice.  Made in China.</li>
            <li> Have used it before . Great price and works well on fine hair..adds body without weighing down. detangles and has a clean scent.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. After leaving it in for 7 minutes my usually dry hair is nice and smooth. If the price makes you wince you should know that the mall charges over $80 for a 18 ounce container!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer who said this product is not the same as the one she got from the mall. I have used it a couple of times now exactly the same way I did with the mall samples, and it leaves my hair feeling nowhere near as nice. It smells the same as the mall sample, looks the same as the mall sample, feels the same as the mall sample, but in terms of results, it&#x27;s nothing like the mall samples. It leaves my hair the same as a regular conditioner would--maybe even worse. Going back to Hask Henna&amp;Placenta.</li>
            <li> I love them smell of these products...they should make them into perfumes but it sitting in my hair for 10mins is already like a perfume. Cant get my BF to stop sniffing my hair</li>
            <li> HerStyler Nourishing &amp; Moisturizing Intensive Hair Conditioning Mask is really a great product, Its been 2 years that I have been using it and I really love it. Makes my hair so smooth, it protects my hair after I blow dry or flat iron my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, very fast shipping</li>
            <li> After buying the Herstyler hair serum which I love, my sister told me about the Hair Mask.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is my hair feels so soft and looks great after using it. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> i have try lots of products and i have to say I LOVE this product it really works it made my hair so soft that my hair stylist even comment on it vs the product i got from her : )  is worth the price i actuallu pay full price over at the mall :(  i put this in the morning n wash my hair 4hrs later and it did nothing wrong with my hair but insted it made it amazing i just love it</li>
            <li> I my girlfriend had a flat iron party and I won this hair CONDITIONER as a door prize. I&#x27;m African American and Native American female with thick curly kinky hair. I love the smell and how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after words... if ur looking for a mask for  your hair this is the mask to get. Its awesome it smells great</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend.  I love how it make my hair feel.  I have had a lot of growth since I&#x27;ve started to use it.  It may be that my hair is not breaking and it appears my hair is growing at a faster rate.  Any how, it&#x27;s great.  The price is great too.</li>
            <li> My hair is waist lenght and tends to react by frizzing during humid conditions.  This products keeps it soft and silky through out the day no  matter what the weather.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review not to long ago about this masque that I&#x27;d purchased from amazon. I realize now the product I received was not the same as original now, my friend bought me the real thing and the smell is completely different! The masque that she gave me smells like the serum, which I love, but the one I bought here at a discount price was not the same product, looked and smelled different. I don&#x27;t like buying products worrying if it&#x27;s real or not:(</li>
            <li> This...hair mask is what l love....the aroma and the softness in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more!</li>
            <li> well i just didnt see anything special about this hair masl  was just ok.</li>
