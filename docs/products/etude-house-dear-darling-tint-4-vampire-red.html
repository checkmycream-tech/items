            <li>The color is absolutely gorgeous</li>
            <li>Good staying power.</li>
            <li>tastes good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good if you want the tint on the inside part of your lips in case you lick it</li>
            <li>i heard good things about it</li>
            <li>/&gt;the taste is not that good</li>
            <li>It smells good though, like grape candy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tint is great for the popular &amp;#34;gradient&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>but I love it and it smells great--</li>
            <li>I love this tint!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product if you don&#x27;t like the feel of lipstick and stays pretty well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Got it yesterday, &amp; I&#x27;ve got to say that I love it!</li>
            <li>The color was truly amazing</li>
            <li>After applying, it leaves a nice color on your lips, but stays in jelly form.</li>
            <li>It tastes kind of like grape soda, like</li>
            <li>it has a nice smell as well kinda like candy</li>
            <li>the seller was so kind</li>
            <li>I bought this lip tint thinking it would be a nice lip stain, but it is not.</li>
            <li>The shade is very.... &amp;#34;fresh blood&amp;#34; so the vampire name is perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, if you guys have any suggestions as to how I can fall in love with this product, let me know! :)</li>
            <li>Can be pleasant, but it&#x27;s kind of too sweet and it makes me feel like i&#x27;m putting grape juice on my lips-</li>
            <li>lip balm seems to work the best so far) and do a one time application.</li>
            <li>I love it , it gives you nice tinted lips without all the smudging and cakey look</li>
            <li>Great brown wine color at first.  </li>
            <li>It has a bit of a nice sweet taste to it, which is nice.</li>
            <li>The price was great and shipping was incredibly fast and easy!</li>
            <li>However you have to make sure that your lips are very smooth with no cracks or peeling skin.</li>
            <li>I love lipstains but this one is virtually unusable.</li>
            <li>Love love love it....</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li>I love this tint, it&#x27;s the perfect shade of red.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love love loooove this product.</li>
            <li>Love this wine color and looks cute</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot better than Benefit&#x27;s lip stain.</li>
            <li>I love the cute packaging and the tube has plenty of product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite lip products.  </li>
            <li>If you are going for the &amp;#34;bitten&amp;#34; look I see a lot in Korean or Japanese Beauty blogs, this is great buy!</li>
            <li>and the more often you apply it, the longer it stays.</li>
            <li>More product can be used for a darker stain.</li>
            <li>i must say is my favorite</li>
            <li>I love the color of this tint.  </li>
            <li>you may not want to use tint as it will seep into cracks and make them more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and how it smells:)</li>
            <li>But most make up does.</li>
            <li>Love this lip tint.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasantly of grapes, and overall the color payoff is amazing!</li>
            <li>when you apply it you get a really nice rich color.</li>
            <li>Great color, decent wear time</li>
            <li>perfect for those who do not wanna wear lipstick all day and just want that hint of color, you may have to blot it but the color is rich and red and lovely.</li>
            <li>but once you put it on and let it dry, wonderful color.  </li>
            <li>then i thought and it looks absolutely beautiful on your lips giving you a sexy mysterious look :)</li>
            <li>Very nice color, my new standby.</li>
            <li>:) I highly recommend this lipstain, plus the brand is a good brand.</li>
            <li>this is really great, the applicator is soft and bent at an angle</li>
            <li>If you have any fresh cherry tints It smells exactly like them,but it&#x27;s really great</li>
            <li>you want a special tint, just go for it!</li>
            <li>I would use it along with other Korean beauty products and get tips and view tutorials on the best way to use these products.</li>
            <li>It dries everything up and wears off easily.</li>
            <li>With a swipe of lip gloss to finish off, this easily lasts for over 4 hours.</li>
            <li>The smell is a strong grape jelly scent.</li>
            <li>the container is super cute, and will fit easily in purses and makeup bags and such, much better than the benefit tints do LOL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taste like a real cherry, sweet and smell good.</li>
            <li>Shipped and recieved quickly!</li>
            <li>Thanks Cosmetic Love!</li>
            <li>Very Pretty color love it</li>
            <li>Mine came with free samples a sheet mask socks and a pore strip like the color smell like cherry and grapes</li>
            <li>I applied it after I adjust the Skinfood tomato jelly lip balm tint, it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>But overall, I love this tint!!</li>
            <li>but as I understand it they&#x27;re very popular in some Asian countries.</li>
            <li>Nice dark color, good for a grunge or punk look.</li>
            <li>It does dry evenly and stays on most of the day but a fair warning if you have chapped/cracked lips</li>
            <li>Beautiful color as expected.</li>
            <li>And for the product, it&#x27;s love at first use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I love Korean tints, I own a couple different brands</li>
            <li>But I like the color and think it would go great with an dark or evening outfit and would be perfect for everyday wear in the fall.</li>
            <li>Also the color was more of a deep/dark pink to me then a red, but since I don&#x27;t have the shade I&#x27;ve decided to keepit and make the best of it.</li>
            <li>It match with Asian Fair Skin.</li>
            <li>This product lasts for hours and stays just a tad tacky giving your lips a truely berry-kissed look and feel.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sweet, not saying to eat it</li>
            <li>Love the color, and it shipped earlier than estimated delivery time which is more fantastic.</li>
            <li>I gave up The Body SHop&#x27;s lip and cheek tint years ago, got fed up with benetint&#x27;s overpriced tint, and lucky to have found this.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect deep shade of berry red.</li>
            <li>The tint won&#x27;t smudge or wipe away quickly</li>
            <li>Shipping was rather quick for coming from Korea (about 2 weeks).</li>
            <li>This is very pretty color</li>
            <li>The texture is between water and gel, but is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>As for the product: arrives looking almost black in the tube but the color is amazing- love it.</li>
            <li>the seller (Beauty net korea)  is amazing they gave me samples and a appreciation card</li>
            <li>It makes a nice gloss but don&#x27;t count on this lasting you through the day</li>
            <li>, I thought it&#x27;d be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it gives almost natural look.</li>
            <li>and it smells really nice and also the color is beautiful such a deep red color also</li>
            <li>Which is sad because it is such a lovely red that I&#x27;d hope for a completely perfect product, but perfect is not possible.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, if you even try to smack your lips, it sticks and comes right off.</li>
            <li>One star lost for staying power, it is beautiful on but after 3-4 hours and drinking and eating, the product is left only in bits</li>
            <li>just make sure you exfoliate your lips to get rid of all the dead skin off your lips before applying this, it looks a lot better</li>
            <li>The tint is very long lasting, and it&#x27;s a beautiful burgundy-bloody color.</li>
            <li>Personally, I am a fan of The Balm&#x27;s lipstain as it dries quickly and leaves a nice, natural berry stain.</li>
            <li>I love how it glides on smoothly and tint stays longer on my lips longer than other tints that i tried.  </li>
            <li>at first i was a bit worried about it drying out my lips</li>
            <li>will try more colors next time</li>
            <li>but this was my first Etude one.</li>
            <li>but it is such a good, lasting color.</li>
            <li>I receive a lot of positive complement whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li>It has a a funky taste and it does not stay long on your lips otherwise its ok.</li>
            <li>Every thing is nice except the fact that there&#x27;s pretty little product.</li>
            <li>It goes on well and stays put but make sure you let it dry.</li>
            <li>so far.. color last , does not dry my lips and smells good..</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s very watery with a little slip and kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>smell is hard to explain but it smells good In my opinion and it smells pleasant&lt;br</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>The order came quicker than I expected, and they give 3 free samples with it!</li>
            <li>the product itself is very watery even for s liquid tint.</li>
            <li>how much color/darkness you want.</li>
            <li>but I do not think this stain is worth the price so far.</li>
            <li>I just feel the price I payed for this was a bit much for what it offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like to put it on my lip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gel like feel.</li>
            <li>The tint is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>It gives light/medium coverage and can&#x27;t really be built up.</li>
            <li>This tint really has to be built up.</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>Ok first it looks dark,</li>
            <li>My order arrived earlier than expected which is good.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the fruity smell this came with, and the color seemed to work best when applied a few times to get the dark deep red.</li>
            <li>Vampires blood make me think it would be rich red.</li>
            <li>I love this tint goes well with other reds.</li>
            <li>Something to consider is that because it is a tint, it does dry your lips after a while, but that is easily solved with lip balm.</li>
            <li>Although the product goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a horrid smell or taste; it just does not last very long.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly but didn&#x27;t dry as fast as I thought it should have.</li>
            <li>This is a true vampire red.</li>
            <li>It has such a sweet scent</li>
            <li>it stays fairly well (a little E.L.F makeup must doesn&#x27;t hurt) and only needs reapplication after food/drink.</li>
            <li>lips are healthy and unchapped but this product will make any little creases on your lip really visible and will make your lips chapped.</li>
            <li>It does come with many skin whitening samples which is odd</li>
            <li>I think the only downside is that the color fades quickly, and if you have cracked or chapped lips the color sticks to the cracks and is darker there than the rest of your lips.</li>
            <li>I constantly wear this, my only thing was that for a while I didn&#x27;t like the smell and taste but over all I still love it.</li>
            <li>The color is more of a rosy berry than a red, but I actually prefer that.</li>
            <li>It was a little more creamy, almost like a gloss which was not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>This better, redder, and lasts definitely longer than brands that have been in the market for a long time.</li>
            <li>To apply, I dab a few spots of color on my top and lower lip then rub them together.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color and stays a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is mostly good for photo shooting, not long wear or serious wear.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works on cheeks too but only if you blend it VERY fast, like even faster than the benefit cheek tints, or it will leave the stain marks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little watery but looks fine on the lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very glossy, so you may want a light gloss in clear or a similar color.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>Shiping was fast, It actually came alot sooner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lip stains from countless brands, and most have been disappointing.</li>
            <li>The only con is that the formula is very watery</li>
            <li>It has the issues that every other lipstain does but if you&#x27;re dedicated to gunk free red lips you learn to work with it.</li>
            <li>Shipping did take 2-3 weeks due to being an international shipment but it was free</li>
            <li>and it is easily build-able for a very deep red vampire look, or a sweet subtle reddish tint</li>
            <li>I got the vampire red one, and it&#x27;s more of a blood red tint, (brownish red) but still very red, not very pink at all&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>After about 5 mins, there is very little color in my upper lip, but for some reason, my lower lip retains the color better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend for the photo shoots in a quick second, but I would not purchase again in the future if I was looking for this type of red again.</li>
            <li>sure you exfoliate your lips before applying or it&#x27;s going to soak into that dead dry skin on your lips.</li>
            <li>cause it seemed to be one of the problems that some people had and because my lips dry out fast.</li>
            <li>However, this has quickly become my everyday lip product.</li>
            <li>haha, the tint itself is a slightly thicker liquid so it doesn&#x27;t run down when you apply it, it really does stain your lips this dark cherry red, which I think looks stunning.</li>
            <li>color is a really pretty red and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li>When I first pulled out the tube, I was surprised because on screen the tint looks dark red</li>
            <li>thought this would be more like a stain but its glossier than any stain I&#x27;ve tried and the staying power is not great.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a thin liquid because you can build up</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve known when I saw the brand name (which is known to be a cheap cosmetic brand with horrible quality), but the reviews were so good</li>
            <li>It is sticky while it is drying, but once it&#x27;s dry its actually very soft.</li>
            <li>You can put a little on for a subtle deep red look or you can layer it on for a much more vibrant color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very natural red and long lasting.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday, &amp; I&#x27;ve got to say that I love it!</li>
            <li> The color was truly amazing</li>
            <li> After applying, it leaves a nice color on your lips, but stays in jelly form.</li>
            <li> It tastes kind of like grape soda, like</li>
            <li> it has a nice smell as well kinda like candy</li>
            <li> the seller was so kind</li>
            <li> I bought this lip tint thinking it would be a nice lip stain, but it is not.</li>
            <li> The shade is very.... &amp;#34;fresh blood&amp;#34; so the vampire name is perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, if you guys have any suggestions as to how I can fall in love with this product, let me know! :)</li>
            <li> Can be pleasant, but it&#x27;s kind of too sweet and it makes me feel like i&#x27;m putting grape juice on my lips-</li>
            <li> lip balm seems to work the best so far) and do a one time application.</li>
            <li> I love it , it gives you nice tinted lips without all the smudging and cakey look</li>
            <li> Great brown wine color at first.  </li>
            <li> It has a bit of a nice sweet taste to it, which is nice.</li>
            <li> The price was great and shipping was incredibly fast and easy!</li>
            <li> However you have to make sure that your lips are very smooth with no cracks or peeling skin.</li>
            <li> I love lipstains but this one is virtually unusable.</li>
            <li> Love love love it....</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li> I love this tint, it&#x27;s the perfect shade of red.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love love loooove this product.</li>
            <li> Love this wine color and looks cute</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot better than Benefit&#x27;s lip stain.</li>
            <li> I love the cute packaging and the tube has plenty of product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite lip products.  </li>
            <li> If you are going for the &amp;#34;bitten&amp;#34; look I see a lot in Korean or Japanese Beauty blogs, this is great buy!</li>
            <li> and the more often you apply it, the longer it stays.</li>
            <li> More product can be used for a darker stain.</li>
            <li> i must say is my favorite</li>
            <li> I love the color of this tint.  </li>
            <li> you may not want to use tint as it will seep into cracks and make them more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Love the color and how it smells:)</li>
            <li> But most make up does.</li>
            <li> Love this lip tint.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasantly of grapes, and overall the color payoff is amazing!</li>
            <li> when you apply it you get a really nice rich color.</li>
            <li> Great color, decent wear time</li>
            <li> perfect for those who do not wanna wear lipstick all day and just want that hint of color, you may have to blot it but the color is rich and red and lovely.</li>
            <li> but once you put it on and let it dry, wonderful color.  </li>
            <li> then i thought and it looks absolutely beautiful on your lips giving you a sexy mysterious look :)</li>
            <li> Very nice color, my new standby.</li>
            <li> :) I highly recommend this lipstain, plus the brand is a good brand.</li>
            <li> this is really great, the applicator is soft and bent at an angle</li>
            <li> If you have any fresh cherry tints It smells exactly like them,but it&#x27;s really great</li>
            <li> you want a special tint, just go for it!</li>
            <li> I would use it along with other Korean beauty products and get tips and view tutorials on the best way to use these products.</li>
            <li> It dries everything up and wears off easily.</li>
            <li> With a swipe of lip gloss to finish off, this easily lasts for over 4 hours.</li>
            <li> The smell is a strong grape jelly scent.</li>
            <li> the container is super cute, and will fit easily in purses and makeup bags and such, much better than the benefit tints do LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taste like a real cherry, sweet and smell good.</li>
            <li> Shipped and recieved quickly!</li>
            <li> Thanks Cosmetic Love!</li>
            <li> Very Pretty color love it</li>
            <li> Mine came with free samples a sheet mask socks and a pore strip like the color smell like cherry and grapes</li>
            <li> I applied it after I adjust the Skinfood tomato jelly lip balm tint, it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> But overall, I love this tint!!</li>
            <li> but as I understand it they&#x27;re very popular in some Asian countries.</li>
            <li> Nice dark color, good for a grunge or punk look.</li>
            <li> It does dry evenly and stays on most of the day but a fair warning if you have chapped/cracked lips</li>
            <li> Beautiful color as expected.</li>
            <li> And for the product, it&#x27;s love at first use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I love Korean tints, I own a couple different brands</li>
            <li> But I like the color and think it would go great with an dark or evening outfit and would be perfect for everyday wear in the fall.</li>
            <li> Also the color was more of a deep/dark pink to me then a red, but since I don&#x27;t have the shade I&#x27;ve decided to keepit and make the best of it.</li>
            <li> It match with Asian Fair Skin.</li>
            <li> This product lasts for hours and stays just a tad tacky giving your lips a truely berry-kissed look and feel.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s sweet, not saying to eat it</li>
            <li> Love the color, and it shipped earlier than estimated delivery time which is more fantastic.</li>
            <li> I gave up The Body SHop&#x27;s lip and cheek tint years ago, got fed up with benetint&#x27;s overpriced tint, and lucky to have found this.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect deep shade of berry red.</li>
            <li> The tint won&#x27;t smudge or wipe away quickly</li>
            <li> Shipping was rather quick for coming from Korea (about 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> This is very pretty color</li>
            <li> The texture is between water and gel, but is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> As for the product: arrives looking almost black in the tube but the color is amazing- love it.</li>
            <li> the seller (Beauty net korea)  is amazing they gave me samples and a appreciation card</li>
            <li> It makes a nice gloss but don&#x27;t count on this lasting you through the day</li>
            <li> , I thought it&#x27;d be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it gives almost natural look.</li>
            <li> and it smells really nice and also the color is beautiful such a deep red color also</li>
            <li> Which is sad because it is such a lovely red that I&#x27;d hope for a completely perfect product, but perfect is not possible.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, if you even try to smack your lips, it sticks and comes right off.</li>
            <li> One star lost for staying power, it is beautiful on but after 3-4 hours and drinking and eating, the product is left only in bits</li>
            <li> just make sure you exfoliate your lips to get rid of all the dead skin off your lips before applying this, it looks a lot better</li>
            <li> The tint is very long lasting, and it&#x27;s a beautiful burgundy-bloody color.</li>
            <li> Personally, I am a fan of The Balm&#x27;s lipstain as it dries quickly and leaves a nice, natural berry stain.</li>
            <li> I love how it glides on smoothly and tint stays longer on my lips longer than other tints that i tried.  </li>
            <li> at first i was a bit worried about it drying out my lips</li>
            <li> will try more colors next time</li>
            <li> but this was my first Etude one.</li>
            <li> but it is such a good, lasting color.</li>
            <li> I receive a lot of positive complement whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> It has a a funky taste and it does not stay long on your lips otherwise its ok.</li>
            <li> Every thing is nice except the fact that there&#x27;s pretty little product.</li>
            <li> It goes on well and stays put but make sure you let it dry.</li>
            <li> so far.. color last , does not dry my lips and smells good..</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s very watery with a little slip and kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> smell is hard to explain but it smells good In my opinion and it smells pleasant&lt;br</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> The order came quicker than I expected, and they give 3 free samples with it!</li>
            <li> the product itself is very watery even for s liquid tint.</li>
            <li> how much color/darkness you want.</li>
            <li> but I do not think this stain is worth the price so far.</li>
            <li> I just feel the price I payed for this was a bit much for what it offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like to put it on my lip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gel like feel.</li>
            <li> The tint is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> It gives light/medium coverage and can&#x27;t really be built up.</li>
            <li> This tint really has to be built up.</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> Ok first it looks dark,</li>
            <li> My order arrived earlier than expected which is good.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the fruity smell this came with, and the color seemed to work best when applied a few times to get the dark deep red.</li>
            <li> Vampires blood make me think it would be rich red.</li>
            <li> I love this tint goes well with other reds.</li>
            <li> Something to consider is that because it is a tint, it does dry your lips after a while, but that is easily solved with lip balm.</li>
            <li> Although the product goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a horrid smell or taste; it just does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly but didn&#x27;t dry as fast as I thought it should have.</li>
            <li> This is a true vampire red.</li>
            <li> It has such a sweet scent</li>
            <li> it stays fairly well (a little E.L.F makeup must doesn&#x27;t hurt) and only needs reapplication after food/drink.</li>
            <li> lips are healthy and unchapped but this product will make any little creases on your lip really visible and will make your lips chapped.</li>
            <li> It does come with many skin whitening samples which is odd</li>
            <li> I think the only downside is that the color fades quickly, and if you have cracked or chapped lips the color sticks to the cracks and is darker there than the rest of your lips.</li>
            <li> I constantly wear this, my only thing was that for a while I didn&#x27;t like the smell and taste but over all I still love it.</li>
            <li> The color is more of a rosy berry than a red, but I actually prefer that.</li>
            <li> It was a little more creamy, almost like a gloss which was not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> This better, redder, and lasts definitely longer than brands that have been in the market for a long time.</li>
            <li> To apply, I dab a few spots of color on my top and lower lip then rub them together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color and stays a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is mostly good for photo shooting, not long wear or serious wear.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it works on cheeks too but only if you blend it VERY fast, like even faster than the benefit cheek tints, or it will leave the stain marks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little watery but looks fine on the lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very glossy, so you may want a light gloss in clear or a similar color.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Shiping was fast, It actually came alot sooner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lip stains from countless brands, and most have been disappointing.</li>
            <li> The only con is that the formula is very watery</li>
            <li> It has the issues that every other lipstain does but if you&#x27;re dedicated to gunk free red lips you learn to work with it.</li>
            <li> Shipping did take 2-3 weeks due to being an international shipment but it was free</li>
            <li> and it is easily build-able for a very deep red vampire look, or a sweet subtle reddish tint</li>
            <li> I got the vampire red one, and it&#x27;s more of a blood red tint, (brownish red) but still very red, not very pink at all&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> After about 5 mins, there is very little color in my upper lip, but for some reason, my lower lip retains the color better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend for the photo shoots in a quick second, but I would not purchase again in the future if I was looking for this type of red again.</li>
            <li> sure you exfoliate your lips before applying or it&#x27;s going to soak into that dead dry skin on your lips.</li>
            <li> cause it seemed to be one of the problems that some people had and because my lips dry out fast.</li>
            <li> However, this has quickly become my everyday lip product.</li>
            <li> haha, the tint itself is a slightly thicker liquid so it doesn&#x27;t run down when you apply it, it really does stain your lips this dark cherry red, which I think looks stunning.</li>
            <li> color is a really pretty red and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> When I first pulled out the tube, I was surprised because on screen the tint looks dark red</li>
            <li> thought this would be more like a stain but its glossier than any stain I&#x27;ve tried and the staying power is not great.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a thin liquid because you can build up</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known when I saw the brand name (which is known to be a cheap cosmetic brand with horrible quality), but the reviews were so good</li>
            <li> It is sticky while it is drying, but once it&#x27;s dry its actually very soft.</li>
            <li> You can put a little on for a subtle deep red look or you can layer it on for a much more vibrant color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very natural red and long lasting.</li>
            <li> will also most likely wear it casually as well.</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied plus the seller sent a few extra&#x27;s (samples) of other products!!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and sometimes it even gives an ombre effect like in the picture.</li>
            <li> I typically have dry lips and stains are typically not an option for me.</li>
            <li> Since this color is a deep dark red.</li>
            <li> and it stay long.</li>
            <li> The stain also doesn&#x27;t last as long as a expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes good base color when applying lipstick too.</li>
            <li> The negative thing about it is it dry up fast on the lip, and it leave the residual stain that I have to watch out</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant on getting it because I thought it would be way too dark for me as I am very pale white.</li>
            <li> and l find that lip stains tend to dry out your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the product to dry, which can be an inconvenience when you&#x27;re trying to build the color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually limited edition in korea</li>
            <li> As it dries, the color recedes into the inner part of my upper/lower lips, cause my lip to have the &amp;#34;just ate dark cherry candy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s a dark red line there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find affordable and quality lip stains in the US (even some of the more expensive brands leave something to be desired).</li>
            <li> I tried it out a few times but the results were always the same.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I will update when she tries and gives her opinion on it.</li>
            <li> but after only 1 minute of applying it, it dried and faded.</li>
            <li> No real scent to it.</li>
            <li> I then add a few extra to get an even coat.</li>
            <li> It is a little liquidity but lasts soooo long</li>
            <li> a lot of other people said and it is buildable, so you can go darker or lighter.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind trying some other lip stain</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of this product at first.</li>
            <li> Not made with the usual ingredients you&#x27;d find in western cosmetics</li>
            <li> It is quite dark but it it what I expected.</li>
            <li> Or those areas will end up being too dark and look like they are &#x27;bleeding&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Might work better if you use a lip base of some sort.</li>
            <li> but in person it looks black, but</li>
            <li> I know that sounds silly but K-beauty products are different from western products.</li>
            <li> BUT, do not use it if you have ANY cracks on your lips, as it will stick to those only after a short time of wear and make you look weird.</li>
            <li> I got it a few weeks before I was supposed to get it</li>
            <li> few of these ingredients have restrictions in terms of safety in make up, specifically in lip products which are bothersome.</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong, but when  you just put it on you can smell it.</li>
            <li> I mean it looks black</li>
            <li> If you start to move your lips or smack them, the color will immediately run into the creases, and unfortunately for me, onto the inner part of my lips.</li>
            <li> I usually reapply after eating.</li>
            <li> However I notice that the color doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and makes my lips feel a bit weird.</li>
            <li> But hey, at least it smells like candy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got that going for it to say the least.</li>
            <li> you buy, I would recommend that you put on a thick balm/chap-stick(eos</li>
            <li> It seriously makes it look like you ate a berry popsicle.</li>
            <li> Seriously would recommend this tint.</li>
            <li> my review can help other people out before they make the mistake of purchasing crap.</li>
            <li> but i was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Its difficult to apply evenly across your lips, and it always wears off on the inside of my lip.</li>
            <li> product is very thick and gooey, and impossible to put on an even application.</li>
            <li> BUT this smells like kool-aid which isn&#x27;t a bad thing</li>
            <li> To my surprise this one does not taste bad at all..</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> so I can rub off before it get ugly.</li>
            <li> I probably will not buy this product again and will just use it as the base color of my lip balm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t the worst product I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst lip tint I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>

            <li> This better, redder, and lasts definitely longer than brands that have been in the market for a long time. I gave up The Body SHop&#x27;s lip and cheek tint years ago, got fed up with benetint&#x27;s overpriced tint, and lucky to have found this. I&#x27;m sticking to this one.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.... hahaha I always wear this out and feel like a vampire. Since this color is a deep dark red.</li>
            <li> Not 100% what I was looking for in a tint. Although the product goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a horrid smell or taste; it just does not last very long. Also the color was more of a deep/dark pink to me then a red, but since I don&#x27;t have the shade I&#x27;ve decided to keepit and make the best of it.</li>
            <li> thought this would be more like a stain but its glossier than any stain I&#x27;ve tried and the staying power is not great. It makes a nice gloss but don&#x27;t count on this lasting you through the day</li>
            <li> Shipped and recieved quickly! This is my favorite lip product. It&#x27;s a very natural red and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Very nice color. I receive a lot of positive complement whenever I wear it. It match with Asian Fair Skin. The negative thing about it is it dry up fast on the lip, and it leave the residual stain that I have to watch out so I can rub off before it get ugly. I work 12 hr a day, I only have to reapply once and it stay long.</li>
            <li> I love this tint! The order came quicker than I expected, and they give 3 free samples with it! The tint is very long lasting, and it&#x27;s a beautiful burgundy-bloody color. Kinda looks like red wine. Perfect for looking vampy. Every thing is nice except the fact that there&#x27;s pretty little product. The smell is a strong grape jelly scent. Can be pleasant, but it&#x27;s kind of too sweet and it makes me feel like i&#x27;m putting grape juice on my lips- and the color is a bit like grapes too. But overall, I love this tint!! it&#x27;s actually limited edition in korea so I recommend it to everyone. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When I first pulled out the tube, I was surprised because on screen the tint looks dark red but in person it looks black, but when you apply it you get a really nice rich color. It smells pleasantly of grapes, and overall the color payoff is amazing! I think the only downside is that the color fades quickly, and if you have cracked or chapped lips the color sticks to the cracks and is darker there than the rest of your lips.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but the product itself is very watery even for s liquid tint. I still gave it 4 stars bc overall it stays fairly well (a little E.L.F makeup must doesn&#x27;t hurt) and only needs reapplication after food/drink. The color is absolutely gorgeous and I can&#x27;t think of a skin tone it wouldn&#x27;t compliment. It does come with many skin whitening samples which is odd but as I understand it they&#x27;re very popular in some Asian countries. So who doesn&#x27;t like freebies?</li>
            <li> I am in love with this! I was very hesitant on getting it because I thought it would be way too dark for me as I am very pale white. I love that this is a thin liquid because you can build up how much color/darkness you want. It has a bit of a nice sweet taste to it, which is nice. It is sticky while it is drying, but once it&#x27;s dry its actually very soft.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product if you don&#x27;t like the feel of lipstick and stays pretty well throughout the day. It tastes kind of like grape soda, like a lot of other people said and it is buildable, so you can go darker or lighter.</li>
            <li> I typically have dry lips and stains are typically not an option for me. This product lasts for hours and stays just a tad tacky giving your lips a truely berry-kissed look and feel.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip stain I have found since Vincent Longo changed their formula. Great color. Good staying power.</li>
            <li> I love this tint, it&#x27;s the perfect shade of red. It looks like blood and my friends actually complimented me for my vampire like looks. (one even asked if it was actual blood in a vile) I constantly wear this, my only thing was that for a while I didn&#x27;t like the smell and taste but over all I still love it. I&#x27;m used to the smell and taste now. I can&#x27;t wait till I buy another one. It&#x27;s long lasting and sometimes it even gives an ombre effect like in the picture.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t wait to try this on when it arrived at my door. i absolutely love love loooove this product. at first i was a bit worried about it drying out my lips cause it seemed to be one of the problems that some people had and because my lips dry out fast. but that didn&#x27;t happen to me. just make sure you exfoliate your lips to get rid of all the dead skin off your lips before applying this, it looks a lot better i think. then apply lip balm after you apply the tint. color is a really pretty red and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> This lip tint is so cute!! and it smells really nice and also the color is beautiful such a deep red color also the seller (Beauty net korea)  is amazing they gave me samples and a appreciation card but the best part was this wasn&#x27;t suppose to come until March and it came today I&#x27;ll defiantly be buying from this seller again</li>
            <li> Ok first it looks dark, I mean it looks black but once you put it on and let it dry, wonderful color.  perfect for those who do not wanna wear lipstick all day and just want that hint of color, you may have to blot it but the color is rich and red and lovely. Would I tell people about this, hell yes!  The buyer sent it, it was great and I am completely satisfied plus the seller sent a few extra&#x27;s (samples) of other products!!!!  Two Thumbs UP!</li>
            <li> Love this wine color and looks cute BUT this smells like kool-aid which isn&#x27;t a bad thing BUT it also makes it look as though you just drank kool-aid so you might as well have mixed up a &amp;#34;kool-aid mix lip stain&amp;#34; at home.&lt;br /&gt;My lips are healthy and unchapped but this product will make any little creases on your lip really visible and will make your lips chapped. The stain also doesn&#x27;t last as long as a expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t the worst product I&#x27;ve tried but I do not think this stain is worth the price so far. I wouldn&#x27;t mind trying some other lip stain next time.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy, I would recommend that you put on a thick balm/chap-stick(eos lip balm seems to work the best so far) and do a one time application. And of course do not use this stain when your lips are chapped. The stains holds on a lot stronger on the cracked areas of your lips and it will look as tho you are bleeding or as if someone was sucking on your lips for hours. haha.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, if you guys have any suggestions as to how I can fall in love with this product, let me know! :)</li>
            <li> Mine came with free samples a sheet mask socks and a pore strip like the color smell like cherry and grapes</li>
            <li> I got the vampire red one, and it&#x27;s more of a blood red tint, (brownish red) but still very red, not very pink at all&lt;br /&gt;it tastes good, it&#x27;s sweet, not saying to eat it but it&#x27;s good if you want the tint on the inside part of your lips in case you lick it&lt;br /&gt;it works on cheeks too but only if you blend it VERY fast, like even faster than the benefit cheek tints, or it will leave the stain marks&lt;br /&gt;soo this is really great, the applicator is soft and bent at an angle so it&#x27;s easier to apply on lips&lt;br /&gt;also the container is super cute, and will fit easily in purses and makeup bags and such, much better than the benefit tints do LOL</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the fruity smell this came with, and the color seemed to work best when applied a few times to get the dark deep red. However I notice that the color doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and makes my lips feel a bit weird. Which is sad because it is such a lovely red that I&#x27;d hope for a completely perfect product, but perfect is not possible. I just feel the price I payed for this was a bit much for what it offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is mostly good for photo shooting, not long wear or serious wear. I&#x27;d recommend for the photo shoots in a quick second, but I would not purchase again in the future if I was looking for this type of red again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taste like a real cherry, sweet and smell good. I really like to put it on my lip. But it&#x27;s so watery that&#x27;s why I gave 4 star.</li>
            <li> It has a a funky taste and it does not stay long on your lips otherwise its ok.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect deep shade of berry red. It seriously makes it look like you ate a berry popsicle. It makes good base color when applying lipstick too. If you just want to play it up just add some sheer lip gloss. Always add lip balm after applying lip stain it makes it last longer and l find that lip stains tend to dry out your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you exfoliate your lips before applying or it&#x27;s going to soak into that dead dry skin on your lips. It lasts for a pretty long time. I usually reapply after eating. I like this product a lot better than Benefit&#x27;s lip stain. I find that Benefit&#x27;s lip stain tends to fade away from the middle of your lips. This product doesn&#x27;t do it at all and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the color.. Vampires blood make me think it would be rich red. It looks like brownish.</li>
            <li> I like the vampy tone of this tint! It goes on well and stays put but make sure you let it dry.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color as expected. :) I highly recommend this lipstain, plus the brand is a good brand.</li>
            <li> Nice dark color, good for a grunge or punk look. It&#x27;s a little watery but looks fine on the lips.</li>
            <li> Seriously would recommend this tint. i heard good things about it but i was skeptical. but it is such a good, lasting color. and it is easily build-able for a very deep red vampire look, or a sweet subtle reddish tint</li>
            <li> Beautiful beautiful lip tint! One of my favorites! Excellent staying power; it stays for hours, even after you eat.</li>
            <li> My order arrived earlier than expected which is good. And for the product, it&#x27;s love at first use. Thanks Cosmetic Love!</li>
            <li> I love it!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Smelled like cherries when I opened the package. It went on smoothly but didn&#x27;t dry as fast as I thought it should have. It&#x27;s a very gel like feel. Not at all what I expected. It wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for so it went to my sister in law. I will update when she tries and gives her opinion on it.</li>
            <li> I love it , it gives you nice tinted lips without all the smudging and cakey look</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s so hard to find affordable and quality lip stains in the US (even some of the more expensive brands leave something to be desired). So I took a chance on Etude House and I don&#x27;t regret it. Great price and great stain! You can put a little on for a subtle deep red look or you can layer it on for a much more vibrant color. I also put it on underneath lipstick to help cover the fact that my lipstick inevitably wears away. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Shiping was fast, It actually came alot sooner then i thought and it looks absolutely beautiful on your lips giving you a sexy mysterious look :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to question the authenticity of some of these five star reviews. This is probably the worst lip tint I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, but I sorely regret ever buying it. Not only did it take forever to come (which I guess can be forgivable since it&#x27;s coming from Korea), but this isn&#x27;t even lip tint.&lt;br /&gt;The product is very thick and gooey, and impossible to put on an even application. Once it dries, if you even try to smack your lips, it sticks and comes right off. I should&#x27;ve known when I saw the brand name (which is known to be a cheap cosmetic brand with horrible quality), but the reviews were so good, I thought it&#x27;d be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my review can help other people out before they make the mistake of purchasing crap. But hey, at least it smells like candy. It&#x27;s got that going for it to say the least.</li>
            <li> The tint has a cool(cold) feeling on the initial swipe on my lips.  Great brown wine color at first.  As it dries, the color recedes into the inner part of my upper/lower lips, cause my lip to have the &amp;#34;just ate dark cherry candy&amp;#34; look. After about 5 mins, there is very little color in my upper lip, but for some reason, my lower lip retains the color better.  I probably will not buy this product again and will just use it as the base color of my lip balm.  By the way, it smells like grape candy.</li>
            <li> The color was truly amazing but after only 1 minute of applying it, it dried and faded. A lot of it gathered towards the opening of my mouth too. So there&#x27;s a dark red line there.</li>
            <li> I love this tint goes well with other reds. Would suggest it to anyone . Very Pretty color love it</li>
            <li> I love how it glides on smoothly and tint stays longer on my lips longer than other tints that i tried.  I love it gives almost natural look.</li>
            <li> I love the cute packaging and the tube has plenty of product. The tint is very pigmented. It&#x27;s one of my favorite lip products.  Something to consider is that because it is a tint, it does dry your lips after a while, but that is easily solved with lip balm.</li>
            <li> this is the best tint i ever got and the name describes the color perfectly its like blood color&lt;br /&gt;the pigmentation is great it stays perfect&lt;br /&gt;and it has a nice smell as well kinda like candy but some people might not like it ....&lt;br /&gt;the taste is not that good but i dont mind it ^_^&lt;br /&gt;and the seller was so kind i always buy from them its A poly in case your wondering&lt;br /&gt;definitely will try more colors next time</li>
            <li> I bought this lip tint thinking it would be a nice lip stain, but it is not. Its difficult to apply evenly across your lips, and it always wears off on the inside of my lip. If you are going for the &amp;#34;bitten&amp;#34; look I see a lot in Korean or Japanese Beauty blogs, this is great buy! But I like to rouge my lips and this just doesn&#x27;t do the trick. It also takes away a lot of the moisture on your lips. I even tried using it after I primed my lips with lip balm, vaseline, and tinted lip balm. It dries everything up and wears off easily.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip color I wear. The tint won&#x27;t smudge or wipe away quickly and the more often you apply it, the longer it stays.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of this product at first. I&#x27;ve tried many lip stains from countless brands, and most have been disappointing. However, this has quickly become my everyday lip product. The color is more of a rosy berry than a red, but I actually prefer that. The texture is between water and gel, but is not unpleasant. No real scent to it. To apply, I dab a few spots of color on my top and lower lip then rub them together. I then add a few extra to get an even coat. More product can be used for a darker stain. With a swipe of lip gloss to finish off, this easily lasts for over 4 hours. A lighter rosy stain is left when it begins to fade. It can be a bit drying alone, so lip gloss or balm is suggested.</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s perfect for the vampire costume I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I will also most likely wear it casually as well. It is a little liquidity but lasts soooo long so it&#x27;s worth it! The price was great and shipping was incredibly fast and easy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade and great quality. I love Korean tints, I own a couple different brands but this was my first Etude one. The shade is very.... &amp;#34;fresh blood&amp;#34; so the vampire name is perfect. The scent is not strong, but when  you just put it on you can smell it. It smells good though, like grape candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was great! I got it a few weeks before I was supposed to get it so it was a great surprise. There were two samples of another product too which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is very pretty color I was looking for burgundy red tint. I applied it after I adjust the Skinfood tomato jelly lip balm tint, it looked fantastic. Love the color, and it shipped earlier than estimated delivery time which is more fantastic.</li>
            <li> To my surprise this one does not taste bad at all.. not that i eat it on purpose but being a tint and trying to do the ulzzang look this tint is awesome .. i must say is my favorite so far.. color last , does not dry my lips and smells good..</li>
            <li> It gives light/medium coverage and can&#x27;t really be built up. I never used Korean beauty products before, so the consistency is something I&#x27;m not used to: it&#x27;s very watery with a little slip and kind of sticky. Not made with the usual ingredients you&#x27;d find in western cosmetics but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad. It&#x27;s not very glossy, so you may want a light gloss in clear or a similar color. I would use it along with other Korean beauty products and get tips and view tutorials on the best way to use these products. I know that sounds silly but K-beauty products are different from western products. But I like the color and think it would go great with an dark or evening outfit and would be perfect for everyday wear in the fall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color and stays a long time. However you have to make sure that your lips are very smooth with no cracks or peeling skin. Or those areas will end up being too dark and look like they are &#x27;bleeding&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a true vampire red. I use this to achieve the gradient look and I always get compliments on the blend. The brush is also conducive to applying it with the gradient look in mind. This is a great shade!</li>
            <li> This tint really has to be built up. To achieve the color of the actual tube, you have to apply the tint about 2-3 times, however the color payoff is convenient if you want a lighter color. The only con is that the formula is very watery so you do have to wait quite a while for the product to dry, which can be an inconvenience when you&#x27;re trying to build the color. This tint is great for the popular &amp;#34;gradient&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this tint.  It was a little more creamy, almost like a gloss which was not what I was expecting.  It does dry evenly and stays on most of the day but a fair warning if you have chapped/cracked lips you may not want to use tint as it will seep into cracks and make them more noticeable.  I will definitely buy another once I run out of this one.</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday, &amp; I&#x27;ve got to say that I love it! Love the color and how it smells:)</li>
            <li> It is quite dark but it it what I expected. It fades throughout the day and needs to be touched up occasionally. Overall, I am content with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great color, decent wear time</li>
            <li> Ingredients: WATER, GLYCERIN, GLYCERYL POLYMETHACRYLATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL,&lt;br /&gt;TREHALOSE, CARBOMER, TROMETHAMINE, RED 33 (CI 17200), GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRUS GRANDIS&lt;br /&gt;(GRAPEFRUIT) PEEL EXTRACT, SAPINDUS TRIFOLIATUS FRUIT EXTRACT, OPUNTIA COCCINELLIFERA FRUIT EXTRACT, ORANGE 4 (CI 15510), BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PUNICA GRANATUM EXTRACT, CI 16255, FRAGRANCE, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT, BLUE 1 (CI 42090), SORBITOL, BAMBUSA&lt;br /&gt;VULGARIS LEAF/STEM EXTRACT&lt;br /&gt;A few of these ingredients have restrictions in terms of safety in make up, specifically in lip products which are bothersome. But most make up does. As for the product: arrives looking almost black in the tube but the color is amazing- love it. BUT, do not use it if you have ANY cracks on your lips, as it will stick to those only after a short time of wear and make you look weird. Might work better if you use a lip base of some sort. Shipping was rather quick for coming from Korea (about 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> Love this lip tint. It is an awesome colour has a nice scent and feels nice going on . It works perfectly for an ombre lip look and it is not drying like some lip stains can be.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and the color is beautiful</li>
            <li> Great ip tint and it seems like blood, but I love it and it smells great--cherry taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a special tint, just go for it!</li>
            <li> as any tints out there, they are bound to fade away or rubs off after a short while,&lt;br /&gt;The smell is hard to explain but it smells good In my opinion and it smells pleasant&lt;br /&gt; If you have any fresh cherry tints It smells exactly like them,but it&#x27;s really great i really like it. :33</li>
            <li> Shipping did take 2-3 weeks due to being an international shipment but it was free s/h so I&#x27;m not complaining! The product itself was beautiful! It has such a sweet scent sometimes I put it on to smell it haha, the tint itself is a slightly thicker liquid so it doesn&#x27;t run down when you apply it, it really does stain your lips this dark cherry red, which I think looks stunning. One star lost for staying power, it is beautiful on but after 3-4 hours and drinking and eating, the product is left only in bits so I need to carry it around to reapply throughout the day. But would purchase again!</li>
