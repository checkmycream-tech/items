Thank you for such a wonderful product! I will definitely be getting the foot cream to try next month!!</li>
            <li> Received product but looked to be half empty when held up to the light wasn&#x27;t sealed.</li>
            <li> Because I have used this company&#x27;s face and neck creams and have been very happy with those products, I was hoping for similar results with the hand cream. The hand cream is only mediocre.  Nothing special about this hand cream, I regret to say</li>
            <li> I love it! I love the smell and how fast is absorbed into the skin. The price is also affordable.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> i purchase this item before. its not the same</li>

            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, PRICE AND TIMELY DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I love it. Definetely recommend it. I would love to buy more</li>
            <li> I have never found a better cream on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;It is high quality and lives up to the Luxury name in the title.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using this cream, I have not used my prescription medicine for psoriasis on my hands.</li>
            <li> The luxury of this hand cream is that it goes on easily, is not messy, absorbs quickly, softens the skin, and has a pleasant subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I love this lotion!  We will continue to use it as long as we can find it!</li>
            <li> I love the Dead Sea Products and unfortunately was introduced to them by one of the overbearing sales women at a kiosk in the mall.  I think you all know what I am talking about.  They are the women that can sell ice to someone who lives on a glacier.  Well, I was weak, weak, weak and ended up buying a few products at a cost that I still cannot believe I paid.&lt;br /&gt;I used the products, but knew I was never going to spend that kind of money again on these products no matter how good they were.&lt;br /&gt;Then I found everything I used and more on Amazon.  What a lifesaver.  I have not found one of their products that I don&#x27;t like and the dealers at Amazon make it possible to use them and try new ones.&lt;br /&gt;The hand cream is amazing.  It has a slight fragrance - not too much since I loathe heavy perfume smells. It makes your skin soft and has a nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is light and softens hands without greasiness.  It has a light, pleasant fragrance.  Expensive but unlike other hand lotions.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this hand cream to me after she has used it for a while.  The cream smell great!  It gets absorbed quickly so no greasy feeling.  Will definitely purchase it again. Like what other reviewers mentioned, buying from Amazon is a lot cheaper comparing to buying it from the retails store.  I am glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> I love the product! I have extremely dry hands, and this cream doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate the broken skin and it leaves my hands feeling silky.Â </li>
            <li> This was our first time using this product.  It&#x27;s top drawer. My wife gave it her stamp of approval.  Good job Premier!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrancw, wonderful moisturizing! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  Like silk, smells good and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Makes your hands silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before, good quality - though not my favorite. I do not like the smell, as it is a bit sweet others than that it is great value for your money</li>
            <li> This hand cream makes your hands feel so good. It&#x27;s not greasy like some creams. This is second time I order and I&#x27;m sure I will order more.</li>
