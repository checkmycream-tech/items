            <li> Very small.  Size is about equal to a size 2</li>
            <li> this garment is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we shall see. She&#x27;s thin so it should fit her. It&#x27;s very pretty and she will look beautiful in it</li>

            <li> Tops are pretty, light and very feminine...I ordered brown and green. Thank goodness I read the reviews before I ordered.  I am 5&#x27;02&amp;#34;, 119 lbs. and generally wear a Petite Small.  Due to previous comments about sizing, I ordered them in XL.  They fit nicely, other than slightly snug around my chest - I am a bit chesty for my size (wear 34D).  Hope this helps out when ordering.</li>
