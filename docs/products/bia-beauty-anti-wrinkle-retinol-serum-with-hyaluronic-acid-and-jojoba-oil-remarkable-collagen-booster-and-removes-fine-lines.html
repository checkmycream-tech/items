            <li>I based my review on my own experience.</li>
            <li>All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I also am very happy that this product is 98% Natural and 72% Organic.</li>
            <li>It arrived with a tamper-proof seal, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>This product goes on non greasy and makes my skin feel and look healthy</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL ORDER AGAIN.....</li>
            <li>AND LOOKS LOOKS BRIGHTER AND BETTER THAN BEFORE...</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I really do love how this serum feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pure , and it smells good.</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say I was very nervous about receiving this item since it comes in a glass bottle, but to my surprise, it was packaged perfectly!  </li>
            <li>product is amazing she&#x27;ve used it only a week and see a great difference.</li>
            <li>but I do hope that it will help keep away any wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
            <li>It comes in an amber glass dropper bottle which is also important.</li>
            <li>so you can get precisely the amount of serum you need without wasting it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You do not need to use a lot of this at a time, so the dropper that is included is perfect for getting out just a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic, it does spread really easy and absorbs super quick with no residue or greasiness.</li>
            <li>Even though this is a pretty strong retinol serum, I have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>My skin texture has smoothed out and my skin feels super hydrated in the morning after using it the night before.</li>
            <li>Did not notice any significant change in the disappearance of fine lines, but it might take a little more time (or perhaps a lot more time depending on your wrinkles ;) ).</li>
            <li>I am amazed by the quick results over a couple of weeks and how much smoother and clean my skin looks.</li>
            <li>The serum worked and felt far better with the use of a toner (apply before serum) and night cream (apply after serum).</li>
            <li>(it looks a little homemade and kind of cheap)</li>
            <li>I had to try the product first before I made a post.  </li>
            <li>first day when i received the product, i applied it to my face to test the product, it absorbs very fast and i can feel my skin tone is much brighter after using this serum.</li>
            <li>It also helps with acne and over time, will reduce the appearance of fine lines, especially around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty craze amaze, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has Aloe, which we all know, is very soothing for the skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it in an upward motion, being very cautious of the under-eye area.</li>
            <li>I  finish the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I chose this retinol serum because of the high retinol content.  </li>
            <li>I will say it is gentle because I do have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>the serum twice a day to clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use this twice a day on a clean, dry face and neck!  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Retinol Serum to use with my new derma roller.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice, dark glass bottle which is important because things like this can go bad if light goes through the bottle.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.  </li>
            <li>and I was nervous to use as I have sensitive skin, but thankfully I have not had any type of reaction to this.  </li>
            <li>Although afterwards it did make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is softer, the pores are smaller, and the blemishes are becoming less visible.  </li>
            <li>First of all, one thing that makes this stand out from other Retinol Serums is that it is 2.5% Retinol.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell and comes with a dropper and is thick enough that won&#x27;t run when you apply it.</li>
            <li>I think the main reason is that this serum contains other ingredients others were lacking.</li>
            <li>At first, I was a little hesitant, because Retinol can make your face red after you use it, but since I have tried others, I decided to go for the big plunge.</li>
            <li>I tried it without these as well, but my face felt too tight, as if the serum was soaked up by the skin too fast.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have not been using this for long</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a little time to see if there would be any results good or bad.  </li>
            <li> I have other, similar products come without this feature</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because I am waiting to see some long term results and will post comments again!</li>
            <li> Dark glass protects the ingredients from being penetrated by harmful light which can cause the ingredients to break down, become rancid and at the very least, drastically reduces the shelf life of the product.</li>
            <li> but it left a slight sticky feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this Serum for a little over a week</li>
            <li> Just as I expected it worked well.  </li>
            <li> It took just a few drops, so this bottle will last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> With other serums I have noticed a reduction in my rosacea or a tightening of pores; not he case here.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that my face didn&#x27;t turn as red as a beet, but also very relieved.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I was a little turned off by the lable when I got it</li>
            <li> This is a stronger strength than others I have tried, they usually come in 2%.</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing how it looks and feels in a few months!</li>
            <li> The serum is thick and it does tighten your face.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that you get from other brands.</li>

            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that you get from other brands. It feels soothing when being applied. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.  ** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> This product is working its too early to say its excellent but for now it good result.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice daily for over a week. While my skin feels moisturized I have noticed no visible difference in the appearance of my skin. With other serums I have noticed a reduction in my rosacea or a tightening of pores; not he case here. I will say it is gentle because I do have sensitive skin...I just do not think Retinol is the answer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try and test this product at a reduced cost for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This product goes on non greasy and makes my skin feel and look healthy</li>
            <li> I had to try the product first before I made a post.  I wanted to wait a little time to see if there would be any results good or bad.  I didn&#x27;t experience any changes immediately but I have been using this product for close to 3 weeks and at this point I do see and feel the difference in my skin.  My face is softer, the pores are smaller, and the blemishes are becoming less visible.  I think with constant use of this product I will receive the results that I am looking for.  I will edit my comments if anything changes with my skin. But for now I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful product</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this 2.5% Retinol Serum by Bia Beauty Care.  It arrived with a tamper-proof seal, which is very important to me.

I was shocked that my face didn&#x27;t turn as red as a beet, but also very relieved.  I think the main reason is that this serum contains other ingredients others were lacking. It has Aloe, which we all know, is very soothing for the skin. This serum will help by shrinking your pores, smoothing skin and making the skin tone even. It also helps with acne and over time, will reduce the appearance of fine lines, especially around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply the serum twice a day to clean, dry skin.

            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL ORDER AGAIN.....MY SKIN DRINKS THIS UP AND LOOKS LOOKS BRIGHTER AND BETTER THAN BEFORE...WILL TELL FRIENDS ABOUT THIS.</li>
            <li> I  finish the whole bottle. My face feels smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Retinol is just a miracle agent to me, I am always on the lookout for  good retinol product. I did order this one at a great deal to try it and share my honest opinion. This product is fantastic, it does spread really easy and absorbs super quick with no residue or greasiness. I am amazed by the quick results over a couple of weeks and how much smoother and clean my skin looks. This product combines the retinol with the hyaluronic acid and vitamin e so it has a punch and works great! Doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell and comes with a dropper and is thick enough that won&#x27;t run when you apply it. This is an A ++ product to me!</li>
            <li> It made me break out so I quit using it</li>
            <li> I bought it for 40s my wife.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing she&#x27;ve used it only a week and see a great difference.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works!!! Will definitely buy this again!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a week and can tell a difference.  I use it twice a day.  I have noticed the tightening in my face and the lines around my mouth aren&#x27;t as noticible .  The serum is thick and it does tighten your face.  I will be purchasing this item again</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to my pricey department store brand and thought I would give this serum a try. My skin feels fabulous and looks great!! I look forward to seeing how it looks and feels in a few months!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.  First off, I have to say I was very nervous about receiving this item since it comes in a glass bottle, but to my surprise, it was packaged perfectly!  I have only been using this Serum for a little over a week and I was nervous to use as I have sensitive skin, but thankfully I have not had any type of reaction to this.  I have already begun to see some noticeable decrease in some red blemishes on my face and a bit of tightening around my eyes!  I use this twice a day on a clean, dry face and neck!  I gave this four stars because I am waiting to see some long term results and will post comments again!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a week and a half. Did not notice any significant change in the disappearance of fine lines, but it might take a little more time (or perhaps a lot more time depending on your wrinkles ;) ). What I did notice was a firmer skin. The serum worked and felt far better with the use of a toner (apply before serum) and night cream (apply after serum). I tried it without these as well, but my face felt too tight, as if the serum was soaked up by the skin too fast. When using toner/cream the serum last longer but it left a slight sticky feeling on my skin. Although afterwards it did make my skin feel soft. The serum is a thicker substance and one drop was enough for my face (extra one for neck and décolleté).&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to be an organic herbal infusion - so lots of herbal goodies added to the retinol and vitamin E. (including  jojoba oil/green tea/aloe/witch hazel).&lt;br /&gt;** Received product at discounted price in return for HONEST opinion. Not instructed as to what to write or what rating to give, review 100% my own**</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase. I purchased the Retinol Serum to use with my new derma roller. I chose this retinol serum because of the high retinol content.  I thought it this didn&#x27;t work, nothing would. Just as I expected it worked well.  My face looks brighter and softer.  It took just a few drops, so this bottle will last quite awhile.  I would suggest this to anyone that is being to show signs of age, and to continue to use it faithfully as I intend on doing.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced price in return for an honest and unbiased review. I based my review on my own experience.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;m on my second bottle currently and it has become a staple in my beauty routine. I was a little turned off by the lable when I got it (it looks a little homemade and kind of cheap) but it&#x27;s now my favorite serum! My skin texture has smoothed out and my skin feels super hydrated in the morning after using it the night before. It also helps keep my acne in check without drying out my skin. It&#x27;s pretty craze amaze, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 25 and only just starting to use anti-aging products. Even though this is a pretty strong retinol serum, I have not had any problems with it. It does not irritate my skin and does not make it red which can sometimes happen with retinol products. I really do love how this serum feels on my skin. You do not need to use a lot of this at a time, so the dropper that is included is perfect for getting out just a few drops at a time. It comes in a nice, dark glass bottle which is important because things like this can go bad if light goes through the bottle. I have not been using this for long but I do hope that it will help keep away any wrinkles or fine lines. So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review.
