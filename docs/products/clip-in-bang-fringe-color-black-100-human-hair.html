            <li> The price was low for the product quality which I was pleasantly surprised .</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that it is noticeable from the top, and that it needs to be thinned a little (at least for me) because it will look a little odd if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> too stiff/too short.these bangs were a total let down when i pulled&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after a few extra things done to it</li>
            <li> However, they are cut really badly, not straight at all.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cash.</li>
            <li> The wig also is cut for a thin long face, it does not fit well on my face.</li>
            <li> There are weird chunks of hair in the middle of the fringe that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li> it was hard to clip in</li>
            <li> I MEAN IT-</li>
            <li> , I was so disappointed ,i would have sent it back</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but the hair on the sides are so thin</li>
            <li> The hair looked to fake.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY UGLY CRAP-</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> I HATE</li>

    <ol>
            <li> too stiff/too short.these bangs were a total let down when i pulled&lt;br /&gt; them out of the it&#x27;s packaging.i just did not like the way they were sewn onto the circular mesh material.</li>
            <li> Easy clip on bangs! You can see it from  The top so you have to wear a headband or bandana over it but it looks great! Got a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really pleased with these bangs. The hair looked to fake.</li>
            <li> Looks great, easy to use a little long but nothing that couldn&#x27;t be trimmed</li>
            <li> This product came in a day before it was supposed to come in. The hair is very smooth and the clips are rather easy to hide with your hair. It&#x27;s also very comfortable.</li>
            <li> and good price when compared to other options. I would recommend to anyone. Real hair for sure that curls and straightens/</li>
            <li> Why they cut the bang so short I don&#x27;t know, but the hair on the sides are so thin , I was so disappointed ,i would have sent it back but it just wasn&#x27;t worth spending the money , to do that  ,Do you think they already know this ?My guess is YES !!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as good as in the video.  You can definitely see you have a bang hair piece on.  You probably have to wear a headband to cover the seam.</li>
            <li> Crap. Not worth the cash.</li>
            <li> The product was just okay it was hard to clip in but after a few extra things done to it I got it to work</li>
            <li> awesome bang extension looks great with everything</li>
            <li> Came out of packaging all warped and cheap looking and won&#x27;t straighten with iron. I never wore it. Definitely doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, more like a halloween wig.</li>
            <li> The price was low for the product quality which I was pleasantly surprised .</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous accessory to add to any style. It looks very much like it does in the picture and gives style a new fullness. Very easy to use and style. Very realistic looking to! I am about to order another one.</li>
            <li> It did not look as good as the picture, so I had to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;That is all I can tell</li>
            <li> I really liked this extension, it came in a nice black color, the hair is nice and smooth and it looks pretty cool, I straightened and nothing happened to it, it&#x27;s worth the price, which is very cheap compared to others. The shipping was fast and arrived way before:).</li>
            <li> It was ok I thought it was fuller like in the picture but overall its nice I will probaly purchase another one in the future I will recommend to some one its very conveinuent</li>
            <li> TOTALLY UGLY CRAP-I HATE IT DON&#x27;T BUY IT! I MEAN IT-if i could i would return it ASAP plus the picture completly lies of how it looks.</li>
            <li> The wig does look real but does not feel secure. The wig also is cut for a thin long face, it does not fit well on my face.</li>
            <li> Product came in hand and easy to use. Looks and feel natural.  Loved it!!!!!!!! Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick style with bang.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look like the picture, looked old and bang was already bent and shooter than the picture shows. Definitely wont buy anymore.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get some clip in bangs that I could style with my flat iron and I thought these would fit the bill. However, they are cut really badly, not straight at all. There are weird chunks of hair in the middle of the fringe that shouldn&#x27;t be there. Plus, the webbing that the hair is on it a bizarre shape with a VERY obvious edge. Be prepared to cover the whole top of your head if you want it to even remotely look like your own hair. On top of all that, the clips that you use to attach it to your own hair are small and do not clip easily. I haven&#x27;t even worn mine out yet and one of the clips is coming apart from the webbing.</li>
            <li> to much shine its  like doll hair ended up throwing it away</li>
            <li> I love these! They came quickly, and are very real looking and very thick. Not at all shiny like I thought they moght be. I have Indian hair and the bangs blend with my hair very well. My only qualm is that it is noticeable from the top, and that it needs to be thinned a little (at least for me) because it will look a little odd if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> People thought they were real bangs! super realistic and easy to wear</li>
