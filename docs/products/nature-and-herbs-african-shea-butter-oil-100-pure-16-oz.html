            <li>/&gt;The oil is also great if you want to add a roll on fragrance oil over certain areas</li>
            <li>More like cooking oil.</li>
            <li>I liked it best when applied to wet skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many shea butters and you cannot beat this.</li>

            <li>But it is an okay product.</li>
            <li>Works for massage oil, but have had better at masseuse.</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with many products.  </li>
            <li>I love this Shea butter oil 4 my body.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I will be buying some more from this company soon.</li>
            <li>I alawys have a stock of this oil.i found  the oil better than the butter for the body.i</li>
            <li>you get some more of this</li>
            <li>Love this liquid form of shea butter.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS, I use it on my skin, face, and hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love Shea Butter and to be able to find it in liquid form is even better.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased to try this liquid Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and it is lovely.</li>
            <li>My legs look and feel much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many types of moisturizers ranging from drug store to high-end department store brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from combination skin leaning more towards oily.</li>
            <li>Impressed, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it was way cheaper than my last moisturizer (Caudalie in case you were wondering).</li>
            <li>Great product, thanks</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered this oil.</li>
            <li>It is better than ANY lotion I have tried.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this oil for the summer time.  </li>
            <li>When I found this oil, I loved it right away.</li>
            <li>AGAIN.THIS PRODUCT MAKES YOUR SKIN VERY SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li>THe bottle top on the shea oil comes with scotch tape and holds pretty good.</li>
            <li>Nice product, does stay solid unless it&#x27;s very warm in your soaping studio</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair and on my skin great great product I dont remeber the last time I was so soft!!!</li>
            <li>It smells great, has a good consistency and does not weight down my hair...</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s best to use it up quicker than your other skin/hair</li>
            <li>Shea butter is the best for skin, other lotions and moisturizers that contain shea are not.</li>
            <li>Love this oil works great &amp; has lasting moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li>And it is easily absorbed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to apply</li>
            <li>but this one is just easy to put on.</li>
            <li>I make my own body care items at home, and was delighted when I added African Shea Butter Oil to a body scrub.  </li>
            <li>Still works fine though.</li>
            <li>Works up fine and does not gum up or feel to oily upon use.</li>
            <li>It has done wonders for my incredible dry skin.</li>
            <li>I got the item fairly quickly and love to use it on my skin.</li>
            <li>The oil has a very (nice) light nutty smell, but I can&#x27;t barely detect it anyway.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s literally &amp;#34;baby-bottom&amp;#34; smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and the relief from itching, flaking and caking is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It kept their skin smooth all day, even after a rigorous day at school.  </li>
            <li>My skin is always so incredibly smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>Like how it makes my skin feel smooth all day</li>
            <li>The oil is great for everything human; that includes your body and hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great African Shea Butter Oil...</li>
            <li>Love the feel and easiness of using the Shea Butter Oil to make my body cream and also to use it right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>, I clean after it seems to have absorbed mostly and been a while.</li>
            <li>It comes out easy, rubs on smoothly, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>however the smell can be really strong, a bit like roasted nuts and rubber gum eraser, not that pleasant, but adding some essential oils might help.</li>
            <li>16oz bottle is the best value and can be put up into small 1 oz plastic bottles with a spout.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>So, I switched to this Shea Oil instead and now the lipbalms are super smooth and stay that way.  </li>
            <li>It is great dry winter air and heat.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t soak into my skin, very greasy, my dog did like licking my face because she loved the taste.</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love and had to buy my own.  </li>
            <li>THe pure shea butter is authentic.</li>
            <li>The best find for very dry skin when added to the cheapest of over the counter lotions, Make sure it is well mixed.</li>
            <li>Many times I get way too much and the container gets all oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it because the consistency is much easier to work wirh</li>
            <li>So much faster than lotion and moisturizes better than any lotion ive ever tried (thats a lot).  </li>
            <li>it gets better, I have not broken out, yet.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made it softer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Emollient, moisturizing, absorbs quickly into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after using this light, natural oil.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to apply and it makes my hair and skin really soft.</li>
            <li>I have found my natural roots cannot tolerate the same products my relaxer hair could and from reading the websites on natural hair, this is one of the best products to use.  </li>
            <li>I have had psoriasis most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>it looks more clear (oily) in the picture than what I got.</li>
            <li>The oil is nice because when I don&#x27;t have time to melt the regular Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>This is different than other shea butter oils I have purchased but this one works the best among all the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice sheen to my dark skin &amp; keeps it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>My latest shipment had a different top then normal.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after the shower when I&#x27;m still damp</li>
            <li>I use it as a hair conditioner and rub it all over my body right when I shut the water from my shower off.  </li>
            <li>I use this oil right out of the shower</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for price, Thanks</li>
            <li>Will certainly be ordering again when I run out which wont be for a while!</li>
            <li>This really makes your skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is due to the fact that I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed with a product enough to give a decent review, until I came upon this product....</li>
            <li>and I love to add Shea Butter, but after several months it starts to &#x27;crystalize&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it is lighter than the solid shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and I have definitely noticed a change in my complexion for the better.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it is more of a packaging concern.</li>
            <li>This is healing and very soothing!</li>
            <li>I love the African Shea Butter Oil.</li>
            <li>I use regular Shea butter as well, but I love the oil for my skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I like it even better than the Shea Butter solid.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll definitely order more from this site again.</li>
            <li>When I run out I will be back to buy some more.</li>
            <li>i have a super dry skin but this oil makes my skin feel very soft and nice and does not leave a oily feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I think it would be better to get the 8 oz is because shea butter (according to my research) doesn&#x27;t have a long shelf life.</li>
            <li>surprisingly, it melted into my skin and didn&#x27;t make me look like a oil slick at all.</li>
            <li>I had previously bought a smaller bottle of this product which turned out to be really good with no bad smell</li>
            <li>I cook with pure coconut oil &amp; when it liquefy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>100% pure ...</li>
            <li>Try the pure and you will notice the difference in the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>It says PURE shea oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fifty-thirteen and many of my contempories have very dry skin problems, but this is the answer for me.</li>
            <li>natural\\&quot; much much easier.</li>
            <li>It really had no smell to it.</li>
            <li>Lotion doesn&#x27;t help the itching and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, I can&#x27;t use fancy scented soaps, the whole said affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really have not tried the Shea oil yet.</li>
            <li>I really felt scammed &amp; got a refund.  </li>
            <li>If you want to order the real thing I suggest ordering from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>Initially when I started to use this product I was more than satisfied however after several uses it starting to smell greasy/oily/fishy</li>
            <li>I took this on vacation with me and it really helped sooth my skin after being out in the sun all day.</li>
            <li>real smell.</li>
            <li>However it is very oily</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and really helped with my combination oily/dry skin.</li>
            <li>your debating whether to get the 16  oz one or the 8 oz one, I really have to say that the 8 oz one would probably be plenty.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I was using baby oil until I found out that it is petroleum based, which really knocked me for a loop.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I put some of the oil on to help with the skin on his face which really worked.  </li>
            <li>I sure hope there is not any other oil than 100% pure Shea butter oil, it has changed.</li>
            <li>but you can blend it with other products for get better the fragance.</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t really like the smell although it&#x27;s not a bad smell and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I will use this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I used it with 100% Pure Jojoba Oil and it made my hair very soft and wavy</li>
            <li>I have very mild eczema and the skin of my calves is very dry in particular.</li>
            <li>After I shampoo, apply conditioner and dry my hair, I then put a drop in my hand, rub my hands together, and smooth it lightly over and under my rather long hair.  </li>
            <li>Previously I could just pop the top and squeeze out whatever amount I needed</li>
            <li>It has a slight nutty smell which is okay</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and you don&#x27;t need much, but it&#x27;s just so much better than the hair grease</li>
            <li>It left my skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s main ingredient was Shea butter</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a big towel to cover entire pillow and don&#x27;t get it on your hands as you could stain your sheets.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for something to keep your skin moisturized but not shiny, hair vibrant but not greasy, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I order it repeatedly and notice the difference when I go back to more traditional moisturizers (and I&#x27;ve tried everything).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend subbing when you can.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone use it.</li>
            <li>Alive and Aware Natural Health, is quick on delivery, but very short on what it is they actually sent you so quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the product; added a little bergamont oil to enhance the fragrance.</li>
            <li>over all a great product for people with dry skin better than a lot of expensive lotions!</li>
            <li>I even have my son hooked after working in the dirt or concrete or whatever he says it saves his skin on his hands.</li>
            <li>My skin loves this stuff and it really helps to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>Not the light oil I expected and have bought in beauty stores.</li>
            <li>Its very thick and heavy and the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but use lightly</li>
            <li>I love that I can order it in a bigger bottle and only pay a little bit more (compared to 2 smaller bottles).</li>
            <li>Later that evening his back felt smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This stuff had not broken me out so far and it has far exceeded all expectations.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>At first I was using it for my face, but I found that I began to break out after two weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li>I FINALLY FOUND A PRODUCT THAT NOT ONLY ELIMINATES THEM, BUT ALSO MAKES MY SKIN SOFT AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li>Apply (out of the shower on your wet scalp,) a good size portion into your wet hands and massage deeply into your scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>Ok- forget all the fancy dyes, and colors, it&#x27;s not sexy, but this WORKS.  </li>
            <li>If the first part of my review wasn&#x27;t clear enough..</li>
            <li>It requires daily use but symptoms will be greatly reduced; no to very little itching &amp; minimal redness.</li>
            <li>I received these oil today (Dec 8th) in perfect conditions and is not a super oily oil, I mean it doesn&#x27;t leaves oily skin, it absorbs very fast; the smeel is not very nice</li>
            <li>A little product applied over moist skin keeps my skin supple and free of&lt;br /&gt;irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instant shine, manageability, and even some waves in my rather straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Despite some mixed reviews on this product, It IS real shea butter oil with no</li>
            <li>I like this product, I use it on my hair because am going natural with my hair.</li>
            <li>I like Shea in this form as it is very versitile, I prefer it in liquid form, especially in the Winter months.</li>
            <li>and now I have to take the lid off completely and have no control over the amount that comes out.</li>
            <li>, my skin is soo soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For a real treat, buy natural shea butter and mix in the shea butter oil (more oil to thin shea butter out then stir together.)</li>
            <li>I also use it for massage oil it leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>and I have to be very selective with the products I buy and choose organics as much as possible.</li>
            <li>I had tried the pure shea butter, but it is too heavy, this oil is just right.  </li>
            <li>I was able to ascertain it&#x27;s shea butter because I have the raw shea butter that is solid in a can.</li>
            <li>I have bought this in the past and am back now to buy some more</li>
            <li>100% pure African Shea Butter Oil with all its natural nutrients, especially vitamins A and E.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>Is this normal or is there actually an added oil????</li>
            <li>it will stain clothes, a little shout or baby powder takes carr of quickly tho.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair and this product while much heavier than the coconut oil i was using, has and is moisturizing my very dry scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is clearer and brighter, and my thick coarse hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li>Compared to other natural butters or oils, African Shea Butter Oil far more of the vitamins and other valuable phytonutrients essential for healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing major</li>
            <li>deep mouisturizing .. soft skin ,, silky shiny hair !</li>
            <li>Compounded by melasma which caused major discoloration on my cheeks, I&#x27;ve had to use heavier foundation &amp; concealer to cover my skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend your African Shea Butter Oil to anyone seeking the ultimate skin care</li>
            <li>After two weeks the flaking has completely ceased and the itching is almost gone entirely.</li>
            <li>Natural oil will harden &amp; become solid if kept at a temperature below 74 degrees.  </li>
            <li>In my daily job I have direct contact with people all the time</li>
            <li>and I am constantly being complemented on how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>It keeps my normally dry and scaly legs very moisturized for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>No more, so many other moisturizers wear off and this stuff lasts.</li>
            <li>I did buy the 16 oz one and we&#x27;re still not half way thru it despite 4 people using it daily for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am planning to keep using it like this for another couple weeks and then try every other day - it is a bit messy and inconvenient, but so far I am very happy with the outcome!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m lucky enough to have skin that hardly ever breaks out, I had a feeling</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not tight and dry anymore, and believe me I used everything to combat the dryness,coconut oil, olive oil, argan oil. .</li>
            <li>I personally use it after my shower, while I&#x27;m still wet, let it absorb a bit (brush my teeth), then gently towel dry.  </li>
            <li>this oil penetrates the scalp leaving the scalp and hair moisturized and soft, you can also add it to any hair dress when you want that creamy feel when the hair is very dry, use it for bed</li>
            <li>I use it on my little 2 year old hair and on mines and it makes your hair and body so soft.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The oil is also great if you want to add a roll on fragrance oil over certain areas</li>
            <li> More like cooking oil.</li>
            <li> I liked it best when applied to wet skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shea butters and you cannot beat this.</li>

            <li> Lovely.  </li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> Four more words to</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> i love it :)</li>

            <li> But it is an okay product.</li>
            <li> Works for massage oil, but have had better at masseuse.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with many products.  </li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter oil 4 my body.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I will be buying some more from this company soon.</li>
            <li> I alawys have a stock of this oil.i found  the oil better than the butter for the body.i</li>
            <li> you get some more of this</li>
            <li> Love this liquid form of shea butter.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, I use it on my skin, face, and hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love Shea Butter and to be able to find it in liquid form is even better.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased to try this liquid Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> and it is lovely.</li>
            <li> My legs look and feel much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many types of moisturizers ranging from drug store to high-end department store brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from combination skin leaning more towards oily.</li>
            <li> Impressed, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it was way cheaper than my last moisturizer (Caudalie in case you were wondering).</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this oil.</li>
            <li> It is better than ANY lotion I have tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil for the summer time.  </li>
            <li> When I found this oil, I loved it right away.</li>
            <li> AGAIN.THIS PRODUCT MAKES YOUR SKIN VERY SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li> THe bottle top on the shea oil comes with scotch tape and holds pretty good.</li>
            <li> Nice product, does stay solid unless it&#x27;s very warm in your soaping studio</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair and on my skin great great product I dont remeber the last time I was so soft!!!</li>
            <li> It smells great, has a good consistency and does not weight down my hair...</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s best to use it up quicker than your other skin/hair</li>
            <li> Shea butter is the best for skin, other lotions and moisturizers that contain shea are not.</li>
            <li> Love this oil works great &amp; has lasting moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li> And it is easily absorbed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to apply</li>
            <li> but this one is just easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I make my own body care items at home, and was delighted when I added African Shea Butter Oil to a body scrub.  </li>
            <li> Still works fine though.</li>
            <li> Works up fine and does not gum up or feel to oily upon use.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my incredible dry skin.</li>
            <li> I got the item fairly quickly and love to use it on my skin.</li>
            <li> The oil has a very (nice) light nutty smell, but I can&#x27;t barely detect it anyway.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s literally &amp;#34;baby-bottom&amp;#34; smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smooth and the relief from itching, flaking and caking is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It kept their skin smooth all day, even after a rigorous day at school.  </li>
            <li> My skin is always so incredibly smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> Like how it makes my skin feel smooth all day</li>
            <li> The oil is great for everything human; that includes your body and hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great African Shea Butter Oil...</li>
            <li> Love the feel and easiness of using the Shea Butter Oil to make my body cream and also to use it right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> , I clean after it seems to have absorbed mostly and been a while.</li>
            <li> It comes out easy, rubs on smoothly, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> however the smell can be really strong, a bit like roasted nuts and rubber gum eraser, not that pleasant, but adding some essential oils might help.</li>
            <li> 16oz bottle is the best value and can be put up into small 1 oz plastic bottles with a spout.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li> So, I switched to this Shea Oil instead and now the lipbalms are super smooth and stay that way.  </li>
            <li> It is great dry winter air and heat.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t soak into my skin, very greasy, my dog did like licking my face because she loved the taste.</li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love and had to buy my own.  </li>
            <li> THe pure shea butter is authentic.</li>
            <li> The best find for very dry skin when added to the cheapest of over the counter lotions, Make sure it is well mixed.</li>
            <li> Many times I get way too much and the container gets all oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad I bought it because the consistency is much easier to work wirh</li>
            <li> So much faster than lotion and moisturizes better than any lotion ive ever tried (thats a lot).  </li>
            <li> it gets better, I have not broken out, yet.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made it softer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> Emollient, moisturizing, absorbs quickly into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this light, natural oil.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to apply and it makes my hair and skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I have found my natural roots cannot tolerate the same products my relaxer hair could and from reading the websites on natural hair, this is one of the best products to use.  </li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis most of my adult life.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> it looks more clear (oily) in the picture than what I got.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice because when I don&#x27;t have time to melt the regular Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> This is different than other shea butter oils I have purchased but this one works the best among all the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice sheen to my dark skin &amp; keeps it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> My latest shipment had a different top then normal.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after the shower when I&#x27;m still damp</li>
            <li> I use it as a hair conditioner and rub it all over my body right when I shut the water from my shower off.  </li>
            <li> I use this oil right out of the shower</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for price, Thanks</li>
            <li> Will certainly be ordering again when I run out which wont be for a while!</li>
            <li> This really makes your skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is due to the fact that I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed with a product enough to give a decent review, until I came upon this product....</li>
            <li> and I love to add Shea Butter, but after several months it starts to &#x27;crystalize&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it is lighter than the solid shea butter.  </li>
            <li> and I have definitely noticed a change in my complexion for the better.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is more of a packaging concern.</li>
            <li> This is healing and very soothing!</li>
            <li> I love the African Shea Butter Oil.</li>
            <li> I use regular Shea butter as well, but I love the oil for my skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I like it even better than the Shea Butter solid.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll definitely order more from this site again.</li>
            <li> When I run out I will be back to buy some more.</li>
            <li> i have a super dry skin but this oil makes my skin feel very soft and nice and does not leave a oily feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I think it would be better to get the 8 oz is because shea butter (according to my research) doesn&#x27;t have a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> surprisingly, it melted into my skin and didn&#x27;t make me look like a oil slick at all.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a smaller bottle of this product which turned out to be really good with no bad smell</li>
            <li> I cook with pure coconut oil &amp; when it liquefy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> 100% pure ...</li>
            <li> Try the pure and you will notice the difference in the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> It says PURE shea oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fifty-thirteen and many of my contempories have very dry skin problems, but this is the answer for me.</li>
            <li> natural\\&quot; much much easier.</li>
            <li> It really had no smell to it.</li>
            <li> Lotion doesn&#x27;t help the itching and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, I can&#x27;t use fancy scented soaps, the whole said affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really have not tried the Shea oil yet.</li>
            <li> I really felt scammed &amp; got a refund.  </li>
            <li> If you want to order the real thing I suggest ordering from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> Initially when I started to use this product I was more than satisfied however after several uses it starting to smell greasy/oily/fishy</li>
            <li> I took this on vacation with me and it really helped sooth my skin after being out in the sun all day.</li>
            <li> real smell.</li>
            <li> However it is very oily</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and really helped with my combination oily/dry skin.</li>
            <li> your debating whether to get the 16  oz one or the 8 oz one, I really have to say that the 8 oz one would probably be plenty.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was using baby oil until I found out that it is petroleum based, which really knocked me for a loop.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I put some of the oil on to help with the skin on his face which really worked.  </li>
            <li> I sure hope there is not any other oil than 100% pure Shea butter oil, it has changed.</li>
            <li> but you can blend it with other products for get better the fragance.</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t really like the smell although it&#x27;s not a bad smell and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I will use this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I used it with 100% Pure Jojoba Oil and it made my hair very soft and wavy</li>
            <li> I have very mild eczema and the skin of my calves is very dry in particular.</li>
            <li> After I shampoo, apply conditioner and dry my hair, I then put a drop in my hand, rub my hands together, and smooth it lightly over and under my rather long hair.  </li>
            <li> Previously I could just pop the top and squeeze out whatever amount I needed</li>
            <li> It has a slight nutty smell which is okay</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and you don&#x27;t need much, but it&#x27;s just so much better than the hair grease</li>
            <li> It left my skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s main ingredient was Shea butter</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a big towel to cover entire pillow and don&#x27;t get it on your hands as you could stain your sheets.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for something to keep your skin moisturized but not shiny, hair vibrant but not greasy, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I order it repeatedly and notice the difference when I go back to more traditional moisturizers (and I&#x27;ve tried everything).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend subbing when you can.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone use it.</li>
            <li> Alive and Aware Natural Health, is quick on delivery, but very short on what it is they actually sent you so quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the product; added a little bergamont oil to enhance the fragrance.</li>
            <li> over all a great product for people with dry skin better than a lot of expensive lotions!</li>
            <li> I even have my son hooked after working in the dirt or concrete or whatever he says it saves his skin on his hands.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this stuff and it really helps to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> Not the light oil I expected and have bought in beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Its very thick and heavy and the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but use lightly</li>
            <li> I love that I can order it in a bigger bottle and only pay a little bit more (compared to 2 smaller bottles).</li>
            <li> Later that evening his back felt smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This stuff had not broken me out so far and it has far exceeded all expectations.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> At first I was using it for my face, but I found that I began to break out after two weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li> I FINALLY FOUND A PRODUCT THAT NOT ONLY ELIMINATES THEM, BUT ALSO MAKES MY SKIN SOFT AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li> Apply (out of the shower on your wet scalp,) a good size portion into your wet hands and massage deeply into your scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Ok- forget all the fancy dyes, and colors, it&#x27;s not sexy, but this WORKS.  </li>
            <li> If the first part of my review wasn&#x27;t clear enough..</li>
            <li> It requires daily use but symptoms will be greatly reduced; no to very little itching &amp; minimal redness.</li>
            <li> I received these oil today (Dec 8th) in perfect conditions and is not a super oily oil, I mean it doesn&#x27;t leaves oily skin, it absorbs very fast; the smeel is not very nice</li>
            <li> A little product applied over moist skin keeps my skin supple and free of&lt;br /&gt;irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instant shine, manageability, and even some waves in my rather straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Despite some mixed reviews on this product, It IS real shea butter oil with no</li>
            <li> I like this product, I use it on my hair because am going natural with my hair.</li>
            <li> I like Shea in this form as it is very versitile, I prefer it in liquid form, especially in the Winter months.</li>
            <li> and now I have to take the lid off completely and have no control over the amount that comes out.</li>
            <li> , my skin is soo soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For a real treat, buy natural shea butter and mix in the shea butter oil (more oil to thin shea butter out then stir together.)</li>
            <li> I also use it for massage oil it leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> and I have to be very selective with the products I buy and choose organics as much as possible.</li>
            <li> I had tried the pure shea butter, but it is too heavy, this oil is just right.  </li>
            <li> I was able to ascertain it&#x27;s shea butter because I have the raw shea butter that is solid in a can.</li>
            <li> I have bought this in the past and am back now to buy some more</li>
            <li> 100% pure African Shea Butter Oil with all its natural nutrients, especially vitamins A and E.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Is this normal or is there actually an added oil????</li>
            <li> it will stain clothes, a little shout or baby powder takes carr of quickly tho.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair and this product while much heavier than the coconut oil i was using, has and is moisturizing my very dry scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is clearer and brighter, and my thick coarse hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li> Compared to other natural butters or oils, African Shea Butter Oil far more of the vitamins and other valuable phytonutrients essential for healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing major</li>
            <li> deep mouisturizing .. soft skin ,, silky shiny hair !</li>
            <li> Compounded by melasma which caused major discoloration on my cheeks, I&#x27;ve had to use heavier foundation &amp; concealer to cover my skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend your African Shea Butter Oil to anyone seeking the ultimate skin care</li>
            <li> After two weeks the flaking has completely ceased and the itching is almost gone entirely.</li>
            <li> Natural oil will harden &amp; become solid if kept at a temperature below 74 degrees.  </li>
            <li> In my daily job I have direct contact with people all the time</li>
            <li> and I am constantly being complemented on how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> It keeps my normally dry and scaly legs very moisturized for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> No more, so many other moisturizers wear off and this stuff lasts.</li>
            <li> I did buy the 16 oz one and we&#x27;re still not half way thru it despite 4 people using it daily for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am planning to keep using it like this for another couple weeks and then try every other day - it is a bit messy and inconvenient, but so far I am very happy with the outcome!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m lucky enough to have skin that hardly ever breaks out, I had a feeling</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not tight and dry anymore, and believe me I used everything to combat the dryness,coconut oil, olive oil, argan oil. .</li>
            <li> I personally use it after my shower, while I&#x27;m still wet, let it absorb a bit (brush my teeth), then gently towel dry.  </li>
            <li> this oil penetrates the scalp leaving the scalp and hair moisturized and soft, you can also add it to any hair dress when you want that creamy feel when the hair is very dry, use it for bed</li>
            <li> I use it on my little 2 year old hair and on mines and it makes your hair and body so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time now, but it has worked little miracles so far.</li>
            <li> I use this product alone and mixed with other oils such as coconut oil for an after shower body oil</li>
            <li> I usually use raw shea butter, but during the winter it is hard, so it&#x27;s nice to use this oil.</li>
            <li> When my fiance came home from work and showered I rubbed his very dry back with it.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes extremely far.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much money over the years trying to accomplish what this shea butter does for very little money.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and it makes it so soft and not overly heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t seem to go off.</li>
            <li> ;it keeps my skin moist and shine for long time .the</li>
            <li> Nothing added and it works on any dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has rescue my hair from being dry and damage.</li>
            <li> Works well for dry skin &amp; research claims to heal skin through vitamins &amp; whatnot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am also using the african black soap with shea to exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very, very, very dry and itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and after two operations on my knees the skin on my legs was just DRY.and bruised.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long, long way!</li>
            <li> There is really no smell to it.</li>
            <li> Be careful, let it absorb otherwise</li>
            <li> expected)</li>
            <li> I have come to appreciate the benefits of using Shea butter in my hair over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of weeks ago, and I have to say that it didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It actually leaves my skin feeling dried out, and it a bit too greasy.  </li>
            <li> Then throughout the week you can apply just a drop or two into wet hands and rub through wet hair to give it shine and thickening appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my face mixed with moisturizer, and also as a body oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had inconsistencies in the viscosity of this product.</li>
            <li> Granted I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but the night before, I slathered it on my face before heading to sleep.</li>
            <li> Massage slowly and applying pressure to work the natural healing shea butter oil into your scalp.  </li>
            <li> In the past year, it went from oily to extremely dry, especially underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> and we so rough and sharp even.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But it will not clash with your other perfumes or whatever.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was but definitely not 100% Shea  Butter as stated!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a small amount of the shea oil to do the job.  </li>
            <li> or otherwise you get small gritty pieces all over your skin.</li>
            <li> The supplier taped the lid closed so that it wouldn&#x27;t leak and that product itself exceeds my expectations!</li>
            <li> Unlike any other.</li>
            <li> This caused undesired results as layering on the piles of foundation, concealer, and powder would make my face extremely cakey.</li>
            <li> My body was always dry so lotions were applied everyday.</li>
            <li> After showering, massage a little on damp hands and rub hands together and then apply to wet face.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a fresh oil.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is that it has a bit of grit to it.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months I stopped wearing makeup, my face looked at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing!  </li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my feet and legs and a few other spots and just rub it in in the shower and get out.</li>
            <li> Also I ordered it for my black girlfriend for her hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin discolorations on my hands and face and in less than a month it has evened them out.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase shea butter in solid form, but it&#x27;s so hard to manipulate unless you rub it a lot or melt it down.</li>
            <li> I normally hate strongly smelly stuff.</li>
            <li> About 2 weeks ago I began using this oil (a little thicker consistancy than I</li>
            <li> it thickened a little but never hardened .  </li>
            <li> I like the product although it can be a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> I am a little oily.</li>
            <li> Put a little in your hands and rub into face.</li>
            <li> After applying sunscreen, I applied a little on my fingers and massaged it into my face, then applied my foundation.</li>
            <li> The crystals melt on your lips, but it does make them feel unpleasant at first.  </li>
            <li> I got this after reading an article on cleaning your face with oil as opposed to harsh soaps.</li>
            <li> I do not use it on my hair because it is rather heavy.  </li>
            <li> So I figured I&#x27;d buy it in liquid form and save myself the trouble.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews about products but this is one heck of a product!</li>
            <li> (no strong perfumes) and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> it arrives semi solid probably due to the cold, but as soon as it warms up it does liquefy.  </li>
            <li> I had very little leakage.</li>
            <li> if you wanted I think, not sure if it would mix.</li>
            <li> NO MORE STRETCH MARKS AFTER 26 YEARS OF STRETCH MARKS</li>
            <li> Hard to find product that hydrates your skin and hair without leaving you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and does wonders to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived as described ... not much more I can say!  </li>
            <li> I notice a slight smell, difficult to describe, so wouldn&#x27;t slather all over and go out with it on</li>
            <li> My skin gets so dry after only 2 hours and the smell is awful!</li>
            <li> I used to have awful dry elbows, so dry they hurt</li>
            <li> My husband had a bad sunburn a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> My scalp however has been a chronic case and I am trying to minimize the use of steroidal shampoo because I am afraid over time it will thin my scalp and make the problem worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna send it back to the seller; it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and doesn&#x27;t fail</li>
            <li> The package looks weird.</li>
            <li> But uncomfortable about the packaging.</li>
            <li> this dealer should get to the ground and check on the weird things being added to this oil.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I for some reason have had a terrible time with dry skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> Crazy about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid my skin would look too oily but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this before with coconul oil and woke up with the worst cystic acne!</li>
            <li> I hate the this product and will never buy again!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and I can see the difference in my skin tone - it&#x27;s literally &amp;#34;baby-bottom&amp;#34; smooth.</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> I received the product in 2 days. But the bottle came with no label, no indication as to what&#x27;s in it, and NO SMELL. What to do, what to do? Alive and Aware Natural Health, is quick on delivery, but very short on what it is they actually sent you so quickly. I used some on my arms and legs, it feels like shea butter, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s shea butter. It does tackle skin discoloration and various bug bites and scars. I was able to ascertain it&#x27;s shea butter because I have the raw shea butter that is solid in a can.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair and this product while much heavier than the coconut oil i was using, has and is moisturizing my very dry scalp and hair.  I had tried the pure shea butter, but it is too heavy, this oil is just right.  I use it everyday and you don&#x27;t need much, but it&#x27;s just so much better than the hair grease I was using.  I have found my natural roots cannot tolerate the same products my relaxer hair could and from reading the websites on natural hair, this is one of the best products to use.  I must say, it is making the journey to \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; much much easier.</li>
            <li> More like cooking oil. Smelled like cooking oil and it clumped into a gritty feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my hair and skin (including my face). I liked it best when applied to wet skin. It left my skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li> I placed my second order or was it my third, anyway, it was shipped out within hours. THe bottle top on the shea oil comes with scotch tape and holds pretty good. I had very little leakage. THe pure shea butter is authentic. Nothing added and it works on any dry skin. I even have my son hooked after working in the dirt or concrete or whatever he says it saves his skin on his hands. I&#x27;ve used many shea butters and you cannot beat this. The oil I use after I shower in the shower however, you could use it just after drying off because it&#x27;s consitency is not runny. I have psoriasis on my feet and legs and a few other spots and just rub it in in the shower and get out. Then I add lotion on top of that. I&#x27;ve even kept some psoriasis spots from breaking compleltly out by using the shea oil. I have not used it on my face but only because I think I would break out. It really had no smell to it. You could add a drop of lavender if you wanted I think, not sure if it would mix. But it will not clash with your other perfumes or whatever. Again, can&#x27;t say enough about the service!! Oh, and I have had shea butters make me itch because of scents and additives and everything makes me itch. This does not.   Maggi, in Florida</li>
            <li> i have a super dry skin but this oil makes my skin feel very soft and nice and does not leave a oily feeling. i use it after every shower and it is great. but don&#x27;t really like the smell although it&#x27;s not a bad smell and doesn&#x27;t last. over all a great product for people with dry skin better than a lot of expensive lotions!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I used it with 100% Pure Jojoba Oil and it made my hair very soft and wavy (which is the look I&#x27;m going for).  I purchased the 16 oz, but this works so well, I&#x27;ll be looking for a larger container purchase next time.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Very happy with the quality!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  Item arrived as described ... not much more I can say!  Glad I bought it!  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> This 16 oz bottle may last forever...a little goes a long way.  At first I was using it for my face, but I found that I began to break out after two weeks of daily use.  Since I&#x27;m lucky enough to have skin that hardly ever breaks out, I had a feeling it was the Shea oil.  I discontinued it on my face and began to use it on my hair.  It&#x27;s really wonderful for that use. After I shampoo, apply conditioner and dry my hair, I then put a drop in my hand, rub my hands together, and smooth it lightly over and under my rather long hair.  Instant shine, manageability, and even some waves in my rather straight hair.  Lovely.  Oh yes...and I also use it on my hands and feet, and they soak it up.</li>
            <li> I have very mild eczema and the skin of my calves is very dry in particular. Lotion doesn&#x27;t help the itching and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, I can&#x27;t use fancy scented soaps, the whole said affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this. Silky feeling, if I miss one day my legs start drying out and itching so I know it&#x27;s working,  and if I sweat my skin doesn&#x27;t get gross like it did with body butter or lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this product and great on the skin</li>
            <li> I wonder if it&#x27;s baby oil because it drys my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna send it back to the seller; it smells horrible. Definitely not a fresh oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making lip balms for a while and I love to add Shea Butter, but after several months it starts to &#x27;crystalize&#x27;.  The crystals melt on your lips, but it does make them feel unpleasant at first.  So, I switched to this Shea Oil instead and now the lipbalms are super smooth and stay that way.  Highly recommend subbing when you can.</li>
            <li> I really have not tried the Shea oil yet. There is really no smell to it. Four more words to</li>
            <li> Love this oil works great &amp; has lasting moisturizing benefits. Leaves a nice sheen to my dark skin &amp; keeps it nice and soft. I drop a fair amount of lavender oil for fragrance and voila!!! Be careful, let it absorb otherwise it will stain clothes, a little shout or baby powder takes carr of quickly tho.</li>
            <li> I noticed with my last order of this product it smelled of olive oil. I sure hope there is not any other oil than 100% pure Shea butter oil, it has changed. I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis most of my adult life. About a year ago my Dermatologist prescribed a face cream that&#x27;s main ingredient was Shea butter and I have had great success with that product. My scalp however has been a chronic case and I am trying to minimize the use of steroidal shampoo because I am afraid over time it will thin my scalp and make the problem worse. About 2 weeks ago I began using this oil (a little thicker consistancy than I expected)...I massage my scalp with it about an hour before showering each morning and wash it off with an over the counter dandruff shampoo. After two weeks the flaking has completely ceased and the itching is almost gone entirely. My hair feels smooth and the relief from itching, flaking and caking is fantastic. I am planning to keep using it like this for another couple weeks and then try every other day - it is a bit messy and inconvenient, but so far I am very happy with the outcome!</li>
            <li> I received these oil today (Dec 8th) in perfect conditions and is not a super oily oil, I mean it doesn&#x27;t leaves oily skin, it absorbs very fast; the smeel is not very nice but you can blend it with other products for get better the fragance. Am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is lighter than the solid shea butter.  I still use both the solid and liquid shea butter, but the liquid I can use on my face! It&#x27;s wonderful to mix with essential oils as well.  I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product you can mix with your shea butter!  Very very good. Shipment nicely sealed. Recommended on the skin and hair</li>
            <li> I have come to appreciate the benefits of using Shea butter in my hair over the last few years.  As someone with curly hair, and curly headed children, I discovered that Shea butter helps to keep curly hair well nourished and reduces frizziness.  However, one of the best discoveries was realizing what a great body moisturizer the African Shea Butter Oil was on my children.  It kept their skin smooth all day, even after a rigorous day at school.  I will definitely make this a staple in our family!</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was but definitely not 100% Shea  Butter as stated!  Natural oil will harden &amp; become solid if kept at a temperature below 74 degrees.  It will liquefy again when kept at a temperature above 74 degrees.  I tested this so called shea butter  by placing it  in the refrigerator ...... it thickened a little but never hardened .  It&#x27;s fake!  I cook with pure coconut oil &amp; when it liquefy&#x27;s I place in the refrig &amp; it hardens.  I really felt scammed &amp; got a refund.  If you want to order the real thing I suggest ordering from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil.  I use it for my hair, and as a body oil.  It works wonders for my skin and hair.  I would reccomend it highly.</li>
            <li> Amazing product; smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money over the years trying to accomplish what this shea butter does for very little money. I have already repurchased twice and will continue to do so. My skin loves this stuff and it really helps to clear my skin. I always thought oil would exasperate my issues with acne but this has helped immensely and helps shrink my pores as well. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I simply love this oil.  It&#x27;s not too thick and does wonders to my hair.  The only negative thing I can say is that it has a bit of grit to it.  Nothing major but I can feel it when spreading it around in my hands.  Still works fine though.</li>
            <li> this oil penetrates the scalp leaving the scalp and hair moisturized and soft, you can also add it to any hair dress when you want that creamy feel when the hair is very dry, use it for bed head.also use it as my body oil in the morning, a product you can use all over the body from head to toes.would always have this oil at home.</li>
            <li> I use it daily.  Won&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> Initially when I started to use this product I was more than satisfied however after several uses it starting to smell greasy/oily/fishy and then the oil separated as if it was going rancid. Then my legs started to breakout. I RETURNED IT TODAY!</li>
            <li> I got this after reading an article on cleaning your face with oil as opposed to harsh soaps. My skin is always so incredibly smooth after using it. I only use it about once a week and I have definitely noticed a change in my complexion for the better. Do not use it in your hair unless you are looking for an oil treatment and wash it out properly.</li>
            <li> Despite some mixed reviews on this product, It IS real shea butter oil with no fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a cancer patient, I am eternally grateful for your shea butter oil.&lt;br /&gt;Having to undergo numerous chemotherapy treatment, the oil is the&lt;br /&gt;only product which soothes and hydrates my parched skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using the african black soap with shea to exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I was able to order the 16oz bottle!  A little product applied over moist skin keeps my skin supple and free of&lt;br /&gt;irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount of the shea oil to do the job.  And it is easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is also great if you want to add a roll on fragrance oil over certain areas&lt;br /&gt;as the shea oil serves as a fixative and makes the fragrance last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend your African Shea Butter Oil to anyone seeking the ultimate skin care product.&lt;br /&gt;The 16oz bottle is the best value and can be put up into small 1 oz plastic bottles with a spout.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is finer than any product avaiable in department stores because it WORKS!</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and it makes it so soft and not overly heavy and greasy. love how it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> Nice product, does stay solid unless it&#x27;s very warm in your soaping studio so find that I have to warm it up before I use it.</li>
            <li> NO MORE STRETCH MARKS AFTER 26 YEARS OF STRETCH MARKS I FINALLY FOUND A PRODUCT THAT NOT ONLY ELIMINATES THEM, BUT ALSO MAKES MY SKIN SOFT AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li> easy to apply but you still have to warm it in your hands or otherwise you get small gritty pieces all over your skin. i got this so i wouldn&#x27;t have to rub it in my hands to apply like i did with the solid shea. probably going to stick with regular shea butter from now on.</li>
            <li> I took this on vacation with me and it really helped sooth my skin after being out in the sun all day. The shea butter seemed like it was a good quality as noted by the seller and I&#x27;ve continued to use at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for my body for a couple of years now. I put it on right after the shower when I&#x27;m still damp and my skin is quite nice. I&#x27;m fifty-thirteen and many of my contempories have very dry skin problems, but this is the answer for me. Also I ordered it for my black girlfriend for her hair and she loves it. It lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t seem to go off. I will use this as long as it&#x27;s available. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like the product although it can be a little sticky.  I don&#x27;t like the container it comes in, you have to unscrew the lid to use it.  Many times I get way too much and the container gets all oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works best for me mixed with shower gel and a couple drops of jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real smell.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair It has rescue my hair from being dry and damage. It has restored luster it makes your hair more manageable. I recommed this product I will continue to use it and it makes your hair grow!!!  And It keeps your hair from tangling.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I use it on my hair because am going natural with my hair.</li>
            <li> This really makes your skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Great product and so smoothe on the skin. So glad I bought it because the consistency is much easier to work wirh</li>
            <li> I love this product. You can use it on your hair and skin. It is great on your feet elbows and hands. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> perfect ! deep mouisturizing .. soft skin ,, silky shiny hair ! 100% pure ... i love it :)</li>
            <li> Like how it makes my skin feel smooth all day</li>
            <li> I have purchased this over &amp; over again. It makes a great body moisturizer &amp; a great carrier for essential oils. Better than perfume.</li>
            <li> I like Shea in this form as it is very versitile, I prefer it in liquid form, especially in the Winter months.</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of weeks ago, and I have to say that it didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to. It actually leaves my skin feeling dried out, and it a bit too greasy.  But it is an okay product.</li>
            <li> We use this to make lotions using essential oils. Works up fine and does not gum up or feel to oily upon use.</li>
            <li> I make my own body care items at home, and was delighted when I added African Shea Butter Oil to a body scrub.  It is extremely moisturizing!  I highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Works well for dry skin &amp; research claims to heal skin through vitamins &amp; whatnot. I notice a slight smell, difficult to describe, so wouldn&#x27;t slather all over and go out with it on, I clean after it seems to have absorbed mostly and been a while. Works for massage oil, but have had better at masseuse. Not bad at all for price, Thanks</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY 2ND BOTTLE SO I THOUGHT WOULD RATE THE PRODUCT... THIS MY 2ND BOTTLE ENOUGH SAID... ITS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to sulfa products.  I have been experimenting with many products.  I love this Shea butter oil 4 my body.  However it is very oily so because I dont work after my bath I lay a towel on my bed and massage it into my body and after a couple of hours I wont b as oily and can dress.  I would recommend that if you need to use it on your body shower and use it as night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also great because it does protect you from the sun, helps with scars and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome.  I have very, very, very dry and itchy skin.  When I use it I do not have these problems.  This is the only product I will use from now on.</li>
            <li> I use this nightly as my regular moisturizer. As soon as I get out of the shower while I am still damp I will use this all over my body and then apply lotion. In my daily job I have direct contact with people all the time and I am constantly being complemented on how soft my skin feels. The only issue I have with it is more of a packaging concern. My latest shipment had a different top then normal. Previously I could just pop the top and squeeze out whatever amount I needed and now I have to take the lid off completely and have no control over the amount that comes out.</li>
            <li> Quality oil, and I love that I can order it in a bigger bottle and only pay a little bit more (compared to 2 smaller bottles). I use this oil as a face wash. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and really helped with my combination oily/dry skin. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approx 4 years and it does the job. My scalp soaks this oil up in 24 hours.  I do not use it on my hair because it is rather heavy.  For my hair I use Grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li> Ahhh-mazing!  A little bit goes extremely far.  I use it as a hair conditioner and rub it all over my body right when I shut the water from my shower off.  So much faster than lotion and moisturizes better than any lotion ive ever tried (thats a lot).  Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and doesn&#x27;t fail, my skin is soo soft and moisturized.  I used to have awful dry elbows, so dry they hurt and we so rough and sharp even.  No more, so many other moisturizers wear off and this stuff lasts. Its my all purpose everything moisturizer.  I highly recommend everyone use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Jojoba Oil (as it&#x27;s lighter) but ordered this African Shea Butter Oil after reading up on it and now people ask me \\&quot;what are you doing to your skin!?\\&quot;  I tell them all about this product.  After showering, massage a little on damp hands and rub hands together and then apply to wet face.  I do it after shaving and it&#x27;s fantastic!  My skin glows from all the healing properties of the African Shea Butter oil.  I apply it all over my entire body after showering too and let it soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your scalp, try this: Apply (out of the shower on your wet scalp,) a good size portion into your wet hands and massage deeply into your scalp and hair. Massage slowly and applying pressure to work the natural healing shea butter oil into your scalp.  This treatment stops flaking and acts as an anti-inflammatory.  I place a towel on my pillow and then awaken in the morning from the deep penetrating treatment overnight.  Just make sure you use a big towel to cover entire pillow and don&#x27;t get it on your hands as you could stain your sheets.  Then throughout the week you can apply just a drop or two into wet hands and rub through wet hair to give it shine and thickening appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try 100% pure African Shea Butter Oil with all its natural nutrients, especially vitamins A and E. Compared to other natural butters or oils, African Shea Butter Oil far more of the vitamins and other valuable phytonutrients essential for healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a real treat, buy natural shea butter and mix in the shea butter oil (more oil to thin shea butter out then stir together.) for an even thicker moisturizing experience!!</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a moisturizer for my hair and skin.  I know a lot of people use this on their face, but I&#x27;ve tried oils that just make me break out.  I stick to using this for my body only.  It&#x27;s light and easy to apply and it makes my hair and skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent much more emoilent then regular nice.</li>
            <li> The best find for very dry skin when added to the cheapest of over the counter lotions, Make sure it is well mixed.It is great dry winter air and heat.</li>
            <li> I use this oil right out of the shower It keeps my normally dry and scaly legs very moisturized for the entire day.  I am happy with this oil, and I plan on buying more when I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
            <li> really great moisturizer. my mother suggested it to me. we both have a bottle and uses it on my sisters and  I hair. we all have different hair types. All african american by the way.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It comes out easy, rubs on smoothly, and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time now, but it has worked little miracles so far. I&#x27;ve had skin discolorations on my hands and face and in less than a month it has evened them out. I&#x27;ve also used it on my hair and it&#x27;s made it softer and more vibrant. I like to include in my reviews what I wanted to know before I bought it, so I&#x27;ll do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your debating whether to get the 16  oz one or the 8 oz one, I really have to say that the 8 oz one would probably be plenty. I did buy the 16 oz one and we&#x27;re still not half way thru it despite 4 people using it daily for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I think it would be better to get the 8 oz is because shea butter (according to my research) doesn&#x27;t have a long shelf life. So it&#x27;s best to use it up quicker than your other skin/hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So should you buy it? If the first part of my review wasn&#x27;t clear enough.. yes you should. If your looking for something to keep your skin moisturized but not shiny, hair vibrant but not greasy, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!! My mother loves it too! WINNER in my household. Will order more soon!!</li>
            <li> it looks more clear (oily) in the picture than what I got.</li>
            <li> Emollient, moisturizing, absorbs quickly into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I use a few drops on my face mixed with moisturizer, and also as a body oil. I like the product however the smell can be really strong, a bit like roasted nuts and rubber gum eraser, not that pleasant, but adding some essential oils might help.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> This is healing and very soothing! I love this it hydrates the skin wonderfully. I use it in the summer time and in the winter.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this light, natural oil. It has a slight nutty smell which is okay (no strong perfumes) and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I love the African Shea Butter Oil. I appreciate the fact that it came in a 16 oz plastic bottle. The oil is great for everything human; that includes your body and hair. I will be buying some more from this company soon. I have already told my family members and some friends about the wonderful company and its product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I alawys have a stock of this oil.i found  the oil better than the butter for the body.i yse it after every shower ;it keeps my skin moist and shine for long time .the smell is softer than the butter . I add some fregrance oil and ut mix nicely with the shea butter.the seller is always send the order on time.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I for some reason have had a terrible time with dry skin this winter.  I usually purchase shea butter in solid form, but it&#x27;s so hard to manipulate unless you rub it a lot or melt it down. So I figured I&#x27;d buy it in liquid form and save myself the trouble.  As soon as I got it I used some on my face and then proceeded to mix it in our lotions.  When my fiance came home from work and showered I rubbed his very dry back with it.  Later that evening his back felt smooth and moisturized. He said &amp;#34;can you get some more of this I really like it.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve noticed a difference already in my skin too, it&#x27;s not tight and dry anymore, and believe me I used everything to combat the dryness,coconut oil, olive oil, argan oil. . nothing worked like this.  So as I write this review, I will be ordering another bottle to have on hand.  I am very pleased with this oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had inconsistencies in the viscosity of this product. Three times I&#x27;ve ordered it and three times it came in different concentrations. It&#x27;s great when it&#x27;s a good consistency but who wants to take the risk?</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping time!</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Moisturizes well for hair and body. I also use it for massage oil it leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and I use it on both my hair and my skin. My complexion is clearer and brighter, and my thick coarse hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li> I use regular Shea butter as well, but I love the oil for my skin in the winter.  It is the best for moisture, as well as marks and scars.  I also use it on my hair when I am doing twist or braid outs.  The oil is nice because when I don&#x27;t have time to melt the regular Shea butter.  The moisture last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again and again for myself as well as my mother who like to use it after going swimming.&lt;br /&gt;Pure Shea butter is the best for skin, other lotions and moisturizers that contain shea are not. Try the pure and you will notice the difference in the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS LIKE MAGIC IN A BOTTLE ,I LOVE IT! IT&#x27;S GOOD FOR MARKS ,SPIDER VEIN&#x27;S,HAIR.I WILL DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.THIS PRODUCT MAKES YOUR SKIN VERY SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews about products but this is one heck of a product! It has done wonders for my incredible dry skin. The only thing I would say is that it has a &amp;#34;herby/hempy&amp;#34; scent to it. This is different than other shea butter oils I have purchased but this one works the best among all the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. This product was exactly what I wanted and expected. The supplier taped the lid closed so that it wouldn&#x27;t leak and that product itself exceeds my expectations!</li>
            <li> Love this liquid form of shea butter. Will buy it again************</li>
            <li> This is a great African Shea Butter Oil...I use it on my little 2 year old hair and on mines and it makes your hair and body so soft. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, I use it on my skin, face, and hair. I usually use raw shea butter, but during the winter it is hard, so it&#x27;s nice to use this oil.</li>
            <li> Hard to find product that hydrates your skin and hair without leaving you feeling greasy.  Perfect when paired with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Crazy about this stuff.  Love, love Shea Butter and to be able to find it in liquid form is even better.  My skin loves this stuff....it is like liquid gold.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to try this liquid Shea butter.  it arrives semi solid probably due to the cold, but as soon as it warms up it does liquefy.  I personally use it after my shower, while I&#x27;m still wet, let it absorb a bit (brush my teeth), then gently towel dry.  It leaves your skin wonderfully moisturized, and it&#x27;s a quick way to moisturize in the mornings.  I was using baby oil until I found out that it is petroleum based, which really knocked me for a loop.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that cocoa butter smell that i like but its a good oil for your skin after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have bought this in the past and am back now to buy some more I have the one that is solid but this one is just easy to put on. Love it!!</li>
            <li> The package looks weird. No food lable: No any introduction about the product. No expiration date. No place made indication.&lt;br /&gt;Only a web site address. Unlike any other. Have not tried the oil yet. But uncomfortable about the packaging. Can we trust a item delivered to you this way.</li>
            <li> Just got this as a gift. It says PURE shea oil but it smells JUST like vegetable oil which makes me suspicious. Can anyone explain this to me? Is this normal or is there actually an added oil????</li>
            <li> I use this product alone and mixed with other oils such as coconut oil for an after shower body oil and it is lovely. I will be getting it again.</li>
            <li> An absolutely wonderful product for all uses. Helps to reduce effects of fungal skin problems; psoriasis &amp;eczema.  It will not cure them, but will minimize symptoms. It requires daily use but symptoms will be greatly reduced; no to very little itching &amp; minimal redness.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My skin is so much softer. I don&#x27;t put it on my face. I am a little oily. My legs look and feel much better. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> At 52 years old, this oil is wonderful. After going through radiation, chemo and finally just age my skin had a gray look to it. I wore makeup to brighten my face and used moisturizer twice daily. My body was always dry so lotions were applied everyday. When I found this oil, I loved it right away. It does not leave you feeling oily. Put a little in your hands and rub into face. After 3 months I stopped wearing makeup, my face looked at least 10 years younger. I use it on my hair, I put some in the lotions I use. For me and all that my skin went through via cancer treatments, it changed my skin back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon before. This is due to the fact that I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed with a product enough to give a decent review, until I came upon this product....absolutely amazing! If there was a GOD PARTICLE for skincare, this product would be it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many types of moisturizers ranging from drug store to high-end department store brands. My last purchase set me back almost $100 and left me underwhelmed and ripped-off to say the last. I&#x27;ve been suffering from combination skin leaning more towards oily. In the past year, it went from oily to extremely dry, especially underneath my eyes. Compounded by melasma which caused major discoloration on my cheeks, I&#x27;ve had to use heavier foundation &amp; concealer to cover my skin. This caused undesired results as layering on the piles of foundation, concealer, and powder would make my face extremely cakey. Blah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the hunt for a good (and organic) moisturizer, I came upon the African Shea Butter oil and read the reviews. Impressed, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it was way cheaper than my last moisturizer (Caudalie in case you were wondering). After applying sunscreen, I applied a little on my fingers and massaged it into my face, then applied my foundation. I was afraid my skin would look too oily but surprisingly, it melted into my skin and didn&#x27;t make me look like a oil slick at all. But the best thing, my skin GLOWED. Like I just did a juice cleanse or ran 5 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it gets better, I have not broken out, yet. I have very sensitive skin and I have to be very selective with the products I buy and choose organics as much as possible. Granted I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but the night before, I slathered it on my face before heading to sleep. I&#x27;ve done this before with coconul oil and woke up with the worst cystic acne! This stuff had not broken me out so far and it has far exceeded all expectations. I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a smaller bottle of this product which turned out to be really good with no bad smell so I decided to get a bigger bottle when I ran out but what I received  is not even close to African Shea butter. My skin gets so dry after only 2 hours and the smell is awful! this dealer should get to the ground and check on the weird things being added to this oil. I hate the this product and will never buy again!</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this oil. It is being used regularly.  I use it on my skin and my hair. Very smooth, and comforting to the skin.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t soak into my skin, very greasy, my dog did like licking my face because she loved the taste.</li>
            <li> I like it even better than the Shea Butter solid. Perfect oil for many purposes.</li>
            <li> I got the item fairly quickly and love to use it on my skin. The oil has a very (nice) light nutty smell, but I can&#x27;t barely detect it anyway. I normally hate strongly smelly stuff. And I&#x27;ll definitely order more from this site again. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Ok- forget all the fancy dyes, and colors, it&#x27;s not sexy, but this WORKS.  It is better than ANY lotion I have tried. I order it repeatedly and notice the difference when I go back to more traditional moisturizers (and I&#x27;ve tried everything).  Forget fancy packaging, go for a good product.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this shea butter oil for herself, and gave me some to try.  I instantly fell in love and had to buy my own.  It is definitely worth it!  I put it on my skin, in my hair, my kids hair, and everywhere.  My husband had a bad sunburn a few days ago.  I put some of the oil on to help with the skin on his face which really worked.  When I run out I will be back to buy some more.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I would recommend it and paln to reorder soon. Absorbs well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil for the summer time.  It hydrates my skin at the same time without staining my clothes and I wear a lot of silk, satin and chiffon in the summer.</li>
            <li> Love the product; added a little bergamont oil to enhance the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and easiness of using the Shea Butter Oil to make my body cream and also to use it right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair and on my skin great great product I dont remeber the last time I was so soft!!! Will certainly be ordering again when I run out which wont be for a while! A little bit goes a long, long way!</li>
            <li> Not the light oil I expected and have bought in beauty stores. Its very thick and heavy and the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but use lightly and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair moisturizer and I am very happy with the results. It smells great, has a good consistency and does not weight down my hair... Will buy this again when I eventually start to run out..</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and after two operations on my knees the skin on my legs was just DRY.and bruised. After using this product for a month my skin has improved greatly in appearance and texture.</li>
