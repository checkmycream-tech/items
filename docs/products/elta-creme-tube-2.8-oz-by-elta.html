            <li> I highly recommend this ointment to anyone that has been burned, or any other skin malady that requires moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I had a strange affliction on my fingertip skin, tried several different lotions and cremes and such, but Elta Creme is the one that made a difference, allowing the skin to heal.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using the product enough, but my nails are not looking as moisturized and have started chipping and breaking again, and the feeling of protected and moisturized skin doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cream, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I should try it as I was a type 2 diabetic with very dry skin With only 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and get allergic hives regularly.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased Elta Creme for someone who is diabetic, and has sore, dry skin on her ankles.  </li>
            <li> Dry skin?</li>
            <li> and it worked on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Got this for mom for her really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Using it at night helps keep my face from getting dry, even during the winter.</li>
            <li> I looked all over in stores for this because a dr. prescribed it for my Dad one time for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a burn victim whose doctor had been giving it to him.</li>
            <li> It feels a little big greasy, but if you have parched skin that looks like the reptile skin, USE THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my rough heels too.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this goes a long way, though.</li>
            <li> I thought I would check out other items.  </li>
            <li> and you only need just a small amount to put on</li>
            <li> The formula did feel a oily but would dry after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts and keeps my neck looking less</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and get hard, dry places on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if it would work</li>
            <li> No more chipping or peeling.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks one could hardly tell that I had been burned.</li>
            <li> Too thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few things I can use on my face without irritating it.</li>
            <li> Its a very small tube</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product but for some reason is now very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Not  impressed by the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not experiencing painful cracked hands anymore.</li>

            <li> One of the better hand creams I&#x27;ve used. It was recommended by a burn victim whose doctor had been giving it to him.</li>
            <li> I purchased Elta Creme for someone who is diabetic, and has sore, dry skin on her ankles.  The creme has relieved much of the dryness and itching, and her ankles don&#x27;t bother her nearly as much as they did.  Thanks for a great product !</li>
            <li> Very good Product this stuff is great for removing scaly skin around wounds.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Awesome!!!! I had second and third degree burns on my hands, arms, legs and face. A friend told me about this stuff that he used when he had similar burns. I had it shipped overnight and began using it right away. My face had been swollen and the doctor said that I would likely need surgery once it healed. Within two days my face started peeling and the moisturizing effect helps ease the pain in my hands and legs. Within two weeks one could hardly tell that I had been burned. I highly recommend this ointment to anyone that has been burned, or any other skin malady that requires moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Elta is excellent dry skin cream.  I am a diabetic and get hard, dry places on my skin.  I had one that had been on my elbow for months.  No regular skin cream had been able to soften it, but Elta started working on it the first time I used it.  I recommend this cream, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great Quality.  Makes Great Gift for special friends.  This can&#x27;t be purchased just everywhere.</li>
            <li> Too thick and greasy. I felt like my skin was smothering.</li>
            <li> Elat is great if you have dry skin.  It&#x27;s great for people who are diabetics</li>
            <li> Very helpful on a skin irritation that I have had for some time.  Recommended by a doctor - will reorder.</li>
            <li> Elta cream  was highly recommended by a friend that is a Nurse. It is amazing! I use it twice a day on my hands and feet and have really noticed a big improvement.</li>
            <li> Dry skin? Burn scars? Itchy donor sites? My friends, you have found your solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderfully. Just a little bit of this goes a long way, though.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  I will forever use ELTA. I was not sure if it would work but it did amazingly.</li>
            <li> The Elta cream works great for dry angry skin. I was introduced to the cream by my doctors they could not believe it was so affordable.</li>
            <li> Great for healing from procedures like CO2 laser resurfacing &amp; other super dry/sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li> This is an HG product in our home!  Awesome for those dry winter months.  Unscented, so my husband doesn&#x27;t mind using this on his hands.  I even use on my face at night for an extra moisture boost when needed.</li>
            <li> The Elta Creme is the best product I have found for dry hands in the winter time.  It is easy to apply and most importantly, stays for hours if not all day.  Because it contains petrolatum, it does not wash off easily with gentle hand washing.  No need to frequently re-apply.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, packaged good.  Is good product for diabetic people with dry skin, Noticeable improvement of skin in one or two days of use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!  I have psoriasis and this is the only moisturizer that I&#x27;ve found that moisturizes, lasts, and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve slathered lard on me.  You use it right after washing and it locks in the moisture for hours.</li>
            <li> This cream works great. I&#x27;m not experiencing painful cracked hands anymore. I would definitely purchase this product again. Does not overpower with fragrance either.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I got a sample at a Health Fair and it worked on my dry skin.  Had to order some.</li>
            <li> The Elta Cream is great for my son&#x27;s skin! Keeps it moist and safe by coating it with the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it&#x27;s very good.  I am 81 but no wrinkles on my face.&lt;br /&gt;(Can&#x27;t say the same for my arms or legs--guess I should use Elta there too?)&lt;br /&gt;A plastic surgeon asked me what I used on my face and I told him--the next time I was&lt;br /&gt;there (he&#x27;d fixed a spot from MOHS surgery) I saw a full display of Elta MD....&lt;br /&gt;the same as this but in a silver packaging.  I thought it was funny.</li>
            <li> I have been a diebetic for over 24 years, and recently on vacation in Florida, the local hospital was using this creme and has been just great with my legs and feet.  Better than any other creme that I have been trying all these years for dried and peeling skin.</li>
            <li> This product is super to remove callouses and keep the skin soft and smooth. .</li>
            <li> I have used elta creme before-I like it. Some may find it too greasy. It has no odor which might be a plus for some.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and wonderful service!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> After a recent foot injury a nurse at the hospital used Elta on the foot after surgery, and recommended I get some for home use. A small amount goes a long way and makes Your skin feel GREAT</li>
            <li> Best hand crem for dry skin ever!</li>
            <li> Got this for mom for her really dry skin.  The visiting nurses had been using it and we could not find it in the store.  Works well and makes her happy.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with my makeup before putting it around my eyes. It makes my wrinkles look better and the&lt;br /&gt;makeup does not settle into the lines. It&#x27;s also good to wear on your neck when you are going to be out for hours.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts and keeps my neck looking less dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product but for some reason is now very hard to find in stores.  ; (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texasmom</li>
            <li> I had great results with the Elta Creme that comes in a tub.  My hands were soft and protected by the special combination in this formula.  My nails had never looked so smooth, sheen, and they even started growing really quickly.  No more chipping or peeling.  The formula did feel a oily but would dry after a few minutes.  However, for convenience I decided to purchase the tube instead.  Not  impressed by the results.  Maybe I&#x27;m not using the product enough, but my nails are not looking as moisturized and have started chipping and breaking again, and the feeling of protected and moisturized skin doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> I had a strange affliction on my fingertip skin, tried several different lotions and cremes and such, but Elta Creme is the one that made a difference, allowing the skin to heal.</li>
            <li> With the use of this moisturizer, you will never need another moisturizer.  I have used it for two years now and my skin looks wonderful. I apply it each morning just before I apply my foundation. I am 70 years old and I cannot thank the doctor that had me use it enough!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and says: Great travel size; love this moisturizing cream, it melts into your skin and leaves it so soft. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Elta is a very useful moisturizer for those of us who have Rosacea. It is one of the few things I can use on my face without irritating it. Using it at night helps keep my face from getting dry, even during the winter.</li>
            <li> It was recomended by the wound care clinic at UCLA They said the represenative had left a sample and I should try it as I was a type 2 diabetic with very dry skin With only 2 weeks use a very large calous on my heal fell off. So I bought a tube from You and am very pleased.Some dry scaly patches that were the result of keritosis removal are going away Quite amazing</li>
            <li> This product is just what I need for my super dry.  It is most effective after a shower/bath.  This product was shipped fast and the productarrived intact.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and get allergic hives regularly. Elta is the only lotion I have found that I do not react to and that keeps my skin moisturized for a longer period of time. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and it was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This ointment (not creme or lotion) is emulsified petroleum jelly and paraffin. It&#x27;s non-sensitizing, hypoallergenic, fragrance and alcohol free.  It&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve found for my extremely sensitive skin, and keeps my hands well protected even during the winter with frequent use of hand sanitizer, soap, and water.</li>
            <li> This is extremely good for dry skin and people with Diabeties</li>
            <li> I really just got the cream (really its more like a thin gel) for a work thing.  I tried using it as a hand cream but its too greasy for my hands, especially since I touch things all day.  I&#x27;m concerned it would leave a spot on anything I touch.  It would be great for someone that has super, super dry skin.  And I&#x27;ve heard its good for skin grafted areas to keep them moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends this lotion. It&#x27;s great for the whole family. We live in Colorado and sometimes need something for severe dry skin. I also like to use it as a lip moisturizer and make up remover.</li>
            <li> I had recieved a sample of Elta hydrovase and loved it and ordered it.  I was so happy with Elta I thought I would check out other items.  So this is my first time use.  Its a very small tube but it really does not take much.  I use it on my feet and after it sinks in, my feet look healthy and attractive but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream is more concentrated, less watery, than other creams, and seems to soak into the skin faster.  Leaves skin super soft.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome moisturizer and after tanning cream! I&#x27;ve used this product for years with great results - what ever season! In winter it&#x27;s great for dry skin, and summer it&#x27;s great for after sun exposure or indoor tanning. Keeps skin soft and shows off tan with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I looked all over in stores for this because a dr. prescribed it for my Dad one time for dry skin. This stuff is really worth having and you only need just a small amount to put on and it goes a long way. I am so happy that I don&#x27;t have to look anymore for it.</li>
            <li> Shazaam! This stuff really works. It feels a little big greasy, but if you have parched skin that looks like the reptile skin, USE THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it nightly on my hands and feet. I look almost human again.</li>
            <li> The wound care clinic where my husband was being treated recommended this. Nurses said it would take the scales off an alligator. I didn&#x27;t try it on an alligator, but it definately worked on my diabetic husband&#x27;s legs and feet. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and it just soaks in. There is a bit of an oily film left on top but that&#x27;s no problem. I have used it on my rough heels too. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My wife has used this produce before and loves it.  It was shipped quickly and at a good price.  She is happy.</li>
            <li> I feel the product is good we have used it since we received it and have had good results.  It was ssuggested at the doctor&#x27;s office and we found it at a good price at Amazon...</li>
            <li> great product great seller</li>
            <li> My mother fell and scraped a bunch of skin off her leg.  The Dr. gave her some of this to keep her skin from drying out. There weren&#x27;t any places close for her to buy more and everyone else was way more, this was a good price and she got it quickly</li>
            <li> Love the Eltra Cr√®me.  Use it all over.&lt;br /&gt;Janet</li>
