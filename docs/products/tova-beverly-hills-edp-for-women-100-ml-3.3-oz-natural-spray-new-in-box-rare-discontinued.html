            <li>TOVA signature is nice but does not compare with the original .</li>
            <li>It is a very special fragrance that Tova, herself, created.  </li>
            <li>Had a strong alcohol scent.</li>
            <li>packaging looked genuine, but the smell was off.  </li>
            <li>Much prefer the originals!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it is a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; knockoff with a formula close to the original.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the original fragrance....</li>
            <li>No one seems to have the original fragrance any where..not even the TOVA store in Beverly Hills.  </li>

            <li>If anything, the newly opened box was surprisingly better as these large bottle, when getting down to 1/3, the alcohol contents tends to start  absorbed the essensial oils of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had kept the box - the original box was white, with no manufacturing information printed on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believed that it was the original Tova since it was in the same packaging.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Scent doesn&#x27;t last for days and days on end like the original .&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have been a TOVA fan for nearly 30 years and know her products very intimately.  </li>
            <li>It is the classic &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; SIGNATURE TOVA.  </li>
            <li>The price was high (over$200), but I had a gift card, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>After some research, what was ascertain, and why price is so high is, this is what is called &amp;#34;Old-New Stock.&amp;#34;  Perfume not bottled in Missouri or wherever.</li>
            <li>and as QVC coined the phrase &amp;#34;Signature&amp;#34; and as not to created confusion or infringement, company was contract to design new box.  </li>

            <li>Let me start by saying, I recently purchased exact Tova in black box.  </li>
            <li>The other thing about previous comment is who has (2) original boxes, with a passion for the perfume and coincidentally finds them as they were tossed into back of a cabinet.  </li>

            <li> Hi, My aunt bought Tova and said it was a fake and sent it back if you want the real tova</li>
            <li> I would buy it in boxes of 5+ and it would last for a few years before re-ordering.  </li>
            <li> Others  (newer models ) are not nearly as comfortable nor do they fir the same.</li>
            <li> I noticed the small print on the back of the box listed a mispelling of TOVA (maybe TOBH?</li>
            <li> Not real perfume!</li>
            <li> she knows the real from a fake</li>
            <li> I used Tova religiously in the late 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> one is softer and less pro dominant .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their is something so off about the previous review.  </li>
            <li> Even my little granddaughter noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li> It was brash and obnoxious smelling.</li>
            <li> She spent the night and told me I had given her the wrong pillow, it didnt smell like Grandma.</li>
            <li> ...my entire family was disappointed with the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; of this fake - Amazon shouldn&#x27;t be dealing with this company or any other that makes imitation TOVA.  </li>
            <li> To, blatanly, bash a product with false imformation is not fair to those that depend on those feedbacks, which leads me to one conclusion:  </li>
            <li> It gets harder to get each year, so thank you Amazon!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So sorry it is discontinued</li>
            <li> This product is terribly disappointing!  </li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s is soooooo soothing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Original bottle and all!!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that I could not use this product.  </li>

            <li> This product is terribly disappointing!  Doesn&#x27;t have the same ingredients as her former product by the same name.  Will never order anything more.  Such a letdown for me and others who dearly loved this fragrance formerly.</li>
            <li> Had a strong alcohol scent.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She loved it and so do I. She bought it a few years ago and it was nice to smell that fragrance again on her.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m always satisfied when I buy it!!</li>
            <li> The spray was, indeed sealed in plastic and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  I have used TOVA since I was in my mid-twenties (I am 54!).  My husband, kids and co-workers all know the smell and have commented on it over the years.  I would buy it in boxes of 5+ and it would last for a few years before re-ordering.  When I went to re-order years ago, and realized it had been discontinued, I scrambled and found some on a drugstore website, and ordered their last 4 boxes.  When it ran out, I started using the &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; spray, but it wasn&#x27;t the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to re-order the signature spray, and saw this add.  The price was high (over$200), but I had a gift card, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging looked genuine, but the smell was off.  My family agreed.  I noticed the small print on the back of the box listed a mispelling of TOVA (maybe TOBH? or something, and it was manufactured somewhere in the midwest - not LA)  I felt like a fool who got scammed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two weeks ago, I did a major Spring clean getting ready to reno my bathroom.  I found TWO boxes of Tova, 100ml 3.4 oz&lt;br /&gt;in the back of my cupboard!!!  I compared bottles and they are different.  This bottle has slightly different gold lettering.  Wish I had kept the box - the original box was white, with no manufacturing information printed on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a smell test with my family and friends and we all agreed that this scent is NOT THE ORIGINAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have a few more years with the original scent - but NOT FROM THIS COMPANY!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; knockoff with a formula close to the original.  I don&#x27;t know, but after comparing to true originals I found,&lt;br /&gt;I THREW IT AWAY!!!</li>
            <li> I believed that it was the original Tova since it was in the same packaging.  It smells awful.  I just blew a lot of money since I bought two of them, and won&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> ...my entire family was disappointed with the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; of this fake - Amazon shouldn&#x27;t be dealing with this company or any other that makes imitation TOVA.  So sorry it is discontinued - it was the only scent I could wear!</li>
            <li> Much prefer the originals!!! Others  (newer models ) are not nearly as comfortable nor do they fir the same.</li>
            <li> It is a very special fragrance that Tova, herself, created.  I have been using it for over twenty five years and have always had people comment on how great it smells.  It gets harder to get each year, so thank you Amazon!!!!!! Margie Eddy-Forbes</li>
            <li> I have been a TOVA fan for nearly 30 years and know her products very intimately.  I&#x27;m not certain where this originated, but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near Beverly Hills.  I paid $100 and I guess it was a lesson well learned.  I have since purchased a similar product from Tova&#x27;s own site and was very happy with that product.  I wish I would have known about Tova&#x27;s own site prior to this purchase . . .</li>
            <li> This is NOT the Tova I have used for years.  It was brash and obnoxious smelling.</li>
            <li> I have worn TOVA for years. But they have changed the formula. Just not the same anymore. Does not last as long. Whenever I can purchase the original,  I am so happy. Worth every penny.  TOVA signature is nice but does not compare with the original . Even my little granddaughter noticed the difference.  She spent the night and told me I had given her the wrong pillow, it didnt smell like Grandma. I had been using Signature because I had run out of Original.lol</li>
            <li> Hi, My aunt bought Tova and said it was a fake and sent it back if you want the real tova here is the info.[...] 1-800-852-9999    My aunts 80 she knows the real from a fake</li>
            <li> Fake!!!!!!!! Not real perfume! Con artist!!!!! DO NOT BUY HERE!</li>
            <li> Been looking for this fragrance for a while, this is the original, very happy with it</li>
            <li> doesnt smell like signature</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original fragrance....I was once again deceived.  No one seems to have the original fragrance any where..not even the TOVA store in Beverly Hills.  The fragrance was changed and even though they state they have the original...it&#x27;s not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very Close to the REAL DEAL.&lt;br /&gt;The closest I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Only differences are...&lt;br /&gt;Scent doesn&#x27;t last for days and days on end like the original .&lt;br /&gt;This one only goes an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;AND&lt;br /&gt;The scent is the same.&lt;br /&gt;However,&lt;br /&gt;This one is softer and less pro dominant .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD VERY MUCH PURCHASE OVER AND OVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Their is something so off about the previous review.  Let me start by saying, I recently purchased exact Tova in black box.  It is the classic &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; SIGNATURE TOVA.  I, too, compared.  If anything, the newly opened box was surprisingly better as these large bottle, when getting down to 1/3, the alcohol contents tends to start  absorbed the essensial oils of fragrance.  The bottle is Identically.  Their was no mispelling on back of box (wish I had original white box.)  Granted, the price is way up there, in comparison to QVC. back when, at $350. (has since been reduced.)  After some research, what was ascertain, and why price is so high is, this is what is called &amp;#34;Old-New Stock.&amp;#34;  Perfume not bottled in Missouri or wherever. and as QVC coined the phrase &amp;#34;Signature&amp;#34; and as not to created confusion or infringement, company was contract to design new box.  As anyone familar with original bottle, it never read Tova Signature on bottle.  That was just on heading.  The other thing about previous comment is who has (2) original boxes, with a passion for the perfume and coincidentally finds them as they were tossed into back of a cabinet.  When one finds your &amp;#34;signature fragrance&amp;#34; i.e.; only one you wear, we stock up and carefully store.  One more thing.  The issue about &amp;#34;even friends could tell the difference on smell me from my originally owned one.&amp;#34;..hard thing to comprehend... not to mentioned, after spending so much money, &amp;#34;she tossed it in garbage.&amp;#34;  Bottom line here is, we depend on your reviews.  To, blatanly, bash a product with false imformation is not fair to those that depend on those feedbacks, which leads me to one conclusion:  You have one listed on one site or another as I&#x27;ve seen them listed on Auction sites with white box for no less than $300.  BUY WITH CONFIDENCE!  THIS IS ORIGINAL TOVA.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, at a good price! Would happily deal with again!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THAT I REQUEST FOR THIS LOVELY PERFUME TOVA BEVERLY HILL EDP FOR WOMEN 100 ML. 3.3 OZ IN A NEW BOX</li>
            <li> This product has no smell whatsoever! I cannot smell it on anything I wear and friends also say they cannot smell it. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Tova is getting very difficult to find and it is the most classy smell</li>
            <li> should have know for that price it wasn&#x27;t the truly original TOVA-</li>
            <li> Not the original. Better to buy the new version from Tova.</li>
            <li> It was everything I missed when it went off the market and came back.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that I could not use this product.  It would not spray.</li>
            <li> I used Tova religiously in the late 90&#x27;s early 2000&#x27;s...... Wore it ony wedding day... It was then only perfume I used..... I have tried several different Tovas over the years trying to coy that original scent to no avail.... Until now..... This is FABULOUS!!!!!!! I even spray it ony girls so I can smell it on them and their clothes!!!! I spray it before I go to bed cuz it&#x27;s is soooooo soothing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Original bottle and all!!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
