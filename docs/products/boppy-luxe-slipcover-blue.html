            <li>It is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>LOVED having the cover for my boppy!  </li>
            <li>I bought my Boppy in 2002 with my 1st son and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I got the covers!</li>
            <li>so it stays in great shape!&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>The cover fits over any boppy and zips around it very nice.  </li>
            <li>This slipcover is a very nice addition to your boppy pillow.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this cover for our baby boys boppy about 2 months ago because I loved the pastel velvet material and the fact that you can take it off and wash it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad he made me get it!</li>
            <li>The cover is easy to remove and put on and washes up great.  </li>
            <li>This has come in so handy.  </li>
            <li>This cover made a nice, neutral background.</li>
            <li>it is perfect for an infant&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My baby was a drippy nurser at first, and it was great to have a layer protecting the boppy.  </li>
            <li>I love this cover.</li>
            <li>When my son was a newborn, I used it constantly and messes just happened, so it was wonderful to unzip it and throw it in the washing machine.  </li>
            <li>I will probably make a better and sturdier one myself.</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li>Buy one of these and you will get alot more use out of your Boppy.</li>
            <li>So this cover came in super handy.</li>
            <li>It looks brand new and is just as wonderful as the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to slip off and on for washing.</li>
            <li>It has a zipper and is easy on-easy off.</li>
            <li>It has held up great so far and its really nice and soft for the baby to lay on.</li>
            <li>I have washed it multiple times now and it still looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>It made it easy to clean the boppy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully soft, fits nicely and is my favorite of the three covers I have.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cover because it is a pretty color as well as being soft and fuzzy.</li>
            <li>so you always have a clean one for your Boppy.</li>
            <li>We purchased two slipcovers so we can always have a clean one on the pillow.</li>
            <li>I love my boppy but the slipcover leaves much to be desired for the price you pay -</li>
            <li>Even our older children loved how soft the cover felt.</li>
            <li>This cover works great for me as a spare slipcover for my boppy that I already have--especially when the other cover is in the wash (which it often!)</li>
            <li>if you are nursing or bottle feeding  You and your baby will love this cover when you feel how soft it is!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still in great condition with just a few stains.  </li>
            <li>I also have some of the cotton boppy slipcovers which are nice, but this one is worth the extra couple of bucks.</li>
            <li>My son loves being propped up in the boppy and like another reviewer mentioned, it makes for much better picture taking than the busy backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I am very glad after the fact for a reason I didn&#x27;t think of at the time: when our baby was small, he had to be propped up during pictures, which meant the boppy appeared in many of them.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad I didn&#x27;t have one of those busy, multi-colored pattern covers.</li>
            <li>I washed it over and over, and always, the stains came right out.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to clean, just unzip, wash it and zip it back on.  </li>
            <li>When I had my daughter in 2005, I bought a pink luxe slipcover and was so pleased with how easy it was to clean and how soft it was after a year of use.  </li>
            <li>Even if you have a boppy, buy the cover and give it a makeover and its alot easier to wash the cover than the whole boppy!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think of this when we first bought it</li>
            <li>it prevents our almost 2-year-old from being able to open it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO soft!!!!  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it is a nice, soft cover for the essential boppy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because my husband really encouraged me to buy this slipcover for our boppy pillow.  </li>
            <li>This Boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and certainly my son doesn&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>The covers are also very durable.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to all nursing Moms!</li>
            <li>It washes very well.</li>
            <li>Really nice cover and get a few</li>
            <li>These are super soft against your baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it is easy enough for any adult.</li>
            <li>and it is still just as soft as the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and washes and wears very well.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, but it didn&#x27;t feel very durable to me.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without my boppy pillow, so this cover was a must have.</li>
            <li>The cover is easy to get on and off and the zipper is hidden well.</li>
            <li>It feels very soft and is so convenient to remove in order to wash.  </li>
            <li>This cover is very soft....</li>
            <li>This cover is so thin that you can see the pattern on most Boppys right through it.</li>
            <li>He loves the soft texture and so do I!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and convenient to remove the cover and throw it in the laundry, rather than washing the entire Boppy pillow and waiting for it to dry.  </li>
            <li>They wash so easily, and it keeps my Boppy from getting messy.</li>
            <li>The fabric is really soft</li>
            <li>I find it to be sturdy and soft.</li>
            <li>It only works well on light colored or white solid Boppys.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve washed it in the washing machine several times, and it&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a soft, simple, durable Boppy slipcover, I&#x27;d highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>You really need to wash it by itself so that the lint from other articles of clothing do not attach to it in the wash.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it is a little more fragile than some of the plainer covers, but it seems to be holding up quite well to daily usage and a few washes so far.</li>
            <li>You can wash it instead of the whole pillow which takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li>The only real improvement I would like to see is to have a waterproof lining or something to protect the Boppy even more since it is a little difficult to wash.  </li>

            <li> I bought two - pink and blue.</li>
            <li> I have this slipcover in blue and pink.  </li>
            <li> but I think I would not choose this type of cover again because it is so thin and lets spit up or moisture right through to the boppy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing at least one, preferrably two, of these covers.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about buying it since you can wash the actual pillow in the washing machine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if the pattern shows through because it&#x27;s  not really part of the decor of my house.</li>
            <li> the texture prevents my babies from slipping off or out of the Boppy.  </li>
            <li> Trying to keep a wet Boppy balanced in your washing machine so it won&#x27;t bounce out the door is a bit of a task.</li>
            <li> a side note, I had another daughter this year and I am using my pink slipcover again.  </li>
            <li> One for the pillow while the other one is in the laundry.  </li>
            <li> I bought two of these;  one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside.  </li>
            <li> but the zipper is just hard enough to get to that</li>
            <li> My son is a bit of a messy nurser and we experience lots of drips.  </li>
            <li> I constantly have to cut the strings:-(</li>
            <li> I was a little leary of purchasing one because of some bad reviews I read, but I was tired of trying to wash the pillow in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> These slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing!  </li>
            <li> I just hated having to wash it all of the time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> One for the pillow while the other one is in the laundry.  Spit-ups, leaks, etc. happen!  These are super soft against your baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We purchased this cover for our baby boys boppy about 2 months ago because I loved the pastel velvet material and the fact that you can take it off and wash it.  It has held up great so far and its really nice and soft for the baby to lay on. The cover fits over any boppy and zips around it very nice.  Even if you have a boppy, buy the cover and give it a makeover and its alot easier to wash the cover than the whole boppy!  This cover is a must no matter if you are nursing or bottle feeding  You and your baby will love this cover when you feel how soft it is!</li>
            <li> I love this cover. I bought two - pink and blue. I was a little leary of purchasing one because of some bad reviews I read, but I was tired of trying to wash the pillow in the washing machine. I am very glad I got the covers! They wash so easily, and it keeps my Boppy from getting messy. I don&#x27;t care if the pattern shows through because it&#x27;s  not really part of the decor of my house. It&#x27;s a practical item. The covers are also very durable. I highly recommend purchasing at least one, preferrably two, of these covers.</li>
            <li> This slipcover is a very nice addition to your boppy pillow.  It feels very soft and is so convenient to remove in order to wash.  You can wash it instead of the whole pillow which takes a long time to dry.  When my son was a newborn, I used it constantly and messes just happened, so it was wonderful to unzip it and throw it in the washing machine.  I have washed it multiple times now and it still looks and feels great.  You really need to wash it by itself so that the lint from other articles of clothing do not attach to it in the wash.  I also have some of the cotton boppy slipcovers which are nice, but this one is worth the extra couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> This has come in so handy.  My son loves being propped up in the boppy and like another reviewer mentioned, it makes for much better picture taking than the busy backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;And since I have a spitty baby, it makes cleanup a breeze.  My boppy doesn&#x27;t need to be washed that often so it stays in great shape!&lt;br /&gt;Get one to protect your investment!</li>
            <li> I like the softness of the luxe cover but I think I would not choose this type of cover again because it is so thin and lets spit up or moisture right through to the boppy.  Also, the pattern on my boppy shows through and I have had to resew the seams on my slipcover multiple times in multiple places because they pulled apart in the 5 months that I have been using it.  I love my boppy but the slipcover leaves much to be desired for the price you pay - I will probably make a better and sturdier one myself.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for 10 months on our alphabet print Boppy and it&#x27;s still in great condition with just a few stains.  yes, the alphabets show through but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and certainly my son doesn&#x27;t care.  He loves the soft texture and so do I!</li>
            <li> I have twins, so I use my Boppys a lot.  I have this slipcover in blue and pink.  The fabric is really soft the texture prevents my babies from slipping off or out of the Boppy.  The cover is easy to remove and put on and washes up great.  The only real improvement I would like to see is to have a waterproof lining or something to protect the Boppy even more since it is a little difficult to wash.  Overall, very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cover on my boppy pillow for 8 months and with every feeding at home.  It&#x27;s soft and washes and wears very well.  I even took my boppy with this cover to nurse my baby when I had him in the hospital.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is a nice, soft cover for the essential boppy.  I am very glad after the fact for a reason I didn&#x27;t think of at the time: when our baby was small, he had to be propped up during pictures, which meant the boppy appeared in many of them.  I was so glad I didn&#x27;t have one of those busy, multi-colored pattern covers. This cover made a nice, neutral background.</li>
            <li> This cover works great for me as a spare slipcover for my boppy that I already have--especially when the other cover is in the wash (which it often!) I find it to be sturdy and soft.</li>
            <li> This cover is very soft....it is perfect for an infant&#x27;s sensitive skin.  We used our boppy quite a bit and still do to some extent.  Even our older children loved how soft the cover felt.</li>
            <li> This cover is so thin that you can see the pattern on most Boppys right through it. It only works well on light colored or white solid Boppys. It is soft, but it didn&#x27;t feel very durable to me. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> These slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing!  I bought two of these;  one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside.  I constantly have to cut the strings:-(</li>
            <li> LOVED having the cover for my boppy!  My baby was a drippy nurser at first, and it was great to have a layer protecting the boppy.  It&#x27;s also easy to slip off and on for washing.</li>
            <li> Really nice cover and get a few so you always have a clean one for your Boppy.</li>
            <li> I used this with my third child.  I washed it over and over, and always, the stains came right out.  It&#x27;s SO soft!!!!  Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because my husband really encouraged me to buy this slipcover for our boppy pillow.  I was a little unsure about buying it since you can wash the actual pillow in the washing machine.  I&#x27;m glad he made me get it! My son is a bit of a messy nurser and we experience lots of drips.  It&#x27;s so easy and convenient to remove the cover and throw it in the laundry, rather than washing the entire Boppy pillow and waiting for it to dry.  We purchased two slipcovers so we can always have a clean one on the pillow. I recommend this product if you&#x27;d like to maintain the integrity of your Boppy pillow!</li>
            <li> Just because you can (and you will) wash your Boppy Pillow don&#x27;t let that keep yopu from getting one of their covers. Trying to keep a wet Boppy balanced in your washing machine so it won&#x27;t bounce out the door is a bit of a task. The cover is easy to get on and off and the zipper is hidden well. I didn&#x27;t think of this when we first bought it but the zipper is just hard enough to get to that it prevents our almost 2-year-old from being able to open it but it is easy enough for any adult. Our 5 month-old uses this pillow to sit in. It gives her alot of support and we don&#x27;t have to be paranoid about either of our girls messing it up. Buy one of these and you will get alot more use out of your Boppy.</li>
            <li> This Boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well. We&#x27;ve washed it in the washing machine several times, and it&#x27;s very durable. If you&#x27;re looking for a soft, simple, durable Boppy slipcover, I&#x27;d highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I bought my Boppy in 2002 with my 1st son and I loved it!  I just hated having to wash it all of the time.  When I had my daughter in 2005, I bought a pink luxe slipcover and was so pleased with how easy it was to clean and how soft it was after a year of use.  So, when my 2nd son was born in 2006, I bought this blue luxe slipcover.  It is wonderful!  It is so easy to clean, just unzip, wash it and zip it back on.  I used it for a year also and it is still just as soft as the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Just a side note, I had another daughter this year and I am using my pink slipcover again.  It looks brand new and is just as wonderful as the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to all nursing Moms!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderfully soft, fits nicely and is my favorite of the three covers I have.  My son loves the feel of it too.  The only drawback is that it is a little more fragile than some of the plainer covers, but it seems to be holding up quite well to daily usage and a few washes so far.</li>
            <li> My child was a puker. So this cover came in super handy. It made it easy to clean the boppy. It has a zipper and is easy on-easy off. I couldn&#x27;t live without my boppy pillow, so this cover was a must have.</li>
            <li> This is a great cover because it is a pretty color as well as being soft and fuzzy. It washes very well.</li>
