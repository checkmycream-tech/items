    <ol>
            <li>Worked great for her!</li>
            <li>but I am still happy with it and works for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to have to show the patients how to manage their meds.</li>
            <li>Great product, thank you.</li>
            <li>Great for travel as well as for say to day.</li>
            <li>So that made me pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a good way to organize them.  </li>
            <li>My Father loves this handy pill keeper.</li>
            <li>Some nice features but</li>
            <li>but she gets to take them on her own.</li>
            <li>The Ezy Dose Four-A-Day is great when you have to take a lot of medication, and the single day compartments are awesome because you can take your compartment out and set it on the table where you wont forget to take your medication for the day.</li>
            <li>I would reccommed this product to anyone with many types and times they need their medication.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my fault, I guess, for reading the size better.  </li>
            <li>My husband has to take many pills each day.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>These are the best pill holders if you take several vitamins and medications.</li>
            <li>Need to focus more, I reckon.  </li>
            <li>I bought a better one at the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li>As described&lt;br /&gt;The requirement for 18 or more words will make me stop doing the reviews.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery 7 Great price</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find this type of organizer in any store.</li>
            <li>I just wish I had paid better attention.  </li>
            <li>It looks so much better now that the bottles are stored, and I can easily slide this organizer into a drawer.</li>
            <li>The multiple compartments fit my needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, a good product with large spaces for vitamins and pills.</li>
            <li>ut still am able to fit all my meds</li>
            <li>Most of my pills cant fit in the compartments,  Even if i put i per section.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill.  </li>
            <li>Compact and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>Easy to combine my meds as I need them.  </li>
            <li>An okay value but the boxes need to be deeper for users on many meds or large pill/tablet sizes.  </li>
            <li>Removable daily trays can is great for leaving house for the day and carrying meds along.</li>
            <li>but my pills fit</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of &#x27;horse pills&#x27; to take, they won&#x27;t all fit.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t fit my needs.</li>
            <li>I gave 3 stars because there description of this product should have been more in my face and not so much in the fine print.</li>
            <li>They are certain to keep them safe in their place.</li>
            <li>I also love that each day pops out of the main compartment so if you&#x27;re going away for the weekend, just pop out Saturday and Sunday</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 7 years!</li>
            <li>To be sure, it&#x27;s a very nice 28-compartment organizer; but those compartments are very small; if you need to fit more than 2 or 3 big pills, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edit- Found a much bigger, more useful version at Wal-Mart for cheaper.  </li>
            <li>only thing that would make it better is if each days container locked.</li>
            <li>i take many big supplements, and after it arrived, i realized that it wouldn&#x27;t hold my supplements.</li>
            <li>and she needed to be able to separate his meds for different times during the day.  </li>
            <li>Most persons who want twice daily AM and PM dosing have to make the adjustment that noon dose is AM of week two.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were shipped fast, they are worth the cost and made well.  </li>
            <li>It could also be used if tablets are to be taken more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;The individual compartments have a snap lid for closure that is secure and will not open accidentally in normal use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This really helped her, she has commented how much she likes using it</li>
            <li>you can fill it for the whole week.</li>
            <li>This product is very hepful to our patients.  </li>
            <li>And they are made very sturdy...</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>I would also like others to know I have seen this very organizer at the Dollar Tree for one dollar.</li>
            <li>This is a very practical product for anyone wishing to have their tablets sorted out over a period of two weeks for morning and evening doses.</li>
            <li>So this product if very useful to him he can take the Day he needs out and put it in his pocket and with the different times of day (AM,Afternoon &amp; Dinner)on</li>
            <li>Easy in and out for single day carrying.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The individual pill containers (AM, PM, etc) aren&#x27;t large enough to accomodate too many larger pills (like calcium).  </li>
            <li>Just the right size for 5 different pills taken throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Instead I got a very large white pill organizer - not at all what I had ordered.</li>
            <li>He first one last 4 years till now.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased; the first one lasted 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to measurements as this product is small NOT medium.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 of these for my 86 year old mom and they allow me to help her sort her pills</li>
            <li>You might as well get the big one for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>I especially would recommend this for older people.</li>
            <li>It is only appropriate for the small tablets.  </li>
            <li>This product comes with a &amp;#34;push-tab&amp;#34; you have to push hard to be able to open the lid of this</li>
            <li>Somewhat difficult to open the containers, would not be good for elderly hands.  </li>
            <li>Why I gave it 4 stars is that I had to use the one time of day for two of his larger pills as they all couldn&#x27;t fit into the small boxes</li>
            <li>Recently he has been unable to do his own medication</li>
            <li>Sometimes forgetful on if a particular med was taken.  </li>
            <li>Visually the product is also different the containers are clear and not blue as in the photo.</li>
            <li>The boxes were way too small, I expected the compartments to be the size of my regular med box, I couldn&#x27;t even get my calcium pill to fit into the container.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The containers were too difficult to open, I really had to pry it  open with a spoon to get my meds,  Too much money for something I just had to throw into the recycling bin.  </li>
            <li> My Husband has to take his medication at different times of the day, and he works long hours.</li>
            <li> This med organizer is easy to use and so helpful in administering complicated meds.  </li>
            <li> It is so much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I expected the units to be a bit larger.</li>
            <li> Too little holes, not big enough to hold my pills for each time I take them.</li>
            <li> I had to send this one back to get a larger size this one was not large enough for the amount of meds I take, although it is just as well made as the other, it was too small.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was a little bigger for those fish oil pills</li>
            <li> 1200 mg of pills is roughly about the max of each time-slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He knows that when a section is empty that he&#x27;s taken his medication.</li>
            <li> Product is a little tight for big pills.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other kinds that broke after very little use.</li>
            <li> After reviewing a few of them, I decided on the Four-A-Day, Weekly, One Day At A Time Medication Organizer - Medium.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Also, my MIL (92 yo), had a difficult time with the containers because they are smaller than what she is used to.</li>
            <li> The space is just too small for my every meal medications.</li>
            <li> it is too small</li>
            <li> I only get that talkative when something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding one in stores.  </li>
            <li> She was getting confused with all of them.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even realize that the days actually pop out from the base so you can take them with you.</li>

            <li> To be sure, it&#x27;s a very nice 28-compartment organizer; but those compartments are very small; if you need to fit more than 2 or 3 big pills, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit- Found a much bigger, more useful version at Wal-Mart for cheaper.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I got this to help organize my grandmother&#x27;s medications.  She was getting confused with all of them. This really helped her, she has commented how much she likes using it and she can just day one day out with her.  I was hoping it was a little bigger for those fish oil pills but it does work..</li>
            <li> My husband has Alzheimer&#x27;s and takes medication three different times a day. Recently he has been unable to do his own medication so I have to do it for him. I have looked and looked for a pill box that would have three different time periods on it and just couldn&#x27;t find one. Then I saw this and ordered it, not only does it have places for four different times of day you can fill it for the whole week. Why I gave it 4 stars is that I had to use the one time of day for two of his larger pills as they all couldn&#x27;t fit into the small boxes but I am still happy with it and works for me.</li>
            <li> This product is very hepful to our patients.  This is a great tool to have to show the patients how to manage their meds.</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
            <li> My Husband has to take his medication at different times of the day, and he works long hours. So this product if very useful to him he can take the Day he needs out and put it in his pocket and with the different times of day (AM,Afternoon &amp; Dinner)on it he keeps his pills seperated. I would reccommed this product to anyone with many types and times they need their medication. He first one last 4 years till now. Had a hard time finding one in stores.  Thank you Barbara</li>
            <li> Great for travel as well as for say to day. Removable daily trays can is great for leaving house for the day and carrying meds along.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fault, I guess, for reading the size better.  The individual pill containers (AM, PM, etc) aren&#x27;t large enough to accomodate too many larger pills (like calcium).  Also, my MIL (92 yo), had a difficult time with the containers because they are smaller than what she is used to.</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to open the containers, would not be good for elderly hands.  Otherwise, a good product with large spaces for vitamins and pills.</li>
            <li> The space is just too small for my every meal medications. It would help if the dimension of the box is indicated in the product description.</li>
            <li> thought it was a bigger size.  ut still am able to fit all my meds</li>
            <li> It is so much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The product is as described. My wife takes lots of meds and we use it for her.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would make it better is if each days container locked. We had one years ago that locked and can&#x27;t find another one.</li>
            <li> My Father loves this handy pill keeper. Just the right size for 5 different pills taken throughout the day. Easy in and out for single day carrying.</li>
            <li> I had to send this one back to get a larger size this one was not large enough for the amount of meds I take, although it is just as well made as the other, it was too small. I you do not take horse pills and you only take a couple of pills at a time this may work for you.</li>
            <li> I got it to take on my vacation and it worked well for my intended use. It was smaller than I thought it would be but my pills fit so I could close it and it held the pills during travel.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill.  Held all the pills needed for our trip.  Compact and easy to travel with.  All as promised.</li>
            <li> The Ezy Dose Four-A-Day is great when you have to take a lot of medication, and the single day compartments are awesome because you can take your compartment out and set it on the table where you wont forget to take your medication for the day.</li>
            <li> My husband has to take many pills each day.  What a good way to organize them.  When you fill the organizer you can tell a week in advance when you need to reorder.  I especially would recommend this for older people.</li>
            <li> Extremely tiny.  Most of my pills cant fit in the compartments,  Even if i put i per section.</li>
            <li> I love this. Fits my needs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that there&#x27;s not a lot of space in each compartment. If you have a lot of &#x27;horse pills&#x27; to take, they won&#x27;t all fit. 1200 mg of pills is roughly about the max of each time-slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even realize that the days actually pop out from the base so you can take them with you. So that made me pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this. But I lost my Sunday, so now I need to buy me another one... d&#x27;oh.</li>
            <li> These are the best pill holders if you take several vitamins and medications. And they are made very sturdy...I&#x27;ve tried several other kinds that broke after very little use.</li>
            <li> I am always forgetting if I have taken my medication.  I wish I could say it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m getting older but I can&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve always been this way.  Need to focus more, I reckon.  Anyway, I decided to purchase one of those medication organizers but didn&#x27;t know which one.  After reviewing a few of them, I decided on the Four-A-Day, Weekly, One Day At A Time Medication Organizer - Medium.  I set it up one day a week then take my medication as prescribed.  Don&#x27;t have to worry now about my forgetting a dose here, a dose there.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> An okay value but the boxes need to be deeper for users on many meds or large pill/tablet sizes.  I like how the days of the weeks are on the boxes and how the boxes lock into the trays.  Some nice features but the size of the individual  boxes is the draw back on this product.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this box.  The first one lasted 7 years! The multiple compartments fit my needs perfectly.  Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> The boxes were way too small, I expected the compartments to be the size of my regular med box, I couldn&#x27;t even get my calcium pill to fit into the container.  The containers were too difficult to open, I really had to pry it  open with a spoon to get my meds,  Too much money for something I just had to throw into the recycling bin.  Some people might like it but it didn&#x27;t fit my needs. I bought a better one at the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> Easy to combine my meds as I need them.  And they do not float around the dish so it&#x27;s easier to place and keep meds in their spot.</li>
            <li> i take many big supplements, and after it arrived, i realized that it wouldn&#x27;t hold my supplements. it is too small</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased; the first one lasted 10 years.  I use it for a 2 week supply (morning and night) for my prescription meds and vitamins.  I also love that each day pops out of the main compartment so if you&#x27;re going away for the weekend, just pop out Saturday and Sunday and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> As described&lt;br /&gt;The requirement for 18 or more words will make me stop doing the reviews. I only get that talkative when something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to measurements as this product is small NOT medium. Despite having four sections, morn,noon,eve,bed it does not hold all my medications and supplements. Visually the product is also different the containers are clear and not blue as in the photo. I would also like others to know I have seen this very organizer at the Dollar Tree for one dollar.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these for my 86 year old mom and they allow me to help her sort her pills but she gets to take them on her own.</li>
            <li> I had bought this to get all my medicine and vitamin bottles off my counter. It looks so much better now that the bottles are stored, and I can easily slide this organizer into a drawer. I also use one for my father to keep his medication organized. He knows that when a section is empty that he&#x27;s taken his medication. I recommend buying a size larger than you think you need. I expected the units to be a bit larger.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery 7 Great price</li>
            <li> I wanted a medium organizer in blue - as pictured.  Instead I got a very large white pill organizer - not at all what I had ordered.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves it.  Her husband has Alzheimer&amp;#34;s and she needed to be able to separate his meds for different times during the day.  Worked great for her!</li>
            <li> This med organizer is easy to use and so helpful in administering complicated meds.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find this type of organizer in any store.</li>
            <li> Sometimes forgetful on if a particular med was taken.  This product meets my needs.  I would recommend others purchase if need to keep up with when med is taken.</li>
            <li> Product is a little tight for big pills.  It is only appropriate for the small tablets.  You might as well get the big one for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> This is a very practical product for anyone wishing to have their tablets sorted out over a period of two weeks for morning and evening doses. It could also be used if tablets are to be taken more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;The individual compartments have a snap lid for closure that is secure and will not open accidentally in normal use.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the labeling is for dosing four times daily. Most persons who want twice daily AM and PM dosing have to make the adjustment that noon dose is AM of week two.</li>
            <li> Too little holes, not big enough to hold my pills for each time I take them. I got One At walmart. Since you edited my review to suit your needs just do away with it all together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fault for not paying attention to the finer details.  This product comes with a &amp;#34;push-tab&amp;#34; you have to push hard to be able to open the lid of this container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it for traveling - where you&#x27;ve packed your meds in your luggage.  They are certain to keep them safe in their place. But if you have a lot of pain using your hands - STAY AWAY and do not get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped fast, they are worth the cost and made well.  I just wish I had paid better attention.  I gave 3 stars because there description of this product should have been more in my face and not so much in the fine print.</li>
