    <ol>
            <li>this set of nail color is perfect!</li>
            <li>This is a great price for some \\&quot;girl fun\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>Very good deal for six nail polishes!</li>
            <li>, that I definately loved!  </li>
            <li>The colors are metalic, they look very nice.</li>
            <li>They will do nicely!</li>
            <li>I liked the colors on the picture</li>
            <li>Every bottle was nicely packed.</li>
            <li>They are, which is alright if you want that kind of look.</li>
            <li>Nothing really spectacular for me.</li>
            <li>But the quality of the polish is great, it dries quickly, and coats well.</li>
            <li>this line is perfect for any kind of french manicure you want.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great, exactly what was pictured.  </li>
            <li>Kleancolor is honestly my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I use these with either a translucent pearlescent or translucent subtle-glitter nail polish, which gives me many more options when mixing and matching finishes.  </li>
            <li>Once you start to add more costs, though, the color shows better.</li>
            <li>Love the nail polish colors in this kit.  </li>
            <li>The polish is okay.</li>
            <li>I will now be more cautious (although how cautious can you really be) about buying polish online because I was not at all happy.</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>love these colors.</li>
            <li>i love the colors and they are very shinny, but i feel they chip very easily.</li>
            <li>The semi-sheer colors are very pretty when applied to your nails, even more so than they appear in the bottles.</li>
            <li>Beautiful light pale colors that are a cream not sparkly and cheap looking</li>
            <li>Useful with the assortment of light shades</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, but chip easily and quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will order some of the companies other sets.</li>
            <li>Very pretty look.</li>
            <li>These nail polishes are very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>3 coats works pretty good, but still sheer.</li>
            <li>the colors are slightly gel like,  and blends perfectly with the white.</li>
            <li>they wear really well, and the colors are true, you don&#x27;t have to put on coat after coat.</li>
            <li>But the colors were kinda opaque and when I tried them on my nails it was more like transparent with a hint (tiny one) of each color.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend, and I am a polish freak!!</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first</li>
            <li>They are very sheer with 1 coat, but you can get a more opaque look with 2-3 coats.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>To be honest - I was doubtful these polishes would be any good, but they are!</li>
            <li>but I have had good luck with Kleancolor polishes in the past.</li>
            <li>packaging is neatly done and each bottle was carefully wrapped in a bubble wrap.i love this set of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.  </li>
            <li>The polish dries fast and seems to wear very well.</li>
            <li>They came  packed very well also.</li>
            <li>I still really like them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These colors are very sheer, and is nice for a French manicure.</li>
            <li>I have ordered nail polish on Amazon and other websites many times before and never had a problem.</li>
            <li>The product itself looks OK, one color looks a little watery</li>
            <li>Very pretty shades of pink and a very muted brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They dry quickly and wear well.</li>
            <li>As someone who owns a wide variety of polish colors and brands, I can say that I was surprised with the quality of such a cheap product.</li>
            <li>A few of the colors tend toward a more sheer finish.  </li>
            <li>If you are going for the 1-2 coat, sheer look, make sure to use one of those nail prepping files (the kind with a few different sides to smooth out nails) and a ridge filling base coat so that the polish looks smooth once dried.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are a bit smaller than normal, but not by much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its thick,  dries smooth, and comes in every color and texture i could want.  </li>
            <li>If you put on only one coat, they all look the same clear shade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have fun over the next few weeks trying out every color in the set.</li>

            <li> Sheer Peach, Sheer Pastel Pink, Sheer Pastel Purple, Sheer Pastel Grey, Sheer Pastel Cocoa, Sheer Pastel</li>
            <li> These colors are so pretty and delicate.</li>
            <li> It flakes off, and after less than a day, you can remove it completely just by scratching it off with a fingernail.</li>
            <li> I use these pale pink polishes when l want to feel very girly and feminine.</li>
            <li> If they were just a tad bit less sheer, I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas for someone else and the receiver loves pink so this should be a winner.</li>
            <li> 4 out of the 6 bottles were partially opened and leaking polish.</li>
            <li> The colors are very delicate, feminine, and classy.</li>
            <li> only negative is the names of the colors should be included in the item description.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews before I ordered these, so I was expecting them to be at least somewhat sheer.</li>
            <li> At least for me, this polish lasts as long as the OPI brand (about 7 days before chipping).</li>
            <li> After a while it seemed to be a little goopy/messy.</li>
            <li> So you have to add at least 4 coats to get close to the colors on the picture.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a horrible mess because they were each wrapped in paper, but now I have 4 bottles of brand new polish that the tops are already stuck shut and the bottles are covered in polish and I haven&#x27;t even used them yet.</li>
            <li> The color names are weird, so ignore them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re neutral colors and not too flashy which I like</li>

            <li> this set of nail color is perfect! packaging is neatly done and each bottle was carefully wrapped in a bubble wrap.i love this set of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors on the picture so I order them. Every bottle was nicely packed. But the colors were kinda opaque and when I tried them on my nails it was more like transparent with a hint (tiny one) of each color.

            <li> Beautiful light pale colors that are a cream not sparkly and cheap looking, that I definately loved!  Each bottle is wrapped individually as to not to break by the saler and I received in a prompt manner via usps.  I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor is honestly my favorite.  its thick,  dries smooth, and comes in every color and texture i could want.  this line is perfect for any kind of french manicure you want.  the colors are slightly gel like,  and blends perfectly with the white.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.  A few of the colors tend toward a more sheer finish.  I use these with either a translucent pearlescent or translucent subtle-glitter nail polish, which gives me many more options when mixing and matching finishes.  But the quality of the polish is great, it dries quickly, and coats well.</li>
            <li> Like the colors but the polish only last for 2 days</li>
            <li> Very sheer. If you put on only one coat, they all look the same clear shade. Once you start to add more costs, though, the color shows better. 3 coats works pretty good, but still sheer. The colors are very delicate, feminine, and classy. If they were just a tad bit less sheer, I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews before I ordered these, so I was expecting them to be at least somewhat sheer. They are, which is alright if you want that kind of look. Depending on which polish you use, it takes 2-3 coats to get a non-sheer look. I actually like that though because you can get 2 different looks from one bottle. If you are going for the 1-2 coat, sheer look, make sure to use one of those nail prepping files (the kind with a few different sides to smooth out nails) and a ridge filling base coat so that the polish looks smooth once dried.  As someone who owns a wide variety of polish colors and brands, I can say that I was surprised with the quality of such a cheap product.

            <li> These nail polishes are very pretty colors. I&#x27;m using these as bridal shower favors. They will do nicely! They came  packed very well also. Very good deal for six nail polishes!</li>
            <li> These colors are so pretty and delicate. They dry quickly and wear well. My polish did not chip for 5 days. Will definitely order this brand again.</li>
            <li> i love the colors and they are very shinny, but i feel they chip very easily.</li>
            <li> Excelente el articulo me llego en buen estado y funciona a la perfección!</li>
            <li> Love the nail polish colors in this kit.  This was a Christmas for someone else and the receiver loves pink so this should be a winner.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, exactly what was pictured.  The polish, however, is not durable at all.  It flakes off, and after less than a day, you can remove it completely just by scratching it off with a fingernail.</li>
            <li> The polish is okay. Nothing really spectacular for me. After a while it seemed to be a little goopy/messy. They&#x27;re neutral colors and not too flashy which I like so that&#x27;s where the three stars come from.</li>
            <li> You must buy these nail polishes!! they wear really well, and the colors are true, you don&#x27;t have to put on coat after coat. The colors are metalic, they look very nice. Would highly recommend, and I am a polish freak!!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, but chip easily and quickly</li>
            <li> Useful with the assortment of light shades</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first or I would have realized how sheer these were.  I still really like them.  Very pretty shades of pink and a very muted brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is the names of the colors should be included in the item description.</li>
            <li> These colors are very sheer, and is nice for a French manicure. I gave it a 4 star since one of my bottle was slightly open and some content spilled inside the box.</li>
            <li> I have ordered nail polish on Amazon and other websites many times before and never had a problem. This package came with six bottles wrapped in paper, put inside of a bubble envelope inside another bubble envelope. The package smelled like nail polish without even opening it. 4 out of the 6 bottles were partially opened and leaking polish. It didn&#x27;t make a horrible mess because they were each wrapped in paper, but now I have 4 bottles of brand new polish that the tops are already stuck shut and the bottles are covered in polish and I haven&#x27;t even used them yet. I will now be more cautious (although how cautious can you really be) about buying polish online because I was not at all happy. The product itself looks OK, one color looks a little watery but I have had good luck with Kleancolor polishes in the past.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Thanks</li>
            <li> Includes: Sheer Peach, Sheer Pastel Pink, Sheer Pastel Purple, Sheer Pastel Grey, Sheer Pastel Cocoa, Sheer Pastel Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these colors. They are very sheer with 1 coat, but you can get a more opaque look with 2-3 coats.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast delivery!  I bought this item as a gift for my granddaughter who lives in North Carolina and she simply loves it!</li>
