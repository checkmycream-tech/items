            <li>The Zuzu mascara worked great.</li>
            <li>This liner somehow manages to have the best applicator, the best formula, and it&#x27;s mineral and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and stays on, too!  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>

            <li>So glad I found this!</li>
            <li>I have many products that irritate my eyes, this line has been a good choice for me..</li>
            <li>This is a very nice liner and went on smoothly</li>
            <li>Stays on all day, comes off easily with water!</li>
            <li>The applicator brush is of great design so it is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love this non-toxic eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Love this brand of liner.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Better than Tarte.  </li>
            <li>and this is my favorite</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love this liner.</li>
            <li>I also love the look of liquid liner.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews on organic/low-chemical count makeup and zuzu luxe came most recommended.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m in love with this</li>
            <li>The Zuzu goes on smoothly and STAYS there!</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love everything about their liquid eyeliner and mascara.  </li>
            <li>Cannot use it...had better results with a powder shadow applied at my lash line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO pleased with the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering this one again and in more colors.</li>
            <li>has pretty good staying power.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!</li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon makes this easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>It glides on easily &amp; with precision.  </li>
            <li>What I got from Amazon was the perfect consistency, making it easy to apply a nice thin line.</li>
            <li>I luv the fact that I&#x27;m using chemical free cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the best liquid eyeliner available in this modern world.  </li>
            <li>I was on the search for a natural ingredient based eyeliner to replace my Tarte cream eyeliner that I loved.  </li>
            <li>I have used this eyeliner for several years and find it really works great!</li>
            <li>This dark brown adds a nice pop that looks really good with my hair and skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applies easily, dries relatively quickly, and stays put all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new love!</li>
            <li>The first time I have been able to wear mascara in 10 years</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly, is a rich brown color and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Of all the eyeliners I have tried with low amounts of preservatives this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It freaked me out when I first put it on, because it showed up a light brown, almost copper.</li>
            <li>I like that this is more natural.</li>
            <li>I tried it right away.  </li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t get this color because it was a light brown in liquid form; fortunately, I took it home anyway and found that it dries to a deep brown/black color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I prefer different natural liquid eyeliners with a better brush, which are easily removed at night, and which have a brown with reddish undertones (making a warmer brownâ€”this brown was flat and seemed more of a brown-black, than</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, as long as you buy a fresh tube.  </li>
            <li>it was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>and they stay on pretty well without fading or smudging.  </li>
            <li>This is my first liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>This is the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ll be sticking with it.</li>
            <li>It felt like other eyeliners kind of clogged my pores and prevented my lashes from growing well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few liners, from Maybelline to Stila, and this is by far the longest lasting and the best color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, easy and does what you buy it for.  </li>
            <li>Tuareg is a VERY pretty, soft, flattering shade of brown.  </li>
            <li>Makeup is a real problem for me.  </li>
            <li>It is very pigmented, dries fast on the eyelid and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I found this originally in Whole Foods, but I don&#x27;t get there often.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting  much</li>
            <li>I did not bother my eyelids like most other products.  </li>
            <li>WAY better than black pearl.  </li>
            <li>So in making the switch, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for another liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>product is hard to remove in the evenings event with coconut oil and a warm washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors I chose are very natural looking</li>
            <li>/&gt;Boy was I surprised!</li>
            <li>I can put this on in the morning and it will look pretty much the same in the evening, even if I went for a several-mile run outside at some point during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cudos  to Zuzu for a great cruel free product!</li>
            <li>(Think about it; do you really want to be putting chemicals next to your eyeballs every day of your life?)</li>
            <li>color is a dark dark brown, which is actually really nice on me</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve settled on tuareg for my green eyes), and it&#x27;s relatively healthy for a facial cosmetic.</li>
            <li>My eyes can be sensitive, but I had high hopes that this would be the different product.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is my favorite liquid liner ever.</li>
            <li>aka brown looks like a very light brown in the bottle but darkens up very quickly to a dark brown black as it dries.</li>
            <li>all of my daily use personal care products to safer, greener alternatives (nothing higher than a 2 on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database).</li>
            <li>clean, flowing application without awkward clumping or smudging; FABULOUS all-day wear.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to find gluten free make up products.  </li>
            <li>a brown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price makes it more appealing than more expensive brands, but I found the clunky felt-tip brush made it difficult to work with and that was frustrating early in the mornings.</li>
            <li>It dries much darker, however, to a typical brownish-black.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the stuff works better than any other non-natural eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

            <li> A few extra shades of this liner are a definite for me, I&#x27;ve been afraid of liquid liner in the past, but this one is nice.</li>
            <li> THe burning is pretty bad when I first apply, then seems to settle down a bit.</li>

            <li> There are only a few products on this planet I am set on for life.</li>
            <li> Not sure who names these things, but maybe a description of the color instead of &amp;#34;tuareg&amp;#34; (and having to ask other customers, who all have a different opinion) would be helpful.  </li>
            <li> Will not be buying any of their other products.</li>
            <li> used to used a Maybelline liquid eyeliner that would inevitably flake off sometime during the day, would get into my my eye, would irritate the ever living  out of my eyes, and to top it all off, look horribly awkward and give me the general appearance of some crazy zombie.</li>
            <li> I need this product in a dark taupe color , and a dark tan brown.</li>
            <li> brush is a bit thick and makes it difficult to draw a nice thin line&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Black seems to be a bit too stark looking.</li>
            <li> In the past I bought some at Whole Foods that they must have had on their shelf for awhile, and it was too thick to apply a thin line.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use harsh chemicals on my body and have been an Aveda addict for years, but..</li>
            <li> And yet, I like this eyeliner just as well as past favorites,</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot and either the brush sucks or the formula sucks.</li>
            <li> Color is too dark, and liner is very irritating to my eyes.</li>
            <li> You will see some smearing if you begin rubbing your eyes madly, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> and I found this made it difficult to draw a thin line</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t grow or would grow in weird directions.</li>
            <li> sad news is this: I&#x27;ve had this for a while now, maybe a month?</li>
            <li> But it is still there and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction too it.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the liner did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be less cruel of a consumer, so I searched to find vegan liquid eye liner on Amazon and came across  Zuzu.  </li>
            <li> This is really disappointing.</li>
            <li> So sad :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this non-toxic eyeliner. But I wish there was a water-proof version.</li>
            <li> I did like this eyeliner and probably will buy again.  I did not bother my eyelids like most other products.  No allergic reaction.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, as long as you buy a fresh tube.  In the past I bought some at Whole Foods that they must have had on their shelf for awhile, and it was too thick to apply a thin line.  What I got from Amazon was the perfect consistency, making it easy to apply a nice thin line.</li>
            <li> Makeup is a real problem for me.  I don&#x27;t want a lot of chemicals, now, but I once used a lot of makeup without giving any thought to that.  This eyeliner is great!  It&#x27;s simple, easy and does what you buy it for.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of liner.  It stays on through work, and does need to be touched up if I go out after work.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best liquid eyeliner available in this modern world.  And it&#x27;s good for you !!  The applicator is superb as well.</li>
            <li> I was on the search for a natural ingredient based eyeliner to replace my Tarte cream eyeliner that I loved.  I was afraid that I  would compromise the long lasting quality when switching to a natural eyeliner, but I&#x27;m glad to find out this wasn&#x27;t the case with the zuzu luxe.  It is very pigmented, dries fast on the eyelid and lasts all day. The applicator is a plastic tip, which was something I had to get use to, but now I can&#x27;t even tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I always wear natural/organic cosmetics.  My Tarte liquid liner had run out and I looked on Amazon.  Found this and it had great reviews so I ordered .it.  It came today.  I tried it right away.  I LOVE it.  Better than Tarte.  It goes on nicely and stays on, too!  It&#x27;s my new love!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal. I like that this is more natural. I feel good about not having yucky stuff go into my eyes. It felt like other eyeliners kind of clogged my pores and prevented my lashes from growing well. They wouldn&#x27;t grow or would grow in weird directions. This isn&#x27;t a growth enhancer, mind you, I just think that the ingredients are easier on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This has pretty good staying power. It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear. You will see some smearing if you begin rubbing your eyes madly, but that is to be expected. The liner will fade a bit during the day on the corners of your eyes where you get oily. It&#x27;s not much, but if you have a date you&#x27;ll want to touch up.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a dark dark brown, which is actually really nice on me - I&#x27;m a brunette with lighter skin. Black seems to be a bit too stark looking. This dark brown adds a nice pop that looks really good with my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;The sad news is this: I&#x27;ve had this for a while now, maybe a month? It has started to burn my eyes a bit. THe burning is pretty bad when I first apply, then seems to settle down a bit. But it is still there and uncomfortable. This is really disappointing. My eyes can be sensitive, but I had high hopes that this would be the different product. So sad :( sigh</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  eyeliner every day and this is my favorite</li>
            <li> This is a very nice liner and went on smoothly it was exactly what I was looking for but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction too it. I have a lot of problems with allergies and eye make up. The Zuzu mascara worked great. The first time I have been able to wear mascara in 10 years but unfortunately the liner did not work for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find gluten free make up products.  I found this originally in Whole Foods, but I don&#x27;t get there often. Ordering from Amazon makes this easy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love this liner. I don&#x27;t like to use harsh chemicals on my body and have been an Aveda addict for years, but.. I also love the look of liquid liner. So glad I found this! Stays on all day, comes off easily with water!</li>
            <li> First,&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Natural/good ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Decent Brown color&lt;br /&gt;Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a bit thick and makes it difficult to draw a nice thin line&lt;br /&gt;The formula is too watery and I found this made it difficult to draw a thin line&lt;br /&gt;The formula flaked a bit underneath my eye as the day progressed (this made my under eye area look darker)&lt;br /&gt;The product is hard to remove in the evenings event with coconut oil and a warm washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I prefer different natural liquid eyeliners with a better brush, which are easily removed at night, and which have a brown with reddish undertones (making a warmer brownâ€”this brown was flat and seemed more of a brown-black, than a brown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price makes it more appealing than more expensive brands, but I found the clunky felt-tip brush made it difficult to work with and that was frustrating early in the mornings.</li>
            <li> There are only a few products on this planet I am set on for life. You couldn&#x27;t pay me to try another liquid eyeliner. The applicator is the perfect thickness, the colors are gorgeous (I&#x27;ve settled on tuareg for my green eyes), and it&#x27;s relatively healthy for a facial cosmetic. (Think about it; do you really want to be putting chemicals next to your eyeballs every day of your life?) Each bottle lasts about four months of daily use for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye liner for a year and it is the best eye liner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on organic/low-chemical count makeup and zuzu luxe came most recommended. I love this eyeliner!!! it goes on smoothly, is a rich brown color and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Of all the eyeliners I have tried with low amounts of preservatives this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color.  Tuareg.</li>
            <li> I have used this eyeliner for several years and find it really works great! I have many products that irritate my eyes, this line has been a good choice for me..</li>
            <li> I initially purchased the Zuzu Luxe Liquid Eyeliner on my quest to limit the amount of chemicals I&#x27;m exposed to on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve now used the \\&quot;Raven\\&quot; and \\&quot;Tuareg\\&quot; colors and I have to say, I&#x27;m in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to used a Maybelline liquid eyeliner that would inevitably flake off sometime during the day, would get into my my eye, would irritate the ever living  out of my eyes, and to top it all off, look horribly awkward and give me the general appearance of some crazy zombie. So in making the switch, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for another liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I surprised! The Zuzu goes on smoothly and STAYS there! No irritation, and the color looks great! It&#x27;s very sharp throughout the day. And an accidental eye rub does not turn you into an instant raccoon. Seriously, the stuff works better than any other non-natural eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried. I will never go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, the \\&quot;Tuareg\\&quot; aka brown looks like a very light brown in the bottle but darkens up very quickly to a dark brown black as it dries. So don&#x27;t be freaked out if you see that.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be less cruel of a consumer, so I searched to find vegan liquid eye liner on Amazon and came across  Zuzu.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting  much but I absolutely love everything about their liquid eyeliner and mascara.  The colors I chose are very natural looking and they stay on pretty well without fading or smudging.  The applicator brush is of great design so it is quick and easy to use. Cudos  to Zuzu for a great cruel free product!</li>
            <li> This is my first liquid eyeliner and I think it&#x27;s perfect. Applies easily, dries relatively quickly, and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Color is too dark, and liner is very irritating to my eyes. Not sure who names these things, but maybe a description of the color instead of &amp;#34;tuareg&amp;#34; (and having to ask other customers, who all have a different opinion) would be helpful.  Will not be buying any of their other products.</li>
            <li> This is the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ll be sticking with it. I almost didn&#x27;t get this color because it was a light brown in liquid form; fortunately, I took it home anyway and found that it dries to a deep brown/black color.  WAY better than black pearl.  It stays on all day, as well.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Cannot use it...had better results with a powder shadow applied at my lash line.</li>
            <li> the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color. Easy to put on. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. I need this product in a dark taupe color , and a dark tan brown. A few extra shades of this liner are a definite for me, I&#x27;ve been afraid of liquid liner in the past, but this one is nice.</li>
            <li> Tuareg is a VERY pretty, soft, flattering shade of brown.  It glides on easily &amp; with precision.  It stays on, all day, without smudging.  I&#x27;m SO pleased with the quality of this product.  I luv the fact that I&#x27;m using chemical free cosmetics.  I wish I had discovered this line sooner!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is my favorite liquid liner ever. I have tried a lot and either the brush sucks or the formula sucks. This liner somehow manages to have the best applicator, the best formula, and it&#x27;s mineral and cruelty free. How is that possible? The applicator is a stiffer brush, almost like a spongey marker. Doing cat eyes is a breeze now. The formula also lasts forever. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few liners, from Maybelline to Stila, and this is by far the longest lasting and the best color. It freaked me out when I first put it on, because it showed up a light brown, almost copper. It dries much darker, however, to a typical brownish-black. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used liquid eyeliner for years. I have oily eyes that just won&#x27;t cooperate with any type of pencil. Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been on a quest to \\&quot;detox\\&quot; all of my daily use personal care products to safer, greener alternatives (nothing higher than a 2 on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database). For me, Zuzu Luxe eyeliner is a match made in makeup heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flattering brown color; clean, flowing application without awkward clumping or smudging; FABULOUS all-day wear. I can put this on in the morning and it will look pretty much the same in the evening, even if I went for a several-mile run outside at some point during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of brands over the years and used to be a big Almay fan. Not so anymore, given my non-toxic makeup mission. And yet, I like this eyeliner just as well as past favorites, possibly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My verdict: Highly recommended. I will be ordering this one again and in more colors.</li>
