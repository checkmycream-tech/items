            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is great for oral sensory stimulation for my sensory kiddo</li>
            <li>Thank you for the great product and service.</li>
            <li>This brush is a great product.</li>
            <li>great for teething.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for rubbing on the gums.</li>
            <li>This product is great for kiddos who need help developing their senses in their mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is good for teeth brushing and also for teething.</li>
            <li>but it was a good start to helping his oral issues</li>
            <li>I wish they have more options like these for the kids to over come oral aversion!</li>
            <li>The product smell of soap or some kind of perfume.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product and perfect for our son.</li>
            <li>the best thing for my three year old</li>
            <li>These are wonderful for introducing first tastes to babies and children who are sensitive to taste and textures.</li>
            <li>This used to be narrower which was more appropriate to fit in child&#x27;s mouth comfortably.</li>
            <li>where I couldn&#x27;t easily grab it (i.e. in a car seat).</li>
            <li>My kid has no problem brushing, so it&#x27;s easy to use this Nuk brush with him.</li>
            <li>The texture it is fine</li>
            <li>but luckily we were able to find this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great teether, and has actually helped with feeding, too.</li>
            <li>Plus, he seems to enjoy chewing on it and turning it over in his hands.     </li>
            <li>He does enjoy for a moment</li>
            <li>My son uses this brush with his speech therapist and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>He loved it- for ten days.</li>
            <li>This is a great toy for little one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>They are available at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and can be used effectively to increase oral motor function through stimulation of the mouth, especially prior to eating.</li>
            <li>I usually just handwash it w/a good soap and sometimes a very diluted bleach solution</li>
            <li>and our baby really took to it and chewed on it, which also helps stimulate her mouth to help her reduce her sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>My children didn&#x27;t really care for this.</li>
            <li>I use one of those sippy-cup straps to attach it to the high chair, and he&#x27;ll chew on it between bites.</li>
            <li>Order this for my son who has high sensory input.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by our son feeding therapist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that the entire item is a one-piece mold, so it&#x27;s very easily sterilized (there are no holes or hollow places for water or bacteria to hide).</li>
            <li>minus one star because a baby is apt to shove it in the back of their throat unsupervised (not advised), but when handled by an adult not in the babies hands</li>
            <li>My boy has oral motor (tongue) issues and may not be able to feel things inside his mouth like the typical 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>Helpful for my son to get used to new textures.</li>
            <li>Which has help with trying new foods.</li>
            <li>and so instead went to Toysrus to buy new ones.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve gotten more mileage out of a green chewy tube, but the texture is different and he doesn&#x27;t seem to like it quite as much.</li>
            <li>Of course, my son has gator jaws and this might hold up better for children who don&#x27;t bite as hard.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, but I do wish there was a stopper added (even if it was removable) to help prevent my little one from pushing it back too far.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s occupational therapist gave us one when he was 16 months old to help treat his sensory seeking and oral motor skills.</li>
            <li>I would not let my child use this without supervision and would recommend frequent inspections of the nubs for quality to prevent any choking hazard.</li>
            <li>He has NOT placed it so far back in his mouth that he could gag on it, but like anything else w/young children, it&#x27;s a possibility and not an item that I would allow him to use w/o direct supervision or</li>

            <li> My daughter has sensory problems and this chew toy seem to help her a lot</li>
            <li> Excellent for oral motor stimulation. It is a little bit big for my four weeks son but it does the job.</li>
            <li> No complaints about this Nuk Brush.  Our baby has food sensitivity for which she is seeing a speech pathologist.  She recommended that baby always has something to keep her busy in the high chair to prevent her from getting bored and playing with the food that she&#x27;s supposed to eat and not play with.  She gave us something similar to this and our baby really took to it and chewed on it, which also helps stimulate her mouth to help her reduce her sensitivity.  The dogs got to the one the speech pathologist gave us but luckily we were able to find this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ridges on the brush aren&#x27;t as deep as the one that was given to us, but baby still uses this in the same manner and doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.  This is a great tool for our baby!</li>
            <li> This used to be narrower which was more appropriate to fit in child&#x27;s mouth comfortably. I don&#x27;t know why they made it wider.</li>
            <li> This Nuk brush was purchased for our grandchild who tends to chew the bristles out of her regular toothbrush. This is good for teeth brushing and also for teething.</li>
            <li> For the price, I feel like we could have just used a toothbrush but it was a good start to helping his oral issues</li>
            <li> I think these brush should be smaller, it is too big for babies or little kids. The texture it is fine</li>
            <li> Helpful for my son to get used to new textures. Which has help with trying new foods. He loves it. Chewing on it also gives his gums relief while teething.</li>
            <li> This is great for oral sensory stimulation for my sensory kiddo</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this product being a \\&quot;toy\\&quot;, but it was recommended by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) to help with some mechanical feeding problems. Our little one has had a hard time with textures in food, among other things.     It&#x27;s a great teether, and has actually helped with feeding, too. I use one of those sippy-cup straps to attach it to the high chair, and he&#x27;ll chew on it between bites. I could see using it as a toothbrush, which is probably its intended purpose, but for now, it&#x27;s helping immensely with development issues. There seems to be something to chewing on it that causes the tongue and jaw to engage in ways that chewing on a baby spoon doesn&#x27;t do. Plus, he seems to enjoy chewing on it and turning it over in his hands.     Sanitation/safety issues: I inspect it regularly to see if any of the \\&quot;nubs\\&quot; have been damaged or are breaking, but the entire item has remained intact for the few months we&#x27;ve been using it. Another plus is that the entire item is a one-piece mold, so it&#x27;s very easily sterilized (there are no holes or hollow places for water or bacteria to hide). I haven&#x27;t placed it in the dishwasher, but I could see it going in with those rubber baby spoons and faring well. I usually just handwash it w/a good soap and sometimes a very diluted bleach solution w/a LOT of rinsing, like other hard plastic toys. The rubber head has some give but is not so soft that it bends, and the handle is very firm. He has NOT placed it so far back in his mouth that he could gag on it, but like anything else w/young children, it&#x27;s a possibility and not an item that I would allow him to use w/o direct supervision or where I couldn&#x27;t easily grab it (i.e. in a car seat).</li>
            <li> This is a great toy for little one&#x27;s. It also works well for oral therapy. Although my baby didn&#x27;t need oral therapy, I purchased this to help prepare my baby for solids and brushing teeth. I definitely feel this contributed to my infant&#x27;s readiness for solids.</li>
            <li> The product smell of soap or some kind of perfume.  I was afraid to use it and so instead went to Toysrus to buy new ones.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for introducing first tastes to babies and children who are sensitive to taste and textures. They are available at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Such a great product and perfect for our son. He loves the Nuk Brush! Thank you for the great product and service.</li>
            <li> Order this for my son who has high sensory input. He does enjoy for a moment but it seem a little too soft for him.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my nephew who is autistic and his mother says he loves it soo much that she cant get him to use the regular toothbrush sometimes</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by our son feeding therapist.</li>
            <li> My son uses this brush with his speech therapist and it&#x27;s fantastic. It&#x27;s durable and can be used effectively to increase oral motor function through stimulation of the mouth, especially prior to eating. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Se lo compre a mi hijo que tiene autismo necesita mucho Censorie y le encantó se tranquilizaba lamentablemente solo le duró un mes</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s occupational therapist gave us one when he was 16 months old to help treat his sensory seeking and oral motor skills. He loved it- for ten days. Then he bit the nubby rubber part off. Of course, my son has gator jaws and this might hold up better for children who don&#x27;t bite as hard. We&#x27;ve gotten more mileage out of a green chewy tube, but the texture is different and he doesn&#x27;t seem to like it quite as much.</li>
            <li> We were recommended this brush by my sons OT to help with textures and food aversion. We use it and it seems to help some. He seems to prefer it over some teethers. I would not let my child use this without supervision and would recommend frequent inspections of the nubs for quality to prevent any choking hazard. (Although we have yet to have any issue with that).</li>
            <li> the best thing for my three year old thank you thank you</li>
            <li> My son has oral sensitivity. This brush is a great product. We have been told that it helps in reducing texture issues and it seem to be helping. Great product! I wish they have more options like these for the kids to over come oral aversion!</li>
            <li> My children didn&#x27;t really care for this.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, but I do wish there was a stopper added (even if it was removable) to help prevent my little one from pushing it back too far.</li>
            <li> great for teething. minus one star because a baby is apt to shove it in the back of their throat unsupervised (not advised), but when handled by an adult not in the babies hands it&#x27;s great for rubbing on the gums.</li>
            <li> This product is great for kiddos who need help developing their senses in their mouth.  My boy has oral motor (tongue) issues and may not be able to feel things inside his mouth like the typical 3 year old.  I use it after brushing every night to help improve his oral motor and sense.  My kid has no problem brushing, so it&#x27;s easy to use this Nuk brush with him.</li>
