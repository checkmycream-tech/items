            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>The bulb still works great too.</li>

            <li>Great for gift-giving.)&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>The idea of sanitizing your toothbrush is a fascinating ideal.     </li>
            <li>This item is a great addition to keep the Sonicare heads hygienic.</li>
            <li>This seemed like a great alternative.   </li>
            <li>Price is great, too</li>
            <li>I use this to sanitize my Sonicare brush head and have been happy with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>That is why I mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely on my bathroom counter and is attractive.  </li>
            <li>I have periodontal disease and anything I can do to help is good for me.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted one and got this one at a really good deal     </li>
            <li>so it helps me feel good when I use it</li>
            <li>It looks nice in the bathroom and works great on our oral b electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The sanitizer is exceptionally good.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you had an immune system disorder or disease then this could be a good idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For my son&#x27;s birthday, I decided this would be a good gift for him.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal on a must have product.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good idea.</li>
            <li>it and wish you good luck if you are buying.</li>
            <li>It is not a way to sterilize (to kill 100% of the living organisms) but good to reduce bacterial or viral load when needed.</li>
            <li>It is not a way to sterilize (to kill 100% of the living organisms) but good to reduce bacterial or viral load when needed.</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
            <li>(I loved that the &#x27;beep&#x27; after each quadrant helped my kids to keep brushing longer and do a better job!)    </li>
            <li>It would be really great to be able to pop theirs into the unit for cleaning too.    </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find it at Amazon</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Assuming you do think it is good to have this sort of treatment for your brushes, the unit seems like a nice thing to have.  </li>
            <li>I would have to say that this is probably a good niche product and nice gift for someone who already owns a compatible toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love my husband, but don&#x27;t want to share his toothbrush grunge by storing our toothbrush heads  close together in a toothbrush holder!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Like the flu shot, just one more line of defense in the war against germs and illness!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>UV light does a great job of killing microbes.</li>
            <li>The sanitizer is a great way to keep my brush and my wife&#x27;s brush free from germs and stored separately from the battery portion.  </li>
            <li>Great product, does what it promises, just wish it was available with a built in charger for the toothbrush handle.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and a vary reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My grandkids visit us and they bring their own toothbrushes from home.   </li>
            <li>Nice compact size, and it stores nicely too.</li>
            <li>I am recovering from a stem cell transplant for acute leukemia - my immune system is suppressed and immature.  </li>
            <li>If you own a Philips Sonicare toothbrush system, then this Sanitizer is a MUST have for you.</li>
            <li>Liked ours</li>
            <li>Packaging (Nice presentation in the box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also nice to have an enclosed place to store the brush heads in while not in use.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t remember what kind of Oral B I had . . .</li>
            <li>If you happen to find it within the $10.00 range (which is the price of the carrying case Sonic makes) it is a nice carrying case for the brush heads.</li>
            <li>, is it effective at getting rid of bacteria.</li>
            <li>After getting the sonicare toothbrush for Christmas and loving it, I saw this deal on Amazon for the sanitizer and thought why not???</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference with the toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Therefore, kids tend to expose the brush to more bugs then we, adults do and their immune system is weaker against pathogens so this type of preventive measure can be a good one to take.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I liked the Phillips Sonicare UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money I paid for it!!!  </li>
            <li>my Phillips sonicare uv sanitizer works great on keeping the brush head of my sonicare tooth brush clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li>It has been very easy to use with the E-series brushheads.  </li>
            <li>The sanitizer is very easy to set up and operate.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.    </li>
            <li>So, very easy, no muss,</li>
            <li>Great gadget, thanks!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 5 years so far, still working good!!</li>
            <li>Just kidding, they&#x27;re still a nice, healthy, yellowish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I went with Amazon and it all came in great contition and very fast.</li>
            <li>First off, the scientist&#x27;s review is great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice in appearance, and perhaps a bit pricey for its function.</li>
            <li>nice to find out after reading the fine print.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t want to get sued, especially in light of reports suggesting that certain diseases may be passed through saliva.  </li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>Now that, would make things more sanitary.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Phillips Sonicare UV Sanitizer because I was concerned about how healthy my toothbrush heads were.  </li>
            <li>I love the magnetic hold.</li>
            <li>Sure, everyone knows your mouth has bacteria, and that that bacteria is safe...</li>
            <li>I guess we cant be too safe.</li>
            <li>but I am glad that I did make the purchase.</li>
            <li>I could never find one of these in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found one through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I agree w/ others that for this price, it should accept more brands and styles.</li>
            <li>(I have to believe \\&quot;truth in advertising\\&quot; laws are at work here, because my Sonicare doesn&#x27;t produce results that are any better than any battery-operated toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.)  </li>
            <li>This is the most inexpensive unit I found.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel better to use it</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure how to tell that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>look any better</li>
            <li>The Essence toothbrush heads tend to build up a lot of gunk because of the way they screw on so rather than buying this fancy sanitizer you&#x27;d be better off just buying a better made toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>The one caveat is that you need to make sure this fits your brand/model of toothbrush, as you won&#x27;t be able to use it otherwise.      </li>
            <li>For starters, killing 90% of the bacteria isn&#x27;t that meaningful if the remaining 10% can grow rapidly.  </li>
            <li>more than one hundred million microorganisms can be found on the brush heads of even healthy individuals.</li>
            <li>Plus there is one more electric cord in addition to your toothbrush charger cord plugged into the outlet which clutters up the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Folks, it doesn&#x27;t get any easier or more practical than this.</li>
            <li>I love this sanitizer.</li>
            <li>We love our Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love my Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I suspect for most people this will just end up as a gadget that gets stuck in a closet or cabinet and never used again.  </li>
            <li>It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll give mine to family member who also uses Sonicare brushes and may appreciate more the gadget geekiness of the UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, I was still able to try this out since my sister owns a Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Just place your brush head inside, close the door, and press the button on the top for the sanitizing cycle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I wasn&#x27;t really able to use the product, I&#x27;ve rated it as a 3 to indicate that I&#x27;m neutral.  </li>
            <li>No opinion would have been a better choice, but Amazon.com doesn&#x27;t offer that alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a scientist, so I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>1) Is the unit safe for operation 2)</li>
            <li>In times like these, we all need a leg up on taking care of ourselves and staying healthy.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job of sanitizing the heads</li>
            <li>This makes you feel like you&#x27;re killing the germs and making the brush head safe to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?    </li>
            <li>For me, it is more of an OCD where I like to be thorough on the things I do.  </li>
            <li>and we feel confident that our brushes are sanitized.</li>
            <li>I also have a background in biology, which is why i should have known better.</li>
            <li>Most diseases are caused by pathogens that we introduce to our body through oral way.</li>
            <li>It sure seems like cheap insurance along with some handwashing directions for the family!</li>
            <li>I started with the recommendation of my dentist, and many of the problems (gum disease, plaque) were cleared up as a result.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regarding the two \\&quot;most helpful</li>
            <li>love the idea that it sanitizes the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s mostly Sonicare and OralB</li>
            <li>You fit the brush head inside, close the door, push the button, and a bright light turns on for 10 minutes, then turns off.  </li>
            <li>Since it appears to do what it claims to, I give the product more than one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have to echo the sentiments that more scientifically-trained reviews have expressed.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not even sure toddler fingers could get in, although kids have been known to defeat a host of safety devices.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not even sure toddler fingers could get in, although kids have been known to defeat a host of safety devices.)    </li>
            <li>many scratches on the product.</li>
            <li>More information is needed to assuage.</li>
            <li>Nice peace of mind, knowing your brush head is clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel great after a brushing, a lot better than a normal brush.</li>
            <li>I like this new line of UV sanitizing products; this is a great product for those with the appropriate systems, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy into the Sonicare system on this basis alone.</li>
            <li>First, the good.</li>
            <li>nice looking, and sanitizing is quick.  </li>
            <li>Its very easy yo use and to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have no way of proving that it does what it says but I feel better having and using it to keep my toothbrush germ free.  </li>
            <li>An LED  flashes on the top of the unit and you see through some translucent plastic that UV light is activated inside.  </li>
            <li>which is all very well and good</li>
            <li>How does Philips really think that this is a good design.  </li>
            <li>There probably is a clinical answer to this to tell us whether killing off 99 percent of bacteria this way is good for us (i.e., reduces colds, reinfections) and whether we would be better to just soak our brushes or perhaps live with the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m not the most adept kid on the block when it comes to anything even slightly mechanical, but I have been known to successfully snap times into their properly fitting spaces once or twice in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>The ultraviolet light disinfection process used by this unit may make some people  think it&#x27;s the latest quack invention, but ultraviolet light is being used in hospitals for disinfection.</li>
            <li>It provides a clean and safe place to store our two brush heads</li>
            <li>This UV sanitizer is so easy to use</li>
            <li>It also easily comes apart for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It is portable and actually easy to use.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Parts that snap easily into place.)&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the unit is easy because there is a removable drip tray.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up and operate.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy to order online</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to hurt yourself opening these things -- but this is a problem for a lot of products not just the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to set-up, use, and care for.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>Unless you have your own lab, you never can be sure if it&#x27;s really working, so we just have to go on faith that the manufacturers are telling the truth.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li>So, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, works as promised..</li>
            <li>like the Sonicare UV Santizer for its easy of use.  </li>
            <li>I like the Sonicare UV Santizer for its easy of use.  </li>
            <li>(The adapters are fairly easy to use.)     </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work, but so does soaking your toothbrush in strong mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>I know that my Essence toothbrushes fit in perfectly and that when I push the button the little light goes on, but once you remove the toothbrushes they don&#x27;t smell or look any cleaner, so how can you be sure?</li>
            <li>People survived brushing their teeth just fine before we had UV cleaning systems for toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The bottom of each brush holder is magnetic and securely grabs and nudges the brush head into place very quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The aformentioned UV sanitizers can handle a full \\&quot;normal\\&quot; brush, so if you don&#x27;t have the relevant Sonicare or Oral B systems, they&#x27;d definitely be a better deal.  </li>
            <li>But as one person pointed out, we&#x27;ve lived without a Sanitizer for years and have gotten along fine without it.</li>
            <li>I have a biology background and the good news is that this amount of UV light is going to have the desired effect on the bacteria that live in your toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>This is very easy to use, which was my first question when I got it.  </li>
            <li>Tools such as the Sonicare UV Sanitizer are a great addition to my arsenal in defense against rogue bacteria.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know how well they fit.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare replacement heads are in no way cheap.</li>
            <li>Even aside from the UV light part just keeping the heads in the case will help keep germs off of it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, am happy with the product...</li>
            <li>This item is easy to keep clean, and disinfects the brush heads while they are stored out of sight.</li>
            <li>Based on the info for my pricey air purifier w/ a UV light, I&#x27;m inclined to think this item works as advertised.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer keeps 2 brush heads, in my case Oral-B Floss-Action, in a brush head case that uses UV light to sanitize the brush heads for about 10 minutes and then shuts off.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The idea is that you close-up the brush in the cabinet and turn on the UV light which kills the germs on the brush in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t sanitize - just get a blinking light.  </li>
            <li>The sanitizing is done by UV light, so there are no cleaning solutions to buy; once you&#x27;ve bought the Sanitizer, you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a light that flashes while it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>I use it every day to keep my brush heads free from bacteria.</li>
            <li>I have a Sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  </li>
            <li>in our e-series brush heads and push the button.&lt;br /&gt;After watching a movie, the light is still flashing--it doesn&#x27;t turn off itself as it should after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Find</li>
            <li>But i thought, cheap supprise gift.</li>
            <li>UV light is a way of sanitizing we use in the lab.</li>
            <li>My feeling is that it should be as effective as stated in the 99% claim on the box since it acts in a very close distance and for quite a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>UV light is a way of sanitizing we use in the lab.</li>
            <li>My feeling is that it should be as effective as stated in the 99% claim on the box since it acts in a very close distance and for quite a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Theoretically, this seems great to sanitize the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that the UV light interacts with the plastic bristles and weakens it;</li>
            <li>Now I know my brush head is germ free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a biological fact that UV light increases the number of DNA mutations.  </li>
            <li>In addition Phillips warranty does not cover the light bulb.....</li>
            <li>This UV sanitizer is designed to sanitize your toothbrush head by saturating it with UV light, which is supposed to kill all the germs and bacteria that could be on it.  </li>
            <li>I love a great gadget: this is terrific, economical and gives us a lot of feeling safer about toothbrush sterility.</li>
            <li>We are very happy with this product, everyone should have one, or at least be able to sanitize their toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  </li>
            <li>Very economical</li>
            <li>Everything functioned as it should and she reported that the toothbrush did feel clean (softer bristles free of residue).</li>
            <li>Quick and easy way to sanitize toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>Well, without a laboratory - you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t honestly say that normal folks need or benefit from something like this, unless you want an iPod looking place to keep your brush heads when not in use.</li>
            <li>It is a brand that has a very good reputation and I really feel it does what it is supposed to do,it does not take up much room and is easily stored when the cleaning process is complete.</li>
            <li>We try to clean twice a day.  </li>
            <li>After I used this unit I could tell a difference of how the brissels felt and they felt clean.</li>
            <li>You have a toothbrush which supposedly uses sonic waves to clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li>When you think about it, how many people do you know personally who have contracted E. Coli from their own toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you will not notice a difference in the way your brush tastes or performs (unless you&#x27;ve also been using it to clean out your belly-button lint or something).</li>
            <li>You can, if necssary, easily clean the inside of the unit by pulling out and washing a tray that collects any runoff water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now we clean our brush-heads on a weekly basis and I don&#x27;t ever worry that we are recycling germs from the brush-head.    </li>
            <li>This takes about 10 minutes for the peace of mind that your brush heads are clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also did research on keeping toothbrushes clean.</li>
            <li>I did find one article at WikiHow that says getting your toothbrush clean just takes toothpaste (which cleans the brush, too), using water and rubbing the bristles before and after... nothing fancy -- everything you already have.ust takes toothpaste (which cleans the brush, too), using water and rubbing the bristles before and after...</li>
            <li>We used to take our Sonicare toothbrush heads and run them through the dishwasher to clean them up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does clean well, however.</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t meant we can&#x27;t clean our brush heads to get rid of accumulated germs and bacteria.  </li>
            <li>I love this sanitizer...knowing that germs are killed before you put your brush in your mouth...and it has a great place to stay in between brushing...</li>
            <li>But as long as you have the correct toothbrush head for the unit, it&#x27;s easy, convenient, and presumably, good for your health.  </li>
            <li>The newer philips heads pop right in easily.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare UV Sanitizer was easy to use right out of the box, with no assembly required.</li>
            <li>The UV Sanitizer offers an alternative that will not harm the head and seems to be effective.  </li>
            <li>If your household happens to use one of the toothbrush brands that is supported by this sanitizer and especially if you find yourself passing colds from person to person, this may be a good product to try.</li>
            <li>The sanitizer is simple to use and I assume it does a good job of killing germs on our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>so much I bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>it true?</li>
            <li>However, if you have people in your family that are prone to illness, or who take antibiotics with some regularity, this might be a cost effective way to sanitize without having to throw out your toothbrushes as frequently.     </li>
            <li>The canceled operation won&#x27;t cool the bulb, but it will stop the UV radiation.  </li>
            <li>That being said, you have no evidence of anything, although it does offer as a place to store your toothbrush heads and looks cool on a bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>on to your basic Sonicare (or a good range of compatible toothbrushes which for the two of us, was a good thing with two different brands) and get those heads sanitized.</li>
            <li>user menu is full of wrinkle.</li>
            <li>This was an excellent health investment for very little money!</li>
            <li>The bottom tray and adaptors snap out fairly easily for cleaning; however, it would be nice if the entire interior compartment emerged germ-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, this is easy to set up once you survive the hardest part...</li>
            <li>The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dead easy to use - close up the sanitiser, press a button and then the brush heads are flooded by bright light for the duration of the clean - about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>After researching the problem they have announced that this summer they have a much better plan for keeping the public pools safe for all-- they&#x27;re going to use UV rays to kill all the bacteria.</li>
            <li>The plastic bulb housing seems to protect the bulb adequately from all but the tiniest fingers.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bulb housing seems to protect the bulb adequately from all but the tiniest fingers.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much, Philips!</li>
            <li>While there could be some benefit, hot water is probably close in effect and free.</li>
            <li>I love that it is compact, simple to use and very cost effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dexterous and in good shape, and it was a pain for me (and I managed to get a minor cut out of it)</li>
            <li>I use it after I brush before bed every night so that next morning the brush head is nice and clean again.</li>
            <li>It is well-designed, easy to operate, and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>I pretty much agree with most reviewers.  </li>
            <li>The unit is large and it came assembled, but had detailed instructions for an unassembeled unit.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the forensic tools to tell if this thing works well, but for piece of mind, it&#x27;s a great little uv unit.</li>
            <li>I have ordered directly from Amazon many times with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I not only feel that my toothbrush heads are more germ free, but I also like it because I can store my heads in the sanitizer between using.  </li>
            <li>Humans have an incredible amount of germs present both internally and on our skin.  </li>
            <li>I am more of an old fashion type toothbrush user but this product should appeal to those who like to take care of their teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and designed specifically for my particular brand of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>this worth having?  </li>
            <li>I use this product daily and feel confident that my toothbrush is free of the bacteria a bathroom use creates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you&#x27;re thinking whether buying the sanitizer is worth it, here&#x27;s my take.</li>
            <li>But that blue, glowing UV light sure seems as though it&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>Therefore I must conclude that for those with the correct brush, this is a useful product.</li>
            <li>The product design is sleek and fits nicely into the bathroom without being extremely big and industrial looking.    </li>
            <li>It was a handy way to carry our brush heads when we traveled recently.    </li>
            <li>then it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The santizer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>We only use bottled water and rinse our toothbrushes with alcohol (Tequila and the rubbing kind</li>
            <li>My understanding is that there is a shut-off to prevent humans from being exposed to the UV light, which is a good thing as UV light will interfere with human DNA in the same way that it damages bacterial DNA.  </li>
            <li>Worth $50?</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s one more thing to sit on a shelf and plug into a power strip, but it&#x27;s worth it to have a really clean toothbrush every time you brush.</li>
            <li>This is a very nicely designed product that accepted the heads of my Sonicare toothbrushed without trouble and operated without a hitch.  </li>
            <li>I found the product easy to use, the packaging while it afforded sanitary delivery of the product was moderately easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, right.  </li>
            <li>recommend it if you have the right brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, any Sonicare toothbrush fits right in the sanitizer case.</li>
            <li>It stands on my counter for easy use and has given me a new comfort level about my health and hygiene.  </li>
            <li>I had mistakenly believed the part of the description that said it supports most major brand brush heads.</li>
            <li>But overall a great product for a gift or you own personal use, especially with mouth and teeh care.</li>
            <li>Most bathrooms have limited outlets available, and it requires two outlets to run this sonicare system.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fairly unobtrusive presence on the average bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Bought a new UV unit to find that the light bulb does not work and phillis web site has no mention on where to get a replacement.  </li>
            <li>You have to have the brush in exactly the right position to close it.  </li>
            <li>Ease of assembly  (Clear, easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>For the last 3 years we used it on daily basis and there is no wear and tear plus bulb and the timer works great</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product, but it appears to do the job fine so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s new in the original packaging, all intact</li>
            <li>It not only sanitizes your brush heads, it keeps them clean and dust free to boot.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is removing the light cover to clean it.</li>
            <li>Is able to take different type of brush heads, which helped me a lot.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and I feel better about using my sonicare toothbrush everyday knowing it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>What about a kid who runs into your bathroom after having played outside where there are many types of non-normal flora (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli 0157:H7, etc.)</li>
            <li>But personally, I think its a really cool gadget, and if you are a gadget fan like me, you probably enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is an LED indicator on the top that shows if the UV cycle has been run since the last time it was opened.</li>
            <li>I like and have numerous gadgets that probably aren&#x27;t really needed, but to me make life easier and more fun.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare Elite 9650 Power Toothbrush which I use 2-3 times daily</li>
            <li>A better idea is to replace your brushes regularly.</li>
            <li>You simply put the toothbrush head(s) in and push a button on the top.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t send him toothpaste because I was sure he only used one brand</li>
            <li>Thanks, Phillips!</li>
            <li>Another thing I started doing was to leave my medicine cabinet ajar, since a closed cabinet means trapping a moist toothbrush in a possibly warm place, thus allowing mold to grow.  </li>
            <li>Effectiveness (I saw a difference in the brush color head after the first use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product arrived, the first challenge was opening the plastic around the sterilizer.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, my rechargeable Oral B toothbrush didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>First impression:    </li>
            <li>Instructions are precise and clear.   </li>
            <li>Simply put your brush head inside, close it, and hit the button on top.</li>
            <li>Thanks sonicare!</li>
            <li>Among different ways of sanitizing things including dumping them into various solutions, this one is the most innocent one since it leaves no chemical residue that may cancel the benefits.</li>

            <li>How do you think your toothbrush head is getting contaminated in the first place?    </li>
            <li>the open many hours after its been in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just recovered from a sinus infection, when I used my Phillips Sonicare Sanitizer for the first time.</li>
            <li>First they buy the company</li>
            <li>after about  years my old Philips brush stop working bought this one and uv light</li>
            <li>Any one who spends significant amount of money for an electric tooth brush to maintain oral hygene may consider using this gadget to keep the brush head clean, (only) if money is not a constraint.    </li>
            <li>My old toothbrush worked better than their new model.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not a microbiologist, I can&#x27;t say for sure, but all the warnings that come with the box suggest that the light is powerful enough to do the necessary damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While there is no tangible proof the UV light has actually sanitized the toothbrush head, we&#x27;ll have to take it on faith that it has - and it&#x27;s been made quick, easy and relatively inexpensive, so why not?  </li>
            <li>So far I like it better than the old battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are so much cleaner; and I love the 30 second quadrant     timer</li>
            <li>Our heads fit right into the space with no adjustments, but if you&#x27;ve got a different model toothbrush, the sanitizer comes with adapters.</li>
            <li>With H1N1 and other viruses around, it is great to take 10 short minutes to disinfect our toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>The UV light serves to kill all germs - apparently...  </li>
            <li>&quot; I read the directions first,  which seemed to require an unusual number of steps to set up and  install the UV bulb.</li>
            <li>It only takes a few minutes to do its magic, so that is a plus if you are in some kind of hurry.</li>
            <li>The sanitizer eliminates an unsightly toothbrush sitting open on your counter, and keeps the head fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy, only takes 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Such an easy product to use.  </li>
            <li>2) not sure if it really does what it says--who does know, but I do feel good using it     </li>
            <li>Have strong scissors on hand to open the plastic sealed packaging the unit is housed in!    </li>
            <li>and it does have a large footprint for the counter.</li>
            <li>Having used this device, I have not developed any exciting feeling, except for the comfort of &#x27;scientific assurance&#x27; that the brush head is clean.</li>
            <li>I feel that my toothbrush is very clean and it seems to stiffen the brushes on the ones about to be used the limited amount of time - 3 months.</li>
            <li>Thanks to them</li>
            <li>The Item works and the blue light goes on.  </li>
            <li>Just How do I know if my brushes really are sanitized?  </li>
            <li>really enjoy the sanitizer - I can sanitize my toothbrush and my husbands at the same time!</li>
            <li>I have a Sonicare toothbrush, which works really well,</li>
            <li>im a biologist at a VERY prestigious institution</li>
            <li>Now, does anyone REALLY need this product?</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>This is one of those things where you don&#x27;t really get to witness the value of your money.  </li>
            <li>I really like the magets that \\&quot;snap\\&quot; the brush head into position and hold it in place.  </li>
            <li>How can you really tell if this thing \\&quot;sanitizes\\&quot; your toothbrush head?  </li>
            <li>How much anti-bacterial stuff is out there anyway?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li>While it is packaged very attractively....and the product itself is also...</li>
            <li>All you have to do is plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to be used.  </li>
            <li>After that it was a breeze, place the brush heads inside the stainless steel lined chamber - the bristles should face the UV bulb - and plug it in and turn it on.</li>
            <li>In about ten minutes, your brush heads are germ free.</li>
            <li>and then whole cycle repeats itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>However, I do have two children that seem to be very suceptible to sniffles, colds, and the ilk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, for $50 plus S&amp;H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I just felt it was important to point out in the hopes I might save someone else from making the same mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end this product does not make much \\&quot;dollar and sense\\&quot; without some type of proof in the claim.   </li>
            <li>Thanks for sending it my way just in time.  </li>
            <li>This product is an answer to that and very convenient.  </li>
            <li>My wife feels that her toothbrushes are much cleaner...</li>
            <li>Very anticlimactic.</li>
            <li>No way to really tell if it works in sanitizing but haven&#x27;t gotten any&#x27;revenge&#x27; yet.</li>
            <li>, I do wish that the sanitizer/charger that came with the toothbrush was available, it is smaller and charges also, but this will do!  </li>
            <li>While most bacteria will be killed, the 0.01% that survive are more likely to have suffered mutations.  </li>
            <li>The unit fits 2 brush heads, but before you even start to consider buying one, you should definitely read the list of brush heads that will actually fit</li>
            <li>and if it is really working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works out very well with a Sonicare electric  toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>The light is lasting for like three years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much of a way of knowing it&#x27;s working without running some bacteria cultures, but I&#x27;ll assume it does</li>
            <li>Ensuring that something we place inside our mouths is 99% sanitary just makes good common sense.  </li>
            <li>Having a cleaner brush is a good thing, so I don&#x27;t see anything negative here.  </li>
            <li>It seems likely to be a far better use of the cash.</li>
            <li>The detergent in your toothpaste (variously called sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, etc) will probably be effective enough at getting rid of bacteria --</li>
            <li>The bacteria that are NOT killed by this treatment are more likely to be mutated.  </li>
            <li>We live in a world of ever more consumer gadgets - many of us have drawers or closets full of forsaken or useless ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m for keeping personal hygiene items as clean as possible; and the Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer does a fantastic job of meeting my needs.</li>
            <li>Great, except H2O2 seriously oxidizes your plastic brush bristles which can shorten the life of your brush head considerably.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have read in other reviews that &#x27;why sanitize when the germs are coming from our mouths&#x27;,</li>
            <li>I can make due with a power strip, but don&#x27;t like having it on a counter top that gets a lot of water splashed around .The</li>
            <li>A side note: we had a problem with a bacteria in swimming pools last summer and they tried everyting to get the water clean--</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s a nice small unit, doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the bathroom</li>
            <li>All points are valid, and sure, according to other reviewers, this makes for a great place to store the Sonicare heads, but really the part of your Sonicare that seems to really need the MOST sanitation is the where the head and base connect.</li>
            <li>I have become a germ-a-phobe in recent years and specifically sought out a sanitizer specially designed for my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it was, was for it to be less bulky and a bit more like the original one that came with the brushes that was attached to the charger.</li>
            <li>It feels solid and looks cool in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The cost of the replacement brush-heads was actually quite reasonable, considering you only had to do it every six months, and we found it did an outstanding job for our family.</li>
            <li>I get colds frequently and sore throats too, and I&#x27;m pretty strict about changing toothbrush heads after either.  </li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s no way for the average consumer to be sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a new toothbrush every time you brush your teeth!  </li>
            <li>So the more bugs you eliminate the less risk you get.</li>
            <li>, People have survived very happily without wasting money on idiotic gadgets like this.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really read into how effective it is but at the least the brush heads are in an enclosed compartment while all sorts of germs are flying around the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I caution anyone w/ young kids not to let them use it, as if opened during operation, the light can potentially damage their eyes.</li>
            <li>There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models).</li>
            <li>I ordered an electronic toothbrush and instead received the latest gimmick promoted to American corporate consumerism!  </li>
            <li>It works quickly and quietly.  </li>
            <li>this is especially helpful if you have more than once person using the same rechargable</li>
            <li>Though I do have one quibble with another review, the biologist poo-pooing this device, despite being mainly in agreement.</li>
            <li>I think the main concern of bacterial growth on the brush is not the ones transmitted from our mouths.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and quietly.</li>
            <li>To summarize, dentists use this sort of gizmo because they&#x27;re putting the same tools into the mouths of many different people.  </li>
            <li>That is probably not a very good thing as per Philips own website which asserts the bacteria thrive in moist environments.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Sonicare products, any of them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>That just confirmed to me again that this is a really smart investment for a family that wants to keep their teeth clean and healthy without having to buy new Sonicare brush-heads every time someone gets sick.  </li>
            <li>It was a little more cheaply constructed than I had expected from a Sonicare product, but seems acceptable.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t see Walmart changing their prices everyday, but when they do they drop the price to give you a better deal, not rob you like what just went on with this item.</li>
            <li>I thought it wasn&#x27;t worth the counter space, and considering that a dip into rubbing alcohol would kill everything, too, I left it with my mom at home.</li>
            <li>Remove brush heads and use as normal.   </li>
            <li>As a useful tool, it also comes up short.</li>
            <li>Exposure to a moderate level of bacteria is actually GOOD for you, since it acts as a sort of exercise for your immune system, strengthening it for more dangerous infections.  </li>
            <li>Particularly in comparison to other cleaning methods easily available.     </li>
            <li>The Sonicare UV Sanitizer uses a small but strong light bulb inside a chrome-painted plastic housing to kill electric toothbrush bacteria on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;m not a biologist, so I really can&#x27;t reasonably comment on whether or not UV light is modifying strands of DNA like some of the previous reviewers.    </li>
            <li>and I found out later that I was right.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I are already in the habit of pushing the button right after both of us have brushed our teeth.  </li>
            <li>upsides are that it runs pretty quickly, the humming sound is a nice reminder to unplug the sanitizer when it&#x27;s done and save some phantom energy, and even if it&#x27;s not plugged in it still blocks some dirty airborne particles after flushing (apparently closing the toilet lid doesn&#x27;t even help that!).</li>
            <li>Besides the regular bugs of the mouth flora reside there in a balance with our immune system and do not make much of a problem but pathogenic bacteria should not be treated in the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-kids learning to brush their own teeth are not very efficient.</li>
            <li>I only noticed later in fine print,</li>
            <li>While you can fit other toothbrush heads into the sanitizer (I tried with one of mine and did so without problem), your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what benefits I would have gotten if the sterilizer had worked with my toothbrush, but I must admit that I haven&#x27;t had a new cavity in 46 years.  </li>
            <li>Then on my computer, I saw the new Sonicare UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems with the new unit.</li>
            <li>I does look like the bulb needs changing now but it still lights up (although a bit dimmer than when new).</li>
            <li>Thsi product is easy to use and takes less than 15 min.  </li>
            <li>However, there are several adapters included which allow it to fit various newer Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The directions for putting them in aren&#x27;t very clear.</li>
            <li>(Normally, I buy a new one after I complete them.)  </li>
            <li>So far I have not had ANY issues with it, so I recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m inclined to agree with many of the other reviewers, in questioning whether this is something that I would actually spend money on.  </li>
            <li>My first thought when I received the  box was, \\&quot;Hmm, bigger than I</li>
            <li>But considering all the other sources of germs that you put into your mouth, your toothbrush shouldn&#x27;t be a significant concern (again, just soak it in rubbing alcohol).</li>
            <li>I bought this exact product in the UK three years ago for the British pound equivalent of $26.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of getting used to, but the long term benefits are worth it</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I received a full refund but no thanks to either the supplier nor Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So...while the product looks cool sitting on the vanity, I&#x27;m not certain it is something that we all need to have.      </li>
            <li>If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>When all product from the old unit are used I will begin using the new one.</li>
            <li>This unit is so compact that it is easily overlooked in plain site, so, you know, go mobile and put it in, like our home, the office.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy enough to use this sterilizer: rinse your toothbrush head, put it in the unit, press the button, take it out ten minutes later.  </li>
            <li>The outer case presents a pleasing blue glow when operating, and indeed it is easy to operate--just push one button, come back 10 minutes later, done!</li>
            <li>Also, to replace the bulb only through the original vendor was more expensive than to buy this particular item.  </li>
            <li>I certainly will use it in the future.  </li>
            <li>While it certainly works as indicated, and seems very efficient, the truth of the matter is that there is really no way to verify efficacy.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to clean the entire head, separate the screw on part and completely dry it off.  </li>
            <li>That said, I really wish this sanitizer could kill bacteria on regular (manual) toothbrushes too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s part of the natural flora.  </li>
            <li>unwanted (again, let me stress the difference between unwanted and and natural flora bacteria)</li>
            <li>if you share your Sonicare power handle with others in your household as I do with my fianc&amp;eacute;e as it really prevents the build-up and funky smell you would get if you didn&#x27;t remove your brush heads regularly like others I know, yech!</li>
            <li>Using the Sonicare we couldn&#x27;t do that without having to replace the brush-head early and incurring the cost.</li>
            <li>counter.)&lt;br /&gt;4)  Ease of use (Plug it in, press the power button; green light flashes.</li>
            <li>Having read that much tooth decay is related to bacteria, it seemed sensible that Philips Sonicare would offer a devise to kill bacteria on tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>I agree with those comments completely, so rather than repeat them</li>
            <li>At only $50 this product is really a steal &amp; help</li>
            <li>keep your brushes fresher longer without having to replace them nearly as often.  </li>
            <li>I cannot measure the hygienic function of this product, however, after a few weeks using it, I can say it is very convenient, has a solid design and incredibly cheap for the quality and effect.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t see a dentist regularly, you absolutely need the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>the bulb replacement, I just ordered two directly from the Sonicare website.</li>
            <li>I got this for my Waterpik Complete Care WP-900 toothbrush heads and it works well with two brush holder attachments that are included with the unit.</li>
            <li>That feature might make this product nearly perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old brush never smelled.   </li>
            <li>While some folks may think this product is frivolous and unnecessary, it is a real bonus in many situations.  </li>
            <li>Safe, compact, and here we are a few months later with no problems.</li>
            <li>since the previous reviewers already pretty much summed up the benefits and disadvantages of this product</li>
            <li>UV mutagenesis of bacteria will not clean your brush and make it sparkly clean.  </li>
            <li>It is small, easy to use, and fits conveniently on my sink.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s true or not, I really liked the way this little item performed, and I FELT as though I&#x27;d done something healthy for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And thus I doubt most people, most of whom didn&#x27;t get sick from their toothbrush normally, will bother with these extra steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2) Works well with the systems listed above (on the main product listing.)    </li>
            <li>but with fairly spendy  brush heads that are designed to last 6 months and have some strong magnets in their base, I have been reluctant to put the head in the dishwasher.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line: you could do so many other and better things with your $50 than spend it on a plastic light-bulb case that kills germs that weren&#x27;t getting you sick in the first place.</li>
            <li>Assuming that its 99% efficacy in killing bacteria is true (no way for the average user to test this!)</li>
            <li>I use soap and water to clean the bristles in the past but it always made the brissels too soft and had to be replaced too soon.  </li>
            <li>And if I linger on that, I might buy a new toothbrush head daily.</li>
            <li>We live in Mexico and being cautious with the drinking water is a big deal.  </li>
            <li>Finally, as another reviewer mentioned, the packaging on this is a real pain to open.</li>
            <li>When sanitation is done, light glows solid green and the unit shuts off automatically.)&lt;br /&gt;5)  </li>
            <li>I picked up this product on clearance at a local retail giant store as I was getting ready to go out of town.    </li>
            <li>no matter how clean you try to be, and even with regular rinsing, grime accumulates in that little space.</li>
            <li>The sanitizer has a convenient tray that the brush heads fit into and if the tray gets dirty it takes just seconds to clean.  </li>
            <li>Since I use an electric toothbrush only once a day and use a traditional brush at other times, I wish that the housing could fit regular brushes as well.  </li>
            <li>Why on earth didn&#x27;t they make this large enough for a regular toothbrush and tongue scraper to be sanitized at the same time?  </li>
            <li>I bought this not to kill the bacteria that might accrue from general toothbrushing in my mouth, but any bacteria that lingers in the bathroom in general.</li>
            <li>Any additional care taken to improve general well being should be welcomed.</li>
            <li>Based on general trust on an approved brand, I continue to use.</li>
            <li>My friends actually tease me about it, so no one was surprised that I now have this sanitzer.</li>
            <li>The issue isn&#x27;t with people who live in a vacuum where only their mouth and mouth flora reside.  </li>
            <li>will when ordinary peroxide soaks of their brushes three times a week is adequate.  </li>
            <li>Close the little door with your heads mounted around the center light and turn it on: easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a replacement for my older Sanitizer and first checked &#x27;Philips&#x27;s&#x27; web site and then went here and found that for a new item the price was a few dollars less</li>
            <li>The website also says that bacteria thrive in moist environments and live up to 48 hours even on dry brush heads.</li>
            <li>So, try NOT to use &#x27;antibacterial&#x27; soap, do eat some live active yogurt after a course of antibiotics and always completely finish a course of antibiotics that you&#x27;ve been prescribed by a doctor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;3-I agree with the reviewer that there is no scientific proof that further sanitizing toothbrushes makes anything better or worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;3-I agree with the reviewer that there is no scientific proof that further sanitizing toothbrushes makes anything better or worse.</li>
            <li>My Dentist first recommended Sonicare with the remark that I needed \\&quot;a little assistance at my age\\&quot; (60) with cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>This little machine is pretty neato.</li>
            <li>However they, as well as, their supplier left me high and dry on this one.  </li>
            <li>can see this item being useful for the germ-phobic, or those who get sick easily, or for households with multiple toothbrushes of the same model (and a high risk of the ick-factor of grabbing somebody else&#x27;s toothbrush head by accident),</li>
            <li>What it comes down to is largely a matter of what system you already have.  </li>
            <li>Not only do the adaptors address difference in bottom connectors (round or rectangular), but they also adjust for differences in height to keep the bristles at the right level.  </li>
            <li>This is useful if only because all other, particularly portable, ultraviolet sanitizers, are too narrow to hold the Sonicare toothbrush itself.</li>
            <li>The first shipment had a dead battery.</li>
            <li>It was difficult to find in our local stores but very easy to find and order, on line.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how well this unit works on other brands or the older philips heads, there are adapters</li>
            <li>While I have a Sonicare e 7000 and do not need a holder for the sanitizer, I know that I am not limited to sanitizing  only that one model of toothbrush</li>
            <li>I have used a Germ Terminator for several years but the sanitizer is much easier to use and takes up less space.  </li>
            <li>When I put my brush head into this sanitizer the UV radiation does the work to kill 99% of the bacteria, however my brush head remains moist till I take it out for next time since it&#x27;s inside the chamber and does not get a chance to dry off completely.</li>
            <li>Last night I opened the package and found some ridiculous piece of UV nonsense that people buy thinking they are getting something special.  </li>
            <li>Ten minutes later, when the small green light stops blinking, the brush head is free of at least 90% of bacteria.</li>
            <li>Therefore, we at least know that UV light has a germicidal effect even though we are not sure about the extend of it for this particular device.</li>
            <li>Therefore, we at least know that UV light has a germicidal effect even though we are not sure about the extend of it for this particular device.</li>
            <li>Also, good bacteria take up space and resources to keep bad bacteria from finding a niche.  </li>

            <li> (I loved that the &#x27;beep&#x27; after each quadrant helped my kids to keep brushing longer and do a better job!)    </li>
            <li> It would be really great to be able to pop theirs into the unit for cleaning too.    </li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Like the flu shot, just one more line of defense in the war against germs and illness!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> UV light does a great job of killing microbes.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is a great way to keep my brush and my wife&#x27;s brush free from germs and stored separately from the battery portion.  </li>
            <li> Great product, does what it promises, just wish it was available with a built in charger for the toothbrush handle.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product and a vary reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My grandkids visit us and they bring their own toothbrushes from home.   </li>
            <li> Nice compact size, and it stores nicely too.</li>
            <li> I am recovering from a stem cell transplant for acute leukemia - my immune system is suppressed and immature.  </li>
            <li> If you own a Philips Sonicare toothbrush system, then this Sanitizer is a MUST have for you.</li>
            <li> Liked ours</li>
            <li> Packaging (Nice presentation in the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice to have an enclosed place to store the brush heads in while not in use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember what kind of Oral B I had . . .</li>
            <li> If you happen to find it within the $10.00 range (which is the price of the carrying case Sonic makes) it is a nice carrying case for the brush heads.</li>
            <li> , is it effective at getting rid of bacteria.</li>
            <li> After getting the sonicare toothbrush for Christmas and loving it, I saw this deal on Amazon for the sanitizer and thought why not???</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference with the toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Therefore, kids tend to expose the brush to more bugs then we, adults do and their immune system is weaker against pathogens so this type of preventive measure can be a good one to take.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great gadget, thanks!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 5 years so far, still working good!!</li>
            <li> Just kidding, they&#x27;re still a nice, healthy, yellowish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I went with Amazon and it all came in great contition and very fast.</li>
            <li> First off, the scientist&#x27;s review is great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice in appearance, and perhaps a bit pricey for its function.</li>
            <li> nice to find out after reading the fine print.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t want to get sued, especially in light of reports suggesting that certain diseases may be passed through saliva.  </li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> Now that, would make things more sanitary.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Phillips Sonicare UV Sanitizer because I was concerned about how healthy my toothbrush heads were.  </li>
            <li> I love the magnetic hold.</li>
            <li> Sure, everyone knows your mouth has bacteria, and that that bacteria is safe...</li>
            <li> I guess we cant be too safe.</li>
            <li> but I am glad that I did make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I could never find one of these in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found one through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I agree w/ others that for this price, it should accept more brands and styles.</li>
            <li> (I have to believe \\&quot;truth in advertising\\&quot; laws are at work here, because my Sonicare doesn&#x27;t produce results that are any better than any battery-operated toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.)  </li>
            <li> This is the most inexpensive unit I found.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel better to use it</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure how to tell that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> look any better</li>
            <li> The Essence toothbrush heads tend to build up a lot of gunk because of the way they screw on so rather than buying this fancy sanitizer you&#x27;d be better off just buying a better made toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> The one caveat is that you need to make sure this fits your brand/model of toothbrush, as you won&#x27;t be able to use it otherwise.      </li>
            <li> For starters, killing 90% of the bacteria isn&#x27;t that meaningful if the remaining 10% can grow rapidly.  </li>
            <li> more than one hundred million microorganisms can be found on the brush heads of even healthy individuals.</li>
            <li> Plus there is one more electric cord in addition to your toothbrush charger cord plugged into the outlet which clutters up the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Folks, it doesn&#x27;t get any easier or more practical than this.</li>
            <li> I love this sanitizer.</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love my Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I suspect for most people this will just end up as a gadget that gets stuck in a closet or cabinet and never used again.  </li>
            <li> It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll give mine to family member who also uses Sonicare brushes and may appreciate more the gadget geekiness of the UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, I was still able to try this out since my sister owns a Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Just place your brush head inside, close the door, and press the button on the top for the sanitizing cycle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I wasn&#x27;t really able to use the product, I&#x27;ve rated it as a 3 to indicate that I&#x27;m neutral.  </li>
            <li> No opinion would have been a better choice, but Amazon.com doesn&#x27;t offer that alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a scientist, so I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> 1) Is the unit safe for operation 2)</li>
            <li> In times like these, we all need a leg up on taking care of ourselves and staying healthy.  </li>
            <li> It does a better job of sanitizing the heads</li>
            <li> This makes you feel like you&#x27;re killing the germs and making the brush head safe to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?    </li>
            <li> For me, it is more of an OCD where I like to be thorough on the things I do.  </li>
            <li> and we feel confident that our brushes are sanitized.</li>
            <li> I also have a background in biology, which is why i should have known better.</li>
            <li> Most diseases are caused by pathogens that we introduce to our body through oral way.</li>
            <li> It sure seems like cheap insurance along with some handwashing directions for the family!</li>
            <li> I started with the recommendation of my dentist, and many of the problems (gum disease, plaque) were cleared up as a result.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding the two \\&quot;most helpful</li>
            <li> love the idea that it sanitizes the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s mostly Sonicare and OralB</li>
            <li> You fit the brush head inside, close the door, push the button, and a bright light turns on for 10 minutes, then turns off.  </li>
            <li> Since it appears to do what it claims to, I give the product more than one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have to echo the sentiments that more scientifically-trained reviews have expressed.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not even sure toddler fingers could get in, although kids have been known to defeat a host of safety devices.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not even sure toddler fingers could get in, although kids have been known to defeat a host of safety devices.)    </li>
            <li> many scratches on the product.</li>
            <li> More information is needed to assuage.</li>
            <li> Nice peace of mind, knowing your brush head is clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel great after a brushing, a lot better than a normal brush.</li>
            <li> I like this new line of UV sanitizing products; this is a great product for those with the appropriate systems, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy into the Sonicare system on this basis alone.</li>
            <li> First, the good.</li>
            <li> nice looking, and sanitizing is quick.  </li>
            <li> Its very easy yo use and to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have no way of proving that it does what it says but I feel better having and using it to keep my toothbrush germ free.  </li>
            <li> An LED  flashes on the top of the unit and you see through some translucent plastic that UV light is activated inside.  </li>
            <li> which is all very well and good</li>
            <li> How does Philips really think that this is a good design.  </li>
            <li> There probably is a clinical answer to this to tell us whether killing off 99 percent of bacteria this way is good for us (i.e., reduces colds, reinfections) and whether we would be better to just soak our brushes or perhaps live with the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m not the most adept kid on the block when it comes to anything even slightly mechanical, but I have been known to successfully snap times into their properly fitting spaces once or twice in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> The ultraviolet light disinfection process used by this unit may make some people  think it&#x27;s the latest quack invention, but ultraviolet light is being used in hospitals for disinfection.</li>
            <li> It provides a clean and safe place to store our two brush heads</li>
            <li> This UV sanitizer is so easy to use</li>
            <li> It also easily comes apart for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It is portable and actually easy to use.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Parts that snap easily into place.)&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the unit is easy because there is a removable drip tray.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up and operate.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy to order online</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to hurt yourself opening these things -- but this is a problem for a lot of products not just the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to set-up, use, and care for.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have your own lab, you never can be sure if it&#x27;s really working, so we just have to go on faith that the manufacturers are telling the truth.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> So, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  </li>
            <li> easy to use, works as promised..</li>
            <li> like the Sonicare UV Santizer for its easy of use.  </li>
            <li> I like the Sonicare UV Santizer for its easy of use.  </li>
            <li> (The adapters are fairly easy to use.)     </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work, but so does soaking your toothbrush in strong mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I know that my Essence toothbrushes fit in perfectly and that when I push the button the little light goes on, but once you remove the toothbrushes they don&#x27;t smell or look any cleaner, so how can you be sure?</li>
            <li> People survived brushing their teeth just fine before we had UV cleaning systems for toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The bottom of each brush holder is magnetic and securely grabs and nudges the brush head into place very quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The aformentioned UV sanitizers can handle a full \\&quot;normal\\&quot; brush, so if you don&#x27;t have the relevant Sonicare or Oral B systems, they&#x27;d definitely be a better deal.  </li>
            <li> But as one person pointed out, we&#x27;ve lived without a Sanitizer for years and have gotten along fine without it.</li>
            <li> I have a biology background and the good news is that this amount of UV light is going to have the desired effect on the bacteria that live in your toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> This is very easy to use, which was my first question when I got it.  </li>
            <li> Tools such as the Sonicare UV Sanitizer are a great addition to my arsenal in defense against rogue bacteria.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know how well they fit.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare replacement heads are in no way cheap.</li>
            <li> Even aside from the UV light part just keeping the heads in the case will help keep germs off of it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, am happy with the product...</li>
            <li> This item is easy to keep clean, and disinfects the brush heads while they are stored out of sight.</li>
            <li> Based on the info for my pricey air purifier w/ a UV light, I&#x27;m inclined to think this item works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer keeps 2 brush heads, in my case Oral-B Floss-Action, in a brush head case that uses UV light to sanitize the brush heads for about 10 minutes and then shuts off.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The idea is that you close-up the brush in the cabinet and turn on the UV light which kills the germs on the brush in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t sanitize - just get a blinking light.  </li>
            <li> The sanitizing is done by UV light, so there are no cleaning solutions to buy; once you&#x27;ve bought the Sanitizer, you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a light that flashes while it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I use it every day to keep my brush heads free from bacteria.</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  </li>
            <li> in our e-series brush heads and push the button.&lt;br /&gt;After watching a movie, the light is still flashing--it doesn&#x27;t turn off itself as it should after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Find</li>
            <li> But i thought, cheap supprise gift.</li>
            <li> UV light is a way of sanitizing we use in the lab.</li>
            <li> My feeling is that it should be as effective as stated in the 99% claim on the box since it acts in a very close distance and for quite a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> UV light is a way of sanitizing we use in the lab.</li>
            <li> My feeling is that it should be as effective as stated in the 99% claim on the box since it acts in a very close distance and for quite a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Theoretically, this seems great to sanitize the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the UV light interacts with the plastic bristles and weakens it;</li>
            <li> Now I know my brush head is germ free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a biological fact that UV light increases the number of DNA mutations.  </li>
            <li> In addition Phillips warranty does not cover the light bulb.....</li>
            <li> This UV sanitizer is designed to sanitize your toothbrush head by saturating it with UV light, which is supposed to kill all the germs and bacteria that could be on it.  </li>
            <li> I love a great gadget: this is terrific, economical and gives us a lot of feeling safer about toothbrush sterility.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this product, everyone should have one, or at least be able to sanitize their toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  </li>
            <li> Very economical</li>
            <li> Everything functioned as it should and she reported that the toothbrush did feel clean (softer bristles free of residue).</li>
            <li> Quick and easy way to sanitize toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> Well, without a laboratory - you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t honestly say that normal folks need or benefit from something like this, unless you want an iPod looking place to keep your brush heads when not in use.</li>
            <li> It is a brand that has a very good reputation and I really feel it does what it is supposed to do,it does not take up much room and is easily stored when the cleaning process is complete.</li>
            <li> We try to clean twice a day.  </li>
            <li> After I used this unit I could tell a difference of how the brissels felt and they felt clean.</li>
            <li> You have a toothbrush which supposedly uses sonic waves to clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li> When you think about it, how many people do you know personally who have contracted E. Coli from their own toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you will not notice a difference in the way your brush tastes or performs (unless you&#x27;ve also been using it to clean out your belly-button lint or something).</li>
            <li> You can, if necssary, easily clean the inside of the unit by pulling out and washing a tray that collects any runoff water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now we clean our brush-heads on a weekly basis and I don&#x27;t ever worry that we are recycling germs from the brush-head.    </li>
            <li> This takes about 10 minutes for the peace of mind that your brush heads are clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also did research on keeping toothbrushes clean.</li>
            <li> I did find one article at WikiHow that says getting your toothbrush clean just takes toothpaste (which cleans the brush, too), using water and rubbing the bristles before and after... nothing fancy -- everything you already have.ust takes toothpaste (which cleans the brush, too), using water and rubbing the bristles before and after...</li>
            <li> We used to take our Sonicare toothbrush heads and run them through the dishwasher to clean them up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does clean well, however.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t meant we can&#x27;t clean our brush heads to get rid of accumulated germs and bacteria.  </li>
            <li> I love this sanitizer...knowing that germs are killed before you put your brush in your mouth...and it has a great place to stay in between brushing...</li>
            <li> But as long as you have the correct toothbrush head for the unit, it&#x27;s easy, convenient, and presumably, good for your health.  </li>
            <li> The newer philips heads pop right in easily.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare UV Sanitizer was easy to use right out of the box, with no assembly required.</li>
            <li> The UV Sanitizer offers an alternative that will not harm the head and seems to be effective.  </li>
            <li> If your household happens to use one of the toothbrush brands that is supported by this sanitizer and especially if you find yourself passing colds from person to person, this may be a good product to try.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is simple to use and I assume it does a good job of killing germs on our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> so much I bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> it true?</li>
            <li> However, if you have people in your family that are prone to illness, or who take antibiotics with some regularity, this might be a cost effective way to sanitize without having to throw out your toothbrushes as frequently.     </li>
            <li> The canceled operation won&#x27;t cool the bulb, but it will stop the UV radiation.  </li>
            <li> That being said, you have no evidence of anything, although it does offer as a place to store your toothbrush heads and looks cool on a bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> on to your basic Sonicare (or a good range of compatible toothbrushes which for the two of us, was a good thing with two different brands) and get those heads sanitized.</li>
            <li> user menu is full of wrinkle.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent health investment for very little money!</li>
            <li> The bottom tray and adaptors snap out fairly easily for cleaning; however, it would be nice if the entire interior compartment emerged germ-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, this is easy to set up once you survive the hardest part...</li>
            <li> The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead easy to use - close up the sanitiser, press a button and then the brush heads are flooded by bright light for the duration of the clean - about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> After researching the problem they have announced that this summer they have a much better plan for keeping the public pools safe for all-- they&#x27;re going to use UV rays to kill all the bacteria.</li>
            <li> The plastic bulb housing seems to protect the bulb adequately from all but the tiniest fingers.  </li>
            <li> The plastic bulb housing seems to protect the bulb adequately from all but the tiniest fingers.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much, Philips!</li>
            <li> While there could be some benefit, hot water is probably close in effect and free.</li>
            <li> I love that it is compact, simple to use and very cost effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dexterous and in good shape, and it was a pain for me (and I managed to get a minor cut out of it)</li>
            <li> I use it after I brush before bed every night so that next morning the brush head is nice and clean again.</li>
            <li> It is well-designed, easy to operate, and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> I pretty much agree with most reviewers.  </li>
            <li> The unit is large and it came assembled, but had detailed instructions for an unassembeled unit.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the forensic tools to tell if this thing works well, but for piece of mind, it&#x27;s a great little uv unit.</li>
            <li> I have ordered directly from Amazon many times with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I not only feel that my toothbrush heads are more germ free, but I also like it because I can store my heads in the sanitizer between using.  </li>
            <li> Humans have an incredible amount of germs present both internally and on our skin.  </li>
            <li> I am more of an old fashion type toothbrush user but this product should appeal to those who like to take care of their teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and designed specifically for my particular brand of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> this worth having?  </li>
            <li> I use this product daily and feel confident that my toothbrush is free of the bacteria a bathroom use creates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re thinking whether buying the sanitizer is worth it, here&#x27;s my take.</li>
            <li> But that blue, glowing UV light sure seems as though it&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> Therefore I must conclude that for those with the correct brush, this is a useful product.</li>
            <li> The product design is sleek and fits nicely into the bathroom without being extremely big and industrial looking.    </li>
            <li> It was a handy way to carry our brush heads when we traveled recently.    </li>
            <li> then it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The santizer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> We only use bottled water and rinse our toothbrushes with alcohol (Tequila and the rubbing kind</li>
            <li> My understanding is that there is a shut-off to prevent humans from being exposed to the UV light, which is a good thing as UV light will interfere with human DNA in the same way that it damages bacterial DNA.  </li>
            <li> Worth $50?</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s one more thing to sit on a shelf and plug into a power strip, but it&#x27;s worth it to have a really clean toothbrush every time you brush.</li>
            <li> This is a very nicely designed product that accepted the heads of my Sonicare toothbrushed without trouble and operated without a hitch.  </li>
            <li> I found the product easy to use, the packaging while it afforded sanitary delivery of the product was moderately easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, right.  </li>
            <li> recommend it if you have the right brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, any Sonicare toothbrush fits right in the sanitizer case.</li>
            <li> It stands on my counter for easy use and has given me a new comfort level about my health and hygiene.  </li>
            <li> I had mistakenly believed the part of the description that said it supports most major brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> But overall a great product for a gift or you own personal use, especially with mouth and teeh care.</li>
            <li> Most bathrooms have limited outlets available, and it requires two outlets to run this sonicare system.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fairly unobtrusive presence on the average bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> Bought a new UV unit to find that the light bulb does not work and phillis web site has no mention on where to get a replacement.  </li>
            <li> You have to have the brush in exactly the right position to close it.  </li>
            <li> Ease of assembly  (Clear, easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> For the last 3 years we used it on daily basis and there is no wear and tear plus bulb and the timer works great</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product, but it appears to do the job fine so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new in the original packaging, all intact</li>
            <li> It not only sanitizes your brush heads, it keeps them clean and dust free to boot.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is removing the light cover to clean it.</li>
            <li> Is able to take different type of brush heads, which helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and I feel better about using my sonicare toothbrush everyday knowing it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> What about a kid who runs into your bathroom after having played outside where there are many types of non-normal flora (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli 0157:H7, etc.)</li>
            <li> But personally, I think its a really cool gadget, and if you are a gadget fan like me, you probably enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an LED indicator on the top that shows if the UV cycle has been run since the last time it was opened.</li>
            <li> I like and have numerous gadgets that probably aren&#x27;t really needed, but to me make life easier and more fun.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare Elite 9650 Power Toothbrush which I use 2-3 times daily</li>
            <li> A better idea is to replace your brushes regularly.</li>
            <li> You simply put the toothbrush head(s) in and push a button on the top.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t send him toothpaste because I was sure he only used one brand</li>
            <li> Thanks, Phillips!</li>
            <li> Another thing I started doing was to leave my medicine cabinet ajar, since a closed cabinet means trapping a moist toothbrush in a possibly warm place, thus allowing mold to grow.  </li>
            <li> Effectiveness (I saw a difference in the brush color head after the first use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product arrived, the first challenge was opening the plastic around the sterilizer.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, my rechargeable Oral B toothbrush didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> First impression:    </li>
            <li> Instructions are precise and clear.   </li>
            <li> Simply put your brush head inside, close it, and hit the button on top.</li>
            <li> Thanks sonicare!</li>
            <li> Among different ways of sanitizing things including dumping them into various solutions, this one is the most innocent one since it leaves no chemical residue that may cancel the benefits.</li>

            <li> How do you think your toothbrush head is getting contaminated in the first place?    </li>
            <li> the open many hours after its been in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just recovered from a sinus infection, when I used my Phillips Sonicare Sanitizer for the first time.</li>
            <li> First they buy the company</li>
            <li> after about  years my old Philips brush stop working bought this one and uv light</li>
            <li> Any one who spends significant amount of money for an electric tooth brush to maintain oral hygene may consider using this gadget to keep the brush head clean, (only) if money is not a constraint.    </li>
            <li> My old toothbrush worked better than their new model.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not a microbiologist, I can&#x27;t say for sure, but all the warnings that come with the box suggest that the light is powerful enough to do the necessary damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While there is no tangible proof the UV light has actually sanitized the toothbrush head, we&#x27;ll have to take it on faith that it has - and it&#x27;s been made quick, easy and relatively inexpensive, so why not?  </li>
            <li> So far I like it better than the old battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are so much cleaner; and I love the 30 second quadrant     timer</li>
            <li> Our heads fit right into the space with no adjustments, but if you&#x27;ve got a different model toothbrush, the sanitizer comes with adapters.</li>
            <li> With H1N1 and other viruses around, it is great to take 10 short minutes to disinfect our toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> The UV light serves to kill all germs - apparently...  </li>
            <li> &quot; I read the directions first,  which seemed to require an unusual number of steps to set up and  install the UV bulb.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to do its magic, so that is a plus if you are in some kind of hurry.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer eliminates an unsightly toothbrush sitting open on your counter, and keeps the head fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy, only takes 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Such an easy product to use.  </li>
            <li> 2) not sure if it really does what it says--who does know, but I do feel good using it     </li>
            <li> Have strong scissors on hand to open the plastic sealed packaging the unit is housed in!    </li>
            <li> and it does have a large footprint for the counter.</li>
            <li> Having used this device, I have not developed any exciting feeling, except for the comfort of &#x27;scientific assurance&#x27; that the brush head is clean.</li>
            <li> I feel that my toothbrush is very clean and it seems to stiffen the brushes on the ones about to be used the limited amount of time - 3 months.</li>
            <li> Thanks to them</li>
            <li> The Item works and the blue light goes on.  </li>
            <li> Just How do I know if my brushes really are sanitized?  </li>
            <li> really enjoy the sanitizer - I can sanitize my toothbrush and my husbands at the same time!</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare toothbrush, which works really well,</li>
            <li> im a biologist at a VERY prestigious institution</li>
            <li> Now, does anyone REALLY need this product?</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things where you don&#x27;t really get to witness the value of your money.  </li>
            <li> I really like the magets that \\&quot;snap\\&quot; the brush head into position and hold it in place.  </li>
            <li> How can you really tell if this thing \\&quot;sanitizes\\&quot; your toothbrush head?  </li>
            <li> How much anti-bacterial stuff is out there anyway?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li> While it is packaged very attractively....and the product itself is also...</li>
            <li> All you have to do is plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to be used.  </li>
            <li> After that it was a breeze, place the brush heads inside the stainless steel lined chamber - the bristles should face the UV bulb - and plug it in and turn it on.</li>
            <li> In about ten minutes, your brush heads are germ free.</li>
            <li> and then whole cycle repeats itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> However, I do have two children that seem to be very suceptible to sniffles, colds, and the ilk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, for $50 plus S&amp;H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I just felt it was important to point out in the hopes I might save someone else from making the same mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end this product does not make much \\&quot;dollar and sense\\&quot; without some type of proof in the claim.   </li>
            <li> Thanks for sending it my way just in time.  </li>
            <li> This product is an answer to that and very convenient.  </li>
            <li> My wife feels that her toothbrushes are much cleaner...</li>
            <li> Very anticlimactic.</li>
            <li> No way to really tell if it works in sanitizing but haven&#x27;t gotten any&#x27;revenge&#x27; yet.</li>
            <li> , I do wish that the sanitizer/charger that came with the toothbrush was available, it is smaller and charges also, but this will do!  </li>
            <li> While most bacteria will be killed, the 0.01% that survive are more likely to have suffered mutations.  </li>
            <li> The unit fits 2 brush heads, but before you even start to consider buying one, you should definitely read the list of brush heads that will actually fit</li>
            <li> and if it is really working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works out very well with a Sonicare electric  toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I really like this sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> The light is lasting for like three years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not much of a way of knowing it&#x27;s working without running some bacteria cultures, but I&#x27;ll assume it does</li>
            <li> Ensuring that something we place inside our mouths is 99% sanitary just makes good common sense.  </li>
            <li> Having a cleaner brush is a good thing, so I don&#x27;t see anything negative here.  </li>
            <li> It seems likely to be a far better use of the cash.</li>
            <li> The detergent in your toothpaste (variously called sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, etc) will probably be effective enough at getting rid of bacteria --</li>
            <li> The bacteria that are NOT killed by this treatment are more likely to be mutated.  </li>
            <li> We live in a world of ever more consumer gadgets - many of us have drawers or closets full of forsaken or useless ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m for keeping personal hygiene items as clean as possible; and the Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer does a fantastic job of meeting my needs.</li>
            <li> Great, except H2O2 seriously oxidizes your plastic brush bristles which can shorten the life of your brush head considerably.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have read in other reviews that &#x27;why sanitize when the germs are coming from our mouths&#x27;,</li>
            <li> I can make due with a power strip, but don&#x27;t like having it on a counter top that gets a lot of water splashed around .The</li>
            <li> A side note: we had a problem with a bacteria in swimming pools last summer and they tried everyting to get the water clean--</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s a nice small unit, doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the bathroom</li>
            <li> All points are valid, and sure, according to other reviewers, this makes for a great place to store the Sonicare heads, but really the part of your Sonicare that seems to really need the MOST sanitation is the where the head and base connect.</li>
            <li> I have become a germ-a-phobe in recent years and specifically sought out a sanitizer specially designed for my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it was, was for it to be less bulky and a bit more like the original one that came with the brushes that was attached to the charger.</li>
            <li> It feels solid and looks cool in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The cost of the replacement brush-heads was actually quite reasonable, considering you only had to do it every six months, and we found it did an outstanding job for our family.</li>
            <li> I get colds frequently and sore throats too, and I&#x27;m pretty strict about changing toothbrush heads after either.  </li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no way for the average consumer to be sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new toothbrush every time you brush your teeth!  </li>
            <li> So the more bugs you eliminate the less risk you get.</li>
            <li> , People have survived very happily without wasting money on idiotic gadgets like this.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really read into how effective it is but at the least the brush heads are in an enclosed compartment while all sorts of germs are flying around the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I caution anyone w/ young kids not to let them use it, as if opened during operation, the light can potentially damage their eyes.</li>
            <li> There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models).</li>
            <li> I ordered an electronic toothbrush and instead received the latest gimmick promoted to American corporate consumerism!  </li>
            <li> It works quickly and quietly.  </li>
            <li> this is especially helpful if you have more than once person using the same rechargable</li>
            <li> Though I do have one quibble with another review, the biologist poo-pooing this device, despite being mainly in agreement.</li>
            <li> I think the main concern of bacterial growth on the brush is not the ones transmitted from our mouths.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and quietly.</li>
            <li> To summarize, dentists use this sort of gizmo because they&#x27;re putting the same tools into the mouths of many different people.  </li>
            <li> That is probably not a very good thing as per Philips own website which asserts the bacteria thrive in moist environments.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sonicare products, any of them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> That just confirmed to me again that this is a really smart investment for a family that wants to keep their teeth clean and healthy without having to buy new Sonicare brush-heads every time someone gets sick.  </li>
            <li> It was a little more cheaply constructed than I had expected from a Sonicare product, but seems acceptable.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t see Walmart changing their prices everyday, but when they do they drop the price to give you a better deal, not rob you like what just went on with this item.</li>
            <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t worth the counter space, and considering that a dip into rubbing alcohol would kill everything, too, I left it with my mom at home.</li>
            <li> Remove brush heads and use as normal.   </li>
            <li> As a useful tool, it also comes up short.</li>
            <li> Exposure to a moderate level of bacteria is actually GOOD for you, since it acts as a sort of exercise for your immune system, strengthening it for more dangerous infections.  </li>
            <li> Particularly in comparison to other cleaning methods easily available.     </li>
            <li> The Sonicare UV Sanitizer uses a small but strong light bulb inside a chrome-painted plastic housing to kill electric toothbrush bacteria on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;m not a biologist, so I really can&#x27;t reasonably comment on whether or not UV light is modifying strands of DNA like some of the previous reviewers.    </li>
            <li> and I found out later that I was right.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I are already in the habit of pushing the button right after both of us have brushed our teeth.  </li>
            <li> upsides are that it runs pretty quickly, the humming sound is a nice reminder to unplug the sanitizer when it&#x27;s done and save some phantom energy, and even if it&#x27;s not plugged in it still blocks some dirty airborne particles after flushing (apparently closing the toilet lid doesn&#x27;t even help that!).</li>
            <li> Besides the regular bugs of the mouth flora reside there in a balance with our immune system and do not make much of a problem but pathogenic bacteria should not be treated in the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-kids learning to brush their own teeth are not very efficient.</li>
            <li> I only noticed later in fine print,</li>
            <li> While you can fit other toothbrush heads into the sanitizer (I tried with one of mine and did so without problem), your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what benefits I would have gotten if the sterilizer had worked with my toothbrush, but I must admit that I haven&#x27;t had a new cavity in 46 years.  </li>
            <li> Then on my computer, I saw the new Sonicare UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems with the new unit.</li>
            <li> I does look like the bulb needs changing now but it still lights up (although a bit dimmer than when new).</li>
            <li> Thsi product is easy to use and takes less than 15 min.  </li>
            <li> However, there are several adapters included which allow it to fit various newer Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The directions for putting them in aren&#x27;t very clear.</li>
            <li> (Normally, I buy a new one after I complete them.)  </li>
            <li> So far I have not had ANY issues with it, so I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inclined to agree with many of the other reviewers, in questioning whether this is something that I would actually spend money on.  </li>
            <li> My first thought when I received the  box was, \\&quot;Hmm, bigger than I</li>
            <li> But considering all the other sources of germs that you put into your mouth, your toothbrush shouldn&#x27;t be a significant concern (again, just soak it in rubbing alcohol).</li>
            <li> I bought this exact product in the UK three years ago for the British pound equivalent of $26.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of getting used to, but the long term benefits are worth it</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I received a full refund but no thanks to either the supplier nor Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So...while the product looks cool sitting on the vanity, I&#x27;m not certain it is something that we all need to have.      </li>
            <li> If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> When all product from the old unit are used I will begin using the new one.</li>
            <li> This unit is so compact that it is easily overlooked in plain site, so, you know, go mobile and put it in, like our home, the office.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy enough to use this sterilizer: rinse your toothbrush head, put it in the unit, press the button, take it out ten minutes later.  </li>
            <li> The outer case presents a pleasing blue glow when operating, and indeed it is easy to operate--just push one button, come back 10 minutes later, done!</li>
            <li> Also, to replace the bulb only through the original vendor was more expensive than to buy this particular item.  </li>
            <li> I certainly will use it in the future.  </li>
            <li> While it certainly works as indicated, and seems very efficient, the truth of the matter is that there is really no way to verify efficacy.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to clean the entire head, separate the screw on part and completely dry it off.  </li>
            <li> That said, I really wish this sanitizer could kill bacteria on regular (manual) toothbrushes too.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s part of the natural flora.  </li>
            <li> unwanted (again, let me stress the difference between unwanted and and natural flora bacteria)</li>
            <li> if you share your Sonicare power handle with others in your household as I do with my fianc&amp;eacute;e as it really prevents the build-up and funky smell you would get if you didn&#x27;t remove your brush heads regularly like others I know, yech!</li>
            <li> Using the Sonicare we couldn&#x27;t do that without having to replace the brush-head early and incurring the cost.</li>
            <li> counter.)&lt;br /&gt;4)  Ease of use (Plug it in, press the power button; green light flashes.</li>
            <li> Having read that much tooth decay is related to bacteria, it seemed sensible that Philips Sonicare would offer a devise to kill bacteria on tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> I agree with those comments completely, so rather than repeat them</li>
            <li> At only $50 this product is really a steal &amp; help</li>
            <li> keep your brushes fresher longer without having to replace them nearly as often.  </li>
            <li> I cannot measure the hygienic function of this product, however, after a few weeks using it, I can say it is very convenient, has a solid design and incredibly cheap for the quality and effect.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t see a dentist regularly, you absolutely need the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> the bulb replacement, I just ordered two directly from the Sonicare website.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Waterpik Complete Care WP-900 toothbrush heads and it works well with two brush holder attachments that are included with the unit.</li>
            <li> That feature might make this product nearly perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old brush never smelled.   </li>
            <li> While some folks may think this product is frivolous and unnecessary, it is a real bonus in many situations.  </li>
            <li> Safe, compact, and here we are a few months later with no problems.</li>
            <li> since the previous reviewers already pretty much summed up the benefits and disadvantages of this product</li>
            <li> UV mutagenesis of bacteria will not clean your brush and make it sparkly clean.  </li>
            <li> It is small, easy to use, and fits conveniently on my sink.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s true or not, I really liked the way this little item performed, and I FELT as though I&#x27;d done something healthy for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And thus I doubt most people, most of whom didn&#x27;t get sick from their toothbrush normally, will bother with these extra steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2) Works well with the systems listed above (on the main product listing.)    </li>
            <li> but with fairly spendy  brush heads that are designed to last 6 months and have some strong magnets in their base, I have been reluctant to put the head in the dishwasher.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line: you could do so many other and better things with your $50 than spend it on a plastic light-bulb case that kills germs that weren&#x27;t getting you sick in the first place.</li>
            <li> Assuming that its 99% efficacy in killing bacteria is true (no way for the average user to test this!)</li>
            <li> I use soap and water to clean the bristles in the past but it always made the brissels too soft and had to be replaced too soon.  </li>
            <li> And if I linger on that, I might buy a new toothbrush head daily.</li>
            <li> We live in Mexico and being cautious with the drinking water is a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Finally, as another reviewer mentioned, the packaging on this is a real pain to open.</li>
            <li> When sanitation is done, light glows solid green and the unit shuts off automatically.)&lt;br /&gt;5)  </li>
            <li> I picked up this product on clearance at a local retail giant store as I was getting ready to go out of town.    </li>
            <li> no matter how clean you try to be, and even with regular rinsing, grime accumulates in that little space.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer has a convenient tray that the brush heads fit into and if the tray gets dirty it takes just seconds to clean.  </li>
            <li> Since I use an electric toothbrush only once a day and use a traditional brush at other times, I wish that the housing could fit regular brushes as well.  </li>
            <li> Why on earth didn&#x27;t they make this large enough for a regular toothbrush and tongue scraper to be sanitized at the same time?  </li>
            <li> I bought this not to kill the bacteria that might accrue from general toothbrushing in my mouth, but any bacteria that lingers in the bathroom in general.</li>
            <li> Any additional care taken to improve general well being should be welcomed.</li>
            <li> Based on general trust on an approved brand, I continue to use.</li>
            <li> My friends actually tease me about it, so no one was surprised that I now have this sanitzer.</li>
            <li> The issue isn&#x27;t with people who live in a vacuum where only their mouth and mouth flora reside.  </li>
            <li> will when ordinary peroxide soaks of their brushes three times a week is adequate.  </li>
            <li> Close the little door with your heads mounted around the center light and turn it on: easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my older Sanitizer and first checked &#x27;Philips&#x27;s&#x27; web site and then went here and found that for a new item the price was a few dollars less</li>
            <li> The website also says that bacteria thrive in moist environments and live up to 48 hours even on dry brush heads.</li>
            <li> So, try NOT to use &#x27;antibacterial&#x27; soap, do eat some live active yogurt after a course of antibiotics and always completely finish a course of antibiotics that you&#x27;ve been prescribed by a doctor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3-I agree with the reviewer that there is no scientific proof that further sanitizing toothbrushes makes anything better or worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3-I agree with the reviewer that there is no scientific proof that further sanitizing toothbrushes makes anything better or worse.</li>
            <li> My Dentist first recommended Sonicare with the remark that I needed \\&quot;a little assistance at my age\\&quot; (60) with cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> This little machine is pretty neato.</li>
            <li> However they, as well as, their supplier left me high and dry on this one.  </li>
            <li> can see this item being useful for the germ-phobic, or those who get sick easily, or for households with multiple toothbrushes of the same model (and a high risk of the ick-factor of grabbing somebody else&#x27;s toothbrush head by accident),</li>
            <li> What it comes down to is largely a matter of what system you already have.  </li>
            <li> Not only do the adaptors address difference in bottom connectors (round or rectangular), but they also adjust for differences in height to keep the bristles at the right level.  </li>
            <li> This is useful if only because all other, particularly portable, ultraviolet sanitizers, are too narrow to hold the Sonicare toothbrush itself.</li>
            <li> The first shipment had a dead battery.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find in our local stores but very easy to find and order, on line.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well this unit works on other brands or the older philips heads, there are adapters</li>
            <li> While I have a Sonicare e 7000 and do not need a holder for the sanitizer, I know that I am not limited to sanitizing  only that one model of toothbrush</li>
            <li> I have used a Germ Terminator for several years but the sanitizer is much easier to use and takes up less space.  </li>
            <li> When I put my brush head into this sanitizer the UV radiation does the work to kill 99% of the bacteria, however my brush head remains moist till I take it out for next time since it&#x27;s inside the chamber and does not get a chance to dry off completely.</li>
            <li> Last night I opened the package and found some ridiculous piece of UV nonsense that people buy thinking they are getting something special.  </li>
            <li> Ten minutes later, when the small green light stops blinking, the brush head is free of at least 90% of bacteria.</li>
            <li> Therefore, we at least know that UV light has a germicidal effect even though we are not sure about the extend of it for this particular device.</li>
            <li> Therefore, we at least know that UV light has a germicidal effect even though we are not sure about the extend of it for this particular device.</li>
            <li> Also, good bacteria take up space and resources to keep bad bacteria from finding a niche.  </li>
            <li> You know how annoying it is to keep in mind that every 30-45 days you must throw away your old toothbrush and then find the same kind with the same either soft or medium head</li>
            <li> This new design is no improvement just a way to sucker us into buying a so called new product.   </li>
            <li> Anyway, if you&#x27;re seriously OCD, maybe it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li> Some of the other negative reviews helped me realize that I&#x27;m probably keeping my toothbrushes and my mouth adequately clean.</li>
            <li> I think it is contamination from being in a restroom, open to fecal contaminants in the air, and also, at least here in my city, an apparently harmless but pretty pink growth that seems to come in the water supply.     </li>
            <li> At the time of writing this review it was offered at $24 directly from amazon so not much of a price change for the three years past and between the countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to use with my kid&#x27;s toothbrushes (both the finger mount slicon gum brushes and small beginners brushes) unlike many other reviewers who use it for electrical toothbrush</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty hard to see how one could screw up the sanitizing process.  </li>
            <li> As a man, I have all too often witnessed other men in public restrooms dodge right past the sink on their way out.</li>
            <li> Also humans have the least clean mouths likely caused by less helpful chemicals in our saliva unlike a dog or a cat, so that was one of my reasons to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact, don&#x27;t take much room on the counter and sanitizes the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have arthritis and the small components are really challenge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive to do that with cost of ultrasonic toothbrush replacement heads, so this is a nice alternative.     </li>
            <li> I already purchase a new toothbrush every six months and now that time could increase to every few weeks with winter coming on.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the life of my soicare brush will be prolonged and more sanitary, especially after a cold.</li>
            <li> After several unanswered emails from the supplier and Amazon, I called American Express.  </li>
            <li> Oh, yeah, a toilet.      </li>
            <li> When I bought my first Phillips Sonicare electric toothbrush, I got the brush head that was hard to keep my lips closed around.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the rate of reinfection to yourself from your own toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The bulb will only turn on when the unit is closed as a safety measure.</li>
            <li> ; I pity the arthritic or elderly who try to open this package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I deducted one star for the flimsy plastic, as I&#x27;m worried that for the price it won&#x27;t hold up long.</li>
            <li> It is time consuming, and not really a chore I wanted to do every morning and everytime I brushed my teeth, or maybe I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer, I thought  it was an unnecessary device, meant to profit even further off a  hundred-dollar-plus toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So, it does nothing obvious, but if you&#x27;re paranoid, you might want to get it just to believe you&#x27;re chasing down every tiny bacterium.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much space, it is CHEAP, and it will assure you that every time you put that brush head in your teeth it will be clean and not full of bacteria or other really nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> Then I found Phillips had designed a new narrow cantilever style sonic head for this handle!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of five is because if you use the plastic inserts to use this with heads other than the sonicare</li>
            <li> and it is never exactly the same</li>
            <li> Plus this is sold separately so those who already have a Sonic toothbrush or other brand don&#x27;t have to buy the double set with toothbrush and Sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li> This could be an issue if you regularly use other gadgets like shavers, hair dryers, curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not compare this device with any other device which can do the same function.</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t think about the other ten percent!)  </li>
            <li> My sister, whose brush-head was part of the initial cycle run, remarked a few days later that she wished she could have had the UV sanitizer when, while traveling, the brush head slipped out, fell to the ground, and was stepped on.</li>
            <li> I have been using the early version of the UV sanitizer (HX7990) for at least 5 years on the same UV bulb.</li>
            <li> So using UV light for 10 minutes is a preferable way of sanitizing stuff compared to those other questionable methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So using UV light for 10 minutes is a preferable way of sanitizing stuff compared to those other questionable methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use the same base but different heads on the brush and are able to keep both of them in this thing to decontaminate or whatever when we are done.  </li>
            <li> Issue me a full credit and pre-paid return slip for this useless piece of equipment that is just another way for people to think that they are staying well</li>
            <li> The battery always seems to die quickly, and unless you take the brush heads off and clean them after each brushing, they start to get nasty, and left over</li>
            <li> another victim on the Internet--his brush heads melted after one night of \\&quot;sanitizing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Returning</li>
            <li> It is hard to measure the relative value since there are not other products to compare against or a way to measure that the sanitizing has happened fully.</li>
            <li> Found that one out too late) and new brush heads.</li>
            <li> As I say, I&#x27;m sure that it works, but it is one of those things that seems virtually impossible to verify.  </li>
            <li> This product makes me feel that my tooth brush is much less likely to be contaminated.  </li>
            <li> Camp 1 is your typical internet biologist, trying to squeeze an extra dollar fifty out of their education.  </li>
            <li> It is extra clutter in the bathroom even with its small footprint, so I store mine in the vanity cabinet and plan to only use it weekly.</li>
            <li> The American Dental Association has an interesting article on this topic located here: [...]</li>
            <li> He is VERY hard to buy for but he really does like the sanitizer.[[ASIN:B000WYWALG Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer]]</li>
            <li> The bulb didn&#x27;t last 9 months (\\&quot;up to 5 years\\&quot;) and it took  another 5 months of back ordering and complicated phone calls to get a new bulb.  </li>
            <li> All you&#x27;ll need is a standard outlet and a small flat surface to set it</li>
            <li> All you&#x27;ll need is a standard outlet and a small flat surface to set it up.      </li>
            <li> it is a little bit of a pain to have to plug/unplug and then plug back in to use and</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way because I use peroxide toothpaste and it destroyed an early model Sonicare handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the \\&quot;officially supported\\&quot; toothbrush heads are a very limited set, check the model you have against the product description carefully.  </li>
            <li> The unit has a minimal size footprint and fits on my sink without being in the way.</li>
            <li> I have no real way of knowing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not designed to do that though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected to \\&quot;notice\\&quot; a difference after the cycle was ran.   </li>
            <li> Be careful...</li>
            <li> Not really up to the hype in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a biomedical scientist too and I agree with that reviewer partially; yet I still give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Spent $170 for it.  </li>
            <li> unit is lightweight and compact enough to pack on a trip for those who travel with their electric toothbrushes and who don&#x27;t like the idea of invisible germs lurking in their bristles, even for a few days.  </li>

            <li> I can only recommend this product to people who have compromised immune systems or are seriously germophobic and can only sleep at night with the peace of mind that a product like this gives.  </li>
            <li> It will induce many double strand breaks in the bacterial DNA, making it hard or impossible for them to grow.  </li>
            <li> The unit seems decently made and works just fine, I can&#x27;t think of any improvements that could be made other than a heavier base to keep it in place, and maybe a way to attach the charging base to make it one unit instead of two, but it works fine as it is.</li>
            <li> She did not like her brush being out at the sink with all the other things that go on at the sink.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, once set up it is a breeze to operate.</li>
            <li> Would tell other people to buy one for there house too.</li>
            <li> For other calmer people, maybe.  </li>
            <li> The unit is small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, which is a plus as you begin to accumulate numerous rechargeable products.      </li>
            <li> recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I&#x27;ve never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  </li>
            <li> No funny taste after usage.    </li>
            <li> This gets expensive, so for me this $49 system is ultimately a money saver, since I do have a Sonicare system (where brush heads are much more expensive than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothbrushes.)  </li>
            <li> The kit includes some pads so other brands of toothbrushes can work with this.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush takes one outlet and this takes the other.</li>
            <li> Probably not unless you fear e.coli or other viruses like that.  </li>
            <li> When it is closed the translucent window down the front shows that the bulb is on.</li>
            <li> and I certainly haven&#x27;t gotten sick or developed any mouth fungus, but</li>
            <li> The hardest thing about the Philips UV Sanitizer was getting the package to open as it was extremely difficult to cut through the clear plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> second quibble is that the manual is out of date; it refers to a UV bulb installation that is no longer necessary (it comes pre-installed), which momentarily confused me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the sanitizer comes with strict warnings about not touching the bulb, making it not appropriate for use in the bathrooms of young children, it does have the safety feature of shutting off if the door is opened during operation.</li>
            <li> Although human mount contains bacteria like the other reviewer said, it does not necessarily mean we can put all dirty stuff into our mount.</li>
            <li> Phillips giving us a hard time and will only replace the sanitizer unit...</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;detergent\\&quot; left behind on a brush head has little impact on re-contamination of a brush head left in</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> During this cycle it consumes an average of 5.2 watts of electricity and it can work  well in 120-220 volt</li>
            <li> If the head starts to glow in the dark, I&#x27;ll write a follow-up.</li>
            <li> Even though this unit is very compact, it&#x27;s weirdly clunky.</li>
            <li> and it stays lit when the (approximately) 10 minute cycle is complete.      </li>
            <li> The cleaning takes approximately 10 minutes and when complete it shuts itself off.</li>
            <li> When you use products like this and other germophobic products, you&#x27;re probably actually increasing your risk of having a serious infection.  </li>
            <li> It caused me to \\&quot;spill\\&quot; some down the handle with each use.</li>
            <li> little device is designed to work with Sonicare, and one other brush manufacturer&#x27;s brush heads.</li>
            <li> all of this mean it actually works at sanitizing?</li>
            <li> Does have little adapters for other brands of toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> ; other UV sanitizers for toothbrushes are as little as $20.    </li>
            <li> On the other, even the slightly germaphobic may recognize a waste of space.    </li>
            <li> On the one hand, it seems like a neat idea when you have a slightly germaphobic SO.</li>
            <li> Plus, once you remove the head from the peroxide it will be subject to airborn contamination thereafter because the peroxide will degrade as the head dries.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I will try to fit the little holders into the unit and get it close properly and start firing up, but inevitably I fail to snap the units in properly and grow frustrated and start mumbling incoherent epithets at the Philips company and put the thing away for another month or two.</li>
            <li> Lastly, please bear in mind that not all bacteria are bad and that you actually need some to help you digest food properly.  </li>
            <li> This is not true for cell-disruptive methods of destruction like bleach and detergent (including the detergent in your toothpaste).      </li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and I appreciate the fact that he package contained different base holders for various models of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> When I used a manual toothbrush, I would typically throw one away after having been ill and begin using a new one.  </li>
            <li> Ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, although I agree with ADA guidelines as well as the other reviewers comments,  I see this as an affordable, maintenance free device, not introducing any nasty chemicals  so that  it could be used for an additional peace of mind especially for my kids.ces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, although I agree with ADA guidelines as well as the other reviewers comments,  I see this as an affordable, maintenance free device, not introducing any nasty chemicals  so that  it could be used for an additional peace of mind especially for my kids.</li>
            <li> We had just replaced the kids a few weeks before and our less than a week.</li>
            <li> I energize it at least twice a day every single day.</li>
            <li> I have long been an advocate of throwing away your toothbrush after you get sick and starting with a clean one so that you don&#x27;t reintroduce germs to your body through the dirty brush-head.  </li>
            <li> This should really help during the cold and flu season that is coming up.</li>
            <li> Before I got the UV sanitizer I used to have numerous problems with cold sores in my mouth, I suspect from my brush heads sitting in the open in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I think it is sanitizing as I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I got this product as a gift a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> (How do you know what the bacteria it killed might have done?)  </li>
            <li> We are our own worst enemies when it comes to the spread of infection.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Sonicare toothbrush a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> We all know prices fluctuate a few cents to a few dollars on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A few days ago this item was $44</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for the few minutes it takes to run the cleaning cycle, why not feel healthier?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> My brush, while an Oral-B, does not fit.</li>
            <li> It also allows any water / mold, etc that may get trapped between the battery portion of the unit and the brush to dry-out each day (which was a concern voiced by some for this Sonicare brush).  </li>
            <li> However, I would like to point out a few things:    1,</li>
            <li> Presumably during that time period, 99% of the bacteria have been killed.  </li>
            <li> Due to the magnetic base on the brushheads, they quickly go right into place when putting them in the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I immediately sent for one and have used it a few times already in the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> By the same token, it doesn&#x27;t appear that these less expensive systems can handle the Oral B or Sonicare brush heads.    </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have a Sonicare system already, I&#x27;d simply use toothbrushes and perhaps invest in a less expensive UV sanitizer that can handle them.  </li>
            <li> This means that the interior needs to be cleaned at least once a week, if not more often, because of the saliva-and-water mix that drains from inside the brush and down its sides.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the germs usually on a toothbrush can extend the time of illness but when you sanitize your toothbrush every time you use it, you are not re-infecting yourself.  </li>
            <li> I have had several others, but this one is sturdier and never seems to fail.  </li>
            <li> Also having never used such a product to sanitize brush head for all these years it is difficult to assess the need for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure a lot of people were disgusted by that episode.</li>
            <li> , no more.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, without a lab test, it&#x27;s not possible to see if it \\&quot;worked\\&quot; or not.  </li>
            <li> item is packed in one of their fiendishly difficult to open plastic blisters</li>
            <li> Others have commented on the \\&quot;small</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is wider than my toothbrush set which has a small charger and the toothbrush sits in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all a mental game and if this product makes you feel better/</li>
            <li> So I am not sure what all the bulb life complaints are about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s small and requires dexterity that I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Do I have to toss it and purchase another at a larger cost than my \\&quot;old\\&quot; type of manual toothbrush every time I come down with a cold?  </li>
            <li> it IS NOT NEW!!!!!!</li>
            <li> However, this gizmo is completely unnecessary if you do not share your brushheads with other people.  </li>
            <li> I would be happy if Sonicare made a sanitizer for the base of your toothbrush head and the the connector joint on the base unit.</li>
            <li> are all waste of money due to the fact that their efficiencies are questionable and bacteria exist in mount as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only part i find annoying is that it tends to collect puddles at the base, although the plastic insert is easily removable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see with a magnifying glass, so I&#x27;ll take their word for it.    </li>
            <li> I am reminded of the episode of Mythbusters where they showed that toothbrushes pick up a lot of coliform bacteria (a common indicator of how sanitary something is).</li>
            <li> At least with a UV lamp we aren&#x27;t raising strains of antibacterial-resistant streptococcus.</li>
            <li> Fecal bacteria was commonly found on toothbrush handles and bristles.</li>
            <li> And since Sonicare replacement heads are so expensive, it&#x27;s probably not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The downsides are that it has a dull hum whenever it&#x27;s plugged in even if it&#x27;s not running and that it leaves the toothbrush smelling a little weird (like it was almost cooking it or</li>
            <li> increasing the chlorine in the water to a ridiculous level, closing pools and cleaning them...</li>
            <li> It acts by making DNA damage which makes it impossible for the single cell organism to survive and proliferate.</li>
            <li> It acts by making DNA damage which makes it impossible for the single cell organism to survive and proliferate.</li>
            <li> My real concern is about the dark nastiness that builds up inside the handle base, around the threads, and underneath the \\&quot;skirt\\&quot; at the base of the brush head.</li>
            <li> Those little cup stands that come with the sonicare used to collect gunky, disgusting drool and slime mixed with toothpaste and who knows what else.</li>
            <li> This device might make some people feel safer but the principle behind its operation is a bit suspect.</li>
            <li> This, however, was my poor assumption, not the fault of the product</li>
            <li> This product is in almost every way unnecessary--</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s giving me a false sense of security since I can&#x27;t tell whether it works or not, but ignorance can indeed be bliss.ut</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s giving me a false sense of security since I can&#x27;t tell whether it works or not, but ignorance can indeed be bliss.</li>
            <li> Given how expensive these are, not a good choice.</li>
            <li> , heat-sealed all the way around, that transform into cutting edges as the hapless consumer tries to retrieve their purchase.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on your bathroom counter, and doesn&#x27;t look unnecessarily space-age or weird to draw attention to it.</li>
            <li> big plus of the sanitizer is while I&#x27;ve always been told to throw out toothbrushes if you&#x27;ve been sick, throwing out the brushheads every time you get sick</li>
            <li> but then once that expired it became too expensive to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Even if you tried to fake it by putting, say, spaghetti sauce on the toothbrush and then sanitizing it, that still doesn&#x27;t prove anything.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible time finding it without buying the entire set of brushes, chargers, etc.  </li>
            <li> It doubled in price, I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So this item is useless to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot prove if the product does as it states</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly complicated to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is so specifically designed it can&#x27;t be used to sanitize anything else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, what I&#x27;ve found is that by using it, the bristles fray sooner.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time opening the case after each use.</li>
            <li> I get dirty looks/comments from my wife everytime she sees this thing on the bathroom counter as in her opinion if the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t smell/</li>
            <li> My kids take the brush, brush their teeth and then start playing with the brush leaving it in awkward places.</li>
            <li> Since using the sanitizer the incidence of these cold sores has gone almost to zero.</li>
            <li> Just after recovering from a bad cold, I started wondering what to do about my sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> could get very expensive.  </li>
            <li> the bad.</li>
            <li> What could be bad?</li>
            <li> but you have a lot of bad viruses and streptococus bacteria in the air as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> NEVER BEEN SICK SINCE.</li>
            <li> I have never, nor do I know anyone who has ever gotten sick or a bacterial infection from their toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get sick again.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about two years and have not gotten sick</li>
            <li> and now they want me to believe that I will get sick unless I buy their Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush just vibrates and I&#x27;m disappointed with how it works.</li>
            <li> I am completely disgusted and was duped by your company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often read the importance of changing our toothbrushes/toothbrush heads, in order to avoid contaminating ourselves with nasty bathroom germs.</li>
            <li> So I give it 3 stars for lack of utility / measurable results, and terrible packaging.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 5 years so far, still working good!!</li>
            <li> The ultraviolet light disinfection process used by this unit may make some people  think it&#x27;s the latest quack invention, but ultraviolet light is being used in hospitals for disinfection. With H1N1 and other viruses around, it is great to take 10 short minutes to disinfect our toothbrush heads. I love my husband, but don&#x27;t want to share his toothbrush grunge by storing our toothbrush heads  close together in a toothbrush holder! The unit has a minimal size footprint and fits on my sink without being in the way. This was an excellent health investment for very little money!</li>
            <li> I have had this for almost 2 years now.  It has not stopped working.  I think it is sanitizing as I use it everyday.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my older Sanitizer and first checked &#x27;Philips&#x27;s&#x27; web site and then went here and found that for a new item the price was a few dollars less so I went with Amazon and it all came in great contition and very fast.</li>
            <li> When I bought my first Phillips Sonicare electric toothbrush, I got the brush head that was hard to keep my lips closed around. It caused me to \\&quot;spill\\&quot; some down the handle with each use. Then I found Phillips had designed a new narrow cantilever style sonic head for this handle! My Dentist first recommended Sonicare with the remark that I needed \\&quot;a little assistance at my age\\&quot; (60) with cleaning my teeth. I am delighted with the performance and ease of use of this toothbrush and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This product makes me feel that my tooth brush is much less likely to be contaminated.  I use it every day to sanitize my brush head.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I had one of these before with another Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush that I had - so decided to give this one of try.  It is well worth the money I paid for it!!!  Is able to take different type of brush heads, which helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on June 26th and was billed immediately.  I was informed that it might take a couple of weeks.  I waited until the day that I was told by Amazon to wait on this supplier.  No product, no contact.  After several unanswered emails from the supplier and Amazon, I called American Express.  Thanks to them I received a full refund but no thanks to either the supplier nor Amazon.  I have ordered directly from Amazon many times with no problems.  However they, as well as, their supplier left me high and dry on this one.  Thank you American Express.  I won&#x27;t leave home without you.</li>
            <li> We have had the Phillips Sonicare UV Sanitizer for over 2 weeks.  We love it.  It provides a clean and safe place to store our two brush heads even if we haven&#x27;t UV&#x27;d them.  We try to clean twice a day.  Excellent product and a vary reasonable price.</li>
            <li> First off, the scientist&#x27;s review is great. All points are valid, and sure, according to other reviewers, this makes for a great place to store the Sonicare heads, but really the part of your Sonicare that seems to really need the MOST sanitation is the where the head and base connect. There&#x27;s an open space that gets grimy no matter how clean you try to be, and even with regular rinsing, grime accumulates in that little space. I would be happy if Sonicare made a sanitizer for the base of your toothbrush head and the the connector joint on the base unit. Now that, would make things more sanitary.</li>
            <li> The Item works and the blue light goes on.  Just How do I know if my brushes really are sanitized?  Is there a test I can do or a tester?</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product 100%. I bought it as a gift to my partner but both of us use it. I highly recommend Sonicare products, any of them. I assume it kills all of the germs, its not like I can see them before! Anyway, I love it. You will also.</li>
            <li> really enjoy the sanitizer - I can sanitize my toothbrush and my husbands at the same time!</li>
            <li> I got this product as a gift a few days ago.  I have a Sonicare toothbrush, which works really well, but with fairly spendy  brush heads that are designed to last 6 months and have some strong magnets in their base, I have been reluctant to put the head in the dishwasher.  The UV Sanitizer offers an alternative that will not harm the head and seems to be effective.  (How do you know what the bacteria it killed might have done?)  That said, I really wish this sanitizer could kill bacteria on regular (manual) toothbrushes too.  My grandkids visit us and they bring their own toothbrushes from home.   It would be really great to be able to pop theirs into the unit for cleaning too.    If your household happens to use one of the toothbrush brands that is supported by this sanitizer and especially if you find yourself passing colds from person to person, this may be a good product to try.</li>
            <li> Thsi product is easy to use and takes less than 15 min.  I feel that the life of my soicare brush will be prolonged and more sanitary, especially after a cold.</li>
            <li> I bought this not to kill the bacteria that might accrue from general toothbrushing in my mouth, but any bacteria that lingers in the bathroom in general. There is another review which goes into detail about digestive bacteria, etc. which is all very well and good (what? I can give up yogurt?) but I personally am not the only source of bacteria in my bathroom.    And if I linger on that, I might buy a new toothbrush head daily. Bleah.    It&#x27;s proven that this type of product does zap bacteria, that&#x27;s enough for me. Nice compact size, and it stores nicely too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Phillips Sonicare UV Sanitizer because I was concerned about how healthy my toothbrush heads were.  I like having this product. It fits nicely on my bathroom counter and is attractive.  I not only feel that my toothbrush heads are more germ free, but I also like it because I can store my heads in the sanitizer between using.  The sanitizer has a convenient tray that the brush heads fit into and if the tray gets dirty it takes just seconds to clean.  I would recommend this product to others.[[ASIN:B000V5Z4J6 Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer]]</li>
            <li> While some folks may think this product is frivolous and unnecessary, it is a real bonus in many situations.  I am recovering from a stem cell transplant for acute leukemia - my immune system is suppressed and immature.  Tools such as the Sonicare UV Sanitizer are a great addition to my arsenal in defense against rogue bacteria.  Humans have an incredible amount of germs present both internally and on our skin.  We are our own worst enemies when it comes to the spread of infection.  Ensuring that something we place inside our mouths is 99% sanitary just makes good common sense.  Not to mention that this was recommended by my dentist who has been in practice for over 30 years.  I can&#x27;t wait to begin using the product!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She did not like her brush being out at the sink with all the other things that go on at the sink. She is vey happy with this item and then I am too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well this unit works on other brands or the older philips heads, there are adapters but I don&#x27;t know how well they fit. The newer philips heads pop right in easily. The unit seems decently made and works just fine, I can&#x27;t think of any improvements that could be made other than a heavier base to keep it in place, and maybe a way to attach the charging base to make it one unit instead of two, but it works fine as it is. If you want a sanitizer and have the newer skirted philips head this is the one.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer.  I have used a Germ Terminator for several years but the sanitizer is much easier to use and takes up less space.  I feel that the germs usually on a toothbrush can extend the time of illness but when you sanitize your toothbrush every time you use it, you are not re-infecting yourself.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great! It works quickly and I feel better about using my sonicare toothbrush everyday knowing it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> This UV sanitizer is so easy to use and it was so inexpensive.  I have no way of proving that it does what it says but I feel better having and using it to keep my toothbrush germ free.  Its very easy yo use and to keep clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After an illness in the family our Dr. recommended replacing all toothbrushes. We had just replaced the kids a few weeks before and our less than a week. The Sonicare replacement heads are in no way cheap. We decided to replace all of the standard toothbrushes and buy a sanitizer for the kids bath and one for ours. I was shocked at the rate of reinfection to yourself from your own toothbrush. I don&#x27;t know why I never thought about it before.  I love that it is compact, simple to use and very cost effective. I love the magnetic hold. We just leave brushes stored in the sanitizer. It is reassuring to know every time I put my toothbrush in my mouth it is sanitized.</li>
            <li> If you own a Philips Sonicare toothbrush system, then this Sanitizer is a MUST have for you. It doesn&#x27;t take much space, it is CHEAP, and it will assure you that every time you put that brush head in your teeth it will be clean and not full of bacteria or other really nasty stuff. I have used it for around a year now, it has worked flawlessly every time. I use it after I brush before bed every night so that next morning the brush head is nice and clean again. It only takes a few minutes to do its magic, so that is a plus if you are in some kind of hurry. So far I have not had ANY issues with it, so I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and did not expect to use it daily as the box suggests.  It has been very easy to use with the E-series brushheads.  Due to the magnetic base on the brushheads, they quickly go right into place when putting them in the sanitizer.  It takes about 5-10 seconds to take brushheads of the brush and put them in the sanitizer or remove them from the sanitizer and put them on the brush so I have been using it daily.  It also only draws about 5 watts of power so it is not pricey to operate.</li>
            <li> Camp 1: They say, \\&quot;Hey, im a biologist at a VERY prestigious institution...\\&quot; yada yada yada.      Camp 2: They say, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t tell if it is cleaning, it doesn&#x27;t LOOK any cleaner!\\&quot;    Camp 1 is your typical internet biologist, trying to squeeze an extra dollar fifty out of their education.  Sure, everyone knows your mouth has bacteria, and that that bacteria is safe...it&#x27;s part of the natural flora.  The issue isn&#x27;t with people who live in a vacuum where only their mouth and mouth flora reside.  What about a kid who runs into your bathroom after having played outside where there are many types of non-normal flora (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli 0157:H7, etc.) and introduces this into your bathroom.  Or, what else is in a bathroom? Oh, yeah, a toilet.      Camp 2 is simply uninformed.  UV mutagenesis of bacteria will not clean your brush and make it sparkly clean.  This product isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;toothbrush carwash\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s a device to kill unwanted (again, let me stress the difference between unwanted and and natural flora bacteria) bacteria.    Now, does anyone REALLY need this product? Probably not.  People survived brushing their teeth just fine before we had UV cleaning systems for toothbrushes.  But personally, I think its a really cool gadget, and if you are a gadget fan like me, you probably enjoy it.  But don&#x27;t let the internet pseudoscientists scare you away.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. Even aside from the UV light part just keeping the heads in the case will help keep germs off of it.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of five is because if you use the plastic inserts to use this with heads other than the sonicare it is a bit of a pain.  The directions for putting them in aren&#x27;t very clear. Once you get everything set-up it works great though.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things where you don&#x27;t really get to witness the value of your money.  You just have to trust that it works, since its work is not visible.    But the product is built with quality.  It feels solid and looks cool in the bathroom.  I like it.    I waited to post my review until I got the rebate, too.  It just came in yesterday.  Ended up getting this for [...] when it was all said and done.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have to give this 3 stars...not that I don&#x27;t like it and it wasn&#x27;t operational when I got it, it&#x27;s just that 1) it is a little bit of a pain to have to plug/unplug and then plug back in to use and 2) not sure if it really does what it says--who does know, but I do feel good using it     I have periodontal disease and anything I can do to help is good for me. I have always wanted one and got this one at a really good deal     so it helps me feel good when I use it and that is a plus in my book. My next dentist visit is next month and will see if it has helped any.     Overall, am happy with the product...hence the 1/2 and 1/2</li>
            <li> I purchased this sanitizer as i am a bit of a germaphobe however; I am not sure that hot water wouldnt accomplish the same thing. I guess we cant be too safe.</li>
            <li> I feel that my toothbrush is very clean and it seems to stiffen the brushes on the ones about to be used the limited amount of time - 3 months. Debated buying this product but I am glad that I did make the purchase.</li>
            <li> If you have a Sonicare, you shouldn&#x27;t be without this item. It not only sanitizes your brush heads, it keeps them clean and dust free to boot. Holds two e-Series heads if you couldn&#x27;t tell from the images. The bottom of each brush holder is magnetic and securely grabs and nudges the brush head into place very quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an LED indicator on the top that shows if the UV cycle has been run since the last time it was opened. The UV cycle runs for 10 mins and shuts off automatically. This is a must-have if you share your Sonicare power handle with others in your household as I do with my fianc&amp;eacute;e as it really prevents the build-up and funky smell you would get if you didn&#x27;t remove your brush heads regularly like others I know, yech!</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is very easy to set up and operate.  I really like the magets that \\&quot;snap\\&quot; the brush head into position and hold it in place.  Having 2 slots for brusheads lets me rotate the brushes - one for the morning and another for night.  I could never find one of these in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found one through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month now, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. The process last for 10 mins and your done.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is simple to use and I assume it does a good job of killing germs on our toothbrushes. It was difficult to find in our local stores but very easy to find and order, on line.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrush for ~10 years.  Before that it had been Oral B battery operated toothbrush.  I switched to Sonicare toothbrush a few weeks ago.  So far I like it better than the old battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Those little cup stands that come with the sonicare used to collect gunky, disgusting drool and slime mixed with toothpaste and who knows what else. This item is easy to keep clean, and disinfects the brush heads while they are stored out of sight. A perfect accessory for the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent service. The first shipment had a dead battery. The company, Philips, not only sent a replacement but refunded the price of the product. The sanitizer is a beauty, convenient and effective.[[ASIN:B000V5Z4J6 Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer]]</li>
            <li> It looks nice in the bathroom and works great on our oral b electric toothbrush.  We use the same base but different heads on the brush and are able to keep both of them in this thing to decontaminate or whatever when we are done.  I haven&#x27;t really read into how effective it is but at the least the brush heads are in an enclosed compartment while all sorts of germs are flying around the bathroom.  I recommend this bathroom toothbrush accessory.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in great condition and with instructions. Works great. Sanitizes toothbrush within 5 to 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> I use soap and water to clean the bristles in the past but it always made the brissels too soft and had to be replaced too soon.  After I used this unit I could tell a difference of how the brissels felt and they felt clean. The price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to spell brissels.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sanitizer because the one that came with the brushes broke, twice.  I had it replaced under warranty but then once that expired it became too expensive to replace it.  Also, to replace the bulb only through the original vendor was more expensive than to buy this particular item.  I bought this back in 2009 and have not had any problems since.  The bulb still works great too. It also easily comes apart for cleaning.  The only thing I wish it was, was for it to be less bulky and a bit more like the original one that came with the brushes that was attached to the charger.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy way to sanitize toothbrush heads.  Adapter for either style of heads.  Liked ours so much I bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I like and have numerous gadgets that probably aren&#x27;t really needed, but to me make life easier and more fun. My friends actually tease me about it, so no one was surprised that I now have this sanitzer.I love my Sonicare Elite 9650 Power Toothbrush which I use 2-3 times daily and I have an Oral B which is saved as a back up. This sanitizer accepts both of my toothbrush heads. I agree w/ others that for this price, it should accept more brands and styles. Based on the info for my pricey air purifier w/ a UV light, I&#x27;m inclined to think this item works as advertised. Also humans have the least clean mouths likely caused by less helpful chemicals in our saliva unlike a dog or a cat, so that was one of my reasons to use it. As other reviewers noted, once set up it is a breeze to operate. It is extra clutter in the bathroom even with its small footprint, so I store mine in the vanity cabinet and plan to only use it weekly. I caution anyone w/ young kids not to let them use it, as if opened during operation, the light can potentially damage their eyes. Upon sending in the product registration, you will receive $29.99 in coupons for future Sonicare purchases. I probably will not get another when this one dies unless the price greatly decreases, but for now I like using it.</li>
            <li> I am more of an old fashion type toothbrush user but this product should appeal to those who like to take care of their teeth. It is portable and actually easy to use. The only thing you may not like is the price. It could be bit lower. But overall a great product for a gift or you own personal use, especially with mouth and teeh care.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s think about this product for a minute.  You have a toothbrush which supposedly uses sonic waves to clean the teeth.  (I have to believe \\&quot;truth in advertising\\&quot; laws are at work here, because my Sonicare doesn&#x27;t produce results that are any better than any battery-operated toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.)  Then you get this item which is designed to sanitize said toothbrush.    How can you really tell if this thing \\&quot;sanitizes\\&quot; your toothbrush head?  Even if you tried to fake it by putting, say, spaghetti sauce on the toothbrush and then sanitizing it, that still doesn&#x27;t prove anything.  It hums and then you take your brush head out.  But what are the benefits of sanitizing the brush head?  Again, I notice no difference in my mouth from how things were before I had this, compared to after using this.  So, it does nothing obvious, but if you&#x27;re paranoid, you might want to get it just to believe you&#x27;re chasing down every tiny bacterium.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is exceptionally good.  I have had several others, but this one is sturdier and never seems to fail.  The only problem I have is removing the light cover to clean it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000V5Z4J6 Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer]]     I like this alot. Would tell other people to buy one for there house too.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer keeps 2 brush heads, in my case Oral-B Floss-Action, in a brush head case that uses UV light to sanitize the brush heads for about 10 minutes and then shuts off. Simple as that! For peace of mind, get it!</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer is easy to use. It is hard to measure the relative value since there are not other products to compare against or a way to measure that the sanitizing has happened fully. Also having never used such a product to sanitize brush head for all these years it is difficult to assess the need for this. Bottom line: Easy to use, nice in appearance, and perhaps a bit pricey for its function.</li>
            <li> nice looking, and sanitizing is quick.  the only part i find annoying is that it tends to collect puddles at the base, although the plastic insert is easily removable so it&#x27;s easy to clean. would recommend!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and designed specifically for my particular brand of electric toothbrush. Sanitizes by UV irradiation over a 10-minute period and shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> I like it that it sanitizes the toothbrush part.  The toothbrush just vibrates and I&#x27;m disappointed with how it works.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product, but it appears to do the job fine so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on May 15th and received it on May 23rd.  It&#x27;s new in the original packaging, all intact and it works.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the most inexpensive unit I found.I was hesitant to spend a lot of money as,lets face it,who knows if it works or not.I have no real way of knowing.Just thinking about all the recent news about fecal matter etc getting on the toothbrush was enough to make you want to use disposable brushes.  It makes me feel better to use it and I may be deluding myself but at the cost it is an affordable delusion.  I also rinse my tooth brush in a solution of clorox and water as well as using the unit.It is a brand that has a very good reputation and I really feel it does what it is supposed to do,it does not take up much room and is easily stored when the cleaning process is complete.</li>
            <li> I am reminded of the episode of Mythbusters where they showed that toothbrushes pick up a lot of coliform bacteria (a common indicator of how sanitary something is). I&#x27;m sure a lot of people were disgusted by that episode. When you think about it, how many people do you know personally who have contracted E. Coli from their own toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little device is designed to work with Sonicare, and one other brush manufacturer&#x27;s brush heads. The idea is that you close-up the brush in the cabinet and turn on the UV light which kills the germs on the brush in about 10 minutes. Now your brush-head is sanitary, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to jury rig the thing to take the brush heads from my Ultreo and my wife&#x27;s Oral B brush. It&#x27;s really not designed to do that though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this, you will not notice a difference in the way your brush tastes or performs (unless you&#x27;ve also been using it to clean out your belly-button lint or something). So, how do you know it&#x27;s working? Well, without a laboratory - you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t honestly say that normal folks need or benefit from something like this, unless you want an iPod looking place to keep your brush heads when not in use. I guess if you had an immune system disorder or disease then this could be a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think people are way too germophobic today. How much anti-bacterial stuff is out there anyway? At least with a UV lamp we aren&#x27;t raising strains of antibacterial-resistant streptococcus. A better idea is to replace your brushes regularly.</li>
            <li> This is a very nicely designed product that accepted the heads of my Sonicare toothbrushed without trouble and operated without a hitch.  You simply put the toothbrush head(s) in and push a button on the top.  An LED  flashes on the top of the unit and you see through some translucent plastic that UV light is activated inside.  The unit turns off after about 10 minutes and you take the brushes out.  You can, if necssary, easily clean the inside of the unit by pulling out and washing a tray that collects any runoff water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this worth having?  I don&#x27;t really know.  There probably is a clinical answer to this to tell us whether killing off 99 percent of bacteria this way is good for us (i.e., reduces colds, reinfections) and whether we would be better to just soak our brushes or perhaps live with the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming you do think it is good to have this sort of treatment for your brushes, the unit seems like a nice thing to have.  It is well-designed, easy to operate, and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> I have to say that until I saw this product in the newsletter that it never occurred to me that I would actually need something like this.  While it is packaged very attractively....and the product itself is also...I&#x27;m inclined to agree with many of the other reviewers, in questioning whether this is something that I would actually spend money on.  While it certainly works as indicated, and seems very efficient, the truth of the matter is that there is really no way to verify efficacy.  So...while the product looks cool sitting on the vanity, I&#x27;m not certain it is something that we all need to have.      DYB</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. SANITIZED BRUSH HEADS PERFECTLY. NEVER BEEN SICK SINCE.</li>
            <li> After one month took off the protective screen for cleaning.  Now it doesn&#x27;t sanitize - just get a blinking light.  The Philips website says the bulb needs to be replaced.  Also says the bulb should last five years.  Yeah, right.  Thank you very much, Philips!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It&#x27;s small, compact, don&#x27;t take much room on the counter and sanitizes the toothbrush.  This should really help during the cold and flu season that is coming up.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and the product description I was convinced that this was something I needed to have, but now that I have it I&#x27;m not even sure how to tell that it&#x27;s working. I know that my Essence toothbrushes fit in perfectly and that when I push the button the little light goes on, but once you remove the toothbrushes they don&#x27;t smell or look any cleaner, so how can you be sure? I want to think that it&#x27;s working and I certainly haven&#x27;t gotten sick or developed any mouth fungus, but I get dirty looks/comments from my wife everytime she sees this thing on the bathroom counter as in her opinion if the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t smell/look any better then it&#x27;s not any cleaner. The Essence toothbrush heads tend to build up a lot of gunk because of the way they screw on so rather than buying this fancy sanitizer you&#x27;d be better off just buying a better made toothbrush.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000V5Z4J6 Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer]] I found the product easy to use, the packaging while it afforded sanitary delivery of the product was moderately easy to open.  I use this product daily and feel confident that my toothbrush is free of the bacteria a bathroom use creates. I am happy with my purchase.  The instructions were clear and I appreciate the fact that he package contained different base holders for various models of toothbrushes.  While I have a Sonicare e 7000 and do not need a holder for the sanitizer, I know that I am not limited to sanitizing  only that one model of toothbrush, he E 7000.</li>
            <li> The unit is large and it came assembled, but had detailed instructions for an unassembeled unit.  All we had to do was plug it in and see how it worked.  And it does take some faith that it is working.  For germaphobes, this is a must.  For other calmer people, maybe.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference and it does have a large footprint for the counter.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Sonicare UV Sanitizer several months ago for myself and my husband.  For my son&#x27;s birthday, I decided this would be a good gift for him.  I had a terrible time finding it without buying the entire set of brushes, chargers, etc.  ALL I wanted was the sanitizer. I was very pleased to find it at Amazon and he just loves it. I also sent him several replacement brush heads because he replaces them even more often than recommended and that becomes expensive for him. I didn&#x27;t send him toothpaste because I was sure he only used one brand and I found out later that I was right.  He is VERY hard to buy for but he really does like the sanitizer.[[ASIN:B000WYWALG Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer]]</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush and absolutely love it.  I feel like my teeth are so much cleaner; and I love the 30 second quadrant     timer</li>
            <li> The Sonicare UV Sanitizer was easy to use right out of the box, with no assembly required. All you have to do is plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to be used.  The unit is small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, which is a plus as you begin to accumulate numerous rechargeable products.      The sanitizing is done by UV light, so there are no cleaning solutions to buy; once you&#x27;ve bought the Sanitizer, you&#x27;re done.  There&#x27;s a light that flashes while it&#x27;s working and it stays lit when the (approximately) 10 minute cycle is complete.      The one caveat is that you need to make sure this fits your brand/model of toothbrush, as you won&#x27;t be able to use it otherwise.      When I used a manual toothbrush, I would typically throw one away after having been ill and begin using a new one.  I realize there may be no scientific or biological advantage to doing this, but it always made sense to me.  It&#x27;s a little expensive to do that with cost of ultrasonic toothbrush replacement heads, so this is a nice alternative.     While there is no tangible proof the UV light has actually sanitized the toothbrush head, we&#x27;ll have to take it on faith that it has - and it&#x27;s been made quick, easy and relatively inexpensive, so why not?  Like the flu shot, just one more line of defense in the war against germs and illness!</li>
            <li> This device might make some people feel safer but the principle behind its operation is a bit suspect. For starters, killing 90% of the bacteria isn&#x27;t that meaningful if the remaining 10% can grow rapidly.  While there could be some benefit, hot water is probably close in effect and free. Finally, as another reviewer mentioned, the packaging on this is a real pain to open.</li>
            <li> The hardest thing about the Philips UV Sanitizer was getting the package to open as it was extremely difficult to cut through the clear plastic packaging. After that it was a breeze, place the brush heads inside the stainless steel lined chamber - the bristles should face the UV bulb - and plug it in and turn it on. The UV bulb comes on and the sanitizer does the rest. In about ten minutes, your brush heads are germ free. The bulb will only turn on when the unit is closed as a safety measure. When it is closed the translucent window down the front shows that the bulb is on. It&#x27;s not possible to \\&quot;see\\&quot; any results, but it&#x27;s the clinical way of sanitizing any equipment. You use this sanitizer with Philips Sonicare Elite or Pro or some Oral B brush heads with an adaptor. So the product is designed well and works as advertised which is the reason for the 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re thinking whether buying the sanitizer is worth it, here&#x27;s my take. The Philips website talks about the fact that studies have shown that there are more than one hundred million microorganisms can be found on the brush heads of even healthy individuals. The website also says that bacteria thrive in moist environments and live up to 48 hours even on dry brush heads. When I put my brush head into this sanitizer the UV radiation does the work to kill 99% of the bacteria, however my brush head remains moist till I take it out for next time since it&#x27;s inside the chamber and does not get a chance to dry off completely. That is probably not a very good thing as per Philips own website which asserts the bacteria thrive in moist environments. So will the sanitizer improve my oral health? I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the sanitizer takes quite a bit of space than simply having just a toothbrush in its charger on the sink. Plus there is one more electric cord in addition to your toothbrush charger cord plugged into the outlet which clutters up the bathroom. If you ask me, If I hadn&#x27;t received this product as a promotion I would not buy it.duct as a promotion I would not buy it.</li>
            <li> You know how annoying it is to keep in mind that every 30-45 days you must throw away your old toothbrush and then find the same kind with the same either soft or medium head and it is never exactly the same and you have to get used to it again and then whole cycle repeats itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, no more. I have an automatic toothbrush and all I do now is put its head in this neat sanitizer and it kills all the bacteria and I can go on for another 20-30 days without having to worry about repeating this process. The product has UV bulb, which is what actually kills the bacteria. There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models). I didn&#x27;t have troubles putting the holder into the Sanitizer. The cleaning takes approximately 10 minutes and when complete it shuts itself off. It was prebuilt with a drip tray to get rid of excess water. This is a great gift for anyone in your family. Folks, it doesn&#x27;t get any easier or more practical than this.</li>
            <li> I love this sanitizer. It is small, easy to use, and fits conveniently on my sink. I use it every day to keep my brush heads free from bacteria. I have become a germ-a-phobe in recent years and specifically sought out a sanitizer specially designed for my Sonicare toothbrush. UV light does a great job of killing microbes.</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare toothbrush.  The cost of the replacement brush-heads was actually quite reasonable, considering you only had to do it every six months, and we found it did an outstanding job for our family. (I loved that the &#x27;beep&#x27; after each quadrant helped my kids to keep brushing longer and do a better job!)    I have long been an advocate of throwing away your toothbrush after you get sick and starting with a clean one so that you don&#x27;t reintroduce germs to your body through the dirty brush-head.  Using the Sonicare we couldn&#x27;t do that without having to replace the brush-head early and incurring the cost. Enter the UV Sanitizer-- problem solved.  Now we clean our brush-heads on a weekly basis and I don&#x27;t ever worry that we are recycling germs from the brush-head.    A side note: we had a problem with a bacteria in swimming pools last summer and they tried everyting to get the water clean-- increasing the chlorine in the water to a ridiculous level, closing pools and cleaning them... all to no avail.  After researching the problem they have announced that this summer they have a much better plan for keeping the public pools safe for all-- they&#x27;re going to use UV rays to kill all the bacteria. That just confirmed to me again that this is a really smart investment for a family that wants to keep their teeth clean and healthy without having to buy new Sonicare brush-heads every time someone gets sick.  Thanks, Phillips!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted way longer than I thought. Four (?) years now. Use every day. Highly recommend. Will buy another someday.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000V5Z4J6 Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer]]  There&#x27;s gotta be an easier way than purchasing yet another gizmo for your already lengthy night time rituals.  I&#x27;d been hanging my toothbrush on a shelf in my medicine cabinet, when one day, I noticed mold growing under the toothbrush (yuck).  I decided to regularly use 3 toothbrushes and use each one only once.  Then I put them in a basket in my dish washer.  Another thing I started doing was to leave my medicine cabinet ajar, since a closed cabinet means trapping a moist toothbrush in a possibly warm place, thus allowing mold to grow.  When I saw this product, I started to purchase it.  Some of the other negative reviews helped me realize that I&#x27;m probably keeping my toothbrushes and my mouth adequately clean.</li>
            <li> We all know prices fluctuate a few cents to a few dollars on Amazon. They usually increase by dollars and decrease by cents, funny how that works. A few days ago this item was $44 then the next day it jumped up to $65 then the next day $89. It doubled in price, I&#x27;m sorry but I&#x27;m calling B.S on that one. You can get these on EBay for $45, what it should be. You don&#x27;t see Walmart changing their prices everyday, but when they do they drop the price to give you a better deal, not rob you like what just went on with this item.</li>
            <li> It takes two Sonicare brush heads at a time, and has adaptors to allow you to load Oral b brush heads too.  It&#x27;s dead easy to use - close up the sanitiser, press a button and then the brush heads are flooded by bright light for the duration of the clean - about 5 minutes.  The UV light serves to kill all germs - apparently...  As I say, I&#x27;m sure that it works, but it is one of those things that seems virtually impossible to verify.  I never poisoned myself before I had this, and I&#x27;ve still not poisoned myself.  So it must work I guess??</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, easy to clean.  Nice peace of mind, knowing your brush head is clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered an electronic toothbrush and instead received the latest gimmick promoted to American corporate consumerism!  Last night I opened the package and found some ridiculous piece of UV nonsense that people buy thinking they are getting something special.  I demand a full refund and to be sold what I purchased!!!!!  Issue me a full credit and pre-paid return slip for this useless piece of equipment that is just another way for people to think that they are staying well will when ordinary peroxide soaks of their brushes three times a week is adequate.  I am completely disgusted and was duped by your company!</li>
            <li> I love my Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer. I received it very quickly.  It sanitizes all of my Sonicare brush heads.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often read the importance of changing our toothbrushes/toothbrush heads, in order to avoid contaminating ourselves with nasty bathroom germs. I&#x27;ve also read that we can re-infect ourselves with cold/flu germs if we don&#x27;t replace brush heads when we&#x27;re ill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it true? Who knows? Whether it&#x27;s true or not, I really liked the way this little item performed, and I FELT as though I&#x27;d done something healthy for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate the item 5 stars on each of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Packaging (Nice presentation in the box. Great for gift-giving.)&lt;br /&gt;2)  Ease of assembly  (Clear, easy to follow instructions. Parts that snap easily into place.)&lt;br /&gt;3)  Space saving (It&#x27;s a nice small unit, doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the bathroom counter.)&lt;br /&gt;4)  Ease of use (Plug it in, press the power button; green light flashes. When sanitation is done, light glows solid green and the unit shuts off automatically.)&lt;br /&gt;5)  Effectiveness (I saw a difference in the brush color head after the first use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does all of this mean it actually works at sanitizing? Again, who knows! But that blue, glowing UV light sure seems as though it&#x27;ll sterilize!&lt;br /&gt;So, for the few minutes it takes to run the cleaning cycle, why not feel healthier?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> We live in a world of ever more consumer gadgets - many of us have drawers or closets full of forsaken or useless ones.  This is another item in that vein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy enough to use this sterilizer: rinse your toothbrush head, put it in the unit, press the button, take it out ten minutes later.  Unfortunately, without a lab test, it&#x27;s not possible to see if it \\&quot;worked\\&quot; or not.  And thus I doubt most people, most of whom didn&#x27;t get sick from their toothbrush normally, will bother with these extra steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is packed in one of their fiendishly difficult to open plastic blisters, heat-sealed all the way around, that transform into cutting edges as the hapless consumer tries to retrieve their purchase.  I&#x27;m dexterous and in good shape, and it was a pain for me (and I managed to get a minor cut out of it); I pity the arthritic or elderly who try to open this package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second quibble is that the manual is out of date; it refers to a UV bulb installation that is no longer necessary (it comes pre-installed), which momentarily confused me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the \\&quot;officially supported\\&quot; toothbrush heads are a very limited set, check the model you have against the product description carefully.  While you can fit other toothbrush heads into the sanitizer (I tried with one of mine and did so without problem), your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see this item being useful for the germ-phobic, or those who get sick easily, or for households with multiple toothbrushes of the same model (and a high risk of the ick-factor of grabbing somebody else&#x27;s toothbrush head by accident), places where it will make somebody \\&quot;feel better\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I suspect for most people this will just end up as a gadget that gets stuck in a closet or cabinet and never used again.  So I give it 3 stars for lack of utility / measurable results, and terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. Of course, I&#x27;m not a biologist, so I really can&#x27;t reasonably comment on whether or not UV light is modifying strands of DNA like some of the previous reviewers.    However, I do have two children that seem to be very suceptible to sniffles, colds, and the ilk. Do I think that every Tom, Dick, and Harry needs to run out and buy one of these. No. However, if you have people in your family that are prone to illness, or who take antibiotics with some regularity, this might be a cost effective way to sanitize without having to throw out your toothbrushes as frequently.     The American Dental Association has an interesting article on this topic located here: [...]</li>
            <li> I would have to say that this is probably a good niche product and nice gift for someone who already owns a compatible toothbrush.  It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, for $50 plus S&amp;H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I&#x27;ve never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the \\&quot;biologist\\&quot; stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a simple to use product that probably does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;But I think I&#x27;ll give mine to family member who also uses Sonicare brushes and may appreciate more the gadget geekiness of the UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try. It was a little more cheaply constructed than I had expected from a Sonicare product, but seems acceptable. Then I tried to load my brush head into it. I had mistakenly believed the part of the description that said it supports most major brand brush heads. I thought the list of models were examples not the only ones that will work. Sadly, I was wrong. My brush, while an Oral-B, does not fit. This, however, was my poor assumption, not the fault of the product so I have not taken anything off the score for this. I just felt it was important to point out in the hopes I might save someone else from making the same mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I was still able to try this out since my sister owns a Sonicare toothbrush so I took it to her house to play with it. Everything functioned as it should and she reported that the toothbrush did feel clean (softer bristles free of residue). Therefore I must conclude that for those with the correct brush, this is a useful product. I deducted one star for the flimsy plastic, as I&#x27;m worried that for the price it won&#x27;t hold up long.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer, I thought  it was an unnecessary device, meant to profit even further off a  hundred-dollar-plus toothbrush. My first thought when I received the  box was, \\&quot;Hmm, bigger than I thought.\\&quot; I read the directions first,  which seemed to require an unusual number of steps to set up and  install the UV bulb. I only noticed later in fine print, \\&quot;May come  with bulb pre-installed.\\&quot; Indeed, that was the case. So I just had to  plug it in.     The outer case presents a pleasing blue glow when operating, and indeed it is easy to operate--just push one button, come back 10 minutes later, done! However, it seems focused on cleaning just the brush head. My real concern is about the dark nastiness that builds up inside the handle base, around the threads, and underneath the \\&quot;skirt\\&quot; at the base of the brush head. What are you doing about that, Philips?!     Does have little adapters for other brands of toothbrush heads. I thought it wasn&#x27;t worth the counter space, and considering that a dip into rubbing alcohol would kill everything, too, I left it with my mom at home. She, too, was hoping it would kill the innards. My sister, whose brush-head was part of the initial cycle run, remarked a few days later that she wished she could have had the UV sanitizer when, while traveling, the brush head slipped out, fell to the ground, and was stepped on. Ew.     Anyway, if you&#x27;re seriously OCD, maybe it&#x27;s useful. But considering all the other sources of germs that you put into your mouth, your toothbrush shouldn&#x27;t be a significant concern (again, just soak it in rubbing alcohol). Not worth it. Floss, brush, use Listerine.</li>
            <li> This unit is very simple to set up and use. The UV bulb was already installed in my unit. Just place your brush head inside, close the door, and press the button on the top for the sanitizing cycle. This takes about 10 minutes for the peace of mind that your brush heads are clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the unit is easy because there is a removable drip tray. You wipe the protective screen over the bulb and wash out the drip tray, wipe the inside of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice to have an enclosed place to store the brush heads in while not in use.</li>
            <li> Having read that much tooth decay is related to bacteria, it seemed sensible that Philips Sonicare would offer a devise to kill bacteria on tooth brushes.  I decided to try this product when I saw that it was compatible with Oral B FlexiSoft and FlossAction products.  Why?  Because I have an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  I couldn&#x27;t remember what kind of Oral B I had . . . but how different could they be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived, the first challenge was opening the plastic around the sterilizer.  After several attempts, I finally found a tool that would get through the armor-like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I looked for a description of the benefits of sanitizing.  I didn&#x27;t find any.  Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to give the product a whirl.  Naturally, my rechargeable Oral B toothbrush didn&#x27;t fit.  So this item is useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let that happen to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what benefits I would have gotten if the sterilizer had worked with my toothbrush, but I must admit that I haven&#x27;t had a new cavity in 46 years.  So I suspect that my bacteria may not be too big of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wasn&#x27;t really able to use the product, I&#x27;ve rated it as a 3 to indicate that I&#x27;m neutral.  No opinion would have been a better choice, but Amazon.com doesn&#x27;t offer that alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep brushing!</li>
            <li> I picked up this product on clearance at a local retail giant store as I was getting ready to go out of town.    First impression:    The idea of sanitizing your toothbrush is a fascinating ideal.     The product design is sleek and fits nicely into the bathroom without being extremely big and industrial looking.    It also features a cord wrap for storage if you choose to not use it for a period of time.    It was a handy way to carry our brush heads when we traveled recently.    Usage:  Have strong scissors on hand to open the plastic sealed packaging the unit is housed in!    Instructions are precise and clear.   I have a Sonic Elite brush heads so I did not to use the extra including attachments to hold the.   Close door, plug in unit and the sanitation cycle begins.   Ten minutes later, cycle is completed.   Remove brush heads and use as normal.   No funny taste after usage.    Overall impression:    I read the manual and inserts fully but did not find scientific information of the claims of sanitation.   I expected to \\&quot;notice\\&quot; a difference after the cycle was ran.   No difference.  Unfortunately I cannot prove if the product does as it states and I have a problem with not knowing if something truly works or not.   In the end this product does not make much \\&quot;dollar and sense\\&quot; without some type of proof in the claim.   If you happen to find it within the $10.00 range (which is the price of the carrying case Sonic makes) it is a nice carrying case for the brush heads.</li>
            <li> This item is a great addition to keep the Sonicare heads hygienic. It&#x27;s a good deal on a must have product.</li>
            <li> First, the good. It&#x27;s not overly complicated to use. Simply put your brush head inside, close it, and hit the button on top. After about 10 minutes, your brush head is sanitized. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on your bathroom counter, and doesn&#x27;t look unnecessarily space-age or weird to draw attention to it. It basically sits in the background and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad. While product pictures--even those on the box itself--show the brush heads inside, there are none included with the product. However, there are several adapters included which allow it to fit various newer Sonicare toothbrushes. Those using standard brushes or even competing brands will not find something they can use here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it if you have the right brushes. If not, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the toothbrushes needed to make this work.</li>
            <li> Just after recovering from a bad cold, I started wondering what to do about my sonicare toothbrush.  Do I have to toss it and purchase another at a larger cost than my \\&quot;old\\&quot; type of manual toothbrush every time I come down with a cold?  This could cost a lot of money.  I already purchase a new toothbrush every six months and now that time could increase to every few weeks with winter coming on.  Then on my computer, I saw the new Sonicare UV Sanitizer.  I immediately sent for one and have used it a few times already in the past few weeks.  It was easy to set up and operate.  It stands on my counter for easy use and has given me a new comfort level about my health and hygiene.  It takes seconds to use and will save me money and give me ease of mind.  Thanks for sending it my way just in time.  It was so easy to order online and I will continue to order future products from Amazon that make my life easier.    Mary in N.B.</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare Elite system, which works well with the product, as it&#x27;s designed to do.  Others have commented on the \\&quot;small footprint\\&quot; of this product and it&#x27;s fairly unobtrusive presence on the average bathroom counter.  I agree with those comments completely, so rather than repeat them I&#x27;d like to list what I see as my specific pros and cons of this UV Sanitizer.    PROS:    1) Assuming that its 99% efficacy in killing bacteria is true (no way for the average user to test this!), it&#x27;s pretty hard to see how one could screw up the sanitizing process.  Very easy to use.    2) Works well with the systems listed above (on the main product listing.)    3) Fits two brush heads at once.    CONS:    1) Possibly a bit pricy; other UV sanitizers for toothbrushes are as little as $20.    2) The aformentioned UV sanitizers can handle a full \\&quot;normal\\&quot; brush, so if you don&#x27;t have the relevant Sonicare or Oral B systems, they&#x27;d definitely be a better deal.  By the same token, it doesn&#x27;t appear that these less expensive systems can handle the Oral B or Sonicare brush heads.    What it comes down to is largely a matter of what system you already have.  I get colds frequently and sore throats too, and I&#x27;m pretty strict about changing toothbrush heads after either.  This gets expensive, so for me this $49 system is ultimately a money saver, since I do have a Sonicare system (where brush heads are much more expensive than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothbrushes.)  If I didn&#x27;t have a Sonicare system already, I&#x27;d simply use toothbrushes and perhaps invest in a less expensive UV sanitizer that can handle them.  I like this new line of UV sanitizing products; this is a great product for those with the appropriate systems, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy into the Sonicare system on this basis alone.</li>
            <li> First, this is easy to set up once you survive the hardest part... getting the thing out of its people-proof clamshell. Be careful... it&#x27;s easy to hurt yourself opening these things -- but this is a problem for a lot of products not just the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visit my dentist regularly and change my toothbrush every six months. The dentist has never once expressed concerns about bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I set this up, I looked at the getting started directions and it begins with removing the cover on the bulb and inserting it. Well, the bulb is already in there, so this could confuse people. It should have directions for changing the bulb, but not at the start of the booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, any Sonicare toothbrush fits right in the sanitizer case. The kit includes some pads so other brands of toothbrushes can work with this. Unpack, plug in, put toothbrush in with brush facing middle, close door, and push button. That&#x27;s all it takes -- so this earns points for simplicity. Plus this is sold separately so those who already have a Sonic toothbrush or other brand don&#x27;t have to buy the double set with toothbrush and Sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, is it effective at getting rid of bacteria. I&#x27;m not a scientist, so I can&#x27;t be sure. But as one person pointed out, we&#x27;ve lived without a Sanitizer for years and have gotten along fine without it. However, I&#x27;m a freak about germs (not OCD, though) and there&#x27;s something comforting knowing my toothbrush gets a dose of UVA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wider than my toothbrush set which has a small charger and the toothbrush sits in it. Plus, this takes up another plug in the outlet. The toothbrush takes one outlet and this takes the other. This could be an issue if you regularly use other gadgets like shavers, hair dryers, curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did research on keeping toothbrushes clean. The results led me to products... not articles or studies. I did find one article at WikiHow that says getting your toothbrush clean just takes toothpaste (which cleans the brush, too), using water and rubbing the bristles before and after... nothing fancy -- everything you already have.ust takes toothpaste (which cleans the brush, too), using water and rubbing the bristles before and after... nothing fancy -- everything you already have.</li>
            <li> Somehow people seem to have compromised to the idea that teeth may be lost before the body! I guess, nature designed the teeth to last until the man dies, if only he can take care. Any additional care taken to improve general well being should be welcomed. Any one who spends significant amount of money for an electric tooth brush to maintain oral hygene may consider using this gadget to keep the brush head clean, (only) if money is not a constraint.    I guess, it will help when we have coughs and colds in the family.     Having used this device, I have not developed any exciting feeling, except for the comfort of &#x27;scientific assurance&#x27; that the brush head is clean. I did not compare this device with any other device which can do the same function. I had only two concerns. 1) Is the unit safe for operation 2) How often do I have to change the UV bulb? I do not have any definite answer to both these questions. Based on general trust on an approved brand, I continue to use.</li>
            <li> This was an asked for Christmas present for our daughter.  Called her and she is very happy with it.  Uses it daily!</li>
            <li> After getting the sonicare toothbrush for Christmas and loving it, I saw this deal on Amazon for the sanitizer and thought why not??? I assume it is working, how would I know??? It is easy, only takes 10 minutes. Seems like a good idea.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer a Must Have for any household. It&#x27;s easy to set-up, use, and care for. I&#x27;m for keeping personal hygiene items as clean as possible; and the Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer does a fantastic job of meeting my needs. I know it will meet your.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just for what it is advertised to do: sanitize my Sonicare brushes.  It works quickly and quietly.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Once again, sonicare produces a superior product!  In times like these, we all need a leg up on taking care of ourselves and staying healthy.  This product is an answer to that and very convenient.  Thanks sonicare!</li>
            <li> I used the sonic care brush cleaner last night.  I don&#x27;t know what to say about that, as what it does is not something you can see, taste, smell, etc.  It was easy to set up and use.  I certainly will use it in the future.  Having a cleaner brush is a good thing, so I don&#x27;t see anything negative here.  The cycle of cleaning is only about 10 minutes, the unit makes no noise and it&#x27;s just a matter of unscrewing the brush from the handle and sticking it into place.  So, very easy, no muss, no fuss.  So, I will keep using it and recommend to friends with sonic care TBs.  At only $50 this product is really a steal &amp; help keep your brushes fresher longer without having to replace them nearly as often.  In my opinion this is a must buy item for anyone that owns a Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> I pretty much agree with most reviewers.  This is very easy to use, which was my first question when I got it.  Unless you have your own lab, you never can be sure if it&#x27;s really working, so we just have to go on faith that the manufacturers are telling the truth.  But as long as you have the correct toothbrush head for the unit, it&#x27;s easy, convenient, and presumably, good for your health.  What could be bad?</li>
            <li> We used to take our Sonicare toothbrush heads and run them through the dishwasher to clean them up.  Those days are gone now that we&#x27;ve got the UV sanitizer. It does a better job of sanitizing the heads and it&#x27;s incredibly easy to use. Our heads fit right into the space with no adjustments, but if you&#x27;ve got a different model toothbrush, the sanitizer comes with adapters. The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s one more thing to sit on a shelf and plug into a power strip, but it&#x27;s worth it to have a really clean toothbrush every time you brush.</li>
            <li> since the previous reviewers already pretty much summed up the benefits and disadvantages of this product I figured I&#x27;d just mention that the big benefit I saw with this sanitizer is the fact that you can store the brush heads inside - this is especially helpful if you have more than once person using the same rechargable base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big plus of the sanitizer is while I&#x27;ve always been told to throw out toothbrushes if you&#x27;ve been sick, throwing out the brushheads every time you get sick could get very expensive.  This makes you feel like you&#x27;re killing the germs and making the brush head safe to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference with the toothbrushes so I assume it works but there&#x27;s no way for the average consumer to be sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it five stars because it seems to do what it does well.  If you are concerned about the bacteria in your toothbrush and dipping it in alcohol isn&#x27;t the answer for you then this product has your name written all over it.    I have a Sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  But since I don&#x27;t use them, I can&#x27;t comment on how well they work.    The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  Ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead... well, 99% of them anyways.    So, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  What more could you ask for?    As a note, I do want to comment on what another reviewer wrote.  Namely, that people have survived decades without a device like this.  And I&#x27;d have to agree.  That is why I mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.  For me, it is more of an OCD where I like to be thorough on the things I do.  Therefore, when I give my brush a thorough cleaning (monthly or so) then I like to finish it off inside of this product.  It&#x27;s all a mental game and if this product makes you feel better/safer then it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Such an easy product to use.  My husband and I are already in the habit of pushing the button right after both of us have brushed our teeth.  Very economical and we feel confident that our brushes are sanitized.</li>
            <li> I like the fact knowing that my toothbrush is being disinfected, but I noticed that within a month or so, my toothbrush had already started turning yellow.</li>
            <li> This is useful if only because all other, particularly portable, ultraviolet sanitizers, are too narrow to hold the Sonicare toothbrush itself. Unfortunately, it is so specifically designed it can&#x27;t be used to sanitize anything else.</li>
            <li> I received the item as ststed.  At this time, I have not used the unit as I am currently using a model discontinued. When all product from the old unit are used I will begin using the new one. I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems with the new unit.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is a great way to keep my brush and my wife&#x27;s brush free from germs and stored separately from the battery portion.  It also allows any water / mold, etc that may get trapped between the battery portion of the unit and the brush to dry-out each day (which was a concern voiced by some for this Sonicare brush).  The santizer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not really up to the hype in my opinion. The battery always seems to die quickly, and unless you take the brush heads off and clean them after each brushing, they start to get nasty, and left over saliva/paste mixture seeps to the actual brush unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does clean well, however. My teeth and gums feel great after a brushing, a lot better than a normal brush.</li>
            <li> My wife feels that her toothbrushes are much cleaner...What else can I say about a sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Just got it today.&lt;br /&gt;Put in our e-series brush heads and push the button.&lt;br /&gt;After watching a movie, the light is still flashing--it doesn&#x27;t turn off itself as it should after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Find another victim on the Internet--his brush heads melted after one night of \\&quot;sanitizing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Returning it and wish you good luck if you are buying.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this product, everyone should have one, or at least be able to sanitize their toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, it seems like a neat idea when you have a slightly germaphobic SO. On the other, even the slightly germaphobic may recognize a waste of space.    I also have a background in biology, which is why i should have known better. But i thought, cheap supprise gift. woo hoo, points for me. Not so. Very anticlimactic. As a gift, it bombs. As a useful tool, it also comes up short. Particularly in comparison to other cleaning methods easily available.     Though I do have one quibble with another review, the biologist poo-pooing this device, despite being mainly in agreement. I think the main concern of bacterial growth on the brush is not the ones transmitted from our mouths. I think it is contamination from being in a restroom, open to fecal contaminants in the air, and also, at least here in my city, an apparently harmless but pretty pink growth that seems to come in the water supply.     That said... Save your money for some Sonicare condoms(little slip on silicon covers that help seal the brushhead to the body, helping to prevent leaks into the body mechanism. Found that one out too late) and new brush heads. It seems likely to be a far better use of the cash.</li>
            <li> We live in Mexico and being cautious with the drinking water is a big deal.  We only use bottled water and rinse our toothbrushes with alcohol (Tequila and the rubbing kind Ha Ha.)   This seemed like a great alternative.   No way to really tell if it works in sanitizing but haven&#x27;t gotten any&#x27;revenge&#x27; yet. We&#x27;ve discontinued the alcohol rinse, but not the tequila.    Price is great, too</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have read in other reviews that &#x27;why sanitize when the germs are coming from our mouths&#x27;, that doesn&#x27;t meant we can&#x27;t clean our brush heads to get rid of accumulated germs and bacteria.  I use mine once a day, I do wish that the sanitizer/charger that came with the toothbrush was available, it is smaller and charges also, but this will do!  Mary Salvador</li>
            <li> I bought this exact product in the UK three years ago for the British pound equivalent of $26. At the time of writing this review it was offered at $24 directly from amazon so not much of a price change for the three years past and between the countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to use with my kid&#x27;s toothbrushes (both the finger mount slicon gum brushes and small beginners brushes) unlike many other reviewers who use it for electrical toothbrush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can accommodate two brush heads  (or two toddler brushes) and as it says on the description it does a 10 minute cycle. During this cycle it consumes an average of 5.2 watts of electricity and it can work  well in 120-220 volt 50-60hz options so that you can take it to overseas holidays by just adding a plug adapter. For the last 3 years we used it on daily basis and there is no wear and tear plus bulb and the timer works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the one star review written by a biologist who claim these stuff are all waste of money due to the fact that their efficiencies are questionable and bacteria exist in mount as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a biomedical scientist too and I agree with that reviewer partially; yet I still give this product 5 stars. Let me tell you why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Although human mount contains bacteria like the other reviewer said, it does not necessarily mean we can put all dirty stuff into our mount. Most diseases are caused by pathogens that we introduce to our body through oral way. By the same way of thinking we should not be washing our fruits and vegetables too. So the more bugs you eliminate the less risk you get. Besides the regular bugs of the mouth flora reside there in a balance with our immune system and do not make much of a problem but pathogenic bacteria should not be treated in the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-kids learning to brush their own teeth are not very efficient. My kids take the brush, brush their teeth and then start playing with the brush leaving it in awkward places. We don&#x27;t want to be to restrictive on them since that may put them off from brushing their teeth entirely. Therefore, kids tend to expose the brush to more bugs then we, adults do and their immune system is weaker against pathogens so this type of preventive measure can be a good one to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-I agree with the reviewer that there is no scientific proof that further sanitizing toothbrushes makes anything better or worse. According to ADA (American dental association) guideline, they neither recommend nor discourage using these stuff. Among different ways of sanitizing things including dumping them into various solutions, this one is the most innocent one since it leaves no chemical residue that may cancel the benefits. So using UV light for 10 minutes is a preferable way of sanitizing stuff compared to those other questionable methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- UV light is a way of sanitizing we use in the lab. It is not a way to sterilize (to kill 100% of the living organisms) but good to reduce bacterial or viral load when needed. It acts by making DNA damage which makes it impossible for the single cell organism to survive and proliferate. Therefore, we at least know that UV light has a germicidal effect even though we are not sure about the extend of it for this particular device. My feeling is that it should be as effective as stated in the 99% claim on the box since it acts in a very close distance and for quite a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, although I agree with ADA guidelines as well as the other reviewers comments,  I see this as an affordable, maintenance free device, not introducing any nasty chemicals  so that  it could be used for an additional peace of mind especially for my kids.ces.

            <li> We bought this for our daughter as the dentist told he that he wanted her to start using it.  Since she has been using it, her gums has stopped bleeding and her teeth are healthier.  It does take a bit of getting used to, but the long term benefits are worth it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if it cleans all bacteria. It&#x27;s hard to see with a magnifying glass, so I&#x27;ll take their word for it.    If the head starts to glow in the dark, I&#x27;ll write a follow-up.</li>
            <li> Theoretically, this seems great to sanitize the toothbrush. Unfortunately, what I&#x27;ve found is that by using it, the bristles fray sooner. I&#x27;m guessing that the UV light interacts with the plastic bristles and weakens it; only a guess. And since Sonicare replacement heads are so expensive, it&#x27;s probably not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I cannot measure the hygienic function of this product, however, after a few weeks using it, I can say it is very convenient, has a solid design and incredibly cheap for the quality and effect.</li>
            <li> In a recent \\&quot;talk to the the doctor\\&quot; on network TV the point was made that the dirtiest item in the bathroom was the toothbrush. It is not just the oral bacteria that is of concern. Fecal bacteria was commonly found on toothbrush handles and bristles. The easiest explanation for this was inadequate hand washing by bathroom users. As a man, I have all too often witnessed other men in public restrooms dodge right past the sink on their way out. So, I am ordering one of these UV sanitizers today. It sure seems like cheap insurance along with some handwashing directions for the family!</li>
            <li> We have used Sonicare brushes for 15 years and bought this in May, 2011, an entire double sanitizer unit with the toothbrush charger all in one.  Spent $170 for it.  The bulb didn&#x27;t last 9 months (\\&quot;up to 5 years\\&quot;) and it took  another 5 months of back ordering and complicated phone calls to get a new bulb.  Still isn&#x27;t working.  We&#x27;ll go back to the simple charger and brush holder.  Phillips giving us a hard time and will only replace the sanitizer unit...like we would even think that would be satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This little machine is pretty neato. Now I know my brush head is germ free. It works quickly and quietly.</li>
            <li> I have a biology background and the good news is that this amount of UV light is going to have the desired effect on the bacteria that live in your toothbrush head.  It will induce many double strand breaks in the bacterial DNA, making it hard or impossible for them to grow.  It will have no lasting harmful effects on the brush because no chemicals/toxins are used.  My understanding is that there is a shut-off to prevent humans from being exposed to the UV light, which is a good thing as UV light will interfere with human DNA in the same way that it damages bacterial DNA.  However, I would like to point out a few things:    1, The detergent in your toothpaste (variously called sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, etc) will probably be effective enough at getting rid of bacteria -- that&#x27;s why we use it.    2, The bacteria are already in your mouth anyway!  How do you think your toothbrush head is getting contaminated in the first place?    3, People have survived very happily without wasting money on idiotic gadgets like this.    4, The bacteria that are NOT killed by this treatment are more likely to be mutated.  It&#x27;s a biological fact that UV light increases the number of DNA mutations.  While most bacteria will be killed, the 0.01% that survive are more likely to have suffered mutations.  This is not true for cell-disruptive methods of destruction like bleach and detergent (including the detergent in your toothpaste).      To summarize, dentists use this sort of gizmo because they&#x27;re putting the same tools into the mouths of many different people.  They don&#x27;t want to get sued, especially in light of reports suggesting that certain diseases may be passed through saliva.  However, this gizmo is completely unnecessary if you do not share your brushheads with other people.  In fact, it&#x27;s not even necessary if you share your brushheads with people you wouldn&#x27;t mind kissing...    Lastly, please bear in mind that not all bacteria are bad and that you actually need some to help you digest food properly.  Also, good bacteria take up space and resources to keep bad bacteria from finding a niche.  So, try NOT to use &#x27;antibacterial&#x27; soap, do eat some live active yogurt after a course of antibiotics and always completely finish a course of antibiotics that you&#x27;ve been prescribed by a doctor.</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it promises, just wish it was available with a built in charger for the toothbrush handle.  Most bathrooms have limited outlets available, and it requires two outlets to run this sonicare system.  I can make due with a power strip, but don&#x27;t like having it on a counter top that gets a lot of water splashed around .The toothbrush is the best on the market. We have used them for years and I highly recommend it.  I started with the recommendation of my dentist, and many of the problems (gum disease, plaque) were cleared up as a result.  If you don&#x27;t see a dentist regularly, you absolutely need the toothbrush.  Trust me, it&#x27;s that good.  The sanitizer eliminates an unsightly toothbrush sitting open on your counter, and keeps the head fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviews. The product is just a gadget. Bought a new UV unit to find that the light bulb does not work and phillis web site has no mention on where to get a replacement.  In addition Phillips warranty does not cover the light bulb.....nice to find out after reading the fine print. X@*#!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the early version of the UV sanitizer (HX7990) for at least 5 years on the same UV bulb. I energize it at least twice a day every single day. I does look like the bulb needs changing now but it still lights up (although a bit dimmer than when new). So I am not sure what all the bulb life complaints are about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the two \\&quot;most helpful reviews\\&quot;, I have this to comment. For the \\&quot;biologist\\&quot;, he seems to forget that a brush sitting out in the open in a bathroom is subjected to all kinds of aerosols that carry viruses and bacteria from flushing toilets. Before I got the UV sanitizer I used to have numerous problems with cold sores in my mouth, I suspect from my brush heads sitting in the open in the bathroom. Since using the sanitizer the incidence of these cold sores has gone almost to zero. The \\&quot;detergent\\&quot; left behind on a brush head has little impact on re-contamination of a brush head left in the open many hours after its been in your mouth. Yes, you have a lot of \\&quot;good\\&quot; bacteria in your mouth but you have a lot of bad viruses and streptococus bacteria in the air as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the bulb replacement, I just ordered two directly from the Sonicare website. You just go to Support and do a search for \\&quot;UV bulb\\&quot; and they link you over to the online parts ordering. Put one in your cart (a whopping $11.00) and checkout. Could not be easier. No phone needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the guy who says \\&quot;just use peroxide\\&quot;. Great, except H2O2 seriously oxidizes your plastic brush bristles which can shorten the life of your brush head considerably. I learned this the hard way because I use peroxide toothpaste and it destroyed an early model Sonicare handle. They subsequently changed the type of plastic used in the handles. Plus, once you remove the head from the peroxide it will be subject to airborn contamination thereafter because the peroxide will degrade as the head dries. If you leave it immersed bewteen brushings, it will shortenthe life of your brush heads. Given how expensive these are, not a good choice.</li>
            <li> We use this every day.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Waterpik Complete Care WP-900 toothbrush heads and it works well with two brush holder attachments that are included with the unit.</li>
            <li> easy to use, works as promised.. love the idea that it sanitizes the toothbrush heads. can put in different size heads and several things at a time</li>
            <li> my Phillips sonicare uv sanitizer works great on keeping the brush head of my sonicare tooth brush clean and sanitary. use it daily</li>
            <li> This UV sanitizer is designed to sanitize your toothbrush head by saturating it with UV light, which is supposed to kill all the germs and bacteria that could be on it.  The unit fits 2 brush heads, but before you even start to consider buying one, you should definitely read the list of brush heads that will actually fit (it&#x27;s mostly Sonicare and OralB heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the product do what it says?  Yeah, I guess so.  You fit the brush head inside, close the door, push the button, and a bright light turns on for 10 minutes, then turns off.  Presumably during that time period, 99% of the bacteria have been killed.  Since it appears to do what it claims to, I give the product more than one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have to echo the sentiments that more scientifically-trained reviews have expressed.  This product is in almost every way unnecessary--I have never, nor do I know anyone who has ever gotten sick or a bacterial infection from their toothbrush.  Exposure to a moderate level of bacteria is actually GOOD for you, since it acts as a sort of exercise for your immune system, strengthening it for more dangerous infections.  When you use products like this and other germophobic products, you&#x27;re probably actually increasing your risk of having a serious infection.  I can only recommend this product to people who have compromised immune systems or are seriously germophobic and can only sleep at night with the peace of mind that a product like this gives.  The bottom line: you could do so many other and better things with your $50 than spend it on a plastic light-bulb case that kills germs that weren&#x27;t getting you sick in the first place.</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;It takes 10 minutes for the process to sanitize your brush, during which time you can wonder what possessed you to get this and if it is really working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, but so does soaking your toothbrush in strong mouthwash.  It is time consuming, and not really a chore I wanted to do every morning and everytime I brushed my teeth, or maybe I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t see the need for it, but I still prefer a brush that I work myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a gift for someone who is into gadgets, then you have found it.</li>
            <li> I love this sanitizer...knowing that germs are killed before you put your brush in your mouth...and it has a great place to stay in between brushing...Love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare UV Sanitizer uses a small but strong light bulb inside a chrome-painted plastic housing to kill electric toothbrush bacteria on a daily basis.  All one needs to do is shake the water from the brush head, insert it into the capsule, close the door, and push a button.  Ten minutes later, when the small green light stops blinking, the brush head is free of at least 90% of bacteria. (Don&#x27;t think about the other ten percent!)  Does it work?  Since I&#x27;m not a microbiologist, I can&#x27;t say for sure, but all the warnings that come with the box suggest that the light is powerful enough to do the necessary damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sanitizer comes with adaptors that accommodate brush heads of multiple brands of electric toothbrushes:  Sonicare, Oral B, and Braun.  Not only do the adaptors address difference in bottom connectors (round or rectangular), but they also adjust for differences in height to keep the bristles at the right level.  Users can insert the larger Sonicare brush assembly or a much smaller Oral B brush or both at the same time.  (See product picture for illustration.)  Since I use an electric toothbrush only once a day and use a traditional brush at other times, I wish that the housing could fit regular brushes as well.  That feature might make this product nearly perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the unit sterilizes only the brush heads and not the entire brush.  This means that the interior needs to be cleaned at least once a week, if not more often, because of the saliva-and-water mix that drains from inside the brush and down its sides.  The bottom tray and adaptors snap out fairly easily for cleaning; however, it would be nice if the entire interior compartment emerged germ-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the sanitizer comes with strict warnings about not touching the bulb, making it not appropriate for use in the bathrooms of young children, it does have the safety feature of shutting off if the door is opened during operation. The canceled operation won&#x27;t cool the bulb, but it will stop the UV radiation.  The plastic bulb housing seems to protect the bulb adequately from all but the tiniest fingers.  (I&#x27;m not even sure toddler fingers could get in, although kids have been known to defeat a host of safety devices.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is lightweight and compact enough to pack on a trip for those who travel with their electric toothbrushes and who don&#x27;t like the idea of invisible germs lurking in their bristles, even for a few days.  All you&#x27;ll need is a standard outlet and a small flat surface to set it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Sonicare UV Santizer for its easy of use.  Maybe it&#x27;s giving me a false sense of security since I can&#x27;t tell whether it works or not, but ignorance can indeed be bliss.ut it will stop the UV radiation.

            <li> I&#x27;d just recovered from a sinus infection, when I used my Phillips Sonicare Sanitizer for the first time. I cleaned my Oral-B Flexisoft brush head as per instructions after I finished my antibiotics. (Normally, I buy a new one after I complete them.)  I didn&#x27;t get sick again. I can&#x27;t say it was the Sanitizer; but I can&#x27;t say it wasn&#x27;t.  Personally, I think it works.     The Phillips Sonicare UV Sanitizer is brand-specific. It can only be used with Sonicare, Sonicare ProResults, Oral-B Flexisoft and Oral-B FlossAction heads. If you don&#x27;t have a Phillips electric toothbrush, you have to use an adapter for the brush head. (The adapters are fairly easy to use.)     I liked the Phillips Sonicare UV Sanitizer. It&#x27;s a good idea. And it does what it says it will. However, it&#x27;s small and requires dexterity that I don&#x27;t have. Even though this unit is very compact, it&#x27;s weirdly clunky. I have a difficult time opening the case after each use. I also have difficulty cleaning it. I have arthritis and the small components are really challenge.</li>
            <li> If this product does what it claims to do then it might be a helpful tool to have in the bathroom.  That being said, you have no evidence of anything, although it does offer as a place to store your toothbrush heads and looks cool on a bathroom counter.  Worth $50? Probably not unless you fear e.coli or other viruses like that.  I do believe that it does work, however again at $50 its a lot for piece of mind</li>
            <li> Wow! UV cleaning in a tiny footprint of space and storage for multiple heads. Close the little door with your heads mounted around the center light and turn it on: easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add on to your basic Sonicare (or a good range of compatible toothbrushes which for the two of us, was a good thing with two different brands) and get those heads sanitized. Safe, compact, and here we are a few months later with no problems. Ours is stored in another room where we(well I) wander around to watch TV around the corner. This unit is so compact that it is easily overlooked in plain site, so, you know, go mobile and put it in, like our home, the office. One of those \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; items that once used gets to be essentialy part of the routine by choice. I love a great gadget: this is terrific, economical and gives us a lot of feeling safer about toothbrush sterility. This skeptic&#x27;s won over!</li>
            <li> This product is everything is was made out to be.  I highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it.</li>
            <li> This works out very well with a Sonicare electric  toothbrush.  It cleans and sanitizes the brush.  Brushes last longer too</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe what they say.  This is just another way for Philips to make money off of us.  First they buy the company and then they come out with a newer product.  My old toothbrush worked better than their new model.  And the newer model has holes in it so that water seeps into it and then it starts to smell.  How does Philips really think that this is a good design.  My old brush never smelled.   Now I have to clean the entire head, separate the screw on part and completely dry it off.  This new design is no improvement just a way to sucker us into buying a so called new product.   I have had it for about two years and have not gotten sick and now they want me to believe that I will get sick unless I buy their Sanitizer.  No Way!! - Philips.</li>
            <li> many scratches on the product. the uv bulb almost die. user menu is full of wrinkle. don&#x27;t buy anything from this seller. it IS NOT NEW!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years!  It&#x27;s like having a new toothbrush every time you brush your teeth!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this sanitizer.  The light is lasting for like three years. I  bought a spare, but i haven&#x27;t needed it ... yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and I still haven&#x27;t returned it. Every once in a while I will try to fit the little holders into the unit and get it close properly and start firing up, but inevitably I fail to snap the units in properly and grow frustrated and start mumbling incoherent epithets at the Philips company and put the thing away for another month or two. Granted, I&#x27;m not the most adept kid on the block when it comes to anything even slightly mechanical, but I have been known to successfully snap times into their properly fitting spaces once or twice in my lifetime. This is not one of those times. Eventually I will get my son to put the thing together for me and will no doubt get hours of brush sanitizing enjoyment in years to come. Until that time, just  call me &amp;#34;frustrated, but hopeful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> after about  years my old Philips brush stop working bought this one and uv light dosen&#x27;t  work Costco replaced it this one dosen&#x27;t work think i&#x27;ll return it and get another brand</li>
            <li> Just kidding, they&#x27;re still a nice, healthy, yellowish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much of a way of knowing it&#x27;s working without running some bacteria cultures, but I&#x27;ll assume it does it&#x27;s job for this part of the review. The downsides are that it has a dull hum whenever it&#x27;s plugged in even if it&#x27;s not running and that it leaves the toothbrush smelling a little weird (like it was almost cooking it or something).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upsides are that it runs pretty quickly, the humming sound is a nice reminder to unplug the sanitizer when it&#x27;s done and save some phantom energy, and even if it&#x27;s not plugged in it still blocks some dirty airborne particles after flushing (apparently closing the toilet lid doesn&#x27;t even help that!).</li>
            <li> need another one but it is price prohibitive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The potential of problems from the sanitizing system is a big concern for cancer survivors. More information is needed to assuage. the problem.</li>
            <li> Why on earth didn&#x27;t they make this large enough for a regular toothbrush and tongue scraper to be sanitized at the same time?  You have to have the brush in exactly the right position to close it.  I am not a designer but I could have made a better sanitizer!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great gadget, thanks!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the forensic tools to tell if this thing works well, but for piece of mind, it&#x27;s a great little uv unit.</li>
            <li> I use this to sanitize my Sonicare brush head and have been happy with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> We all keep our toothbrushes in the bathroom, this Sanitizer helps keep everything clean!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful tool and should be used with every Sonicare user</li>
