            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So freaking cute!</li>
            <li>There are lots of great compartments and it ROLLS for easy traveling and carrying around.</li>
            <li>, kinda could not stand on its own (on carpet).</li>
            <li>It is a nice and sturdy roll about.</li>
            <li>A good friend of mine has this very case and she loves and swears by It!!</li>
            <li>This case gives you a huge amoount of storage for that ever growing collection!</li>
            <li>so in love with it.</li>
            <li>I was very happy when I received this but realized even after a short roll around my kitchen to show it off that it was flimsy.</li>
            <li>I love the cosmetics</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love animal print.</li>
            <li>The top also detaches. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>So I just make sure not to tilt it with the handle and instead use the top of the case.</li>
            <li>Sure a tub keeps it out the way</li>
            <li>With this case I am able to sort through it, put my essentials in the top storage, and use the bottom section for extras.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really cute, and it seems to be made well.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I&#x27;ll be using this case for years to come.</li>
            <li>the price was great compare to other makeup trolly&#x27;s in the market and the quality is great.</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>Super cute trolly case!</li>
            <li>This zebra rolling makeup case is sooo unique!</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with since the wheels rotate 360 degrees, or just take the top compartment</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very strong and the color pattern is so bright and nice on the outside</li>
            <li>the most important feature is that its very light and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>A strong construction of the case makes it durable as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this animal print right now!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, I figured.</li>
            <li>First the outside looked great wheels moved so nice</li>
            <li>The cheap cardboard was showing.</li>
            <li>The inside is made of cheap plastic and has cardboard covered in a velvety material on the inside, which was peeling away from the aluminum sides.  </li>
            <li>Shany Zebra Rolling Trolly Makeup Case, Light Weight, 12 Pounds]]</li>
            <li>but once i opened it i was amazed at how cheaply put together</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t know if it is the fault of Amazon shipping it or that it&#x27;s a cheap product</li>
            <li>Yes to the great space  only 12 lbs   </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things with the case is that I can just remove the top part to travel with when the whole unit isn&#x27;t needed.  </li>
            <li>If you can get your hands on a Shany case, its worth the $!</li>
            <li>So I used the bottom portion (with the wheels etc) to store my products that I didn&#x27;t need frequently and managed to get most of what I needed to fit into the top makeup case portion.</li>
            <li>One thing I can adviced Amazon, you can actually check the product first to make sure it is in good condition before you send it to the buyer so it will save us from all these.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my kit, loved the outside leopard look</li>
            <li>Im was happy at first that it did arrived today, March 3rd as I needed it.</li>
            <li>I do have a Seya rolling ake-up case but a bit smaller and its been 3 yrs &amp; works &amp; looks good.</li>
            <li>I really like the zebra print and how easy it is to have all your essentials fit and just up and leave.</li>
            <li>The trays are all coming apart at the edges and none of the inserts fit right inside the trays..</li>
            <li>This is a tin can waiting to crumble... and the zebra siding comes off pretty easily too.</li>
            <li>Aside from being visually appealing, this is a high quality case with durable wheels and handles.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty case.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough room to store some palettes, lipsticks,nail polish and more which I love about this makeup case and you rarely find such nice prints for such good prices.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not surprised how good</li>
            <li>ITS DURABLE AND VERY STURDY AND HOLDS A LOT!!</li>
            <li>It is so sturdy and can fit so much stuff.</li>
            <li>She takes it everywhere on a job and all her makeup fits perfectly with having some many little places to put you palettes along with other things!</li>
            <li>The accordion drawers came right off in my hand.</li>
            <li>Just drop right off.</li>
            <li>I waited a while to right this comment after receiving it and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty rare to find a rolling makeup case in a fun pattern for this price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creative yet professional which is exactly what artist should be looking for.</li>
            <li>(like mine (: ) with wheels i am able to travel nicer and it gives me less worry about distinguishing which luggage is mine!</li>
            <li>shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>&amp; after I checked &amp; took pictures to report it as Im sure I wanted my money back.</li>
            <li>Drawers lock to keep product safe and has enough room to stow products for any job.</li>
            <li>I am currently saving up my money to splurge on this, love the print and all the space.</li>
            <li>this one however is lighter than my old one even when its filled with all the make up and tools so i can easily get it in and out of the car without breaking my back.</li>
            <li>I filled the case up and then found out I had even more hidden compartments!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t long (about 3 months) before the bottom of the top portion began to fall off.</li>
            <li>Opening the first case looked promising, but one opened and the otherside did not.</li>
            <li>It has room for everything and is easily organized and only TWELVE pounds.</li>
            <li>which was what I really wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to makeup school and getting ready to get this case.</li>
            <li>Looks extremely professional but shows off how fun the zebra print is.</li>
            <li>How much did i pay for this??..</li>
            <li>tooo much for quality like this...</li>
            <li>and she adores it so much.</li>
            <li>Everything is all in one place and ready to go at a moments notice.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you get this!</li>
            <li>VERY  </li>
            <li>THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;</li>
            <li>It feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li>So much room.  </li>
            <li>It rolls really well</li>
            <li>it was too heavy on its own.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Then when i thought that was all, it doesn&#x27;t align right when the cases are buckled together, and then the bottom metal rounded edges are completely coming off..</li>
            <li>but you never know what you really have when everything is just sitting on top of each other.</li>
            <li>And they are very professional looking and have so much space!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  Also inside the boxes it has adjustable space where you can rearrange the lines to your favor  </li>
            <li>One must be reminded that sometimes, mail carriers and such aren&#x27;t as gentle with pretty things as we are and that is no fault of Shany.</li>
            <li>My case is kind of heavy, and I can totally see that breaking in the process of me tilting it to roll.</li>
            <li>The piece that holds the latch to keep the top and bottom together on the right side was completely broken off&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>This was my first and LAST purchase.</li>
            <li>no complaint so far   </li>
            <li>point is, if you want this thing for work, or for frequent use, do yourself a favor and spend the extra $100 for a zebra print trunk of higher quality.</li>
            <li>The little compartments inside started to break with fairly light use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a PROFESSIONAL makeup artist, therefore I need quality products and supplies to maintain that.</li>
            <li>Traveling with this makes you look like an professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>I have so much makeup and nail polish that I was keeping it in a giant tub to store it.  </li>
            <li>There is so much more, but I don&#x27;t want to waste anymore time on this product!!</li>
            <li>The tray in the small case on top does not slide all the way open as it should and one part of it doesn&#x27;t seem to be attached to the track at</li>
            <li>I was excited about the print and the price (at nearly $100 less than similar products, hell yes!).</li>
            <li>The lining in the top of the box is ripped from the tray not fitting properly and (possibly, just a theory)</li>
            <li>That is a major plus.</li>
            <li>A dream crusher, this pretty little thing...</li>
            <li>When I was looking the reviews had three good reviews and three bad...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Drawers lock to keep product safe and has enough room to stow products for any job.</li>
            <li> I am currently saving up my money to splurge on this, love the print and all the space.</li>
            <li> this one however is lighter than my old one even when its filled with all the make up and tools so i can easily get it in and out of the car without breaking my back.</li>
            <li> I filled the case up and then found out I had even more hidden compartments!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t long (about 3 months) before the bottom of the top portion began to fall off.</li>
            <li> Opening the first case looked promising, but one opened and the otherside did not.</li>
            <li> It has room for everything and is easily organized and only TWELVE pounds.</li>
            <li> which was what I really wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to makeup school and getting ready to get this case.</li>
            <li> Looks extremely professional but shows off how fun the zebra print is.</li>
            <li> How much did i pay for this??..</li>
            <li> tooo much for quality like this...</li>
            <li> and she adores it so much.</li>
            <li> Everything is all in one place and ready to go at a moments notice.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you get this!</li>
            <li> VERY  </li>
            <li> THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;</li>
            <li> It feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li> So much room.  </li>
            <li> It rolls really well</li>
            <li> it was too heavy on its own.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Then when i thought that was all, it doesn&#x27;t align right when the cases are buckled together, and then the bottom metal rounded edges are completely coming off..</li>
            <li> but you never know what you really have when everything is just sitting on top of each other.</li>
            <li> And they are very professional looking and have so much space!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  Also inside the boxes it has adjustable space where you can rearrange the lines to your favor  </li>
            <li> One must be reminded that sometimes, mail carriers and such aren&#x27;t as gentle with pretty things as we are and that is no fault of Shany.</li>
            <li> My case is kind of heavy, and I can totally see that breaking in the process of me tilting it to roll.</li>
            <li> The piece that holds the latch to keep the top and bottom together on the right side was completely broken off&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> This was my first and LAST purchase.</li>
            <li> no complaint so far   </li>
            <li> point is, if you want this thing for work, or for frequent use, do yourself a favor and spend the extra $100 for a zebra print trunk of higher quality.</li>
            <li> The little compartments inside started to break with fairly light use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a PROFESSIONAL makeup artist, therefore I need quality products and supplies to maintain that.</li>
            <li> Traveling with this makes you look like an professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I have so much makeup and nail polish that I was keeping it in a giant tub to store it.  </li>
            <li> There is so much more, but I don&#x27;t want to waste anymore time on this product!!</li>
            <li> The tray in the small case on top does not slide all the way open as it should and one part of it doesn&#x27;t seem to be attached to the track at</li>
            <li> I was excited about the print and the price (at nearly $100 less than similar products, hell yes!).</li>
            <li> The lining in the top of the box is ripped from the tray not fitting properly and (possibly, just a theory)</li>
            <li> That is a major plus.</li>
            <li> A dream crusher, this pretty little thing...</li>
            <li> When I was looking the reviews had three good reviews and three bad...</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t fall off, but they pretty much bent sideways, rendering them almost useless.</li>
            <li> I have been admiring this for so long!</li>
            <li> i have a back problem from standing on my feet all day and it was really hard for me to carry my old trolly bc</li>
            <li> The small rail holding the very bottom tray was bent down and broken.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> I had used some duct tape to hold it on for a while, but after only 7 months together, I had to scrap my little case.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING is falling apart.the little card board inserts to make different sections..</li>
            <li> I actually have the black version of this as well and when I seen the zebra one, I just had to have it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 2 gigs and having to actually roll this product down a few city blocks, the wheels started to give.</li>
            <li> The dividers are coming apart, the lining is coming out and not only is one of the drawers broken off, the part that should make said drawer slide only slides on one side.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is with the telescopic handle.</li>
            <li> I do still use the little compartment sliding things to hold my brushes and sponges.</li>
            <li> but I would have to say that some of the reviews leave me with the thought and suggestion that the materials this is made with should be a little stronger</li>
            <li> Waste of time &amp; money..</li>
            <li> I am a face painter and my gear isn&#x27;t terribly heavy, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected there to be some flaws, but this is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure the slats would stay connected</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the condition I received it in I&#x27;m not confident this would make it on a plane trip.</li>
            <li> The locks on the outside were broken, the plastic on the inside was cracked and broken as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived dirty, internal trays do not slide, lining isn&#x27;t attached to interior walls/trays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and this looks like child&#x27;s play..very disappointed</li>

            <li> This item arrived broken, scratched and VERY dirty on the outside. The inside was just as bad. The cloth interior was coming off of the inside. The cheap cardboard was showing. The accordion drawers came right off in my hand. Obviously, the seller doesn&#x27;t care about selling or sending quality products. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I will never buy from this seller or Shany ever again. This was my first and LAST purchase. I&#x27;m a PROFESSIONAL makeup artist, therefore I need quality products and supplies to maintain that.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item March 1st and Hoping to recieved it March 3rd when I ordered and have it shipped one day. Im was happy at first that it did arrived today, March 3rd as I needed it. It came with amazon box, I opened it and the case is inside a shany box. But as soon I opened the amazon box, i can see two visible holes outside the shany boxes and voila! Once i took out the case, I saw  dents &amp; scratches.. I took lots of pics to show.. The liner was not even glued properly and separating from the case and it was very obvious. I do have a Seya rolling ake-up case but a bit smaller and its been 3 yrs &amp; works &amp; looks good. So Im very disappointed by taking chances &amp; purchasing this item. I called Amazon an hour after it arrived &amp; after I checked &amp; took pictures to report it as Im sure I wanted my money back. Waste of time &amp; money.. I might have to just buy another Seya Product I guess.. Don&#x27;t buy this product. One thing I can adviced Amazon, you can actually check the product first to make sure it is in good condition before you send it to the buyer so it will save us from all these.</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken. The inside is made of cheap plastic and has cardboard covered in a velvety material on the inside, which was peeling away from the aluminum sides.  For the price it was, I was seriously disappointed.  The locks on the outside were broken, the plastic on the inside was cracked and broken as well.</li>
            <li> i bought the zebra trolly couple of weeks a go and im so in love with it. the price was great compare to other makeup trolly&#x27;s in the market and the quality is great. the most important feature is that its very light and easy to carry around. i have a back problem from standing on my feet all day and it was really hard for me to carry my old trolly bc it was too heavy on its own. this one however is lighter than my old one even when its filled with all the make up and tools so i can easily get it in and out of the car without breaking my back.</li>
            <li> I got this for all of my nail gear. I do portable nails for my family and friends. I filled the case up and then found out I had even more hidden compartments! Excellent quality too. If you can get your hands on a Shany case, its worth the $!</li>
            <li> I was excited about the print and the price (at nearly $100 less than similar products, hell yes!). I was very happy when I received this but realized even after a short roll around my kitchen to show it off that it was flimsy. I am a face painter and my gear isn&#x27;t terribly heavy, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 gigs and having to actually roll this product down a few city blocks, the wheels started to give. They didn&#x27;t fall off, but they pretty much bent sideways, rendering them almost useless. That&#x27;s fine, I figured. So I used the bottom portion (with the wheels etc) to store my products that I didn&#x27;t need frequently and managed to get most of what I needed to fit into the top makeup case portion. I still had the zebra print look which was what I really wanted. The little compartments inside started to break with fairly light use. The tracks they slid on fell off and became such a pain that I eventually just ripped them off and physically took them out and put them back in every time I needed to get something. Still, I persevered. I loved my zebra trunk...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t long (about 3 months) before the bottom of the top portion began to fall off. Just drop right off. I had used some duct tape to hold it on for a while, but after only 7 months together, I had to scrap my little case. I do still use the little compartment sliding things to hold my brushes and sponges. I slip them into my set bag and it keeps everything neat and tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is, if you want this thing for work, or for frequent use, do yourself a favor and spend the extra $100 for a zebra print trunk of higher quality. This is a tin can waiting to crumble... and the zebra siding comes off pretty easily too. Sigh. A dream crusher, this pretty little thing...</li>
            <li> The print is one of my favs but I would have to say that some of the reviews leave me with the thought and suggestion that the materials this is made with should be a little stronger so I had to give this product a 4 stars. I really do love the print and the storage seems ideal for a makeup artist. There&#x27;s enough room to store some palettes, lipsticks,nail polish and more which I love about this makeup case and you rarely find such nice prints for such good prices.</li>
            <li> This zebra rolling makeup case is sooo unique! If you want to step out of the \\&quot;All Black\\&quot; everything this is perfect. The compartments are roomy and have the ability to store all your makeup products. Easy to travel with since the wheels rotate 360 degrees, or just take the top compartment and if you don&#x27;t want to take everything and use it as your train case.</li>
            <li> This was my birthday present to myself.  It arrived two days after I ordered it, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scratched, dented and broken.  The dividers are coming apart, the lining is coming out and not only is one of the drawers broken off, the part that should make said drawer slide only slides on one side.  I guess I didn&#x27;t read enough reviews online to have an idea this was going to happen.  Happy birthday to me!  Except not.  Lame.  Very disappointed that I have to send it back.</li>
            <li> I take this thing everywhere. I LOVE IT! It is so sturdy and can fit so much stuff. There are lots of great compartments and it ROLLS for easy traveling and carrying around. Not to mention how cute it is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to makeup school and getting ready to get this case. A good friend of mine has this very case and she loves and swears by It!! I&#x27;m not surprised how good this product Is everything I&#x27;ve ever got from Shany has always been good sturdy quality!! [[ASIN:B003TPA9XG Shany Zebra Rolling Trolly Makeup Case, Light Weight, 12 Pounds]]</li>
            <li> Super cute trolly case! Looks extremely professional but shows off how fun the zebra print is. This case gives you a huge amoount of storage for that ever growing collection! (like mine (: ) with wheels i am able to travel nicer and it gives me less worry about distinguishing which luggage is mine!</li>
            <li> I want this item... Im adding this to my wish list for x-mas. I love the cosmetics so I need to carry them in style.</li>
            <li> DO not buy this! When I was looking the reviews had three good reviews and three bad... First the outside looked great wheels moved so nice, kinda could not stand on its own (on carpet). Opening the first case looked promising, but one opened and the otherside did not. My brother showed me where the henges were and they were just plastic pieces. The dividers are cardboard covered felt!!! Moving the pieces around made the felt bunch up and come off. The lining was rippley and coming off the bottom. There is so much more, but I don&#x27;t want to waste anymore time on this product!! DO NOT BUY... A kid might like it but a freaken tackle box would be better then this!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my kit, loved the outside leopard look but once i opened it i was amazed at how cheaply put together it was.. EVERYTHING is falling apart.the little card board inserts to make different sections.. All the fabrics is either falling off or bubbled up..The trays are all coming apart at the edges and none of the inserts fit right inside the trays.. It looks as though they are too big and are pushing against the wall..  Then when i thought that was all, it doesn&#x27;t align right when the cases are buckled together, and then the bottom metal rounded edges are completely coming off.. WOW!!! How much did i pay for this??..tooo much for quality like this... I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and this looks like child&#x27;s play..very disappointed</li>
            <li> One of my co-workers has one of these and she adores it so much. She takes it everywhere on a job and all her makeup fits perfectly with having some many little places to put you palettes along with other things!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and I was very excited to receive it. However, I don&#x27;t know if it is the fault of Amazon shipping it or that it&#x27;s a cheap product but it was not in good condition when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The small rail holding the very bottom tray was bent down and broken.&lt;br /&gt;2) The piece that holds the latch to keep the top and bottom together on the right side was completely broken off&lt;br /&gt;3) The tray in the small case on top does not slide all the way open as it should and one part of it doesn&#x27;t seem to be attached to the track at all&lt;br /&gt;4) All the foam padding is not measured and attached properly so I&#x27;m not sure the slats would stay connected&lt;br /&gt;5) The lining in the top of the box is ripped from the tray not fitting properly and (possibly, just a theory) someone trying to stuff it in anyway&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the condition I received it in I&#x27;m not confident this would make it on a plane trip. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love it.... shipping was very fast. The box was well protected and the quality is awesome! I like how it has a lot of space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty rare to find a rolling makeup case in a fun pattern for this price.  Drawers lock to keep product safe and has enough room to stow products for any job.</li>
            <li> Yes to the great space  only 12 lbs   Also you can adjust the size of it by taking the 2 middle box out and use the cover (provided) and valla you have a much smaller case (This was a plus)  It not only have wheels but they also rotate (This is the newest feature, I have not seen one like it B4)  This is a must have if you are a make up artist I highly recommend  Also inside the boxes it has adjustable space where you can rearrange the lines to your favor  Mine arrived at good conditions and quality is just perfect  I waited a while to right this comment after receiving it and no complaint so far   I keep you guys updated if anything  I recommend this</li>
            <li> I actually have the black version of this as well and when I seen the zebra one, I just had to have it! I&#x27;ve never had a quality or damage issue with any Shany products! Mine arrived in perfect condition. One must be reminded that sometimes, mail carriers and such aren&#x27;t as gentle with pretty things as we are and that is no fault of Shany. This product holds up well. I travel with it all over the place, I&#x27;m constantly in and out of it and I&#x27;ve had no issues at all!</li>
            <li> I have been admiring this for so long! I am currently saving up my money to splurge on this, love the print and all the space. I want to become a freelance makeup artist and this would be the perfect case to take with me to appointments.</li>
            <li> I love this and it&#x27;s very strong and the color pattern is so bright and nice on the outside it doesn&#x27;t rip or tear. Very good</li>
            <li> This is SHAMEFUL!  Arrived dirty, internal trays do not slide, lining isn&#x27;t attached to interior walls/trays, latches do not line up...  I&#x27;m not exaggerating any of this.  I expected there to be some flaws, but this is ridiculous.  I opened it 10 minutes ago, and it&#x27;s already going back in the box to be returned.</li>
            <li> this trolly makeup case is great! its sturdy are roomy. the zebra print makes it ten times cuter when im traveling with it!</li>
            <li> IM IN LOVE WITH THIS CASSE!! ITS ZEBRA!!! OMG...I LOVE ZEBRA PRINT!!! AND THIS CASE IS THE BOMB.COM..ITS DURABLE AND VERY STURDY AND HOLDS A LOT!!</li>
            <li> Shany has some of the cutest rolling trolly makeup cases! And they are very professional looking and have so much space!</li>
            <li> Traveling with this makes you look like an professional makeup artist. It helps you be organize and neat. If you don&#x27;t like zebra, it also comes in leopard !</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty case. I really like the zebra print and how easy it is to have all your essentials fit and just up and leave. Everything is all in one place and ready to go at a moments notice.</li>
            <li> Now this is an ARTIST&#x27;S case. It&#x27;s creative yet professional which is exactly what artist should be looking for. It has room for everything and is easily organized and only TWELVE pounds. Can I say perfect?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this animal print right now! and omg the quality is sooo good! I love the case and its a rolling Trolly! so its great to take with you when you travel. I highly recommend you get this! its great for all your makeup!</li>
            <li> Okay, let me point out the obvi, the Zebra is so cute!!! Love animal print. And it&#x27;s portable, and the telescopic handle and the wheels are great!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter who is going to Cosmetology school.  She loved it. It is a nice and sturdy roll about.</li>
            <li> EXCELENT ALL I M HAPPY&lt;br /&gt; VERY  THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;br /&gt; I HOPE WILL BE YOU CUSTOMER AGAIN SOON</li>
            <li> This trolly is the cutest on the market. Aside from being visually appealing, this is a high quality case with durable wheels and handles. I would recommend this to anyone looking for portability and style!!</li>
            <li> beautiful zebra print and it rolls. That is a major plus. This is the perfect case for a makeup lover. The top also detaches. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Cheap, didnt last and was already broken when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> I am in nail school, so I bought this to transport all my nail stuff (acrylic, polishes, remover, cotton, ect) and I love it. It works great! I like that the compartments are all adjustable. It feels very sturdy. My only complaint is with the telescopic handle. It is only attached at the bottom, on the last compartment. My case is kind of heavy, and I can totally see that breaking in the process of me tilting it to roll.So I just make sure not to tilt it with the handle and instead use the top of the case. I have gotten so many compliments on it! I love it!</li>
            <li> So freaking cute! Zebra? How perfect. This is a great, sturdy case with a place to organize everything. Perfect for on-site jobs.</li>
            <li> Great for travel &amp; stands out from the rest of the luggage at the airport! A very sexy case! A strong construction of the case makes it durable as well. A \\&quot;rockin and rollin\\&quot; case to own!</li>
            <li> I received this awesome train case as a gift.  I have so much makeup and nail polish that I was keeping it in a giant tub to store it.  Sure a tub keeps it out the way but you never know what you really have when everything is just sitting on top of each other. With this case I am able to sort through it, put my essentials in the top storage, and use the bottom section for extras. It holds all my brushes and nails stuff.  I keep extra hand creams and face moisturizes in as well. So much room.  One of my favorite things with the case is that I can just remove the top part to travel with when the whole unit isn&#x27;t needed.  It rolls really well, it&#x27;s really cute, and it seems to be made well.  I am sure I&#x27;ll be using this case for years to come.</li>
