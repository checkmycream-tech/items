            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it works best, and curls look most &amp;#34;natural/loose&amp;#34</li>

            <li>Absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I tyed using this curling wand and only held my hair to it for 5 to 7 seconds and got perfect curls!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my hair and asked what I used.</li>
            <li>you will LOVE this</li>
            <li>Works on all hair types, as i did prom hairdos with this curler and they came out stunning.</li>
            <li>- it heats up fast, gets really hot, and curls perfectly!  </li>
            <li>That might not mean much to anyone else, but I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t end up with good curls and straight tips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So easy to use</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and looks shiny, and curls come out gorgeous and sexy.</li>
            <li>5 stars though, great results and not kinks at the bottom like with regular curling irons.</li>
            <li>Curls last all day and look great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Curls are bouncy, shiny and smooth...</li>
            <li>Thanks again! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for really long hair.</li>
            <li>It is so quick, heats up incredibly fast and so easy to ude and the result is beautiful and lasts long.</li>
            <li>It makes nice soft curls in longer hair .</li>
            <li>Also this curling iron gives your hair really nice curls that almost look wavy and natural.</li>
            <li>and it get very hot</li>
            <li>Does take some practice but once you have it down its a great look.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot really quick and my results always look salon worthy.</li>
            <li>Works great once you use it a few times and get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>The gloves are nice, but you will likely not use them, and they do nothing for the neck and arm.  </li>
            <li>You can get lots of different kind of curls too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fun tool.</li>
            <li>I recommend this curling iron to all the girls out there that want nice wavy curls that will last all day!</li>
            <li>Other wise i would recommend this to everyone, one of my friend has the enzo milano curling iron</li>
            <li>Not only was it easy to purchase but arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair which is extremely resistant to holding curls, but this iron does the trick beautifully.</li>
            <li>Have to get used to using this curling iron with no clamp, but it works good once you get a rhythm down.</li>
            <li>It gets hot very fast</li>
            <li>cuz well is my first curly iron..</li>
            <li>gets really hot really quickly-&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, its super fast and easy!</li>
            <li>Curls will hold until you wash your hair, and they look fabulous the first and second day!</li>
            <li>Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s Pink wats not to love</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It solved fast and I could receive</li>
            <li>hahaha 4.5 stars</li>
            <li>Easy to use and holds curl for a long time!</li>
            <li>You will burn yourself horribly if you don&#x27;t know how to use it... but watch some vids in youtube and those beautiful gurus will show you how! :)</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that usually loses a curl very fast- not anymore!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not a clumsy person.  </li>
            <li>It would take me 2 hours to style my hair using a normal curing iron with a clip.</li>
            <li>I did have a friend hairdresser tell me that I could simply get a really good curling iron and take off the lip, and at least it would have a covered tip for burn control.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind the size of rod that you want - the thinner rods make really tight curls and the larger rods are able to make looser curls.</li>
            <li>I love it, just be careful because it seriously gets really hot!</li>
            <li>If you have layered hair it helps to kind of twist as you wrap around the wand to hold down the little ends</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do my hole head (because I was to excited to see if it worked as well as other said ) only trying it</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and always super straight which could never hold a curl when I use a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>have natural curly hair... didn&#x27;t have the time to use it for a proper time...</li>
            <li>I have very thin fine straight hair</li>
            <li>Just your pretty little fingers.  </li>
            <li>When I first curl it, its a little too curly</li>
            <li>really well, this actually cut my time in half.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> really well, this actually cut my time in half.  </li>
            <li> It heats up pretty fast but the handle moves so that makes it difficult for me to tighten my hair around the wand.</li>
            <li> My curls last all day long and even stay put after being in the wind.  </li>
            <li> therefore I dont use it and have burnt myself pretty badly but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> but the thing will burn you I long hair</li>
            <li> I mean it curls fast</li>
            <li> Stays curled for very long time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair in order to style it.</li>
            <li> I know I sound crazy.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> Not exactly everywhere, but anywhere between my neck and my hand.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any other to compare...</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to were a robe, a big thick cotton one, when operating this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I had to be extremely cautious while using it because it will give you a burn to bring you to your knees!</li>
            <li> I can curl my hair to perfection in less then 30 min.</li>
            <li> ; if you dont wrap/hold the hair around the wand too tight.</li>
            <li> but now it takes me just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> With a little hairspray, of course!</li>
            <li> I use this product almost everyday!  </li>
            <li> It takes some time to learn how to use it by wrapping your around the iron, and you should use the glove to avoid burning yourself at least in the beginning.</li>
            <li> have thick hair that doesnt tend to hold- curls</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and stubborn to style.</li>
            <li> For a moment I thought i sent my stuff to the wrong place</li>

            <li> This Iron is very nice. It takes some time to learn how to use it by wrapping your around the iron, and you should use the glove to avoid burning yourself at least in the beginning. It makes nice soft curls in longer hair .</li>
            <li> If you are the girl who spirals her hair around her regular curling iron get this... Don&#x27;t think twice you will be happy.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works amazing I use it everyday, its super fast and easy! It gets hot very fast and it get very hot so be careful. Other wise i would recommend this to everyone, one of my friend has the enzo milano curling iron but this is cheaper and works better!</li>
            <li> This product it awesome! It is so quick, heats up incredibly fast and so easy to ude and the result is beautiful and lasts long. I would recommend this product to all my friends! I love it, just be careful because it seriously gets really hot! 5 stars though, great results and not kinks at the bottom like with regular curling irons.</li>
            <li> Incredible! Amazing! Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use (had to get the hang of it... a couple burns in the beginning... WEAR the glove!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such great curls. No one has ever told me I have nice hair... and now every time I use this I get compliments from strangers! That might not mean much to anyone else, but I&#x27;m very happy with this. I have fine, straight hair that usually loses a curl very fast- not anymore!</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my mother in law. I tested it to see if it works good I mean it curls fast but the thing will burn you I long hair and I burnt my shoulder and my neck idk if this product is the best for my mother in law... But I will see if she&#x27;ll be able to handle it.</li>
            <li> Absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair before, but this makes it so easy! I can curl my hair to perfection in less then 30 min. The curls always come out perfect!</li>
            <li> This curling rod is awesome - it heats up fast, gets really hot, and curls perfectly!  My curls last all day long and even stay put after being in the wind.  I would definitely recommend it.  Keep in mind the size of rod that you want - the thinner rods make really tight curls and the larger rods are able to make looser curls.</li>
            <li> Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that doesnt tend to hold- curls lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Iron gets really hot really quickly-&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Ok. I have mixed feelings about this item.  It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and it does it well.  My only gripe is that I&#x27;ve burned myself everywhere. Not exactly everywhere, but anywhere between my neck and my hand. Basically, my arms.  I have scars that are probably never going to go away, about 5 of them.  And I&#x27;m not a clumsy person.  I did have a friend hairdresser tell me that I could simply get a really good curling iron and take off the lip, and at least it would have a covered tip for burn control.  Good tip.  I might try it.  The gloves are nice, but you will likely not use them, and they do nothing for the neck and arm.  Just your pretty little fingers.  My recommendation is to were a robe, a big thick cotton one, when operating this curling iron.  You can get lots of different kind of curls too.  Waves, spiral... it&#x27;s a fun tool.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty fast but the handle moves so that makes it difficult for me to tighten my hair around the wand.</li>
            <li> Works great once you use it a few times and get the hang of it. Curls last all day and look great</li>
            <li> Just got this today and tryed it out. BEST thing I have ever used for my hair. My hair is really thick and stubborn to style. It would take me 2 hours to style my hair using a normal curing iron with a clip. And the curls would still not hold well even with hair spry. I tyed using this curling wand and only held my hair to it for 5 to 7 seconds and got perfect curls! Didn&#x27;t do my hole head (because I was to excited to see if it worked as well as other said ) only trying it but I can already tell it is AMAZING.Also its definetly one heck of a time saver LOL!Definetly going to curl my hair all the way tomorrow. &gt;(^.^)&lt; PS this review is for the LE Angelique 25/18 curling iron.</li>
            <li> This wand does great on my hair! When I first curl it, its a little too curly but it falls into place after a hour or so.  Stays curled for very long time.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost everyday!  Not only was it easy to purchase but arrived quickly! I also saved money purchasing this on Amazon, elsewhere these type of curling irons are well over $120.  I would definatly recommend this product and shopping on Amazon.  Thanks again! :)</li>
            <li> Love this wand!! It gets really hot really quick and my results always look salon worthy. and it&#x27;s Pink wats not to love</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron. My hair is thick and always super straight which could never hold a curl when I use a regular curling iron. My curls with the Le Angelique lasted the entire day even without hairspray! Also this curling iron gives your hair really nice curls that almost look wavy and natural. I recommend this curling iron to all the girls out there that want nice wavy curls that will last all day! &lt;3</li>
            <li> This is certainly the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used! I had to be extremely cautious while using it because it will give you a burn to bring you to your knees! I have two burns in the same spot on my left arm already! It&#x27;s great for really long hair. Mine is shoulder length, thinking I need one with a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> makes curling my hair so simple and quick!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to play around for awhile to figure out just how I will use it in my hair, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve found that it works best, and curls look most &amp;#34;natural/loose&amp;#34; if you dont wrap/hold the hair around the wand too tight.</li>
            <li> Curls really well, this actually cut my time in half.  It used to be such a project to curl my hair but now it takes me just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Does take some practice but once you have it down its a great look. This is the only thing that can get my hair to hold a curl. I have very thin fine straight hair and this is a great tool to give me alternative look. If you have layered hair it helps to kind of twist as you wrap around the wand to hold down the little ends so you don&#x27;t end up with good curls and straight tips. Unless that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for. Easy to use and holds curl for a long time! With a little hairspray, of course!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Very easy to use. I am not a fan of the glove because my hair clings to it ... therefore I dont use it and have burnt myself pretty badly but it was worth it. I know I sound crazy. This wand will make your hair look amazing and if your hair is like mine and wont hold curls to save your life, this is your life saver!!! I have received so many compliments on my hair and asked what I used. you will LOVE this</li>
            <li> Best curling iron i have ever owned! I have naturally wavy hair which is extremely resistant to holding curls, but this iron does the trick beautifully. Curls will hold until you wash your hair, and they look fabulous the first and second day! No hairspray required! Hair feels soft and looks shiny, and curls come out gorgeous and sexy. Works on all hair types, as i did prom hairdos with this curler and they came out stunning. A must have for every girl!</li>
            <li> Yam yam yam!!!! where to start! haha oh yeah the iron :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok So the service and shipping were excellent!!! For a moment I thought i sent my stuff to the wrong place *.* but Thank you! It solved fast and I could receive it.&lt;br /&gt;(overseas)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural curly hair... didn&#x27;t have the time to use it for a proper time... buuuut suddenly my fave straightener stop working!! mamma mia so what to do with this freaky hair? :P  and yesh this curly iron saved my life... You will burn yourself horribly if you don&#x27;t know how to use it... but watch some vids in youtube and those beautiful gurus will show you how! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curls are bouncy, shiny and smooth... last forever (maybe cuz my hair is curly?) i style my hair beautifully with it and right nowwwwwww gonna wash my head and do it again :P hahaha 4.5 stars cuz well is my first curly iron.. don&#x27;t have any other to compare... But I don&#x27;t regret the purchase. &amp;lt;3 thank yoo &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. I didn&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair in order to style it.</li>
            <li> This product is great</li>
            <li> Have to get used to using this curling iron with no clamp, but it works good once you get a rhythm down.</li>
