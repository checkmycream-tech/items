            <li>It is really good stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise good product</li>
            <li>Honestly, I just buying a full size bottle of bronzer to use on my face and a tingle for everywhere else gets the best results for me.</li>
            <li>I am a happy camper :-)</li>
            <li>, so most of it ends up on your face and not on the side of the bottle, lol.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>And it is priced way better than in the tanning salons!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My favorite face tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>I tried this moisturizer as soon as I got it and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and the tan is amazing</li>
            <li>This bronzer smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t break you out</li>
            <li>Its got a nice feel</li>
            <li>Smells nice, doesnt feel greasy, doesnt cause my face to burn while tanning.</li>
            <li>Does leave a nice bronze but</li>
            <li>it felt like applying silk to your face and felt like silky powder once applied which is nice</li>
            <li>i liked luminary face  and</li>
            <li>It did work well though giving the skin on my face a nice tan</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>It was nice having a lotion specifically for my face.  </li>
            <li>I tanned so quickly and it is a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it an A- for sure! :)</li>
            <li>It gives you a very nice tan quickly, and it firms and tones your skin as well.</li>
            <li>It works better than the amazing face I was using.  </li>
            <li>Very light in color.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...</li>
            <li>I use the Luminary Bronzer lotion, which is fabulous!</li>
            <li>my favorite is crystal faces</li>
            <li>, i haven&#x27;t bought crystal faces on line, i don&#x27;t really care for amazing face as good</li>
            <li>love this face tanner.</li>
            <li>and I love the lotion...</li>
            <li>and I love the smell</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love the luminary tanning lotion, my face is always the hardest part to tan.</li>
            <li>This could be good on the right person.</li>
            <li>I am still working on my tan, but so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>I have used this prouduct before, smells great and leaves your skin smooth with no weird smell lingering like some tanning lotions do.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love it..smells good and is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>so I have a more natural look, which is always great in my books.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on great, sinks right in and the results are beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love the luminary body tanning lotion, but prefer a light sunscreen based on my face.</li>
            <li>Just really love this lotion, tans great, the smell is awesome, and leaves my skin feeling so silky, BUT it is just too expensive, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The product had good ratings so my interest to buy this was high.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth, absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>i also bought that at the salon, so if your not feeling extravagant luminary face is really good,  but really australian gold crystal face is awesome and it lasts actually all the face lotions i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>The product is the size of my palm and they charged more than a full price bottle for it.</li>
            <li>(I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin), and it gives you this beautiful honey golden look.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t get this duo again, but it was fine.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth afterwards and I didn&#x27;t break out.  </li>
            <li>Feels smooth when you put it on</li>
            <li>it goes on so smooth and dosen&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and the way it glides on, the smell is nice also.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, leaves my face feeling soft, but I always wash it off after tanning.</li>
            <li>I received this and was so excited...</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more! :)</li>
            <li>I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week</li>
            <li>Does not make you breakout, keeps skin clear one of the best facial tanners ive used.</li>
            <li>It would be like buying Designer Skin lotions full price at the salon just because I have the money to blow, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling nice and soft, hydrated, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li>Makes my face sooo smooth, and I feel I&#x27;ve gotten much tanner with this on my face!</li>
            <li>Love this, keeps your face so soft</li>
            <li>For the price, I think it&#x27;s certainly worth it.</li>
            <li>I really have not been able to tell much of a difference using this on my face.</li>
            <li>it would b nice if it was bigger</li>
            <li>I may try another facial lotion (I&#x27;ve read some great reviews about Australian Gold&#x27;s Crystal Faces or I may just try the Saving Face,)</li>
            <li>But since its was designed for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;, then maybe it&#x27;s not such a good product after all.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so smooth and soft plus it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout</li>
            <li>Will definitely order again once this one runs out :)</li>
            <li>I loveeee this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my favorite facial tanner, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I got this product to try when I went tanning, I made sure I had a clean face and applied the product 20 minutes or a little more before I went tanning along with the regular tanning lotion, that way it would have time to set in.</li>
            <li>but this one is hands down my favorite one!</li>
            <li>The company shipped fast and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Goes on super soft from all the silicone</li>
            <li>The product works fine but doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the bottles</li>
            <li>Anyways, someone else wrote a review saying it took about a pea size drop to cover their whole face.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well with my face, however, i tried blending it into my neck and chest and it did not work ..</li>
            <li>the skin.great price and fast delivery.will buy again recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li>fast and even.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>It is very greasy and if you have acne prone skin</li>
            <li>The package was different and the light thing feel off when I opened it.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel very oily after awhile, and I don&#x27;t have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Works very well in the newest tanning beds.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>i was really upset that it was opened already</li>
            <li>I also do not have to use a whole lot.</li>
            <li>but i was very disappoined</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>but I can live with that!  </li>
            <li>I got a great even color in just two tanning sessions using only this product where other products did practically nothing through multiple tans!</li>
            <li>Love this Facial Tanning totally gives you color.</li>
            <li>its totally open..needs a proper top for dispensing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li>Which if you think about it, it counters the high price a bit.</li>
            <li>best thing is you only need a little tiny bit, maybe a pea size goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see paying $20 for something this small without some super special benefits.  </li>
            <li>Other than adding an alcohol based ingredient, fantastic product.</li>
            <li>this has been my favorite tanning lotion for as long as i can remember....will continue to use it as long as they make it</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Without it I am pale and I don&#x27;t get color easily.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial tanner because it makes my face soft and it leaves my cheeks glowing after I tan.</li>
            <li>Great but no top that allows for small amount out..</li>
            <li>when I took it to the salon and used it it smelled like regular lotion with no smell really.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and not once has this made my face break out.</li>
            <li>This product is NOT for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no problem using it.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and silky before and after.</li>
            <li>First too much always came out of the bottle and when the bottle got low it was very difficult to get the product out, and on top of that it wasnt very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I can see having to use this if you have seriously sensitive skin and break out with the regular tanning lotions on your face, but even then you may as well use the slightly cheaper and slightly larger bottle of Saving Face by Designer Skin (also available through Amazon,) which is also hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you like a little extra special something on your face during tanning.  </li>
            <li>I actually would use it withouth tanning because it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>and you are going to have one hot, dark body!  </li>
            <li>I also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture (didn&#x27;t have that normal silky texture like other designer skin body tanning lotions) and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a little larger than some of the petite women using these products, but it took about 3 pea size drops to cover my whole face.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really have not been able to tell much of a difference using this on my face.</li>
            <li> it would b nice if it was bigger</li>
            <li> I may try another facial lotion (I&#x27;ve read some great reviews about Australian Gold&#x27;s Crystal Faces or I may just try the Saving Face,)</li>
            <li> But since its was designed for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;, then maybe it&#x27;s not such a good product after all.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so smooth and soft plus it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout</li>
            <li> Will definitely order again once this one runs out :)</li>
            <li> I loveeee this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my favorite facial tanner, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try when I went tanning, I made sure I had a clean face and applied the product 20 minutes or a little more before I went tanning along with the regular tanning lotion, that way it would have time to set in.</li>
            <li> but this one is hands down my favorite one!</li>
            <li> The company shipped fast and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Goes on super soft from all the silicone</li>
            <li> The product works fine but doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the bottles</li>
            <li> Anyways, someone else wrote a review saying it took about a pea size drop to cover their whole face.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well with my face, however, i tried blending it into my neck and chest and it did not work ..</li>
            <li> the skin.great price and fast delivery.will buy again recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li> fast and even.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> It is very greasy and if you have acne prone skin</li>
            <li> The package was different and the light thing feel off when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel very oily after awhile, and I don&#x27;t have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Works very well in the newest tanning beds.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i was really upset that it was opened already</li>
            <li> I also do not have to use a whole lot.</li>
            <li> but i was very disappoined</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> but I can live with that!  </li>
            <li> I got a great even color in just two tanning sessions using only this product where other products did practically nothing through multiple tans!</li>
            <li> Love this Facial Tanning totally gives you color.</li>
            <li> its totally open..needs a proper top for dispensing&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> Which if you think about it, it counters the high price a bit.</li>
            <li> best thing is you only need a little tiny bit, maybe a pea size goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see paying $20 for something this small without some super special benefits.  </li>
            <li> Other than adding an alcohol based ingredient, fantastic product.</li>
            <li> this has been my favorite tanning lotion for as long as i can remember....will continue to use it as long as they make it</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Without it I am pale and I don&#x27;t get color easily.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial tanner because it makes my face soft and it leaves my cheeks glowing after I tan.</li>
            <li> Great but no top that allows for small amount out..</li>
            <li> when I took it to the salon and used it it smelled like regular lotion with no smell really.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and not once has this made my face break out.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no problem using it.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and silky before and after.</li>
            <li> First too much always came out of the bottle and when the bottle got low it was very difficult to get the product out, and on top of that it wasnt very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I can see having to use this if you have seriously sensitive skin and break out with the regular tanning lotions on your face, but even then you may as well use the slightly cheaper and slightly larger bottle of Saving Face by Designer Skin (also available through Amazon,) which is also hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you like a little extra special something on your face during tanning.  </li>
            <li> I actually would use it withouth tanning because it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> and you are going to have one hot, dark body!  </li>
            <li> I also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture (didn&#x27;t have that normal silky texture like other designer skin body tanning lotions) and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little larger than some of the petite women using these products, but it took about 3 pea size drops to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li> but my face got really tan, when it usually doesn&#x27;t tan</li>
            <li> This bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> And it makes my skin very soft, doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.  </li>
            <li> A little of this lotion goes along way, and one thing I really like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t runny like a lot of other face tanning lotions</li>
            <li> It feels very moisturizing and a little goes a long way so this small bottle will last a while!</li>
            <li> And didnt smell how my other one of this same product did and wasnt sealed!</li>
            <li> , it makes my face so dark just after a few visits and my face normally doesn&#x27;t tan.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this stuff and should last you quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this, not worth 20 dollars for the tiny bottle either.</li>
            <li> It will literally be white when my body is dark when using it for a month.</li>
            <li> A little bit definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use a different lotion for my body and my face and typically your body tans faster</li>
            <li> and I got absolutely no color from it</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive for what it is worth.</li>
            <li> But when I came across this facial tanning lotion a few months ago, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers are used to using schlock.</li>
            <li> This item came in packaging but looked nothing like my other Designer Skin product packaging.</li>
            <li> and my skin is very prone to breakouts if I use the wrong face lotion.</li>
            <li> Ordered on May 3rd in the late afternoon, and received it may 6th.</li>
            <li> So when I tan, my face doesn&#x27;t tan as well however the dark spots get ALOT darker.</li>
            <li> I would have gotten more color (and less glitter all over the place from the bloody bottle exterior) if I hadn&#x27;t used anything at all.</li>
            <li> and half of lotion was gone.&lt;br /&gt;someone</li>
            <li> Black label</li>
            <li> Bought it in conjunction with the Luminary 25x Black Label lotion.  </li>
            <li> even have the little spout that it squirts out of..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> heavy smell which is a plus when you&#x27;re putting a tanning lotion on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and I don&#x27;t feel my face &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it felt very tight afterwards.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would have to be that the scent is not great</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look dry, hasn&#x27;t broken out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually used whatever lotion I&#x27;m using that day except for tingles (I&#x27;ve yet to put a tingle lotion on my face.)  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what people are smelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it has helped darken my face in just a few tans!</li>
            <li> The bottle is fairly small, but I wanted to try it - just not at that price.</li>
            <li> should have checked twice when it was packing lotion even tho its small one.</li>
            <li> how small it was</li>
            <li> and I have a VERY pale complexion.</li>
            <li> Lemme tell you.. if you have a HARD TO TAN face, and want the color to match the color you have from your tan on your body.. get this.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible, the color is wrong,  the top was busted.</li>
            <li> I only gave it three stars because the smell is bad.</li>
            <li> Alcohol Denat can be irritating for some.</li>
            <li> I have used Saving Face and it was thin, and I felt like it was baking onto my skin bc</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my face did not get tanned at all.</li>
            <li> and it was a fake.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing...</li>
            <li> Also afraid this may make me break out.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed this time around...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it..smells good and is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Its got a nice feel but I didnt notice any \\&quot;OOMPH\\&quot; in my color/tanning results. I dont know if I like or dislike the fact that its unscented. I dont think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, doesnt feel greasy, doesnt cause my face to burn while tanning. I havent noticed any facial firming though...</li>
            <li> This product got my face tan after only 10 minutes on a level 3! I love it.  My skin felt smooth afterwards and I didn&#x27;t break out.  A little bit definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...I only see the results I want when using a bed called the Matrix (it&#x27;s one of those non-burn beds). I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week and I have a VERY pale complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this, keeps your face so soft and I havent burned at all since using it. Wont use anything else from now on</li>
            <li> Feels smooth when you put it on but I saw no difference color wise, and there was no firming. Honestly, I just buying a full size bottle of bronzer to use on my face and a tingle for everywhere else gets the best results for me. I&#x27;m switching back to doing that once I use this up. Thankfully I didnt buy this for salon price, I would have been pissed w/ no results.</li>
            <li> very good product for the price that we found it on amazon, It makes my wife smell like see just got home from the beach and the tan is amazing</li>
            <li> I use the Luminary Bronzer lotion, which is fabulous! So I decided to try this and will never use anything else, it makes my face so dark just after a few visits and my face normally doesn&#x27;t tan. I would definitely recommend this product and it arrived before the estimated delivery!</li>
            <li> Does leave a nice bronze but the smell&lt;br /&gt;Is terrible. It has the &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; smell</li>
            <li> Got here in a timely manner, everything was in order, but the packaging leaks sparkles EVERYWHERE. The product works fine but doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the bottles&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought from the salon.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion about a month or so ago and I use it every time I use the tanning booth. Lemme tell you.. if you have a HARD TO TAN face, and want the color to match the color you have from your tan on your body.. get this. It gives you a very nice tan quickly, and it firms and tones your skin as well. As soon as I apply it... my skin feels so smooth and soft plus it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout and my skin is very prone to breakouts if I use the wrong face lotion. I&#x27;d give it an A- for sure! :)</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are used to using schlock. Or they are on crack. Either way, my experience is that this product suuuu-uuu-uuucks. I would have gotten more color (and less glitter all over the place from the bloody bottle exterior) if I hadn&#x27;t used anything at all. Save your money!</li>
            <li> You see, I would expect that for $20 at 3.6 oz I would see an immediate improvement in my facial color especially when using it with a bed with facial bronzing bulbs.  I&#x27;ve usually used whatever lotion I&#x27;m using that day except for tingles (I&#x27;ve yet to put a tingle lotion on my face.)  Anyways, someone else wrote a review saying it took about a pea size drop to cover their whole face.  Maybe its because I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m a little larger than some of the petite women using these products, but it took about 3 pea size drops to cover my whole face.  I can see having to use this if you have seriously sensitive skin and break out with the regular tanning lotions on your face, but even then you may as well use the slightly cheaper and slightly larger bottle of Saving Face by Designer Skin (also available through Amazon,) which is also hypoallergenic.  I probably won&#x27;t be using this lotion again for this price.  I may try another facial lotion (I&#x27;ve read some great reviews about Australian Gold&#x27;s Crystal Faces or I may just try the Saving Face,) but I can&#x27;t see paying $20 for something this small without some super special benefits.  It would be like buying Designer Skin lotions full price at the salon just because I have the money to blow, in my opinion.  I&#x27;ll finish this bottle while using tingle lotions, but definitely won&#x27;t be paying for this facial tanning accelerator again.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion from my tanning salon when it came out. First too much always came out of the bottle and when the bottle got low it was very difficult to get the product out, and on top of that it wasnt very moisturizing it felt like applying silk to your face and felt like silky powder once applied which is nice but it was obviously just a silicone feeling and I got absolutely no color from it there was no difference what so ever from this product.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, smells great! Does not make you breakout, keeps skin clear one of the best facial tanners ive used.</li>
            <li> It worked very well with my face, however, i tried blending it into my neck and chest and it did not work .. but my face got really tan, when it usually doesn&#x27;t tan</li>
            <li> i liked luminary face  and the price was great  i bought it through amazon  about $16.00.  my favorite is crystal faces but i bought it at the salon and it was awesome, i haven&#x27;t bought crystal faces on line, i don&#x27;t really care for amazing face as good i also bought that at the salon, so if your not feeling extravagant luminary face is really good,  but really australian gold crystal face is awesome and it lasts actually all the face lotions i&#x27;ve tried lasts like 6 months it just the initial investment</li>
            <li> I received this and was so excited... when I took it to the salon and used it it smelled like regular lotion with no smell really. So I asked the manager of the salon and we compared it to the bottles they had there and it was totally different..not to mention this one didn;t even have the little spout that it squirts out of..it was just open so it would pour out.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion thinking it was going to be the best lotion out there. Extremely disappointing... If you open the lotion there is no smell at all so I&#x27;m not sure what people are smelling. I do not see any results at all and if you do its because your mind is playing games with you lolol. I use a different lotion for my body and my face and typically your body tans faster but my face is noticably paler than the rest. Don&#x27;t get this, not worth 20 dollars for the tiny bottle either.</li>
            <li> I am still working on my tan, but so far, so good!  And it makes my skin very soft, doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.  Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Just really love this lotion, tans great, the smell is awesome, and leaves my skin feeling so silky, BUT it is just too expensive, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This feels so good on you face.protect also firms the skin.great price and fast delivery.will buy again recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lovin this! Makes my face sooo smooth, and I feel I&#x27;ve gotten much tanner with this on my face! I have extremely sensitive skin and not once has this made my face break out. I also highly recommend the seller. Ordered on May 3rd in the late afternoon, and received it may 6th. WOW! Will definitely order again once this one runs out :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tans my face s fast and even. No break outs great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No heavy smell which is a plus when you&#x27;re putting a tanning lotion on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have!</li>
            <li> Does not streak or turn orange. Very light in color.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you like a little extra special something on your face during tanning.  It has lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  And it is priced way better than in the tanning salons!</li>
            <li> The product is the size of my palm and they charged more than a full price bottle for it. I got it weeks after I was supposed to which added unneeded stress to my wedding prep. I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It didnt tan me at all! And didnt smell how my other one of this same product did and wasnt sealed!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy or oily! I&#x27;ve noticed it has helped darken my face in just a few tans! I also like that it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I loveeee this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> Good lotion..goes on great..feels silky soft..good bronzing..BUTTTTT it has ALCOHOL DENAT? What the hell? This product is NOT for someone with sensitive skin. Alcohol Denat can be irritating for some. Other than adding an alcohol based ingredient, fantastic product. But since its was designed for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;, then maybe it&#x27;s not such a good product after all.</li>
            <li> love this face tanner. it goes on so smooth and dosen&#x27;t make me break out..best thing is you only need a little tiny bit, maybe a pea size goes a long way. I will have this face tanner forever before I run out.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle and it was wrapped in plastic. Lotion was everywhere....the bottle was ripped apart on the side. I had to discard it. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The product had good ratings so my interest to buy this was high. Unfortunately, my face did not get tanned at all. It is very greasy and if you have acne prone skin I do not recommend anyone buy this. This product is too expensive for what it is worth. It deserves a zero! Oh BTW when I got it shipped, there was no seal and it looked like it was used. When I called the store they said that&#x27;s how they sell their products.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2010 Desighner Luminary for face firming Bronzer facial tanning lotion. I love this product! I use it every day! The company shipped fast and it was exactly what I ordered. I am a happy camper :-)</li>
            <li> This item came in packaging but looked nothing like my other Designer Skin product packaging. I had used Luminary for a year and I love the lotion...it does a wonderful job and gives me color.  Without it I am pale and I don&#x27;t get color easily. However this product from this company didn&#x27;t seem the same. The package was different and the light thing feel off when I opened it. When I use it the lotion feels different and greasy..and doesn&#x27;t give me any color. Very disappointed this time around...</li>
            <li> Great price on amazon.  I think this stuff works best for me and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I actually would use it withouth tanning because it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this prouduct before, smells great and leaves your skin smooth with no weird smell lingering like some tanning lotions do. Tanning prouducts are so overpriced in the tanning salons. This is a great lotion would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t tan my face. Results may vary to others</li>
            <li> This works like the Luminary for the body. It doesn&#x27;t have the bronzer in it but it is that great silicone lotion. I tanned so quickly and it is a beautiful color. My face doesn&#x27;t look dry, hasn&#x27;t broken out. Purchase from Amazon like I did. Much cheaper than the salon. 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and the way it glides on, the smell is nice also.  But the next day after using it, I break out. It makes my face feel very oily after awhile, and I don&#x27;t have oily skin.  A little goes a long way too.  I&#x27;ve had this since the summer of 2010 and haven&#x27;t even used a fourth of it.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of tanning lotions designed for my face throughout the years but this one is hands down my favorite one! This bronzer smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t break you out (I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin), and it gives you this beautiful honey golden look. A little of this lotion goes along way, and one thing I really like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t runny like a lot of other face tanning lotions, so most of it ends up on your face and not on the side of the bottle, lol. With the color I achieve with this my neck and my face are the same color so I have a more natural look, which is always great in my books. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this to any skin type.  I have sensitive skin and had no problem using it.  The reusults were great!!</li>
            <li> Gives great color, perfect for sensitive or acne prone skin, and the skin care is awesome. My favorite face tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Smells good, leaves my face feeling soft, but I always wash it off after tanning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff. Just buy it. It&#x27;s like $16. And you get tan. Just do it.</li>
            <li> Luminary face and body are both great lotions. This stuff goes on great, sinks right in and the results are beautiful. It took 3 tanning sessions to get my face and neck to match my body</li>
            <li> I have always used Luminary as my tanning lotion and I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.  Great product</li>
            <li> Works very well in the newest tanning beds.  Made my face an even color. We recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I tried this moisturizer as soon as I got it and LOVE IT! It goes on very smooth, absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling. And this stuff smells wonderful!  I will definitely buy it again, I&#x27;m already hooked! It&#x27;s great to use after showering as well. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I saw this at my tanning salon for sale for $35. The bottle is fairly small, but I wanted to try it - just not at that price. I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and I don&#x27;t feel my face &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34; per say, but I do like the fact that I have a different lotion for my face than I have for my body. For the price, I think it&#x27;s certainly worth it. I also appreciate the way this product was packaged, it was wrapped in saran wrap to avoid spillage in shipping.</li>
            <li> i was really upset that it was opened already and half of lotion was gone.&lt;br /&gt;someone should have checked twice when it was packing lotion even tho its small one.</li>
            <li> This facial lotion tan my face in one session. I recommend only using this lotion once in a awhile not every time you tan. You will start to look like a racoon. Because this lotion is that good</li>
            <li> The lotion worked well on my face and it felt moisturizing. I got good color from it. I only gave it three stars because the smell is bad. It smells like a mixture between bleach and unscented hand lotion. I also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture (didn&#x27;t have that normal silky texture like other designer skin body tanning lotions) and it was a pain to get out of the bottle. It did work well though giving the skin on my face a nice tan</li>
            <li> I really like this facial tanner because it makes my face soft and it leaves my cheeks glowing after I tan. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite facial tanner, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> smaller bottle than I pictured.  BUT I have been using it and WOW!!! My face is darker!  It works better than the amazing face I was using.  It does smell like alcohol, but only initially.  After I tan the smell has faded.  I also do not have to use a whole lot. This bottle should last a long time. :)  Definitely buying more! :)</li>
            <li> Pair this face firming bronzer up with the Designer Skin Luminary 25x Black label and you are going to have one hot, dark body!  Leaves your skin feeling nice and soft, hydrated, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in my tanning bed and I love it! I got a great even color in just two tanning sessions using only this product where other products did practically nothing through multiple tans! My face seems to just tan with this product and not get red. It feels very moisturizing and a little goes a long way so this small bottle will last a while! My only complaint would have to be that the scent is not great but I can live with that!  Will definitely keep using this!</li>
            <li> Bought from Tan Like Me and it was a fake. It smells terrible, the color is wrong,  the top was busted.</li>
            <li> I really have not been able to tell much of a difference using this on my face. The product came in cracked from shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> this has been my favorite tanning lotion for as long as i can remember....will continue to use it as long as they make it</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I have used Saving Face and it was thin, and I felt like it was baking onto my skin bc it felt very tight afterwards. This is different. My skin felt soft and silky before and after. I bought it for a great price considering what it is in the salons. I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I love the luminary tanning lotion, my face is always the hardest part to tan. It will literally be white when my body is dark when using it for a month. I got this product to try when I went tanning, I made sure I had a clean face and applied the product 20 minutes or a little more before I went tanning along with the regular tanning lotion, that way it would have time to set in. Well, my face still did not tan with this product like I was hoping it would help boost the process some.</li>
            <li> Love this Facial Tanning totally gives you color. I have to switch out my facial tanning lotions cause sometimes my face will get use to one and just keep burning rather than getting tan and getting color ! This is one of 3 of my facial tanning lotions I keep on rotation !</li>
            <li> This could be good on the right person. I love the luminary body tanning lotion, but prefer a light sunscreen based on my face. Also afraid this may make me break out.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! So great for your face. Goes on super soft from all the silicone and you can actually see the firming and toning it does for you face. My face feels like it has definitely regained some tightness. And it gives really good color!!! I love designer skin products!! I can&#x27;t get enough of them!!</li>
            <li> I have a some hyperpigmentation on my face. So when I tan, my face doesn&#x27;t tan as well however the dark spots get ALOT darker. I even gave up tanning for a year for this reason! I tried several things. But when I came across this facial tanning lotion a few months ago, I decided to try it. That was the best thing I ever did! My face is now tanning evenly and the blotches aren&#x27;t getting darker!</li>
            <li> It was nice having a lotion specifically for my face.  Bought it in conjunction with the Luminary 25x Black Label lotion.  Won&#x27;t get this duo again, but it was fine.</li>
            <li> i like this but i was very disappoined how small it was i payed 26.00 dollars for this. it would b nice if it was bigger</li>
            <li> It is really good stuff. It&#x27;s also a little on the pricey side. A little bit goes a long way with this stuff and should last you quite a long time. Which if you think about it, it counters the high price a bit.</li>
            <li> Great but no top that allows for small amount out..its totally open..needs a proper top for dispensing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise good product</li>
