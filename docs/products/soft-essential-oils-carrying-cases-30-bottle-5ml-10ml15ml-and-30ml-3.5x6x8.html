            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>its holding up nicely</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t move it around, but the liner seems very secure and the bottles stay put.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality, convienance, and protection that it provides for my oils.</li>
            <li>All my oils fit snugly and safely for air travel (checked luggage)</li>

            <li>Either way, this will be a great starter case as I get into Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>i filled it up and can&#x27;t fit all my oils.</li>
            <li>I can now alphabetize  Blends next to single oils; the case almost couldn&#x27;t be more perfect!  </li>
            <li>They followed up with me via email to assure it was what i expected and that I was happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have it full &amp; it holds up well</li>

            <li>Shipping was extremely fast!  </li>
            <li>love this product, but would recommend a different shipping method.&lt;br /&gt;where</li>
            <li>What I like most about this bag is that it holds the NOW 1oz oils that I buy at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li>you definitely are not going to be able to fill the whole case with 15mL bottles--it will have to be a mix of 15mL and 5mL.  </li>
            <li>The bottom of the case has a large pocket to carry any oil equipment you may need.</li>
            <li>It has 30 slots for your oils, and is very well padded to keep them protected.</li>
            <li>Well padded and just right for carrying around your essential oils.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is more or less what I expected based on the comments.  </li>
            <li>Lots of room and soft with a handle!</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Really like the oil carrier, especially for when I travel.  </li>
            <li>I have three of these and have highly recommended them to my friends who use essential oils.</li>
            <li>This case zips closed and has a very convienent carrying handle.  </li>
            <li>The zipper has a small mishap but it still zips open and closed rather easily.</li>
            <li>depth of the carrier which nicely handles taller Doterra Blends like InTune, Immortelle and Past Tense.</li>

            <li> I give this 5 stars. Absolutely LOVE this case! It holds my 5 and 15 ml bottles as well as the roll ons.  It&#x27;s sturdy and practical.  I have three of these and have highly recommended them to my friends who use essential oils.</li>
            <li> Soft, easy carry design. It is best for storing a variety of bottle sizes; 5, 10, &amp; 15 ml. I have it full &amp; it holds up well</li>
            <li> Exactly what I thought I was getting! Quality stitched!  All my oils fit snugly and safely for air travel (checked luggage)</li>
            <li> Very nice. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I have 5 ml and 15 ml bottles in this case and all fit easily.  The case stays on my bathroom vanity and I don&#x27;t move it around, but the liner seems very secure and the bottles stay put.  I would definitely recommend this case.</li>
            <li> This one is much larger than my previous case. I did not expect it to be but I was pleasantly surprised. I have some 30 ml bottles that fit perfectly in this bag! Love it!</li>
            <li> its holding up nicely</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is more or less what I expected based on the comments.  The comments were true:  you definitely are not going to be able to fill the whole case with 15mL bottles--it will have to be a mix of 15mL and 5mL.  Either way, this will be a great starter case as I get into Essential Oils.  Shipping was extremely fast!  I ordered on a Friday and received it on the next Monday.  They followed up with me via email to assure it was what i expected and that I was happy with the purchase.  My only complaint:  The fabric isn&#x27;t as durable as I thought it would be for the price they are asking.  It&#x27;s a very thin Fleece (?) or something similar, so if this is to be used as a travel case, you may end up with snags or holes with regular wear and tear.  Overall, I would recommend this company.</li>
            <li> love this product, but would recommend a different shipping method.&lt;br /&gt;where the product isn&#x27;t smashed together</li>
            <li> The zipper is misaligned and so I can&#x27;t fully close it.  Neither of my other two similar ones has that problem.</li>
            <li> The zipper has a small mishap but it still zips open and closed rather easily. What I like most about this bag is that it holds the NOW 1oz oils that I buy at the local grocery store. I have recommended this bag to my other oil-loving friends/family.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this for my essential oils and so glad I did.  Fits a variety of size bottles and keeps the bottles separate and in place.</li>
            <li> Just as described!  Perfect!</li>
            <li> love it! later i will order another. i filled it up and can&#x27;t fit all my oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO happy with this product! (Will order a third carrier today). The case  accomodates shorter Doterra (5 ml.) right beside tall (4&amp;#34;)  Doterra Blends! (Just visially raise short bottles with cotton ball) The padding is sumptuous enough to support and hold  shorter 5 ml . bottles at the same height as 15 ml. bottles so  smaller 5 ml. bottles won&#x27;t  get visually lost at the bottom of carrier display.  Keeping uniformity of bottle lid heights creates an attractive display. I&#x27;m  also VERY happy for  the 5&amp;#34; depth of the carrier which nicely handles taller Doterra Blends like InTune, Immortelle and Past Tense. I know this may seem ridiculous to care about,  but  visually attractive  presentation for various sized bottles is important to many oil enthusiasts. I can now alphabetize  Blends next to single oils; the case almost couldn&#x27;t be more perfect!  Recommendation? A shoulder strap option would be great!</li>
            <li> Very nice for carrying oils!  Lots of room and soft with a handle!</li>
            <li> Really like the oil carrier, especially for when I travel.  It keeps all my oil bottles upright so there is no chance of them leaking.</li>
            <li> Well padded and just right for carrying around your essential oils. Not too big, but big enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had it two weeks and the zipper broke. So now I have an open case with no top to it to zip up.</li>
            <li> This case is very practical and easy to use. It has 30 slots for your oils, and is very well padded to keep them protected. This case zips closed and has a very convienent carrying handle.  The bottom of the case has a large pocket to carry any oil equipment you may need. I carry my case with me everywhere I go! I love the quality, convienance, and protection that it provides for my oils.</li>
