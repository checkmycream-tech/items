            <li> Excellent price and love this product!</li>
            <li> I gave this set as a gift to my mother and to my boyfriend&#x27;s mother for Christmas.  This was my boyfriend&#x27;s mother&#x27;s second set since she loved the scent so much.  She used the lotion in under a month! My mother loves it too and already got compliment on the scent from a co-worker :)</li>
            <li> Received product quickly. Love it. My only wish is that the lotion is in a pump instead of squeeze tube.</li>

            <li> Fragrances seemed diminished. Not what I received as a gift. Old stock?</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful ocean breeze sent without being overpowering. It has been a signature fragrance for me for awhile, I continue to receive compliments and inquiries on how to find it. I have also gifted inis a number of times, back before Amazon when it was much more hard to find in the US market.</li>
            <li> Could not ask for more!  I was tickled about the Inis Energy of the Sea Trio.  It was well worthvthe money.</li>
            <li> Great, clean smelling fragrance.  I get many compliments every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Want to order more for my daughter for Christmas before uses all of mine up.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing scent, you&#x27;ll feel the wild Irish coast ocean when you wear this.</li>
            <li> This fragrance was recommended to me.  I bought it as a gift for my wife, who is Irish.  It is fresh and feminine and subtle.  The buying experience was excellent.  Men, if you&#x27;re lookingfor a fragrance for your girl, Irish or not, you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> A wonderful fragrance, crisp and clean -- and this set includes smaller versions of the shower gel and body cream, a big plus and a great price!</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandmother for christmas,and HOLY CRAPOLI does it smell awesome! I didn&#x27;t even open the box...you can smell this oceany and beautiful scent right through the box. When she told me about this Inis brand,I knew I&#x27;d like it,too...looks like I&#x27;m getting myself one of these,or something similar as well. Well-worth the money many times over so far.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance- it is my signature scent- very fresh.  I purchased this size for traveling.  It is not too small for a couple of weeks of use- but not too big for packing!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this smell! Get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is the best of any I know, no matter what price you are talking about.  Light, refreshing, yet sexy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lady for whom I gave this as a Christmas gift just loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find any of these &amp;#34;Inis&amp;#34; products, I was so happy to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance!!!  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it!!!</li>
            <li> consider it my signature scent. not too sweet or flowery. I get a lot of compliments when I walk by</li>
            <li> Tried Inis twice before purchasing. Both times the scent lasted till the next day. Unfortunately this lasted only 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with the spray but the lotion and body wash were a pleasant addition. I&#x27;m sensitive to many fragrances but this is light enough for every day</li>
            <li> My new summer fragrance - I just love this clean, fresh scent.  It does remind me of time spent at the ocean!  If you want a very light summer fragrance this is it.  I would recommend the set so you can layer the products so the scent lasts longer!  Love it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and clean. I really like wearing it in the spring. It is strong so I mist it into the air and walk into the mist or I squirt it in the palms of my hands and gently dab it on very lightly and it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clean scent.  To me, the shower gel seems stronger in scent than the cologne.  The shower gel smells a bit more manly to me, but all could be used by male or female.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my Niece by request but I can say I liked the fragrance</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and people around me like it too.</li>
            <li> My wife spent several weeks wandering around the Irish Countryside.  This scent makes her feel like she is right back there.  And I like it on her too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful set - a great gift for any occasion!</li>
            <li> Great value for this product.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  Definitely worth the price I paid.</li>
