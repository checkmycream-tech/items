            <li>I really liked this product</li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth, shine, good smell and no frizz.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put a shower cap,over your head after you put it in your hair.</li>
            <li>You will love how your hair looks, feels and smells.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make the tip of my hair looking more healthy or anything.</li>
            <li>I just love the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you buy the Beauty Elixir, its even better.</li>
            <li>I really love this product</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love the oil, so I ordered the shampoo &amp; mask despite the hefty price tag.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Is not my favorite product, but it is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I heard so may good things about it that I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with highlights</li>
            <li>Orofluido left my hair smooth, silky, detangled, and smelling great with out a build up feeling.</li>
            <li>Love this mask for my hair it makes it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super oily, which is nice because it doesnt stain the bed or anything like such.</li>
            <li>I recomand this mask to everyone who has dry and thin hair, veryyyyy good mask, I use it about 3 years, and very happy with it</li>
            <li>My jar from amazon came from the UK, but it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Take a pea size (or more for thicker longer hair) and rub in hands and apply to dry hair!</li>
            <li>This product is really gold in my hair.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this mask and the elixir, used a clarifying shampoo, and my hair got much</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really exited to try this mask</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li>It definitely is worth the purchase considering that its a pretty big packaging.</li>
            <li>This stuff workers very well on permed, colored and high lighted hair.</li>
            <li>This mask contains a lot of silicone, which at first made my hair soft, but with the time added buildup to my hair like I never had before.</li>
            <li>My hair were dull and started to break very easily.</li>
            <li>Also, a little goes a long way, so it should last a good few months even if you use it twice a week :)</li>
            <li>As a licensed professional, I like to use this mask on EVERYONE!</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel revitalized, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>packaging is cool, and the consistency is creamy but not too thick.</li>
            <li>The best way to use it is by taking a quarter size of the mask (depending on how thick or thin your hair is) and adding a little bit of the oil to the mask, and leaving it on for as long as you can.</li>
            <li>This hair mask makes my blonde dry highlighted hair so soft, silky and shiney.</li>

            <li> This hair mask makes my blonde dry highlighted hair so soft, silky and shiney.</li>
            <li> Yes my hair were soft, but they hare with other conditioner or mask as well</li>
            <li> , I match it with the elixir and the shine spray and with my long thick hair it feels light and not bogged down with product!!</li>
            <li> Mix a little of the Orofluido oil into the mask, cover your hair with a plastic cap, and wait an hour (or sleep in it overnight) and WOW!</li>
            <li> No your hair will not look like it had a Silikone treatment but made my thick and long hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> yes, I said dry hair.</li>
            <li> Thinner formula then I expected it to be, smells like vanilla with a touch of amber.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave it overnight, and wash it off the next day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> weighed down hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, your hair will absorb it and you won&#x27;t have heavy</li>
            <li> The consistency is not too thick nor too watery.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this orofluido mask didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair that an other conditioner wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail with a broken bottle &amp; cap, so I had to scrape it up &amp; put it in another container.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really not impressed by the result.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but trust!</li>
            <li> after using this mask for a while, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> BEST HAIR CAIR PRODUCT/CONDITIONER-AMAZING SMELL</li>
            <li> Thinner formula then I expected it to be, smells like vanilla with a touch of amber.  Orofluido left my hair smooth, silky, detangled, and smelling great with out a build up feeling. Will last me a bit longer then the comparable Moroccan oils mask since it spread a lot easier.  My jar from amazon came from the UK, but it was worth the wait and I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> This hair mask makes my blonde dry highlighted hair so soft, silky and shiney. Smells wonderful and makes my hair so touchable and bouncy. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this mask for my hair it makes it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I recomand this mask to everyone who has dry and thin hair, veryyyyy good mask, I use it about 3 years, and very happy with it</li>
            <li> Awesome just reordered!</li>
            <li> Great mask and I love the smell of Orofluido products. No your hair will not look like it had a Silikone treatment but made my thick and long hair very manageable. Left it in over night.</li>
            <li> This product is really gold in my hair. I just loved and indicate. My hair is so smooth, shine, good smell and no frizz.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner</li>
            <li> NICE MASK, helps moisturize hair</li>
            <li> This stuff workers very well on permed, colored and high lighted hair. Makes your hair feel revitalized, soft and shiny.  Worth the money.  Be sure to put a shower cap,over your head after you put it in your hair. Wear about 10 minutes.  You will love how your hair looks, feels and smells.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Do the hair treatment and sometimes I use it as my daily hair conditioner if I feel my hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;Worth to try.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: after using this mask for a while, I&#x27;m very disappointed. I heard so may good things about it that I had high expectations. This mask contains a lot of silicone, which at first made my hair soft, but with the time added buildup to my hair like I never had before. My hair were dull and started to break very easily. I stopped using this mask and the elixir, used a clarifying shampoo, and my hair got much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really exited to try this mask but unfortunately this orofluido mask didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair that an other conditioner wouldn&#x27;t. Yes my hair were soft, but they hare with other conditioner or mask as well and the results doesn&#x27;t last. It didn&#x27;t make the tip of my hair looking more healthy or anything. I am using this mask with the Orofluido elexir oil and I&#x27;m really not impressed by the result. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist. I just love the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, way better than the Moroccan Oil. If you use a lot, it might get greasy, so use a moderate amount on your tips. This seller even sent a sample mask, which is always a plus. I would recommend you buy the Beauty Elixir, its even better.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders in your hair. I worked in a salon that used this product, and our clients absolutely loved it!!! The consistency is not too thick nor too watery. The best way to use it is by taking a quarter size of the mask (depending on how thick or thin your hair is) and adding a little bit of the oil to the mask, and leaving it on for as long as you can. I usually leave it overnight, and wash it off the next day. It isn&#x27;t super oily, which is nice because it doesnt stain the bed or anything like such. It definitely is worth the purchase considering that its a pretty big packaging. Also, a little goes a long way, so it should last a good few months even if you use it twice a week :)</li>
            <li> I really love this product</li>
            <li> Love this. Great deep condition mask, and I took someone elses advice and used a dab as a leave in and my hair is feeling awesome!! Smells wonderful, I match it with the elixir and the shine spray and with my long thick hair it feels light and not bogged down with product!! Love!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product</li>
            <li> The scent of everything in this line is amazing - I bought this because of that. Its basically conditioner and not a life changing one at that...won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the oil, so I ordered the shampoo &amp; mask despite the hefty price tag. This is no deep conditioner. It came in the mail with a broken bottle &amp; cap, so I had to scrape it up &amp; put it in another container. I know deep conditioners being a hairstylist. This ain&#x27;t it, folks. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair smell!!!</li>
            <li> love it.  the smell and the way my hair feels with this product is great.  It makes my hair smell wonderful, and gives it great texture.  One of the best conditioners I ever had.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with highlights and I think it works for me. Is not my favorite product, but it is good.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t follow the instructions, they recommend leave it on for 5 minutes but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference on my hair. It works when I leave it for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, Ease to use, Great!!</li>
            <li> Ok, Glamazons, here&#x27;s my review.....HALLELUJAH! (cue the Angels singing) lol, seriously, I love this mask! BOOM! As a licensed professional, I like to use this mask on EVERYONE! Yes, everyone. Mix a little of the Orofluido oil into the mask, cover your hair with a plastic cap, and wait an hour (or sleep in it overnight) and WOW! Beautiful. Here&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t told anyone, until now....... Take a pea size (or more for thicker longer hair) and rub in hands and apply to dry hair! yes, I said dry hair. In about 5 min. your hair will absorb the mask and feel amazing! Yes, your hair will absorb it and you won&#x27;t have heavy weighed down hair. I know it sounds crazy, but trust! It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro, Owner of Glamour Couture</li>
