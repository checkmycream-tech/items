            <li>This product has a one of a kind fragrance.</li>
            <li>This classic and elegant fragrance is perfect for any occasion -</li>
            <li>the smell is very mild and nice to smell</li>
            <li>but it is worth it to buy from a dept store with a good return policy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this perfume for almost 20 years and still love</li>
            <li>My favorite scent, that reminds me of my grandmother.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 15 years and still love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>my moms favorite.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for many years and can&#x27;t find anything to compare.</li>
            <li>I love how refreshing it smells.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>It is light and beautiful and smells like real Lilly of the valley flowers.</li>
            <li>I do really love this original scent though.</li>
            <li>A scent that is easily identified and never forgotten.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if it is real because it made me sneeze and feel itchy</li>
            <li>I was so happy to get a larger size bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li>Light and feminine.</li>
            <li>Love this scent..light and airy and very girly.  :)</li>
            <li>It is light, flowery but not too sweet, not too heavy and perfect for daytime.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it soooo easy to order!</li>
            <li>This perfume spray contains the perfect mixture of flowers so that it does not have a heavy but fresh, spring fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I wear it with my fancy clothes or when I&#x27;m wanting to feel special and feminine as I&#x27;m running errands.  </li>
            <li>but this one  doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same strength as what I buy at the department store but still good.</li>
            <li>recieved quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the initial scent and feel like I&#x27;m starting the day with a pleasant introduction to others instead of an onslaught of overpowering fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the discounted price it&#x27;s probably worth it</li>
            <li>I was married in a Jessica Mcclintock dress but don&#x27;t let that prejudice get in the way of this review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is one of my favorite daily fragrances.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of Jessica products is the only one that my wife has used that I really enjoy!</li>
            <li>This has been her favorite fragrance for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same perfume for 35 years - I love the sweet soft smell.</li>
            <li>I wanted this parfum for a long time I really love it</li>
            <li>Wow, this is difficult to find, so was delighted to be able to order it online for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but I seem to have to put twice as much on.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used this perfume for awhile and really missed the scent.  </li>
            <li>I just love this perfume~~I hope I can still purchase it in the near future!</li>
            <li>A very pretty bottle too with the classic white floral topper.  </li>
            <li>I have always worn and loved this fragrance but the bottle that I recieved wasnt packaged in plastic and seems to almost be watered down a little.</li>
            <li>Did not meet my expectation because the scent is very week and does not last after you put it on.</li>
            <li>I am not much of a synthetic scent woman I have to admit, I much prefer natural scents.</li>
            <li>May buy my next bottle from department store just to see if there really is any difference, if not, will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li>My husband is going wild when he smells it at the end of a long day at work.</li>

            <li> Best fragrance ever made..</li>
            <li> Quality was very poor. Was not the same quality as before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same perfume for 35 years - I love the sweet soft smell.</li>
            <li> My perfume did not smell like it does in the store. I thought I was getting a deal but it is worth it to buy from a dept store with a good return policy.  I am disappointed. I am not much of a synthetic scent woman I have to admit, I much prefer natural scents. I do really love this original scent though. But be warned, if you are unhappy with your purchase they will not give you a refund, only 10% of your purchase. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if it is real because it made me sneeze and feel itchy so it&#x27;s your choice...</li>
            <li> I was married in a Jessica Mcclintock dress but don&#x27;t let that prejudice get in the way of this review. I&#x27;ve used this perfume for almost 20 years and still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of my favorite daily fragrances. It is light, flowery but not too sweet, not too heavy and perfect for daytime. I get compliments on it constantly even though I can&#x27;t smell it on myself. I love the initial scent and feel like I&#x27;m starting the day with a pleasant introduction to others instead of an onslaught of overpowering fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a daily use, casual scent.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectation because the scent is very week and does not last after you put it on.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, that reminds me of my grandmother. This classic and elegant fragrance is perfect for any occasion - I wear it with my fancy clothes or when I&#x27;m wanting to feel special and feminine as I&#x27;m running errands.  A very pretty bottle too with the classic white floral topper.  I&#x27;ll keep wearing this scent for years to come.  It&#x27;s one of my several standbys.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 15 years and still love the fragrance. Would recommend this product to anyone who loves flowers.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Jessica products, therefore so do I. The fragrance of Jessica products is the only one that my wife has used that I really enjoy!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get a larger size bottle for the price.  They wrapped it well and it arrived quickly in great condition.</li>
            <li> An excellent scent. Light and feminine. A scent that is easily identified and never forgotten. I notice this scent every time I smell it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PERFUME  AND A EXCELLENT PRICE!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted this parfum for a long time I really love it the smell is very mild and nice to smell</li>
            <li> Bought  this as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law.  This has been her favorite fragrance for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and feel incomplete w/out it! Thanks for making it soooo easy to order! I never run out now!!</li>
            <li> searched everywhere for the best price for this perfume.  my moms favorite.  very satisfied.  recieved quickly.  would def go through this site again.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is difficult to find, so was delighted to be able to order it online for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This perfume is simply beautiful on. My husband is going wild when he smells it at the end of a long day at work. It makes me feel feminine and beautiful. Thank you for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this scent..light and airy and very girly.  :)</li>
            <li> Jessica is the only perfume I use. Have been using it for many years and can&#x27;t find anything to compare. Could be my imagination but this one  doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same strength as what I buy at the department store but still good. May buy my next bottle from department store just to see if there really is any difference, if not, will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I have always worn and loved this fragrance but the bottle that I recieved wasnt packaged in plastic and seems to almost be watered down a little. I&#x27;m going to order from another vendor and see if it&#x27;s just me or if it is indeed a little weaker. It still smells good but I seem to have to put twice as much on. For the discounted price it&#x27;s probably worth it but I was just slightly dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume; along with my mother and aunts, for years! It is light and beautiful and smells like real Lilly of the valley flowers.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume~~I hope I can still purchase it in the near future!</li>
            <li> This perfume spray contains the perfect mixture of flowers so that it does not have a heavy but fresh, spring fragrance.  Everywhere I go people ask me what perfume I am wearing.  A few sprays in the morning last all day.  I will not wear anything else.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I love how refreshing it smells. This product has a one of a kind fragrance.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this perfume for awhile and really missed the scent.  It is really long lasting and I get so many compliments on it.</li>
