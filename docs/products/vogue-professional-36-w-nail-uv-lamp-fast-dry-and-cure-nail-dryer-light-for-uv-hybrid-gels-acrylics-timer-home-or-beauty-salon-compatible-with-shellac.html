            <li> Both these for a manny peddy themed birthday party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the little girls at the party were very disappointed, especially the birthday girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo to the company selling these crap units.</li>
            <li> Work great with my gels to keep my nails strong</li>
            <li> I have paid over a hundred dollars for a UV light that didnt work half as good as this one. It arrived ahead of schedule, had easy to understand instructions, and works great. I also love how you can set the timer to 90 or 120 seconds, or you can turn the timer off and the lights will stay on.</li>
            <li> was super excited , however one of the bulb broke and one socket had an old bottom piece from bulb stuck in socket</li>
            <li> I use regular nail polish instead of the opi  and it looks like I just step out of the nail salon!!!!!!.  I am not a professional manicurist but you can not tell by looking. okay?</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and work great!  Cures all my hard gels and gel polishes from Lina brand to Amorus, OPI Axxium, fingerpraints, kiara sky and gelish</li>
            <li> This did not work at all. I have to send it back. please do not waste your time. buy another one!</li>
            <li> It worked great at first but after only about 10 uses the bulbs are weak and it take 2-3 times longer to cure the polish.  I ordered a different one with stronger wattage.</li>
            <li> This is a total piece of junk. When mine arrived only two of the four bulbs worked switching bulbs around trying to figure out if it was the unit or the bulb, one of the bulbs just fell apart in my hand. Turns out it wasn&#x27;t just the bulbs, it was the sockets as well. So only two of the four function or not.</li>
            <li> It works great and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so I could do my own gel nails.  I love it.  Works great &amp; can do my nails in the comfort of my own home.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in doing their own nails!</li>
            <li> I bought this so I can do my own glitter toes at home. It looks and works great! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great size. Works well. I removed the bottom reflector tray. It seems to make your gel polish easier to remove when it is not cured from the top and the bottom.</li>
            <li> This Item not work at all i want my money back...</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time but did not work. It was quicker for me to repair item then it was not to have it as gift for Christmas ontime..&lt;br /&gt;It could have been damaged at factory and overlooked but once repaired it does as expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick. But I had to return this product bc the bulbs didn&#x27;t light up all at once and when I barely wiggled them they came apart.</li>
            <li> Cured my nails well, dropped it once from my desk and it stopped working had to buy another. Not durable at all</li>
            <li> I love this light! It works very well for doing my nails at home. Would definatley recommend.</li>
            <li> this product worked for a few weeks then stopped working all together, It stopped curing my nails an seemed as if it had a short in the cord. not worth buying again. doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> When I considered buying this product, I was a bit deterred by the negative reviews. However, I&#x27;ve had it for several months now without any problems. I&#x27;ve used it to cure my cnd shellac and it works great. The installation of the bulbs was extremely easy and I never had a problem with them falling out. The sliding tray is also fine, though I&#x27;ve never tried gel on my toes. If you want a good lamp at a reasonable cost, get this one. I honestly don&#x27;t understand why so many people didn&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li> My dad got everything this and It works best I love the timer it has and helps me know when it&#x27;s ready</li>
            <li> This did not work at all.  I have to send it back.  I am not a fan of items that do not work at all.  I don&#x27;t want a replacement.  Based on other reviews, in addition to my personal experience, they probably have an overall  quality control issue.</li>
            <li> It could be me but is the lamp suppose to burn your hand? other than that it works fine. it drys quickly with regular polish i have yet to try uv polish</li>
            <li> Bought  as a gift  for  girlfriend  she loves it  uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> The light bulbs kept falling out when I was trying to use it. Then a burning smell like wires melting started coming from the unit. You get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> when received the pullout tray was missing and two of the four lights did not work. Since I am using it for a different purpose I kept it.</li>
            <li> Very fast very smooth transaction great product love it</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister in law and she said it was good and that she liked it so I got another one for my mother in law. So far haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so I guess its going well.</li>
            <li> I love this UV light. I&#x27;ve used many expensive professional brand name lights over the years and this one works just as well as a $200 ones. My nails are happy :)</li>
            <li> Works ok not amazing but good for the price</li>
            <li> I paid for a new one and I got garbage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I didn&#x27;t like it because it was used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would I recomen</li>
            <li> Delivered was fast and good product.</li>
            <li> Price was right, came in two days and no detections .. love it thanks!!</li>
            <li> it takes way more than expected to dry the polish... plus is HUGE</li>
