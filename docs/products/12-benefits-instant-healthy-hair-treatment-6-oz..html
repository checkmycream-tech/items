            <li>This is by far the best leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels after using this.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo, then condition, then put in some of this magic and go on your merry way.</li>

            <li>I ordered it and truly love the product and will order again.</li>

            <li>Same great product for 1/3 the cost, really keeps my hair soft &amp; works better than detangler.</li>
            <li>Was eye-ing another product to try and compare to this, but the other one is no longer available, so I guess that makes me a happy, captive audience.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth, soft, smelling great, and the texture is just unbelievable.</li>
            <li>I use this every day and love it...just could not find a place to buy it locally so ordered it online.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll admit, the first time I ordered this from Amazon</li>
            <li>I got the regular size on Amazon and am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Keeping my hair healthy even with blow drying and flat iron use.</li>
            <li>I buy it here rather than at the salon as they have too much mark up on their products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I was iffy about it because you never know if your gonna really get the real product or</li>
            <li>It works really well for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Initially, after applying to my hair hair liberally, I was sure my hair would be greasy and gross.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for any hair type.</li>
            <li>It  smells amazing and it does detangle my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>love this product line,  have used for a few years</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair amazingly soft and keeps me from getting split ends!</li>
            <li>Just too much for a small bottle of goo, but I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my 2 1/2 year old.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised after I blew dry it.  </li>
            <li>i have thin fine hair.</li>

            <li> Great stuff. Keeping my hair healthy even with blow drying and flat iron use. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have a wonderful hair dresser and she is the person who introduced me to this wonderful product.  I have very thick slightly wavy hair.  I use this after shampooing and conditioning my hair.  My hair is on the dry side and so thick I have no problem layering moisturizing products.  If I style my hair with my heat curling brush,  I spray this on to protect my hair from the heat.  I love how my hair feels after using this.  I buy it here rather than at the salon as they have too much mark up on their products.  Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> smells great and leaves my hair so soft. i have thin fine hair. only reason for 4stars is because after a few weeks noticed that it was leaving buidup. nothing a clarifying shampoo cant fix</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product! I never go a day without using it. Untangles my hair really well after a shower &amp; smells great!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product- my hairdresser suggested I use this and it works wonders- I use throughout the day- just spritz on and work into the ends of my hair- never have split ends-</li>
            <li> I use this every day and love it...just could not find a place to buy it locally so ordered it online. The price is the same as I used to find it at my salon, when they did offer it.</li>
            <li> A great product, especially as an all in one. Shampoo, then condition, then put in some of this magic and go on your merry way. Leaves my hair smooth, soft, smelling great, and the texture is just unbelievable. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this five stars is the price. Just too much for a small bottle of goo, but I will be back for more. Was eye-ing another product to try and compare to this, but the other one is no longer available, so I guess that makes me a happy, captive audience.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! What else is there to say? Finally a product that does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> My aunt has done my hair before in her salon she owns before and she gave me some of this stuff to take home and use because my hair is a mess when it&#x27;s wet after a shower and let me tell you... THIS IS THE BEST DETANGLER EVER. I&#x27;m on my second order of this from Amazon and I&#x27;ll admit, the first time I ordered this from Amazon I was iffy about it because you never know if your gonna really get the real product or some rip off product but this literally saves my hairs life. It keeps my hair amazingly soft and keeps me from getting split ends!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser. I have never looked back...terrific product!!! Keeps my hair in top shape. Highly recommend for any hair type.</li>
            <li> Did not like price at beauty salon, hence the purchase on amazon.  Same great product for 1/3 the cost, really keeps my hair soft &amp; works better than detangler.</li>
            <li> Absolute love this product.  I use it everyday.  I have medium to long hair and helps to de-tangle immediately. BUY!</li>
            <li> Helped smooth my hair and it kept the curling iron curls in place longer.</li>
            <li> Stylist recommended the product for use before swimming to prevent chlorine damage to my colored hair.  It works really well for this purpose.</li>
            <li> It is a great product!  12 Benefits provides body, shine and ease of style. Regards from this product are well woth the price.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this from Birchbox and loved it.  I ordered it and truly love the product and will order again.</li>
            <li> Great product for the hair.  I Love the 12 Benefits as it makes your hair feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> love this product line,  have used for a few years</li>
            <li> Received this in a Glossy Box and now I am addicted.</li>
            <li> Miracle hair treatment!! Makes hair thicker and shine!</li>
            <li> I tried this product in my Birchbox in a sample size and fell in love with it. I got the regular size on Amazon and am totally satisfied. It  smells amazing and it does detangle my thick curly hair. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how my hair smells after i&#x27;ve used this product and my hair seems healthier when i use it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best leave in conditioner. My hair is very dry and frizzy on the ends but this product makes me look like a model in a hair conditioner ad. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I would make to the 12 benefits company is to put it in a squeeze style spray bottle rather than the pump.</li>
            <li> I got this in a Birchbox in the sample size. I loved it!! I live in Alaska, so its really hard to keep my hair from drying out, but this works and doesn&#x27;t make it weighed down or greasy or anything! It smells amazing, gets out tangles, makes my hair soft, and adds shine. I even use it on my 2 1/2 year old.</li>
            <li> I have thin, curly, dry hair.  This is the miracle spray that I&#x27;ve been searching for.  Initially, after applying to my hair hair liberally, I was sure my hair would be greasy and gross.  I was pleasantly surprised after I blew dry it.  Perfectly silky, soft, and full.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
