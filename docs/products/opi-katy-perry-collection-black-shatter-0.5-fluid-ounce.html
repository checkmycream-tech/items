            <li>i love it</li>

            <li>Additionally, there are many vibrant shatters from which to choose, everything from turquoise to rose.</li>
            <li>Black shattervis the best shatter of all I got.</li>
            <li>n enjoy it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute and looks about good almost on any color nail polish except black of course.</li>
            <li>The internal packaging was unique and I liked that as much as I liked the product.    </li>
            <li>I was excited to give this a try-</li>
            <li>I thought the finish look was going to be this cool</li>
            <li>It looks cool, which is why i gave it 4 starts but not what i thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>She loves it and thinks it&#x27;s so cool because all the girls at school are wearing it.  </li>
            <li>This shatter looks fantastic over all the polishes that OPI created with Katy Perry, so have fun experimenting.</li>
            <li>From a guy&#x27;s point of view... it looks really cool when put on and the shatter effect gives you that pop.</li>
            <li>The product is very simple to use, it dries quickly and looks great after a clear top coat.</li>
            <li>The black shatter creates a beautiful effect on my nails.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to use to add a little edge to your nails or to cover up when you paint your own</li>
            <li>They were very friendly and help full w/ this particular delivery.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it with many different colors underneath the black crackle and all have looked awesome!</li>
            <li>but now that I know what to expect I will be able to apply it better next time.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, so you have to put it on quickly.  </li>
            <li>so you have to work quick.</li>
            <li>Arrived new. :-)</li>
            <li>When everyone else was without, I had the first bottle of shatter nail polish!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great polish and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily at all, but I&#x27;m just not thrilled about the way it looks.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth what you pay.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cool product.</li>
            <li>I wish it had lasted longer because it was fun to use and wear.</li>
            <li>This was really fun while I had it.</li>
            <li>I also recommend that you put a clear top coat over it.    </li>
            <li>overall nice color</li>
            <li>You do have to work quickly because it dries very fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks OPI for making me a cool mom to my sometimes picky teenager.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing the way it shatters as it begins to dry.</li>
            <li>Also shipping from this seller was super fast</li>
            <li>Thanks a ton!</li>
            <li>The shattering effect wasn&#x27;t nearly as pretty as before.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>A day or so later, I reapply the top coat.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I apply the shatter and top coat to instantly add another week or so to the color without having to remove it all and start from scratch.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t look well with dark colors underneath, a light color looks better.</li>
            <li>I have bought allot of different ones and I just love them all.</li>
            <li>but of all the other shatters, the black is the best.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was in brand new condition.</li>
            <li>I also own the wite and the blue, and both turned out to be complete disappointments.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is very cool and different looking.</li>
            <li>I just kind of looks like black.</li>
            <li>The only down-side is that it dries too quickly!  </li>
            <li>I wore it over a shiney pink and it looks really cute.</li>
            <li>I ordered it anyway because I&#x27;m a pushover when it comes to what she wants (within reason).  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>Matches the look of the costume really well.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think the special shatter effect is worth the trouble. :)</li>
            <li>Leaves square type pattern on top of dark color.  </li>
            <li>I would definitly recomemded to anyone who wants to try this new nail look.</li>
            <li>I got white,silver, black, only black looks perfect.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting it to pop more in contrast with the color of the polish and the black of the shatter.</li>
            <li>Received quickly while I could not get it locally, we had within 4 days.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this nail polish in other eye catching ways in the future.</li>
            <li>Apply the strokes as you normally would though.</li>
            <li>You can make lots of fun looks with them with different colors.</li>
            <li>But for a fun look, I would definitely recommend trying one out!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and lasts long with a topcoat on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something new to look at and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>Also, since the polish is made to dry quickly, it gets quite goopy around the opening of the bottle.</li>
            <li>, I currently have it on top of a mauve-y purple shade solid on my toes and french on my fingers.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that shatters are thicker than regular polish and they dry quickly, so you have to work fast.</li>
            <li>It dries to a matte finish, so apply a top coat to make it extra dark and shiny, if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li>People always ask me if I had my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li>I was afraid black shatter would be too Gothic or punky, but with a shiny top coat and the right attire, it&#x27;s quite classy and unique, a real eye-catcher.</li>
            <li>Only apply one layer quickly, then wait a minute for it to dry and crackle.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into this trend, it&#x27;s important to have the basics of black, white, red and silver.</li>
            <li>I drove around to and called several stored near my home</li>
            <li>This OPI Black Shatter one was the first one I bought and</li>
            <li>You apply your normal color, let it dry, and then apply the shatter polish.</li>
            <li>(so it came out a little streaky the first time),</li>
            <li>The only thing to remember is that it must be applied over polish that is already pretty dry (doesn&#x27;t have to be COMPLETELY dry, but can&#x27;t be \\&quot;wet\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>It may be due to the popularity of this particular product.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like black polish, but I was expecting this to shatter like the silver shatter, which actually looks really great and shatters really wide so the polish underneath can be seen.</li>

            <li> But for a fun look, I would definitely recommend trying one out!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and lasts long with a topcoat on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something new to look at and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Also, since the polish is made to dry quickly, it gets quite goopy around the opening of the bottle.</li>
            <li> , I currently have it on top of a mauve-y purple shade solid on my toes and french on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that shatters are thicker than regular polish and they dry quickly, so you have to work fast.</li>
            <li> It dries to a matte finish, so apply a top coat to make it extra dark and shiny, if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> People always ask me if I had my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li> I was afraid black shatter would be too Gothic or punky, but with a shiny top coat and the right attire, it&#x27;s quite classy and unique, a real eye-catcher.</li>
            <li> Only apply one layer quickly, then wait a minute for it to dry and crackle.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into this trend, it&#x27;s important to have the basics of black, white, red and silver.</li>
            <li> I drove around to and called several stored near my home</li>
            <li> This OPI Black Shatter one was the first one I bought and</li>
            <li> You apply your normal color, let it dry, and then apply the shatter polish.</li>
            <li> (so it came out a little streaky the first time),</li>
            <li> The only thing to remember is that it must be applied over polish that is already pretty dry (doesn&#x27;t have to be COMPLETELY dry, but can&#x27;t be \\&quot;wet\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It may be due to the popularity of this particular product.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like black polish, but I was expecting this to shatter like the silver shatter, which actually looks really great and shatters really wide so the polish underneath can be seen.</li>
            <li> I mean really, almost $10 for a tiny amount of nail polish?</li>
            <li> but instead i&#x27;m getting these long shattered streaks.</li>
            <li> Same cost w shipping added as Ulta 3 and other discount cosmetic stores.</li>
            <li> as in not too dry looking.</li>
            <li> I have used OPI Katy Perry Black Shatter several times since I&#x27;ve purchased it.</li>
            <li> I only had this polish a little over a year now.  </li>
            <li> Also i have only had mine a few weeks, but it seems to be clumping up a bit, but nothing that hinders its use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when my daughter wanted this polish.  </li>
            <li> Thereafter a lot of other brands like it but don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would switch up every other nail.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works as described.</li>
            <li> well so this was really weird and have only seen that happen in my really old polishes.  </li>
            <li> I use it w dark colors and</li>
            <li> I like to apply a moisturizing base coat followed by two coats of polish and finished with a glossy top coat.</li>
            <li> If you practice you may get it down.</li>
            <li> the black shows up well.  </li>
            <li> it was a little clumpier than I was expecting</li>
            <li> It dried up on me since I lost it when we moved .</li>
            <li> then the product dried up in it&#x27;s bottle.</li>
            <li> yes, it does tend to clump up after the bottle has been used, but I just sit and shake it up for a few minutes and that seems to loosen it up.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly, w/ no problems.  </li>
            <li> Goes on black, then slowly breaks up to a cracked appearance.</li>
            <li> I do have to say, that over time, this polish becomes a little thick and goopy in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It dried before I could get it off the brush!</li>
            <li> It comes out really thick and dries clumpy, not smooth.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem was that, after about a month or two, the polish got all chunky and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> The thinner you make it, which is hard to do, the smoother it is...</li>
            <li> I ordered this when it was all the crazy for my fiancee and it is the same as the stuff that you couldn&#x27;t find in Ulta.  </li>
            <li> I waited a while to use this polish and have been waiting to write a review until I&#x27;d used it (DUH!).</li>
            <li> After a month, the nail polish kinda congealed and it was very thick.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars just because it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> I read alot of reviews by people who are unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> by the time I found it it was thick and horrible.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the shatter isn&#x27;t that noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, because the look would have been so neat.</li>
            <li> No matter how I applied it it just looked like a horrible paint job.</li>

            <li> Black shattervis the best shatter of all I got. I got white,silver, black, only black looks perfect. I even tried gold Sephora but still ...  Idu want to buy one shatter color, this a a must!</li>
            <li> When everyone else was without, I had the first bottle of shatter nail polish!  Great shopping experience!  Thanks a ton!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works. It&#x27;s amazing the way it shatters as it begins to dry. I recommend you buy it. It&#x27;s very cute and looks about good almost on any color nail polish except black of course. I think it&#x27;s worth what you pay.</li>
            <li> The black shatter creates a beautiful effect on my nails.  The only down-side is that it dries too quickly!  After a month, the nail polish kinda congealed and it was very thick. The shattering effect wasn&#x27;t nearly as pretty as before. (which is why this only has 4 stars)  I read some suggestions online and put a drop of two of nail polish remover in it. Lo and behold! It&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s mint condition!  Personally, I think the special shatter effect is worth the trouble. :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to give this a try- it was a little clumpier than I was expecting (so it came out a little streaky the first time), but now that I know what to expect I will be able to apply it better next time. I wore it over a shiney pink and it looks really cute.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool product. However, i gave it 4 starts bc from the pictures i saw i thought i was going to get the same results, but i&#x27;m not. I thought the finish look was going to be this cool kinda square shatter look, but instead i&#x27;m getting these long shattered streaks. It looks cool, which is why i gave it 4 starts but not what i thought it was going to be. Would recommend it though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this nail polish. For those of you who haven&#x27;t used it or seen it used I would recommend going on youtube and watch it be applied. I wear it almost everytime I do my nails now. Also shipping from this seller was super fast and I would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Purchased shatter nailpolish for my daughter. Goes on black, then slowly breaks up to a cracked appearance. Looks great over the bright colors.</li>
            <li> Great quality and in one brush you get a great crackle effect over any color. Dries nicely...as in not too dry looking.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to be able to find the OPI Shatter nail polish.  I drove around to and called several stored near my home and they were sold out.  It arrived quickly and was in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> I loved this nail polish!  I have tried it with many different colors underneath the black crackle and all have looked awesome! It dries quickly, so you have to put it on quickly.  Also i have only had mine a few weeks, but it seems to be clumping up a bit, but nothing that hinders its use.</li>
            <li> Great polish. Good price. Arrived new. :-)</li>
            <li> Can I please just say that I love all OPI products.  I was skeptical at first when my daughter wanted this polish.  I ordered it anyway because I&#x27;m a pushover when it comes to what she wants (within reason).  HUGE HIT! She loves it and thinks it&#x27;s so cool because all the girls at school are wearing it.  Thanks OPI for making me a cool mom to my sometimes picky teenager.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly, w/ no problems.  Gave it to a friend as a gift. Actually, I made it out to be a surprise gift from Katy Perry, with help from the seller.  They were very friendly and help full w/ this particular delivery.  Would purchase from seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used OPI Katy Perry Black Shatter several times since I&#x27;ve purchased it. It&#x27;s the coolest stuff ever.  People always ask me if I had my nails done professionally. Buy this item for sure! You won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> It is a great product...works as stated in the description.  HOWEVER, amazon.com contacted the seller and the seller did not respond.      I did receive the product a week after the estimated time of arrival.  It may be due to the popularity of this particular product.    I would still order from them again.  The internal packaging was unique and I liked that as much as I liked the product.    Hopefully, a more prompt response and a more accurate ETA would be better.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Dries fast. Thereafter a lot of other brands like it but don&#x27;t work as well. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I waited a while to use this polish and have been waiting to write a review until I&#x27;d used it (DUH!). I like it, I currently have it on top of a mauve-y purple shade solid on my toes and french on my fingers. I was disappointed that the shatter isn&#x27;t that noticeable. I just kind of looks like black. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like black polish, but I was expecting this to shatter like the silver shatter, which actually looks really great and shatters really wide so the polish underneath can be seen. I guess I was expecting it to pop more in contrast with the color of the polish and the black of the shatter. It&#x27;s a great polish and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily at all, but I&#x27;m just not thrilled about the way it looks. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a different brush stroke next time. I heard that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It looks very nice and has excellent quality. I would definitly recomemded to anyone who wants to try this new nail look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be a cave woman for Halloween, so I put on this polish over a light tan color and it REALLY looks great! Matches the look of the costume really well. I look forward to using this nail polish in other eye catching ways in the future. I think this would look even more amazing (for halloween) with a REALLY bright orange!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Looks just like you&#x27;d expect. The only thing to remember is that it must be applied over polish that is already pretty dry (doesn&#x27;t have to be COMPLETELY dry, but can&#x27;t be \\&quot;wet\\&quot;). Also, since the polish is made to dry quickly, it gets quite goopy around the opening of the bottle. I recommend that you buy some nail polish thinner if you don&#x27;t have some already.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this polish. Does exactly what it says it will. Dries quickly and lasts long with a topcoat on it. I also have it in silver.</li>
            <li> I loved this shatter! It looks great over bright colors and shimmery polishes. You do have to work quickly because it dries very fast. My biggest problem was that, after about a month or two, the polish got all chunky and hard to work with. It dried before I could get it off the brush! I wish it had lasted longer because it was fun to use and wear.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that shatters are thicker than regular polish and they dry quickly, so you have to work fast. Apply the strokes as you normally would though. Shatter polish is all the rage these days. If you&#x27;re into this trend, it&#x27;s important to have the basics of black, white, red and silver. Additionally, there are many vibrant shatters from which to choose, everything from turquoise to rose. Shatter polishes, in my opinion, are a great way to extend the life of your manicure and pedicure. I like to apply a moisturizing base coat followed by two coats of polish and finished with a glossy top coat. A day or so later, I reapply the top coat. After a week or two, depending on the polish&#x27;s quality, all polish will begin to chip. That&#x27;s when I apply the shatter and top coat to instantly add another week or so to the color without having to remove it all and start from scratch. I was afraid black shatter would be too Gothic or punky, but with a shiny top coat and the right attire, it&#x27;s quite classy and unique, a real eye-catcher. This shatter looks fantastic over all the polishes that OPI created with Katy Perry, so have fun experimenting.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I use it w dark colors and the black shows up well.  Leaves square type pattern on top of dark color.  Very happy with the purchase.  Same cost w shipping added as Ulta 3 and other discount cosmetic stores.</li>
            <li> For the price this one had me flipping out I loved the color over my yellowish toe nails and it seemed to make them disappear and look beautiful as if I were young again</li>
            <li> This was really fun while I had it. It dried up on me since I lost it when we moved . by the time I found it it was thick and horrible.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is very cool and different looking. One of my favorites!! And a really good price.</li>
            <li> This polish works as described, just be sure to follow the instructions. Only apply one layer quickly, then wait a minute for it to dry and crackle. It dries to a matte finish, so apply a top coat to make it extra dark and shiny, if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> it is just not crackling at all for me.. doesn&#x27;t look good at all</li>
            <li> I like shatter polishes, even though they are not quite as popular now. You can make lots of fun looks with them with different colors. This OPI Black Shatter one was the first one I bought and it was great! You apply your normal color, let it dry, and then apply the shatter polish. It cracks on your nail and leaves a nice cracked appearance. You can apply it horizontally, or vertically, for different looks. Sometimes I would switch up every other nail. I liked red/black, white/black, and yellow/black combinations the most.  Apply a topcoat after everything to make it look sleeker on your nails and last longer. I do have to say, that over time, this polish becomes a little thick and goopy in the bottle. Shatter polishes definitely don&#x27;t have the shelf life of regular nail polishes, which can last for years and years. But for a fun look, I would definitely recommend trying one out!</li>
            <li> An amazing thing to have if you MUST have it and can&#x27;t find it. I really love it and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this when it was all the crazy for my fiancee and it is the same as the stuff that you couldn&#x27;t find in Ulta.  This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> then the product dried up in it&#x27;s bottle. I always screw the tops on well so this was really weird and have only seen that happen in my really old polishes.  I only had this polish a little over a year now.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. You can&#x27;t go over it multiple times like regular nail polish so you have to work quick. It also doesn&#x27;t look well with dark colors underneath, a light color looks better.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is the best- great effects and does what it says it will- has the shatter effect. Received quickly while I could not get it locally, we had within 4 days. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great polish, and I love the effect of the Shattered look! It&#x27;s OPI so you know it&#x27;s a good product. The only things is, the polish tends to clump on the brush and around the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> product works as shown</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend after she kept checking all local stores and they were either sold out or had not yet recieved any. From a guy&#x27;s point of view... it looks really cool when put on and the shatter effect gives you that pop. It&#x27;s something new to look at and my girlfriend loves it. I gave it four stars just because it&#x27;s so expensive. I mean really, almost $10 for a tiny amount of nail polish? Other than that it works as described.</li>
            <li> This polish is ok, I hoped it would be better though. It comes out really thick and dries clumpy, not smooth. It also dries as soon as you put it on. The thinner you make it, which is hard to do, the smoother it is... So, thicker means bigger, clumpier cracks, thinner means smaller, smoother cracks. If you practice you may get it down.</li>
            <li> The product is very simple to use, it dries quickly and looks great after a clear top coat. I think my nails look fancier now than they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li> I read alot of reviews by people who are unhappy with this product. I for one LOVE IT. as soon as I got it I was alredy making a list of all my colors that I could not wait to try it on. Just watching it form into its shatter effect is amazing. and I have had nothing but great experience with this product. I also recommend that you put a clear top coat over it.    yes, it does tend to clump up after the bottle has been used, but I just sit and shake it up for a few minutes and that seems to loosen it up. but of all the other shatters, the black is the best. I also own the wite and the blue, and both turned out to be complete disappointments.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. It works great and looks great without a lot of work. Is my favorite nail polish accessory.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I would recommend it...it&#x27;s nice to use to add a little edge to your nails or to cover up when you paint your own and you can&#x27;t see all the bumps and smudges.</li>
            <li> This polish is so easy to use, and as it dries it literally looks like you had cracks handpainted on your nails! Its AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> its nice very good color but u need 2 or 3 coat overall nice color i love it n enjoy it</li>
            <li> This did not work. No matter how I applied it it just looked like a horrible paint job. The crackle effect was not working for me. Very disappointing, because the look would have been so neat.</li>
            <li> I have bought allot of different ones and I just love them all. Awesome buy too. Use them all on my nails.</li>
