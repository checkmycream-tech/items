            <li>When I ordered it, I didn&#x27;t think it would work, despite the good reviews on the package.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and does what is says it will do.  </li>

            <li>and she is really pleased.</li>
            <li>He too being a physician loves to find a product that really works well and will work great for others.  </li>
            <li>It would have been a great product, except I&#x27;m highly allergic to the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Excellent hand cream for very dry hands or feet.</li>
            <li>It is very good for dry or chapped hands and feet.</li>
            <li>i use it at night with gauze gloves to insure smooth hands in the morning</li>
            <li>But when I first applied it at night, I felt better.  </li>

            <li>My dermatologist recommended that I try the Cutemol for a skin problem and it worked wonderfully; however, for me, the cream was a little heavy and took a while to absorb totally.  </li>
            <li>For me I have found other creams that work as good at half the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for eczema and it keeps things wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>It looks like huge thick scars and sometimes bleeds.</li>
            <li>Product was recommended by dermatologist since I have extra sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> I guess other companies have caught up.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> very heavy cream for very dry hands  i use it at night with gauze gloves to insure smooth hands in the morning</li>
            <li> Bought this on recommendation of my dermatologist for my hands and cuticles.  He had given me a sample and I like it.  Good penetrating cream for my hands.  Would recommend others try it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say but love it. I have problems with my fore fingers being very dry and peel. The doctors recommendations never helped. I found this online and will stick with it forever.</li>
            <li> I will need to use it longer In this weather my finger tips are cracking and split</li>
            <li> Great wintertime skin cream. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Excellent hand cream for very dry hands or feet.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  When I ordered it, I didn&#x27;t think it would work, despite the good reviews on the package.  But when I first applied it at night, I felt better.  The next morning, my nails looked much healthier and cleaner, and the cuticles and skin around the nail was much more hydrated.  I definitely recommend this for people with dehydrated skin around their nails.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I try the Cutemol for a skin problem and it worked wonderfully; however, for me, the cream was a little heavy and took a while to absorb totally.  I felt like I had to isolate my hands to keep from soiling anything I might touch after the application.  Beyond that it was the solution for my dry skin condition.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and does what is says it will do.  I found it to be really good in the winter for skin cracks.  My only thing is the price.  It is high for what it is.  For me I have found other creams that work as good at half the price.  I guess other companies have caught up.  Like generic drugs, not as good as the original but at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, seller is wonderful</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and I love it.  It may be a little pricey but we&#x27;ll worth it. Just a tiny bit does the job.</li>
            <li> It is very good for dry or chapped hands and feet. I do not know what else to say, I am sorry</li>
            <li> Cutemol was recommend by my dermatologist for my weak nails. I now use it on my skin as well as it&#x27;s very dry and it make a good difference  dry patches are no longer.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has Cutemol half price then buying it at my dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff!! The skin on my fingers crack terribly in the winter. The Cutemol cream helps. It goes on thick but not greasy. A little bit goes a long way. I bought 4 tubes and I keep one in my purse, one at work, one by my bed, etc. I recommend it to anyone who suffers like I do with bleeding, throbbing, and cracking skin.</li>
            <li> This really helps with dry cuticles and fingertips that are prone to cracking and roughness from water or cold weathe.!</li>
            <li> Recommended by me dermatologist. Works wonders!</li>
            <li> A little expensive (buy the 8oz jar instead) but worth it.  I&#x27;ve been using this for eczema and it keeps things wonderfully soft. My mom has been having psoriasis on her hands for about 6 months or so and her skin was itching, flaking, and getting thin. Her dermatologist advised her to get some hand cream with alpha hydroxy and she found it hurt her hands. I sent her the 2-pack of Cutemol and she put it on with gloves, overnight. The next day her hands did not itch for a minute and she is really pleased. Hopefully this will help her hands heal up.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hands dry and crack every winter. It looks like huge thick scars and sometimes bleeds. This is the ONLY thing we could find to help! It&#x27;s great! She just has to use it a few times and it goes back to normal!</li>
            <li> It would have been a great product, except I&#x27;m highly allergic to the fragrance.  Product was recommended by dermatologist since I have extra sensitive skin.  So, while I couldn&#x27;t return it, I instead gave the Cutemol to a friend who likes it.  Will try the Triple Cream product from the same company that makes Cutemol, and hopefully Triple Cream will work out better for me because it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> A sample of this was given to me by my dermatologist.. My husband tends to get cracks on his hands esp by his nails.  He tried this and is hooked.  He too being a physician loves to find a product that really works well and will work great for others.  A good find and we have a couple different bottles to keep handy.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My skin went from sand paper to baby butt smoothe.  Cutemol really works.</li>
            <li> One of the best emollients I have used.  Gardening and detergents dry my hands terribly. Cutemol reallh plumps up the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream of its kind.  It is thick and you have to wait and let it soak in, but if you have very dry and rough skin it is the best.</li>
