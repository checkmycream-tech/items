            <li> The color is saturated and stays put for a long time without drying out.  </li>
            <li> and although its a dark shade I can still wear it to work as it is not as dark as the bruised color from the same brand.</li>
            <li> It is not quite as dark as I thought it would be, but I would still make the purchase knowing what I know.</li>
            <li> The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the weird smell</li>
            <li> IT SERIOUSLY FEEL SO CREAMY ON YOUR LIPS</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is unuseable.</li>
            <li> When I received this lipstick it was hard, sticky, and had a terrible spell.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub off too badly.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>

            <li> Luv luv the color and is creamy on the lips!!</li>
            <li> This color is sooooo pretty! Had to use a lip liner with it though. It would look best on darker girls or really pale girls. It&#x27;s a beautiful purple burgundy with some shimmer. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the weird smell but i got over it. Got alot of compliments !</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous color for those who want a deep and rich burgundy lipstick.  The color is saturated and stays put for a long time without drying out.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> This color is a beautiful plum toned burgundy.  The lipstick goes on very smoothly and leaves lips feeling moist. It is not quite as dark as I thought it would be, but I would still make the purchase knowing what I know.</li>
            <li> It is darker than pictured, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with that. The fact that it&#x27;s kind of matalitic with glitter in it caught me off guard since you don&#x27;t see it in the picture. It came on the third day after it was shipped and it looks really good on. I actually like it.</li>
            <li> This color is darker in person but goes on very sheer. Still love it! Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> I love NYX. Their lipsticks are absolutely amazing. Medusa is a beautiful plum color. The only thing I did not like about it was that it has glitter. Other than that, it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife as a Christmas stocking stuffer. She loved the color and is very familiar with the NYX brand.</li>
            <li> This particular color is amazing. I Love the texture and lasting power. Great for blending if desired. Doesn&#x27;t rub off too badly.</li>

            <li> This is a fab color that would look great on any skin tone. Im brownskin and I get alot of compliments whenever I wear it. It is a little darker than the picture but its still an awesome color!</li>
            <li> When I received this lipstick it was hard, sticky, and had a terrible spell.  Needless to say it is unuseable.</li>
            <li> I usually really like NYX&#x27;s lipstick but this color was not the shade of purple that I thought it was going to be. Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> I love it it looks amazing on and although its a dark shade I can still wear it to work as it is not as dark as the bruised color from the same brand. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I order this product because its a gorgous purple I like every aspects of it I would definitely reorder and I recommended a few of my friends which they are very satisfied as well thank you so much</li>
            <li> I love the color payoff in this lipstick! I will always be an NYX fettish! Thank you, NYX!!!!</li>
