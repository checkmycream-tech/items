            <li> I got this for my daughter and it smells kind of bad when you first get it. Also one of the tie things fell off. But it is BIG and spacious so it is perfect for a teenager to use going to the mall and stuff.</li>
            <li> It is so pretty and not to big or too small and the brown is a beautiful color and you can put a lot in it and I just love it, it is also not that heavy with your stuff in it and I think it looks good with every out fit. I also love it because I use it when I go on my tours and meet and greets and it is just so amazing and I drink a lot of water so I can fit like 5 water bottles in the bag with everything else I carry so it is wonderful and I think you would love it also</li>
            <li> I ordered sheets and was sent the wrong color luckily it still matched my comforter, aside from that everything was great.</li>
            <li> Love the design of the purse. Unfortunately the purse was poorly made. It started unraveling on the strap first time I used it! I am returning it.</li>

            <li> To big and bulky...when you tighten the straps they&#x27;re to long with the tassel and no snaps or other way to close the top.&lt;br /&gt;No likey!</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks this purse started falling apart, and it distributes weight horribly which causes arm and shoulder pain.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have some concerns about the construction but haven&#x27;t had any issues yet.</li>
            <li> it had a couple of holes in the leather</li>
            <li> Poor quality. I wear it to times and is already ruined.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this purse!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tiny, and the color is not the same.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice sized bag. It&#x27;s big enough to carry my things (water, keys, wallet, phone, phone charger, etc) when I leave the house to hang out with my friends. It&#x27;s cut and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love the size and the overall look of this bag. However, the description states that the bag is brown. It is actually a hideous orange color. There is no way that anyone could ever think that this bag is brown, so the description is very misleading. I am very disappointed with the color.</li>
            <li> do not waist your money.  the heart broke off the first day I had it.  Very cheap,</li>
            <li> This is the worst purse ever. It fell apart right when I took it out.</li>
            <li> Fell apart too easy..</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! Supper cute😘</li>
            <li> I use the purse every single day. Its beautiful. The stitching for the inside was undone when i received it and after 2 days one of the pocket&#x27;s stitching came off. Other than that its pretty</li>
            <li> The color stinks, is completely different from picture</li>
