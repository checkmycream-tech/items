    <ol>
            <li>And the price here is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Best thing for an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>This is also the best price I have found.</li>
            <li>I get an awesome blowdry if I comb this through, then either a lite application of  Ojon&#x27;s Thickening spray or B&amp;B&#x27;s Thickening, then grooming creme!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>Not the best for my hair, it feels good when you spray it in and comb it through</li>
            <li>Its great for detangling without adding any oil to your hair.</li>
            <li>this product is a great detangler for after the shower...adds smoothness to hair...</li>
            <li>I can go 3-4 days between washes, which is great.</li>
            <li>It acts as a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>well, I just don&#x27;t know, but I am happy with my minimalist approach:  </li>
            <li>Have used this stuff for years and it works great as a detangler.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and absorbs oils and stink.   </li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Nice product to help with tangles too!</li>
            <li>My salon bottles always had a strong, delightful, minty, tea tree scent that made me feel invigorated and happy.</li>
            <li>The scent is also pleasant, not overpowering at all.    </li>
            <li>I bought this awesome hair spray online about a year ago after my hairstylist used it on my hair and strongly recommended it.</li>
            <li>My good friend, who is also my stylist, uses this in her salon and recommended it.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>(really good)</li>
            <li>It smells so good -</li>
            <li>And it makes your scalp feel good.</li>
            <li>This product is great, but this retailer sells this for a lot more than the suggested retail price.</li>
            <li>Great for curly hair and cools your head and helps style your hair better after using it with cream or wax or pomade.</li>
            <li>I never go a day without working this into my hair becuase it always leaves my hair smelling great and feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>It kind of defines the strands, which shows off highlights.</li>
            <li>Makes the scalp feels nice and aids with styling my hair as well.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice feel after I use the tonic.  </li>
            <li>There is just something about this Tonic lotion that I am loving.</li>
            <li>I used to have really damaged hair from dying and always putting it up for work but now with this product, my hair is always looking great!</li>
            <li>Helps with detangling hair and smells good, love this product</li>
            <li>I also love the clean, herbal fragrance that also works great as a hair refresher.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair hold whatever styling product I use more effectively.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product smells and the benefits it provides.</li>
            <li>It (mostly) works.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I guess I should remind her that it&#x27;s my money :-)</li>
            <li>I fell in LOVE with this product and had been using it for a couple years ordering it from a beauty salon in Atlanta.  </li>
            <li>I love this tonic.</li>
            <li>But that may have more to do with the abuse my scalp has taken in 15 years of hair dyeing.</li>
            <li>Tonic Lotion is a truly wonderful, versatile, and essential product.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but if you are not a fan of tea tree oil smell you may not like it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, makes me feel like I am splurging and being pampered.</li>
            <li>something i&#x27;d imagine a hippie to smell like, which is okay but definitely not the best.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works much, much better than using water on my hair.</li>
            <li>I am sending my counterfeit product to Bumble and Bumble because I suspect their brand people will have better luck convincing Amazon to sever its relationship with &amp;#34;BJ Beauty&amp;#34; than I will.</li>
            <li>Better than any product out there.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for almost four years now.  </li>
            <li>I love this tonic and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I spray it with Tonic before drying it, and I get a much better blow-dry than if I had used water.  </li>
            <li>sure you get the one that includes the word &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really low-maintenance way of making your hair look gorgeous and who doesn&#x27;t love that tingle as it hits your scalp?</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Lovely light and soothing scent.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice and fresh and detangles really easily, where without it I kill my scalp ripping through my hair with a brush.</li>
            <li>It smells terrific and is great both just after shampooing and also for in refreshing my style between washes.  </li>
            <li>I tend to like b &amp; b&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners more than their styling products, but you absolutely must own this.</li>
            <li>It also is a great tonic for the face, as the tea tree oil is great to clear up those occasional pimples.</li>
            <li>I have fine, highlighed hair.</li>
            <li>Proceed with Bumble Thickening Hairspray, dry and style, you will be most happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great to use immediately after washing your hair or as a next day refresher.</li>
            <li>What I bought from B&amp;B is light and makes my hair shine, as it should.</li>
            <li>rosemary and tea tree), before products (to help the products work better than imagined), or after styling (to calm frizz/flyaways, soften hair, and re-set hold/style).</li>
            <li>It smells great, and I don&#x27;t notice that the smell actually stays in my hair.</li>
            <li>My current salon does not sell Bumble &amp; Bumble so purchasing the product here on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li>so was excited to find it offered on Amazon.   </li>
            <li>Color Care friendly.</li>
            <li>I went to many dermatologists and they were ready to diagnose it as psoriasis!</li>
            <li>I swear the defrizz works better if I use this first.</li>
            <li>I love this product, not only for my own hair, but I also use it on my dog who has skin allergies.</li>
            <li>Also, because of the tea tree oil, or something like that, in it, it helps keep my hair clean longer.</li>
            <li>I leave the house feeling clean from head to toe.  </li>
            <li>Priced about right and easy to get.</li>
            <li>Great product for those days you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair but need a touch up blow dry!</li>
            <li>It is also great for a quick touch up once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I also bought the Super Rich Conditioner and the Tonic Shampoo...</li>
            <li>Bb Tonic is a great product, unfortunately not the same product when ordered through amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great product for wet hair - use before blow drying....</li>
            <li>The service was fast and I am glad I have it now.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I am thrilled that amazon offers it.</li>
            <li>The Bumble &amp; Bumble lads claim that their Bb tonic Lotion protects hair from heated tools when they&#x27;re used and that it conditions the scalp to keep it healthy, particularly when a person is not all for using conditioners.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and helps detangle my hair, even helps to tame my frizzies, and I get better results when styling my hair.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on scalp, though I haven&#x27;t really experienced any dramatic \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; as bottle states.</li>
            <li>is also good to use as a in between hair refresher, instead of dry shampoo (which drys my hair out).</li>
            <li>I just spray it on my locks after a good towel dry.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good and the scent lasts even after my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>After the nice trial size ran dangerously low, I jumped on Amazon  for the full size bottle.</li>
            <li>Not only is it convenient to use (just spray liberally on your damp hair, comb through and blow-dry), it leaves my hair shiny and healthy!  </li>
            <li>I have curly, dry hair and do not shampoo daily, so this is great to revive the curls and the style in the morning without having to add on more styling products.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and doesn&#x27;t take abuse very well.</li>
            <li>Tonic is great as a leave-in conditioner, especially when your hair is too fine to condition daily (as mine is).  </li>
            <li>Thanks Bumble &amp; Bumble for making something that works and is safe enough for me to put on my precious pooch.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>It still works ok for my purposes: like other reviewers I have fine straight hair, and this product works better than water to refresh my hair between washings.</li>
            <li>Use this or the Prep right after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>and I have soft, shiny, fresh smelling, stronger,&amp; easy to detangle hair.</li>
            <li>Since using it, my hair has more volume and just in general seems healthier and softer.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t know whether the Bb claims are accurate, but I certainly enjoy using the Tonic Lotion after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>I have curly kind of dry hair, and anytime I can nourish my hair without adding any weight, I will.</li>
            <li>However, I used to be able to go 2 days without washing, but with this Amazon bottle, I can only go one day before my hair starts to look greasy.</li>
            <li>Further, the Amazon bottle is not as \\&quot;milky\\&quot; looking, and once shaken has a perma-froth on top, whereas the salon product&#x27;s froth soon dissolves.</li>
            <li>If you google it you can usually find more information about it, though there was much more a year ago.    </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t use the product that often I only had to buy some more now.</li>
            <li>next time i buy a leave in conditioner, i will opt for something cheaper with a better scent.</li>
            <li>Most days it&#x27;s the only product I use in my hair.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of detangling my thick hair</li>
            <li>This is the first time ordering this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not so much!</li>
            <li>We have used the product for years on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair, but this was the first time ordering it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair is tangle free and soft, ready to</li>
            <li>so maybe someone with long more tangled hair will see a difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for providing some extra nourishment for the hair, or a sort of \\&quot;primer\\&quot; for other styling products.</li>
            <li>Also good to fluff up with a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li>After just ONE use of this, my hair was super shiny and really soft.</li>
            <li>I first noticed the problem when trying to use the product - it doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the same as the genuine product.</li>
            <li>It used to look fried all the time and never looked healthy, but now when I let it dry with this stuff, its sleek and looks like I just got it cut!</li>
            <li>Also, one of the main reasons I first bought this product was the scent.  </li>
            <li>I use this product every morning and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought directly from Bumble and Bumble this time to compare and there is a distinct difference.</li>
            <li>Product is much easier to use without the spray.</li>
            <li>The real difference was when I began spraying it liberally throughout my hair</li>
            <li>but really why would  I want want to??</li>
            <li>Voila, my hair is straight again.</li>
            <li>I use so much of this</li>
            <li>Spraying lightly on the hair and reshaping with the blow dryer ~ bring my hairstyle back to life again.</li>
            <li>I thought this did not work or smell this the real Bumble and bumble</li>
            <li>this is not the real product.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than in salon or at Target.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but it leaves my hair coated and kind of heavy.   </li>
            <li>I spray it on right after my shower, put my hair in a towel, and have even quit using any other product any more because my hair is so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I guess someone is diluting the formulas down to make more money, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I spray lightly all over my bed-head, brush it out, and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells less like tea tree and more like alcohol.  </li>
            <li>After you shampoo and towel dry, spritz all over hair lightly and massage into hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Less is more with this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they are the real thing and just old, but doesn&#x27;t seem that way.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, thin, and straight, and it tends to air-dry quickly while I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Besides smelling terrific, if you do not like the smell of tea tree oil, then stop right here.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and in the morning when I don&#x27;t have time to wash it, I spray on this Tonic and it makes my curls bounce right back and helps get rid of the bedhead flatness.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I could live without it....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the scalp tingling bit as mentioned on the bottle, but I can definitely live without that.</li>
            <li>Just speculating, but do be aware of the potential differences if you choose to purchase this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>the smell is different from most other bumble and bumble products.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think I was using enough at first)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty low-key when it comes to my hair (stick-straight Asian hair, somewhat fine by Asian standards, but coarse by Caucasian standards), but still don&#x27;t like the kinks I get from sleeping or having my hair dry in a funny way.</li>
            <li>The logo and printing on the bottle look a bit like a photo copy, with less detail around the edges of the text when compared with the genuine article.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find the products for less on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>As far as the \\&quot;layering\\&quot; suggested by</li>
            <li>It can be used alone (to make hair extremely soft and fragrant - think</li>
            <li>Only a few spritz and your hair will feel so delightfully soft and look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I brought this to the nearest Sephora and directly compared the two.</li>
            <li>my hairdresser&#x27;s appointment is too far away, so I decided to get it on-line so that I can get it quicker.</li>
            <li>I have thick, course hair to begin with, so it may produce better results in hair that is finer mine.</li>
            <li>Other than the botlte, it cannot be further from the original product.</li>
            <li>The only place I can find this tonic are high end salons which seem out of the way for me.  </li>
            <li>It is worth it to pay a little extra for what is assuredly the real thing.</li>
            <li>use this product on my out of the shower wet hair, I have curly hair and makes it easy to comb thru when wet.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I expected and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>For the price of this item, i expected it to be a little more that what it has done for my hair.</li>
            <li>When I needed a new bottle recently, I decided to order from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>notice no other reason to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what exactly is going on, but I think it&#x27;s worth the few dollars difference to buy from B&amp;B to really get what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but well worth it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a quick, light spritz to keep away fly-aways, kinks and other random hair quirks that you may not want to see before you run out the door.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go so far as to call this an \\&quot;imposter\\&quot; like another reviewer, but I do agree it is different.  </li>
            <li>I buy several bottles during the year and give her enough at Christmas to last the whole year.</li>
            <li>I just spray this stuff (liberally) on my wet hair and let it air dry, and my hair is magically smoother, finer, not frizzy but also not weighed down in the slightest.</li>
            <li>the conditioner also seems off (less thick, not as nice a smell), and I have not tried the tonic shampoo yet.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t add any artificial color.</li>
            <li>Both work the same way, they add a little more protection to your wet hair before you blow dry it.</li>
            <li>and apparently others have had the same experience.  </li>
            <li>Her hair feels like silk if she lets it dry naturally or uses a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I spritz it on after a shower and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>This may all be due to normal manufacturing differences...</li>
            <li>or perhaps the Amazon product is older or was left in storage with temperature extremes that changed the emulsion properties or broke down the essential oils.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> And the price here is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Best thing for an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> This is also the best price I have found.</li>
            <li> I get an awesome blowdry if I comb this through, then either a lite application of  Ojon&#x27;s Thickening spray or B&amp;B&#x27;s Thickening, then grooming creme!!  </li>
            <li> Excellent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Not the best for my hair, it feels good when you spray it in and comb it through</li>
            <li> Its great for detangling without adding any oil to your hair.</li>
            <li> this product is a great detangler for after the shower...adds smoothness to hair...</li>
            <li> I can go 3-4 days between washes, which is great.</li>
            <li> It acts as a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> well, I just don&#x27;t know, but I am happy with my minimalist approach:  </li>
            <li> Have used this stuff for years and it works great as a detangler.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and absorbs oils and stink.   </li>
            <li> Great smell.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Nice product to help with tangles too!</li>
            <li> My salon bottles always had a strong, delightful, minty, tea tree scent that made me feel invigorated and happy.</li>
            <li> The scent is also pleasant, not overpowering at all.    </li>
            <li> I bought this awesome hair spray online about a year ago after my hairstylist used it on my hair and strongly recommended it.</li>
            <li> My good friend, who is also my stylist, uses this in her salon and recommended it.</li>
            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> (really good)</li>
            <li> It smells so good -</li>
            <li> And it makes your scalp feel good.</li>
            <li> This product is great, but this retailer sells this for a lot more than the suggested retail price.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair and cools your head and helps style your hair better after using it with cream or wax or pomade.</li>
            <li> I never go a day without working this into my hair becuase it always leaves my hair smelling great and feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> It kind of defines the strands, which shows off highlights.</li>
            <li> Makes the scalp feels nice and aids with styling my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> , it has a nice feel after I use the tonic.  </li>
            <li> There is just something about this Tonic lotion that I am loving.</li>
            <li> I used to have really damaged hair from dying and always putting it up for work but now with this product, my hair is always looking great!</li>
            <li> Helps with detangling hair and smells good, love this product</li>
            <li> I also love the clean, herbal fragrance that also works great as a hair refresher.</li>
            <li> It helps my hair hold whatever styling product I use more effectively.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells and the benefits it provides.</li>
            <li> It (mostly) works.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I guess I should remind her that it&#x27;s my money :-)</li>
            <li> I fell in LOVE with this product and had been using it for a couple years ordering it from a beauty salon in Atlanta.  </li>
            <li> I love this tonic.</li>
            <li> But that may have more to do with the abuse my scalp has taken in 15 years of hair dyeing.</li>
            <li> Tonic Lotion is a truly wonderful, versatile, and essential product.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but if you are not a fan of tea tree oil smell you may not like it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, makes me feel like I am splurging and being pampered.</li>
            <li> something i&#x27;d imagine a hippie to smell like, which is okay but definitely not the best.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works much, much better than using water on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am sending my counterfeit product to Bumble and Bumble because I suspect their brand people will have better luck convincing Amazon to sever its relationship with &amp;#34;BJ Beauty&amp;#34; than I will.</li>
            <li> Better than any product out there.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for almost four years now.  </li>
            <li> I love this tonic and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I spray it with Tonic before drying it, and I get a much better blow-dry than if I had used water.  </li>
            <li> sure you get the one that includes the word &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really low-maintenance way of making your hair look gorgeous and who doesn&#x27;t love that tingle as it hits your scalp?</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Lovely light and soothing scent.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice and fresh and detangles really easily, where without it I kill my scalp ripping through my hair with a brush.</li>
            <li> It smells terrific and is great both just after shampooing and also for in refreshing my style between washes.  </li>
            <li> I tend to like b &amp; b&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners more than their styling products, but you absolutely must own this.</li>
            <li> It also is a great tonic for the face, as the tea tree oil is great to clear up those occasional pimples.</li>
            <li> I have fine, highlighed hair.</li>
            <li> Proceed with Bumble Thickening Hairspray, dry and style, you will be most happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great to use immediately after washing your hair or as a next day refresher.</li>
            <li> What I bought from B&amp;B is light and makes my hair shine, as it should.</li>
            <li> rosemary and tea tree), before products (to help the products work better than imagined), or after styling (to calm frizz/flyaways, soften hair, and re-set hold/style).</li>
            <li> It smells great, and I don&#x27;t notice that the smell actually stays in my hair.</li>
            <li> My current salon does not sell Bumble &amp; Bumble so purchasing the product here on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> so was excited to find it offered on Amazon.   </li>
            <li> Color Care friendly.</li>
            <li> I went to many dermatologists and they were ready to diagnose it as psoriasis!</li>
            <li> I swear the defrizz works better if I use this first.</li>
            <li> I love this product, not only for my own hair, but I also use it on my dog who has skin allergies.</li>
            <li> Also, because of the tea tree oil, or something like that, in it, it helps keep my hair clean longer.</li>
            <li> I leave the house feeling clean from head to toe.  </li>
            <li> Priced about right and easy to get.</li>
            <li> Great product for those days you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair but need a touch up blow dry!</li>
            <li> It is also great for a quick touch up once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Super Rich Conditioner and the Tonic Shampoo...</li>
            <li> Bb Tonic is a great product, unfortunately not the same product when ordered through amazon.  </li>
            <li> Great product for wet hair - use before blow drying....</li>
            <li> The service was fast and I am glad I have it now.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> so I am thrilled that amazon offers it.</li>
            <li> The Bumble &amp; Bumble lads claim that their Bb tonic Lotion protects hair from heated tools when they&#x27;re used and that it conditions the scalp to keep it healthy, particularly when a person is not all for using conditioners.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and helps detangle my hair, even helps to tame my frizzies, and I get better results when styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on scalp, though I haven&#x27;t really experienced any dramatic \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; as bottle states.</li>
            <li> is also good to use as a in between hair refresher, instead of dry shampoo (which drys my hair out).</li>
            <li> I just spray it on my locks after a good towel dry.  </li>
            <li> It smells really good and the scent lasts even after my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> After the nice trial size ran dangerously low, I jumped on Amazon  for the full size bottle.</li>
            <li> Not only is it convenient to use (just spray liberally on your damp hair, comb through and blow-dry), it leaves my hair shiny and healthy!  </li>
            <li> I have curly, dry hair and do not shampoo daily, so this is great to revive the curls and the style in the morning without having to add on more styling products.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and doesn&#x27;t take abuse very well.</li>
            <li> Tonic is great as a leave-in conditioner, especially when your hair is too fine to condition daily (as mine is).  </li>
            <li> Thanks Bumble &amp; Bumble for making something that works and is safe enough for me to put on my precious pooch.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> It still works ok for my purposes: like other reviewers I have fine straight hair, and this product works better than water to refresh my hair between washings.</li>
            <li> Use this or the Prep right after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have soft, shiny, fresh smelling, stronger,&amp; easy to detangle hair.</li>
            <li> Since using it, my hair has more volume and just in general seems healthier and softer.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t know whether the Bb claims are accurate, but I certainly enjoy using the Tonic Lotion after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I have curly kind of dry hair, and anytime I can nourish my hair without adding any weight, I will.</li>
            <li> However, I used to be able to go 2 days without washing, but with this Amazon bottle, I can only go one day before my hair starts to look greasy.</li>
            <li> Further, the Amazon bottle is not as \\&quot;milky\\&quot; looking, and once shaken has a perma-froth on top, whereas the salon product&#x27;s froth soon dissolves.</li>
            <li> If you google it you can usually find more information about it, though there was much more a year ago.    </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t use the product that often I only had to buy some more now.</li>
            <li> next time i buy a leave in conditioner, i will opt for something cheaper with a better scent.</li>
            <li> Most days it&#x27;s the only product I use in my hair.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of detangling my thick hair</li>
            <li> This is the first time ordering this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not so much!</li>
            <li> We have used the product for years on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair, but this was the first time ordering it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair is tangle free and soft, ready to</li>
            <li> so maybe someone with long more tangled hair will see a difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for providing some extra nourishment for the hair, or a sort of \\&quot;primer\\&quot; for other styling products.</li>
            <li> Also good to fluff up with a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li> After just ONE use of this, my hair was super shiny and really soft.</li>
            <li> I first noticed the problem when trying to use the product - it doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the same as the genuine product.</li>
            <li> It used to look fried all the time and never looked healthy, but now when I let it dry with this stuff, its sleek and looks like I just got it cut!</li>
            <li> Also, one of the main reasons I first bought this product was the scent.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought directly from Bumble and Bumble this time to compare and there is a distinct difference.</li>
            <li> Product is much easier to use without the spray.</li>
            <li> The real difference was when I began spraying it liberally throughout my hair</li>
            <li> but really why would  I want want to??</li>
            <li> Voila, my hair is straight again.</li>
            <li> I use so much of this</li>
            <li> Spraying lightly on the hair and reshaping with the blow dryer ~ bring my hairstyle back to life again.</li>
            <li> I thought this did not work or smell this the real Bumble and bumble</li>
            <li> this is not the real product.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than in salon or at Target.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair coated and kind of heavy.   </li>
            <li> I spray it on right after my shower, put my hair in a towel, and have even quit using any other product any more because my hair is so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> I guess someone is diluting the formulas down to make more money, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I spray lightly all over my bed-head, brush it out, and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells less like tea tree and more like alcohol.  </li>
            <li> After you shampoo and towel dry, spritz all over hair lightly and massage into hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Less is more with this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they are the real thing and just old, but doesn&#x27;t seem that way.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin, and straight, and it tends to air-dry quickly while I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Besides smelling terrific, if you do not like the smell of tea tree oil, then stop right here.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and in the morning when I don&#x27;t have time to wash it, I spray on this Tonic and it makes my curls bounce right back and helps get rid of the bedhead flatness.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I could live without it....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the scalp tingling bit as mentioned on the bottle, but I can definitely live without that.</li>
            <li> Just speculating, but do be aware of the potential differences if you choose to purchase this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> the smell is different from most other bumble and bumble products.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think I was using enough at first)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty low-key when it comes to my hair (stick-straight Asian hair, somewhat fine by Asian standards, but coarse by Caucasian standards), but still don&#x27;t like the kinks I get from sleeping or having my hair dry in a funny way.</li>
            <li> The logo and printing on the bottle look a bit like a photo copy, with less detail around the edges of the text when compared with the genuine article.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find the products for less on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> As far as the \\&quot;layering\\&quot; suggested by</li>
            <li> It can be used alone (to make hair extremely soft and fragrant - think</li>
            <li> Only a few spritz and your hair will feel so delightfully soft and look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I brought this to the nearest Sephora and directly compared the two.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser&#x27;s appointment is too far away, so I decided to get it on-line so that I can get it quicker.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair to begin with, so it may produce better results in hair that is finer mine.</li>
            <li> Other than the botlte, it cannot be further from the original product.</li>
            <li> The only place I can find this tonic are high end salons which seem out of the way for me.  </li>
            <li> It is worth it to pay a little extra for what is assuredly the real thing.</li>
            <li> use this product on my out of the shower wet hair, I have curly hair and makes it easy to comb thru when wet.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this item, i expected it to be a little more that what it has done for my hair.</li>
            <li> When I needed a new bottle recently, I decided to order from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> notice no other reason to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what exactly is going on, but I think it&#x27;s worth the few dollars difference to buy from B&amp;B to really get what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but well worth it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a quick, light spritz to keep away fly-aways, kinks and other random hair quirks that you may not want to see before you run out the door.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go so far as to call this an \\&quot;imposter\\&quot; like another reviewer, but I do agree it is different.  </li>
            <li> I buy several bottles during the year and give her enough at Christmas to last the whole year.</li>
            <li> I just spray this stuff (liberally) on my wet hair and let it air dry, and my hair is magically smoother, finer, not frizzy but also not weighed down in the slightest.</li>
            <li> the conditioner also seems off (less thick, not as nice a smell), and I have not tried the tonic shampoo yet.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my hair nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t add any artificial color.</li>
            <li> Both work the same way, they add a little more protection to your wet hair before you blow dry it.</li>
            <li> and apparently others have had the same experience.  </li>
            <li> Her hair feels like silk if she lets it dry naturally or uses a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I spritz it on after a shower and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> This may all be due to normal manufacturing differences...</li>
            <li> or perhaps the Amazon product is older or was left in storage with temperature extremes that changed the emulsion properties or broke down the essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I had tried the Prep, but hated the smell ( might have had an off bottle) but my new hairdresser, who rocks my world introduced me to the Tonic Lotion ,( &amp; apparently Prep isn&#x27;t any good for colored hair) .</li>
            <li> and so she told me to buy online directly from Bumble and Bumble, because if you buy from other places likes Target or on Amazon they might be counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Brushing this through his fur is sometimes the only thing that calms his skin long enough for him to fall asleep at night.</li>
            <li> I suppose it could be said that I notice a little &#x27;texture&#x27; added to my rather fine but thick</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry, thin, fragile, and damaged, usually super frizzy if I just let it dry/blowdry it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and about 70% white.</li>
            <li> I spray it on after I wash my hair and then blow dry and straighten with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t dry flat and lifeless</li>
            <li> The item provided by &amp;#34;BJ Beauty&amp;#34; is counterfeit, it is a fake, this is not a legitimate or genuine Bumble &amp; Bumble product.</li>
            <li> I see myself using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long?</li>
            <li> There is no strong odor and it leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Also, it tends to make my hair feel dry and wiry.</li>
            <li> All I do is brush it through while my hair is still damp, then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair with split ends,</li>
            <li> It detangles, it even seems to make my hair feel lighter if I use it on dry hair the day after I wash it.</li>
            <li> The owner said that (rumor alert) salons that are going out of business will sell their overstock to resellers, and you can end up with old bottles that are way past their expiration date.</li>
            <li> everything weighs it down and makes it look flat and greasy-even though my ends are always so dry.  </li>
            <li> I am a regular user of the B&amp;B tonic spray, which I usually buy at the local beauty supply chain.  </li>
            <li> I had a bottle with a little left over from a salon purchase, and I compared it with the Amazon bottle.  </li>
            <li> I feel cheated for having spent the money.  </li>
            <li> After trying a number of different straightening cremes, which were too heavy.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to wet my hair in the morning, instead of water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wasting my money on any other products!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to support the other bumble and bumble styling products.</li>
            <li> First Bumble and Bumble product I tried.... not really impressed with it and didn&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
            <li> I used as directed a few times and did not like the feel of my hair after it was dry.  </li>
            <li> softens my grays, and I use less of my other styling products.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Since I have the prior bottle that ran out and the new bottle sold by BJ Beauty sitting on my counter side by side, I could also see the Amazon-sold product from &amp;#34;BJ Beauty&amp;#34; was fake from small differences in the bottle printing.</li>
            <li> I spray it before blow drying to protect my hair without weighing down.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep my hair hydrated - but not oily, greasy or weighted down.</li>
            <li> flakes, red patches, &amp; irritation no more!</li>
            <li> I spray a little or a lot after shower, I comb through, I decide what other products to mess with or not</li>
            <li> Anyway, I decided to buy online on Amazon anyway because it was slightly cheaper, and I did notice a difference.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this Bumble &amp; Bumble Hair Tonic about a year and a half ago, and I have not stopped its use yet.</li>
            <li> All the other bottles I have bought in the past</li>
            <li> it makes it easier to comb but works no better than any other leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> the tea tree oil is divine - and makes your scalp tingle just a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I would consider keeping imposters if they worked for my hair, but so far they are resulting in a big, bad hair day.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizing and conditioning without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> The product I got on Amazon made my hair feel greasy and heavy, not at all like my experience at salons.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money, threw it away...</li>
            <li> The Bb tonic lotion might be totally unnecessary like cologne for the body, but for me it produces the same effect.  </li>
            <li> and this stuff is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding product for my hair-</li>
            <li> a waste of money</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling heavy and flat--something I have never experienced before from this product.  </li>
            <li> However, am sad that I bought 2 bottles,only to find that I wasted my money because this IS NOT the same solution.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few items that can detangle my unruly hair!</li>
            <li> but then it evaporates leaving my hair no more manageable, shiny or conditioned than before.  </li>
            <li> She has colored hair, very thick, somewhat curly and nearly down to her waist in length.</li>
            <li> But it was too late</li>
            <li> Total waste of money and too bad since I was hoping, since it was B&amp;B, that it would work.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I am going to see if I can return it, but I am not sure if it will even be possible  Overall, very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> In the morning or during the day, after my hair has air-dried, if I don&#x27;t like what I see, I spray a little in weird areas.</li>
            <li> I will only get it in salons and stores from now on because of our bad experience.  </li>
            <li> I have taken to misting my hair with this at least twice a day; in the morning when styling, and throughout the day just to have the experience again!</li>
            <li> I hate the effects of traditional shower conditioners, so this one is a winner.  </li>
            <li> have a wavy thin hair that is somehow manageable</li>
            <li> , i am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> The bottle I purchased from Amazon has a faint scent that is medicinal and vaguely offensive like formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a haircut at the b &amp; b academy and this is what my stylist while cutting my hair, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with or if it is just a fake product, either way, stay away!!!</li>
            <li> I suppose it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> It stopped my terrible dandruff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the way this product smells and the benefits it provides. Great to use immediately after washing your hair or as a next day refresher. Also, feels like it provides scalp benefits too. Moisturizing and conditioning without being heavy or greasy. I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> Great product for those days you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair but need a touch up blow dry!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this Bumble &amp; Bumble hair tonic from a local salon and using it for a couple of years. I would give the product based on that experience 5 stars, but based on this Amazon purchase, I give it 2 stars. I won&#x27;t go so far as to call this an \\&quot;imposter\\&quot; like another reviewer, but I do agree it is different.  It still works ok for my purposes: like other reviewers I have fine straight hair, and this product works better than water to refresh my hair between washings. I spray lightly all over my bed-head, brush it out, and then blow dry.  However, I used to be able to go 2 days without washing, but with this Amazon bottle, I can only go one day before my hair starts to look greasy. Also, one of the main reasons I first bought this product was the scent.  My salon bottles always had a strong, delightful, minty, tea tree scent that made me feel invigorated and happy. The bottle I purchased from Amazon has a faint scent that is medicinal and vaguely offensive like formaldehyde.  I had a bottle with a little left over from a salon purchase, and I compared it with the Amazon bottle.  The bottles and labels are very similar, but not identical. Further, the Amazon bottle is not as \\&quot;milky\\&quot; looking, and once shaken has a perma-froth on top, whereas the salon product&#x27;s froth soon dissolves. This may all be due to normal manufacturing differences...or perhaps the Amazon product is older or was left in storage with temperature extremes that changed the emulsion properties or broke down the essential oils.  Just speculating, but do be aware of the potential differences if you choose to purchase this product from Amazon. **Update: I decided to get another bottle from a salon and not use what I bought from Amazon. I&#x27;m back in my former B&amp;B Hair Tonic bliss...The owner said that (rumor alert) salons that are going out of business will sell their overstock to resellers, and you can end up with old bottles that are way past their expiration date. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;sthe case here, but it could explain it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years since it was introduced to me by my hairdresser. Its great for detangling without adding any oil to your hair. Also good to fluff up with a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product, not only for my own hair, but I also use it on my dog who has skin allergies. Brushing this through his fur is sometimes the only thing that calms his skin long enough for him to fall asleep at night. Thanks Bumble &amp; Bumble for making something that works and is safe enough for me to put on my precious pooch.</li>
            <li> I tend to like b &amp; b&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners more than their styling products, but you absolutely must own this. I&#x27;ve gotten a haircut at the b &amp; b academy and this is what my stylist while cutting my hair, so now I try to replicate that &#x27;salon glow&#x27; by using this every day. It (mostly) works. It&#x27;s a really low-maintenance way of making your hair look gorgeous and who doesn&#x27;t love that tingle as it hits your scalp?</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and arrived on time.  Just like going to the store-- only easier!</li>
            <li> this product is a great detangler for after the shower...adds smoothness to hair...can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my hair or style.  Directions say to use before the Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray.  I used as directed a few times and did not like the feel of my hair after it was dry.  My hair is short so maybe someone with long more tangled hair will see a difference.  I would not buy again.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My good friend, who is also my stylist, uses this in her salon and recommended it. I love it. I spray it on after I wash my hair and then blow dry and straighten with a flat iron. I have thick hair so it sounds weird to say I need more texture, but it texturizes my hair so it doesn&#x27;t just sit on my head. It kind of defines the strands, which shows off highlights. Also, because of the tea tree oil, or something like that, in it, it helps keep my hair clean longer. I can go 3-4 days between washes, which is great. I&#x27;m all about low maintenance. I see myself using this product for a long time to come. And the price here is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and it works very well. Makes the scalp feels nice and aids with styling my hair as well. I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this awesome hair spray online about a year ago after my hairstylist used it on my hair and strongly recommended it. When I was leaving I didn&#x27;t have the cash to buy it in my salon and so she told me to buy online directly from Bumble and Bumble, because if you buy from other places likes Target or on Amazon they might be counterfeit. I guess someone is diluting the formulas down to make more money, I don&#x27;t know. If you google it you can usually find more information about it, though there was much more a year ago.    Anyway, I decided to buy online on Amazon anyway because it was slightly cheaper, and I did notice a difference. The product I got on Amazon made my hair feel greasy and heavy, not at all like my experience at salons. But it was too late so I&#x27;ve just been using it. Since I don&#x27;t use the product that often I only had to buy some more now. I bought directly from Bumble and Bumble this time to compare and there is a distinct difference. What I bought from B&amp;B is light and makes my hair shine, as it should. It acts as a great moisturizer. Once I opened the bottle I could immediately smell the difference between the two products. I&#x27;m not sure what exactly is going on, but I think it&#x27;s worth the few dollars difference to buy from B&amp;B to really get what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> Bb Tonic is a great product, unfortunately not the same product when ordered through amazon.  I agree with imposter!!  Wasted my money, threw it away...</li>
            <li> Best thing for an itchy scalp. Smells nice, not overpowering. I removed the spray head and replaced it with a pour spout; otherwise, my floors and wall get all sticky. Product is much easier to use without the spray.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for four years.  It makes my hair soft and healthy looking.  I would highly reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product. I buy it for her. She has colored hair, very thick, somewhat curly and nearly down to her waist in length. This is the only product she has found that untangles her hair after washing. Her hair feels like silk if she lets it dry naturally or uses a blow dryer. This is also the best price I have found. I buy several bottles during the year and give her enough at Christmas to last the whole year. As she puts it, \\&quot;I have an arsenal of hair products that I&#x27;ve tried over the years. I&#x27;m not wasting my money on any other products!\\&quot;.  I guess I should remind her that it&#x27;s my money :-)</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of the B&amp;B tonic spray, which I usually buy at the local beauty supply chain.  I was excited to find the products for less on Amazon.  Prior to ordering, I had not seen the reviews stating that others thought it was an imposter, but I agree that it seems like a different product.  I compared it to the remaining tonic spray that I bought from the store.  The scent smells less like tea tree and more like alcohol.  It doesn&#x27;t have the same color (white) as my prior bottles.  It left my hair feeling heavy and flat--something I have never experienced before from this product.  I went onto the reviews to see if anyone else felt this and apparently others have had the same experience.  I also bought the Super Rich Conditioner and the Tonic Shampoo...the conditioner also seems off (less thick, not as nice a smell), and I have not tried the tonic shampoo yet.  Maybe they are the real thing and just old, but doesn&#x27;t seem that way.  I would consider keeping imposters if they worked for my hair, but so far they are resulting in a big, bad hair day.  I am going to see if I can return it, but I am not sure if it will even be possible  Overall, very disappointed.  It is worth it to pay a little extra for what is assuredly the real thing.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to me and I am now hooked.  Not only is it convenient to use (just spray liberally on your damp hair, comb through and blow-dry), it leaves my hair shiny and healthy!  I also love the clean, herbal fragrance that also works great as a hair refresher.</li>
            <li> I fell in LOVE with this product and had been using it for a couple years ordering it from a beauty salon in Atlanta.  Could&#x27;nt get it anymore through them....so was excited to find it offered on Amazon.   However, am sad that I bought 2 bottles,only to find that I wasted my money because this IS NOT the same solution.  It looks the same- but it leaves my hair coated and kind of heavy.   All the other bottles I have bought in the past NEVER did that.</li>
            <li> I love this tonic. But why? It smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice no other reason to use it. I am not a blow-dryer, so I see no benefit there. I spritz it on after a shower and let my hair dry naturally. I suppose it could be said that I notice a little &#x27;texture&#x27; added to my rather fine but thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel the tingle that they speak of on my scalp. But that may have more to do with the abuse my scalp has taken in 15 years of hair dyeing.</li>
            <li> The Bumble &amp; Bumble lads claim that their Bb tonic Lotion protects hair from heated tools when they&#x27;re used and that it conditions the scalp to keep it healthy, particularly when a person is not all for using conditioners.  I personally don&#x27;t know whether the Bb claims are accurate, but I certainly enjoy using the Tonic Lotion after shampooing.  It is for me, rather, a treat for the hair as part of my AM routine grooming.  I leave the house feeling clean from head to toe.  The Bb tonic lotion might be totally unnecessary like cologne for the body, but for me it produces the same effect.  As far as the \\&quot;layering\\&quot; suggested by Bumble &amp; Bumble goes, well, I just don&#x27;t know, but I am happy with my minimalist approach:  just Bb tonic lotion once a day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my Tonic Lotion for a couple of weeks, but I am already hopelessly hooked! It can be used alone (to make hair extremely soft and fragrant - think rosemary and tea tree), before products (to help the products work better than imagined), or after styling (to calm frizz/flyaways, soften hair, and re-set hold/style). I have taken to misting my hair with this at least twice a day; in the morning when styling, and throughout the day just to have the experience again! Tonic Lotion is a truly wonderful, versatile, and essential product.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. My hair is very dry and about 70% white. This leaves my hair nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t add any artificial color. My hair is tangle free and soft, ready to style.&lt;br /&gt;It softens my grays, and I use less of my other styling products. I love the smell, but if you are not a fan of tea tree oil smell you may not like it. (The odor disappears shortly after spraying).&lt;br /&gt;This is also good to use as a in between hair refresher, instead of dry shampoo (which drys my hair out). This has become a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for me since my hairdresser used it on me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few items that can detangle my unruly hair! It smells great, and I don&#x27;t notice that the smell actually stays in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I love the smell, makes me feel like I am splurging and being pampered.</li>
            <li> I suppose it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but the smell is awful. Also, it tends to make my hair feel dry and wiry. I have thick, course hair to begin with, so it may produce better results in hair that is finer mine.</li>
            <li> I have had my hair cut at a Bumble and Bumble salon in NYC for the last 5 years. The guy who cuts my hair uses this stuff all the time on my hair. Only just recently I decided to purchase this for my home use. Why did I wait so long? Besides smelling terrific, if you do not like the smell of tea tree oil, then stop right here. I love it! After you shampoo and towel dry, spritz all over hair lightly and massage into hair and scalp. Proceed with Bumble Thickening Hairspray, dry and style, you will be most happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Have used this stuff for years and it works great as a detangler.  I use it before combing out my hair and it helps to restore  your ph level before you begin styling.</li>
            <li> For the price of this item, i expected it to be a little more that what it has done for my hair. it makes it easier to comb but works no better than any other leave in conditioner. the smell is different from most other bumble and bumble products. it&#x27;s got an earthy like, woods-y, tea tree oil scent to it. something i&#x27;d imagine a hippie to smell like, which is okay but definitely not the best. i have to admit, i am a little disappointed. next time i buy a leave in conditioner, i will opt for something cheaper with a better scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble for years.  I love it!</li>
            <li> For those of you who like to add an extra step of grooming in the morning with no measurable results, look no further.  This is the product!  I have been a faithful B &amp; B user for over ten years (and have converted others to the seaweed shampoo and conditioner!) and this stuff is a waste of money.  It smells good (really good) but then it evaporates leaving my hair no more manageable, shiny or conditioned than before.  It&#x27;s like a handshake for your hair. I feel cheated for having spent the money.  Learn from my mistake!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this Bumble &amp; Bumble Hair Tonic about a year and a half ago, and I have not stopped its use yet. It smells good and helps detangle my hair, even helps to tame my frizzies, and I get better results when styling my hair. I have curly kind of dry hair, and anytime I can nourish my hair without adding any weight, I will.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my hair since using it.  The real difference was when I began spraying it liberally throughout my hair (I don&#x27;t think I was using enough at first) after towel-drying.  Since using it, my hair has more volume and just in general seems healthier and softer.  I have fine, highlighed hair. This is definitely a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; in my book now!</li>
            <li> This product is great, but this retailer sells this for a lot more than the suggested retail price. Buy from Bumble Bumble or Sephora for only $20.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE beauty product. Only a few spritz and your hair will feel so delightfully soft and look healthy and shiny. Less is more with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this after shower hair tonic.  I just spray it on my locks after a good towel dry.  All I do is brush it through while my hair is still damp, then blow dry.  It smells really good and the scent lasts even after my hair is dry.  I&#x27;ve noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t dry flat and lifeless, it has a nice feel after I use the tonic.  The only place I can find this tonic are high end salons which seem out of the way for me.  My current salon does not sell Bumble &amp; Bumble so purchasing the product here on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> There is just something about this Tonic lotion that I am loving. I had tried the Prep, but hated the smell ( might have had an off bottle) but my new hairdresser, who rocks my world introduced me to the Tonic Lotion ,( &amp; apparently Prep isn&#x27;t any good for colored hair) . Anywhos, the Tonic I spray a little or a lot after shower, I comb through, I decide what other products to mess with or not and I have soft, shiny, fresh smelling, stronger,&amp; easy to detangle hair. I also take to the beach and spray myself there too. It&#x27;s a weightless, foolproof ....tonic. It&#x27;s great for providing some extra nourishment for the hair, or a sort of \\&quot;primer\\&quot; for other styling products.I get an awesome blowdry if I comb this through, then either a lite application of  Ojon&#x27;s Thickening spray or B&amp;B&#x27;s Thickening, then grooming creme!!  Feels nice on scalp, though I haven&#x27;t really experienced any dramatic \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; as bottle states. I feel like I could live without it....but really why would  I want want to?? After the nice trial size ran dangerously low, I jumped on Amazon  for the full size bottle. Highly reccomend.  Color Care friendly.</li>
            <li> Love it! I spray it before blow drying to protect my hair without weighing down. Hair is soft and smells great. Now i get it at a cheaper price then salons.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I spray it on after a night out if I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair or when I need to freshen up the day before&#x27;s style.  It smells great and absorbs oils and stink.   I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Honestly I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It helps my hair hold whatever styling product I use more effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty low-key when it comes to my hair (stick-straight Asian hair, somewhat fine by Asian standards, but coarse by Caucasian standards), but still don&#x27;t like the kinks I get from sleeping or having my hair dry in a funny way. After trying a number of different straightening cremes, which were too heavy. My stylist at the time at the bumble+bumble salon suggested this product. I&#x27;ve been a convert ever since.     In the morning or during the day, after my hair has air-dried, if I don&#x27;t like what I see, I spray a little in weird areas. Voila, my hair is straight again. It works much, much better than using water on my hair. The scent is also pleasant, not overpowering at all.    I highly recommend this product as a quick, light spritz to keep away fly-aways, kinks and other random hair quirks that you may not want to see before you run out the door.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry, thin, fragile, and damaged, usually super frizzy if I just let it dry/blowdry it. After just ONE use of this, my hair was super shiny and really soft. It also smells nice and fresh and detangles really easily, where without it I kill my scalp ripping through my hair with a brush. It makes your scalp and hair feel refreshed and even cleaner than when you just shower/wash it and don&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it&#x27;s literally REPAIRING my hair. It used to look fried all the time and never looked healthy, but now when I let it dry with this stuff, its sleek and looks like I just got it cut! I use so much of this it&#x27;s already about gone. I spray it on my scalp, ends, and everywhere, DOUSING my hair in it, and even though I use a tonnn on my hair, it never ever looks greasy or feels sticky. Totally worth every penny, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li> use this product on my out of the shower wet hair, I have curly hair and makes it easy to comb thru when wet.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years. When I needed a new bottle recently, I decided to order from Amazon.com. The item provided by &amp;#34;BJ Beauty&amp;#34; is counterfeit, it is a fake, this is not a legitimate or genuine Bumble &amp; Bumble product. I first noticed the problem when trying to use the product - it doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the same as the genuine product. Since I have the prior bottle that ran out and the new bottle sold by BJ Beauty sitting on my counter side by side, I could also see the Amazon-sold product from &amp;#34;BJ Beauty&amp;#34; was fake from small differences in the bottle printing. The logo and printing on the bottle look a bit like a photo copy, with less detail around the edges of the text when compared with the genuine article. I am sending my counterfeit product to Bumble and Bumble because I suspect their brand people will have better luck convincing Amazon to sever its relationship with &amp;#34;BJ Beauty&amp;#34; than I will.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair with split ends, frizz etc. I just spray this stuff (liberally) on my wet hair and let it air dry, and my hair is magically smoother, finer, not frizzy but also not weighed down in the slightest. It detangles, it even seems to make my hair feel lighter if I use it on dry hair the day after I wash it. Most days it&#x27;s the only product I use in my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Item as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have, if you have curly hair.  Better than any product out there.  This is one item I must have for controlling the frizz of curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not the best for my hair, it feels good when you spray it in and comb it through but it leaves a lot of build up and makes your scalp itchy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years ever since my hair stylist recommended it.  It protects hair from damage from dryers and curling irons without leaving a buildup on your hair.  There is no strong odor and it leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use this between shampoos to bring the shape back into my hairstyle.  After wearing a ponytail, the band creates a ring around my hair.  Spraying lightly on the hair and reshaping with the blow dryer ~ bring my hairstyle back to life again.</li>
            <li> I thought this did not work or smell this the real Bumble and bumble and then I went back to the salon and bought one to confirm my suspicions.....this is a knock off. DO NOT BUY THIS!! this is not the real product.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair and cools your head and helps style your hair better after using it with cream or wax or pomade.</li>
            <li> As soon as my hair stylist sprayed this on my hair I was hooked.  It smells so good - the tea tree oil is divine - and makes your scalp tingle just a little bit.  It does a great job of detangling my thick hair but I would have bought it just for the smell alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. This is the first time ordering this from Amazon. Other than the botlte, it cannot be further from the original product. I brought this to the nearest Sephora and directly compared the two. They smell different, they feel different, the work different. Something is up.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for almost four years now.  I hate the effects of traditional shower conditioners, so this one is a winner.  Just spray and comb!  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but others may like it.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to wet my hair in the morning, instead of water. I have curly, dry hair and do not shampoo daily, so this is great to revive the curls and the style in the morning without having to add on more styling products. I just spray it on, run my fingers through and go. It leaves my hair soft and feeling healthy. It also is a great tonic for the face, as the tea tree oil is great to clear up those occasional pimples.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding product for my hair-everything weighs it down and makes it look flat and greasy-even though my ends are always so dry.  My hairdresser got me started with this and I love it!  I spray it on right after my shower, put my hair in a towel, and have even quit using any other product any more because my hair is so soft and shiny!  Much cheaper on Amazon than in salon or at Target.</li>
            <li> I love this tonic and use it every day.  It smells terrific and is great both just after shampooing and also for in refreshing my style between washes.  There is no build-up so no worries about overuse.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I never go a day without working this into my hair becuase it always leaves my hair smelling great and feeling so smooth! I used to have really damaged hair from dying and always putting it up for work but now with this product, my hair is always looking great!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin, and straight, and it tends to air-dry quickly while I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning.  I spray it with Tonic before drying it, and I get a much better blow-dry than if I had used water.  Tonic is great as a leave-in conditioner, especially when your hair is too fine to condition daily (as mine is).  Use it with Thickening Spray or Styling Creme before drying to volumize your hair.</li>
            <li> I spray this on damp hair. It stopped my terrible dandruff. I went to many dermatologists and they were ready to diagnose it as psoriasis! flakes, red patches, &amp; irritation no more!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and in the morning when I don&#x27;t have time to wash it, I spray on this Tonic and it makes my curls bounce right back and helps get rid of the bedhead flatness.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I use this product almost every day. My hair is fine and doesn&#x27;t take abuse very well. This product helps keep my hair hydrated - but not oily, greasy or weighted down. It is also great for a quick touch up once my hair is dry. It also seems to support the other bumble and bumble styling products. I swear the defrizz works better if I use this first. I don&#x27;t know about the scalp tingling bit as mentioned on the bottle, but I can definitely live without that.</li>
            <li> Use this or the Prep right after I wash my hair. Both work the same way, they add a little more protection to your wet hair before you blow dry it. Nice product to help with tangles too! And it makes your scalp feel good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for sometime and I like it a lot.  I was almost out of it and my hairdresser&#x27;s appointment is too far away, so I decided to get it on-line so that I can get it quicker. The service was fast and I am glad I have it now.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product for wet hair - use before blow drying.... Seems to assist with straightening hair or to add extra body for whatever style you are in the mood for... Lovely light and soothing scent.  Note:  I think there are two BB products which are tonics - make sure you get the one that includes the word &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> First Bumble and Bumble product I tried.... not really impressed with it and didn&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
            <li> Yucko! It&#x27;s stinky and gooey and doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair! Total waste of money and too bad since I was hoping, since it was B&amp;B, that it would work. Not so much!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My salon quit carrying it so I am thrilled that amazon offers it. Great smell. A little pricey but well worth it</li>
            <li> This is not the product advertised!  We have used the product for years on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair, but this was the first time ordering it here on Amazon. I will only get it in salons and stores from now on because of our bad experience.  This product left her hair tangled and gloppy.  I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with or if it is just a fake product, either way, stay away!!!</li>
            <li> On time. Priced about right and easy to get. Thanks</li>
            <li> Helps with detangling hair and smells good, love this product</li>
            <li> Great product.  Seller delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> This thing made my hair frizz like never before and it smells awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a wavy thin hair that is somehow manageable but this product made it look and feel like a cotton ball :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what a waste of money</li>
