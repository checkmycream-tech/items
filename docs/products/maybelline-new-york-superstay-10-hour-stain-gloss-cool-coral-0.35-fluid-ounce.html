            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a plus :)</li>
            <li>This is really more of a stain than a gloss, but it&#x27;s not sticky at all, which I care about more than it looking shiny.</li>

            <li>My daughter loved it so much that she bought more in different colors.</li>

            <li>Hoping for more, nut it was only OK.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>This stuff is super cheap with a very vibrant color.</li>
            <li>Its more of an orange-y color than a blue based red which is what is super popular these days for that vintage look</li>
            <li>This is another product that is not longer available in the stores where I live.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>This new stain is much better than the old version.  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple of applications to get the super red happening on your lips, but it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful red color and can be layered a few more times to achieve the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; red.</li>
            <li>This product does not stain and fades relatively fast.</li>
            <li>It is really in between a stain and a gloss.  </li>
            <li>My favorite colors are Mauve Dream and Pink Plush.  </li>
            <li>I really stocked up when I ordered.</li>
            <li>I also put a shiny finish after the stain because it does have a very matte finish.</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t the color I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>but anyways i got cool coral and its NOTHING like a coral its RED.</li>
            <li>However, I HIGHLY recommend Maybelline 24 Hour in Commited Coral.</li>
            <li>Love these stains, they last a long time.</li>
            <li>does look a little more red than coral when on your lips, but as the name of the product implies, it is a stain.</li>
            <li>If you apply the first coat and then wait for it to dry and repeat this method 4</li>
            <li>I love it and was very sad to find that it is no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>I hope that it will be coming back, maybe in a new package.  </li>
            <li>The color has been pretty long lasting, though with coffee, etc.</li>
            <li>So the actual natural color of your lips is going to influence how it wears.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is never dry and does not look or act like paint.  </li>
            <li> Its a good vibrant lip color but the felt tip fell off after a few applications making it awkward to use with regular lip brushes, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a total waste of money,</li>
            <li> the stain does not last as long as is states.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long and it feels as if nothing is there.</li>

            <li> It feels dry on my lips.</li>

            <li> PLAIN RED.</li>
            <li> I applied it and was very wet.  </li>
            <li> Not full coverage lipstick.</li>
            <li> If your lips are dry and flaky, your lip color will look poorly and flake off with your dry lips.</li>
            <li> Stays put for half a day usually.  </li>
            <li> I am really upset and mad about your product.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that being a stain, it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to remove, just a washcloth and water.</li>
            <li> The stain wears off in weird places and looks very uneven.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that expensive</li>
            <li> Vary bad product, not worh the price</li>

            <li> This product does not stain and fades relatively fast. But its not a bad lip gloss but you would have to reapply often.</li>
            <li> These are some of my new favorite lip products! I love the colors, pigmentation and how wearable they are. They are super glossy and gorgeous.  Will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> This new stain is much better than the old version.  It is really in between a stain and a gloss.  Stays put for half a day usually.  I have the best luck applying if I scrape most of the gloss off the applicator when I apply in, to get a nice even coat.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars even though this color did not work as well for me as the others. It was somewhat too bright for my fair complexion.  That is no reflection on the value of this great product.  It has a nice polished look when applied and the stain lives on the whole day. It is never dry and does not look or act like paint.  I love it and was very sad to find that it is no longer available in stores.  I hope that it will be coming back, maybe in a new package.  My favorite colors are Mauve Dream and Pink Plush.  I really stocked up when I ordered.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that I could wear all day and could eat and drink with and this is brilliant! It&#x27;s a beautiful red color and can be layered a few more times to achieve the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; red. I accidentally slept with it on and it was still there in the morning so it stays! It also smells really good ^_^ The only downside is that being a stain, it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to remove, just a washcloth and water. Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> Vary bad product, not worh the price</li>
            <li> I Love the way it goes on. Colors are beautiful.  I will buy more when needed. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This is another product that is not longer available in the stores where I live. It is the best lip stain for lasting color.</li>
            <li> Love it!! It lasts long and it feels as if nothing is there. The colors are beautiful. Def one of my faves.</li>
            <li> Nice color but the stain does not last as long as is states.  The color was gone within 2 hours and the directions tell about 12 hour color.  I also put a shiny finish after the stain because it does have a very matte finish.</li>
            <li> I love the lip gloss. Its very nice and a lovely color. 10/10 recommend. It is cheap and amazing. Arrived before estimation.</li>
            <li> The color is nice. However, I put the &amp;#34;10 Hour&amp;#34; lipstick on before work, giving it over an hour drying time, and it&#x27;s already gone after breakfast. However, I HIGHLY recommend Maybelline 24 Hour in Commited Coral. If I don&#x27;t remember remove it, it&#x27;s literally still on the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best recommendation is to keep your lips healthy. If your lips are dry and flaky, your lip color will look poorly and flake off with your dry lips. Hydrate and keep some lip balm in your nightstand!</li>
            <li> it was the worth experience I ever had with Maybelline if it was  free return I was returning the day I got. didn&#x27;t stay even a minute on my lip how you could advertise such this product as you say is Superstay 10 hour. I am really upset and mad about your product. I have to order different product that I alway order with Maybelline</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t the color I had hoped for. Its more of an orange-y color than a blue based red which is what is super popular these days for that vintage look so many people love. I&#x27;d suggest just avoiding this color. It did however stay on for a while. Even when I tried to remove it with makeup remover and coconut oil (yes, that&#x27;s a thing and it works wonders). It wasn&#x27;t that expensive so I&#x27;m not going to go through the hassle of returning it but will definitely not be buying this color again. If you apply the first coat and then wait for it to dry and repeat this method 4+ times it becomes more of a reddish color but still too orange for me.</li>
            <li> I give at an A+ and 5 stars. I love it. Maybelline products are always great, it stays on all day perfectly!</li>
            <li> bought this off my brothers account but anyways i got cool coral and its NOTHING like a coral its RED. PLAIN RED. and it doesnt stay on for 10 hours i think maximum was like 4 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a great product IF you use it sparingly. If you want a bold look then its eh. The stain wears off in weird places and looks very uneven. When you put it on its cool and pigmented. This product is great if you can get it on sale or cheaper than regular price. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it wasn´t as I expect</li>
            <li> Love these stains, they last a long time. Not glossy all day but still have color after eating and drinking</li>
            <li> It was just as described. My daughter loved it so much that she bought more in different colors.</li>
            <li> This was to light.  As in watery and didn&#x27;t last at all.  I applied it and was very wet.  Didn&#x27;t  like this product .</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain, I was sad to see that I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon though, so I guess that&#x27;s a plus :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is super cheap with a very vibrant color. It takes a couple of applications to get the super red happening on your lips, but it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect but it has this watery part about it but I guess that&#x27;s the stain part of stain gloss</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  It didn&#x27;t last for ten hours. I ordered the cool coral color but it looks more like cherry.  It feels dry on my lips.</li>
            <li> Hoping for more, nut it was only OK.  Dries very bright and does not last more than a few hours at best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works for 10 hours but unlike others it didn&#x27;t dry out and crack my lips.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has long hair understands the hell that is a breeze pushing your hair into sticky lip gloss. This is really more of a stain than a gloss, but it&#x27;s not sticky at all, which I care about more than it looking shiny. The color has been pretty long lasting, though with coffee, etc., I did need some reapplications throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color does look a little more red than coral when on your lips, but as the name of the product implies, it is a stain. Not full coverage lipstick. So the actual natural color of your lips is going to influence how it wears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this on sale and consider it a pretty good deal. Lovely color, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Its a good vibrant lip color but the felt tip fell off after a few applications making it awkward to use with regular lip brushes, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a total waste of money,</li>
            <li> Great price for a favorite lip stain!</li>
