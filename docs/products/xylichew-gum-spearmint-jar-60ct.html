            <li>This is the best gum!</li>

            <li>great gum  beats brushing...</li>
            <li>Great flavor for 30sec - 1min  </li>
            <li>This is quite good tasting gum.</li>
            <li>I ordered Xylichew because of the Xylitol, which is good for teeth and gums and it helps to prevent cavities.</li>
            <li>The spearmint flavor taste really good</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I can continue to chew gum, while promoting a healthy mouth</li>
            <li>I love this gum!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
            <li>nice flavour</li>
            <li>healthy and tastes good</li>
            <li>Fresh spearminty flavor, hours of chewy happiness!</li>
            <li>I really love this Gum.</li>
            <li>Label says not to use more than 10 pcs a day.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the price and good thing</li>
            <li>I like that it is sugar free and chemical free.  </li>
            <li>Great flavor that can be made to last longer by wrapping a xylitol mint in the gum.</li>
            <li>Better tasting last longer than the Peppermint which is also good</li>
            <li>the ingredients (NO aspartame) are exactly what I need to be healthy.</li>
            <li>Second time ordering ... optimum chew and flavor.</li>
            <li>The sugary sweet taste doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad the spearmint part lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Initially,  started out well flavor wise but quickly vanished.</li>
            <li>Will buy again but it won&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the spearmint flavor, as the flavor lasted a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I probably will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Made with real birch, and very tasty</li>
            <li>and I think it keeps its flavor really well.</li>
            <li>how many people I talk to I need to have it to keep my mouth wet.</li>
            <li>Wish it was still sold in natural food stores, though.</li>
            <li>It stays soft so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>Better than some other xylitol gums I have purchased, the pieces are big enough that one is sufficient.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last long, which it&#x27;s ok since I don&#x27;t usually chew gum for long periods of time anyway.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper, softer but the flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long but none of the brands of this type last very long.  </li>

            <li> I really love this Gum. I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time and the ingredients (NO aspartame) are exactly what I need to be healthy. I know some other reviewers say it doesn&#x27;t keep it flavor but I purchased the Spearmint and I think it keeps its flavor really well.</li>
            <li> Flavor lasted less than a minute. Pieces are small and the product is expensive for the small amount sold. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Better than some other xylitol gums I have purchased, the pieces are big enough that one is sufficient.  I like that it is sugar free and chemical free.  Will re-order.</li>
            <li> Great flavor that can be made to last longer by wrapping a xylitol mint in the gum.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the spearmint flavor, as the flavor lasted a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I probably will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Tried this product since I was not able to buy in my location. Initially,  started out well flavor wise but quickly vanished. Ingredient list drew me to make purchase. Will buy again but it won&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
            <li> nice flavour but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Much cheaper, softer but the flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long but none of the brands of this type last very long.  Label says not to use more than 10 pcs a day.  All sweeteners that end in &amp;#34;tol&amp;#34; such as xylitol, maltitol, sorbitol, etc. can cause diarrhea with overuse, damitol!</li>
            <li> This is the best gum! I hate it when we run out and I&#x27;m left with only the grocery store options that are full of artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> This is quite good tasting gum. The container is perfect for leaving at the office. I&#x27;m ordering more! What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I like to chew gum, but I don&#x27;t want the artificial ingredients that most gums have. I ordered Xylichew because of the Xylitol, which is good for teeth and gums and it helps to prevent cavities. The spearmint flavor taste really good but it doesn&#x27;t last long, which it&#x27;s ok since I don&#x27;t usually chew gum for long periods of time anyway. I am so happy that I can continue to chew gum, while promoting a healthy mouth and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> healthy and tastes good</li>
            <li> The taste doesn&#x27;t last long.  The gum gave me stomach cramps and kicked up some  heartburn symptoms.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who has GERD.</li>
            <li> Bought this gum on clearance at hi health  (az) it&#x27;s not bad the spearmint part lasts a while. The sugary sweet taste doesn&#x27;t but I&#x27;m ok with that. It stays soft so that&#x27;s a plus. I am a gum chewer, with my job and how many people I talk to I need to have it to keep my mouth wet. Idk if this will work for that situation but I like it. I don&#x27;t really like the price and good thing I got it for half price but I would recommend it. Anything to help lower the aspertaine intake.</li>
