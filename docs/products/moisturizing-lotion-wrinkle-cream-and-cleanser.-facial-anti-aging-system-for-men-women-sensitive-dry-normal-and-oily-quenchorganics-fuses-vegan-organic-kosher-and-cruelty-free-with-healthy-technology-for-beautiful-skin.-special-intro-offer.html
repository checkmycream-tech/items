            <li>/&gt;Oh, by the way, I think the tree-free labels are absolutely beautiful!!!</li>
            <li>rest of the line is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is not that great.</li>

            <li>LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li>The company sent me a very kind email after I purchased it, with additional information on usage.  </li>
            <li>Amazing bargain in a convenient drawstring bag!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering More of this Awesome product!!</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked nor felt as good as it does with these products.  </li>
            <li>these  seem to  do  a  good  job  of  keeping  </li>
            <li>&#x27;m very glad it&#x27;s vegan</li>
            <li>Easy to use, smell is not that great.</li>
            <li>(Kiss My Face Fragrance-Free Olive &amp; Aloe Moisturizer, also sold on Amazon), and my face has felt nice and moisturized all day (without any greasiness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs nicely and then the Erase cream I think has improved the youthfulness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and gel is so so nice as well.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s environmentally friendly!!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;QuenchOrganics fuses vegan, organic, kosher and cruelty free with healthy technology for beautiful skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>, I really love it &amp; would say to others give this product a try...</li>
            <li>(smoothed on after Quench) is really interesting.  </li>
            <li>I am going to order more (lest the price go up before I do so) and will update with my observations over a longer span of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and my husband said it reduces itching on his neck after shaving.</li>
            <li>and I also love that it has hyaluronic acid because that helps the skin retain moisture.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>LOVE ~ LOVE ~</li>
            <li>My girlfriend also stated that my skin looks more &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I noticed that if I apply the Cleanse and let it set for 5 minutes, I tend to get better results so others might want to try this as well.</li>
            <li>All I want is healthy looking skin that reflects how I feel inside.  </li>
            <li>My favorite however, is Erase.</li>
            <li>the lotion feels refreshing the</li>
            <li>A great buy, i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I believe aging is a natural and beautiful process</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered a Great new skin treatment program!!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>If I can achieve that naturally and in harmony with the planet I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this line.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions, using a warm washcloth to wipe off the cleanser (which was pretty sticky but effective and moisturizing), and then applied the moisture lock (I seem to need more than it says to use to get my whole face</li>
            <li>I have been using all of these Quench products,&amp; I can say they make my face &amp; neck feel smooth &amp; silky, seems as it has removed a lot of wrinkles that I use to see</li>
            <li>hoping it will be available again soon.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something good and natural that would not require me to put another mortgage on my house :</li>
            <li>that leaves very few choices for me,  this product makes my skin look good and feel good.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this product because of the organic Cleanse</li>
            <li>Since starting, people have told me my skin looks &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34;  and it feels really good.</li>
            <li>It felt like a cool gel and wasn&#x27;t too runny.</li>
            <li>I am new to QuenchOrganics products and like what I&#x27;ve experienced thus far.</li>
            <li>I used Olay for a long time and although I&#x27;m happy with their products I wanted to try something more natural.  </li>
            <li>The products have a very minimal, pleasant odor, and that is a huge plus in my book, and I find the packaging to be aesthetically</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels on my face because it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face greasy</li>
            <li>Overall; I am very satisfied with this purchase and at the price I paid it was a steal.</li>
            <li>; So reasonably priced too, its a Steal of a deal!!</li>
            <li>I even considered making my own creams following recipes online!</li>
            <li>far I LOVE the way these products feel on my skin</li>
            <li>I decided to try Quench after I could no longer get my last favorite product via Amazon anymore, because the company was only selling at their own site for twice the price.  </li>
            <li>, Aesthetic Solutions offers the best natural results so far for the same price as the Quench product alone.  </li>
            <li>I love the facial cream, it is thick but is well absorbed, it has a very nice smell and feel.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;We minimize packaging, use natural grass &#x27;Tree Free&#x27; labels, never tested on animals, with vegan, organic and kosher ingredients and wind powered production processes.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>Yes, these reviews are real if I&#x27;m writing one!  </li>
            <li>I have issues with dryness on areas on my face this time of year and my face is consistently smooth, hydrated, and soft.</li>
            <li>I recommend first lubbing up with the cleanser and then rinsing it off using a face cloth.  </li>
            <li>I have also used ROC and more recently tried AVANI.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is great, but different cleaning thoroughly but gently without leaving your skin overly dry.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the ingredients is very high.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>as  much  </li>
            <li>I learned that Quench was best if utilized in small quantities since a little did quite a bit.</li>
            <li>The fine lines and dry patches/flaky spots are gone!</li>
            <li>I was brought up with high end cosmetics, fed to me by my aunt.</li>
            <li>I tried everything from drug store brands to high end products to no avail.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of lines but the ones I do are clearly diminished!!  </li>
            <li>used this product last night for the first time and have already seen a difference TODAY!</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t gotten any new pimples as well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft after I use it and never greasy</li>
            <li>Other wrinkle creams irrate my sensitive skin but this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am usually not into products that require 3 steps</li>
            <li>Upon waking up, my skin is soft and not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;Brava, QuenchOrganics, and thank you for making my skin softer!</li>
            <li>but I still wanted something new and natural.  </li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING from drug store skincare lines, to high end brands found only at Nordstrom and other fine department stores.  </li>
            <li>i love the gel and the lotion but couldn&#x27;t get into the cleansing wax - it felt it clogged up my pores and was hard to wash off.</li>
            <li>Cleanse leaves skin soft, soothed, and moist but not greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00DY7SEQI QuenchOrganics anti aging Hyaluronic moisturizing sensitive]]</li>
            <li>My skin would not retain its resilience it had in my early 30&#x27;s until I used this product.</li>
            <li>and I started to get adult acne about six months ago.</li>
            <li>I naturally have oily skin</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not pursuing miracles and being young looking forever.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the trouble is with this product, but when my wife used it for the first time, it burnt her face!!</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Erase &#x27; also contains squalene which is typically NOT VEGAN.     </li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this product, especially at the current price - it seems like a steal!</li>
            <li>, I am a 28 year old male</li>
            <li>They are not bad (although AVANI is very heavy)</li>
            <li>The main thing is purchasing and using beauty, and other, products that are cruelty-free.</li>

            <li> Quench firms skin and fades the flaws without any typical sensitive skin reactions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;&amp;#62;Quench is excellent--moisturizing sensitive skin, making small wrinkles invisible by plumping skin with moisture, and leaving no residue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have  very dry  </li>
            <li> It is the icing on the cake for my face at night (it is a bit thick but fine when I apply a thin layer).</li>
            <li> Totally not cool.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding vegan (it does have beeswax in it, so some vegans might not consider it \\&quot;vegan\\&quot;), natural skincare products free of parabens and all of that nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> maybe they can alter that a little to make it &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I just started wearing these products a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;&amp;#62;Cleanse is too thick, so you may need to add a little water and shake to get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is a little thick but they are fixing that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not  sure  </li>
            <li> The  cleanser  is  a  bit  difficult  </li>
            <li> I would hope others will follow and make disgusting and unnecessary, animal testing a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> that it  is  cold  here in  Omaha.  </li>

            <li> I have been using all of these Quench products,&amp; I can say they make my face &amp; neck feel smooth &amp; silky, seems as it has removed a lot of wrinkles that I use to see, I really love it &amp; would say to others give this product a try...I use Moisturizer Organic Hyaluronic Acid, Organic Moisturizer, the wrinkle cream, moisturizing lotion &amp; I&#x27;m very glad it&#x27;s vegan</li>
            <li> NOT VEGAN!!  I bougght this for myself and for a vegan friend. The &#x27;Cleanse&#x27; and the &#x27;Erase&#x27; contain beeswax. Anything that uses animal products or by-products in NOT VEGAN. Totally not cool. I bought this over a year ago and trusted what it said. I just found out from my procrastinating friend who just started using it that the product line is NOT VEGAN.    The &#x27;Erase &#x27; also contains squalene which is typically NOT VEGAN.     The below statements are from their product description on Amazon.    \\&quot;QuenchOrganics fuses vegan, organic, kosher and cruelty free with healthy technology for beautiful skin.\\&quot;  \\&quot;We minimize packaging, use natural grass &#x27;Tree Free&#x27; labels, never tested on animals, with vegan, organic and kosher ingredients and wind powered production processes.\\&quot;    Just because something uses vegan ingredients it does NOT make it VEGAN.    I did use the product. It is not that great. I did not see an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, these reviews are real if I&#x27;m writing one!  Buy this product to get results without stripping and thinning your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&amp;#62;Cleanse is too thick, so you may need to add a little water and shake to get it out of the bottle.  No problem: Cleanse leaves skin soft, soothed, and moist but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&amp;#62;Quench is excellent--moisturizing sensitive skin, making small wrinkles invisible by plumping skin with moisture, and leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&amp;#62;Erase (smoothed on after Quench) is really interesting.  Quench firms skin and fades the flaws without any typical sensitive skin reactions.  Again, no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the current price (just under $20!), Aesthetic Solutions offers the best natural results so far for the same price as the Quench product alone.  Amazing bargain in a convenient drawstring bag!</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding vegan (it does have beeswax in it, so some vegans might not consider it \\&quot;vegan\\&quot;), natural skincare products free of parabens and all of that nasty stuff. I also like that the company is cruelty-free, and uses sustainable practices. The products have a very minimal, pleasant odor, and that is a huge plus in my book, and I find the packaging to be aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product last night for the first time and have already seen a difference TODAY! I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible!! I have issues with dryness on areas on my face this time of year and my face is consistently smooth, hydrated, and soft. The fine lines and dry patches/flaky spots are gone! I followed the directions, using a warm washcloth to wipe off the cleanser (which was pretty sticky but effective and moisturizing), and then applied the moisture lock (I seem to need more than it says to use to get my whole face and it&#x27;s probably the smallest of the containers so we&#x27;ll see how that works out...) and then the erase cream. This morning I only wiped my face with water, then applied the moisture lock, followed by my lotion (Kiss My Face Fragrance-Free Olive &amp; Aloe Moisturizer, also sold on Amazon), and my face has felt nice and moisturized all day (without any greasiness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product, especially at the current price - it seems like a steal! I am going to order more (lest the price go up before I do so) and will update with my observations over a longer span of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also left the same review here, on what appears to be the same product: [[ASIN:B00DY7SEQI QuenchOrganics anti aging Hyaluronic moisturizing sensitive]]</li>
            <li> I was brought up with high end cosmetics, fed to me by my aunt. She retired and I ran out of samples from Lancome, Elizabeth Arden and some Arbonne I used for a year. My skin would not retain its resilience it had in my early 30&#x27;s until I used this product. I love it and my husband said it reduces itching on his neck after shaving. We are on our second order.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my face because it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face greasy</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;m for anything that is organic and I also love that it has hyaluronic acid because that helps the skin retain moisture.  My skin feels very soft after I use it and never greasy and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering More of this Awesome product!! EVERYONE has Noticed a visible difference in my appearance, saying I look So much younger!! and that my skin looks Great!! I have to tell them, &amp;#34;NO! I&#x27;m NOT using botox!!  :)  I&#x27;ve discovered a Great new skin treatment program!!&amp;#34; So reasonably priced too, its a Steal of a deal!! Not to mention it&#x27;s environmentally friendly!! LOVE ~ LOVE ~ LOVE it!!  ༺♥༻</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have tried EVERYTHING from drug store skincare lines, to high end brands found only at Nordstrom and other fine department stores.  I decided to try Quench after I could no longer get my last favorite product via Amazon anymore, because the company was only selling at their own site for twice the price.  I was very impressed with how hydrating the products were without looking or feeling greasy.  NO SHINE!!!!  I wear liquid makeup and sometimes have problems with my makeup &amp;#34;rolling&amp;#34; under moisturizer - but not with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using the line for about a week and my skin is VISIBLY improved.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of lines but the ones I do are clearly diminished!!  I strongly recommend this line.  I am a convert!</li>
            <li> No allergic reaction,  makes my skin look and feel wonderful!  I am allergic to anything with petroleum  products in it,  that leaves very few choices for me,  this product makes my skin look good and feel good.  thanks.</li>
            <li> This product works great for men too, I am a 28 year old male and I started to get adult acne about six months ago. I tried everything from drug store brands to high end products to no avail. I originally bought this product because of the organic Cleanse so the Quench and Erase were just bonuses. I started using this product a week ago and can already see a difference. Not only has my acne started to disappear but I haven&#x27;t gotten any new pimples as well. My girlfriend also stated that my skin looks more &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; and refreshed. I noticed that if I apply the Cleanse and let it set for 5 minutes, I tend to get better results so others might want to try this as well. I naturally have oily skin so I only apply the Erase at night since it tends to make my skin look oily and greasy but it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and make me break out so no stars lost there. Overall; I am very satisfied with this purchase and at the price I paid it was a steal. I would defiantly recommend this product to others that have tried everything else.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, smell is not that great. Haven&#x27;t been using long enough, but my skin seems brighter and happier. The main thing is purchasing and using beauty, and other, products that are cruelty-free. I would hope others will follow and make disgusting and unnecessary, animal testing a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Very happy I discovered these products on Amazon. I care very deeply about putting all natural/organic products on my skin.  For the price this facial system CANNOT be beat.  It is a steal, literally.  The quality of the ingredients is very high.  The company sent me a very kind email after I purchased it, with additional information on usage.  They also included literature on who they were and the ingredients found in each product when it came in the mail.  I will order this over and over again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the trouble is with this product, but when my wife used it for the first time, it burnt her face!!</li>
            <li> These products are wonderful.  The cleanser is a little thick but they are fixing that.  I&#x27;m 52 and my skin has never looked nor felt as good as it does with these products.  Combine that with the fact that they are cruelty-free and organic, I&#x27;ve found my skin care regime for life!</li>
            <li> The cleanser is great, but different cleaning thoroughly but gently without leaving your skin overly dry.  I recommend first lubbing up with the cleanser and then rinsing it off using a face cloth.  I used to just rinse with water and my hands, but with this cleanser the face cloth does the trick.  The serum absorbs nicely and then the Erase cream I think has improved the youthfulness of my skin.  Other wrinkle creams irrate my sensitive skin but this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I just started wearing these products a few days ago.  I have been looking for something good and natural that would not require me to put another mortgage on my house :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and decided to give these products a try.  I used Olay for a long time and although I&#x27;m happy with their products I wanted to try something more natural.  I am a fan of Aloe Vera and other natural products so I decided it was time for me to return to nature.  I have also used ROC and more recently tried AVANI.  They are not bad (although AVANI is very heavy) but I still wanted something new and natural.  I even considered making my own creams following recipes online! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I LOVE the way these products feel on my skin so I am totally happy with continuing using them.  I believe aging is a natural and beautiful process so I&#x27;m not pursuing miracles and being young looking forever.  All I want is healthy looking skin that reflects how I feel inside.  If I can achieve that naturally and in harmony with the planet I&#x27;m happy.  And if you add affordably, I&#x27;m in heaven! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, I think the tree-free labels are absolutely beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> I  like these  products  a  lot  though  I&#x27;m  not  sure  I  will like  them  as  much  in  the summer.  I have  very dry  skin  and these  seem to  do  a  good  job  of  keeping  it  moisturized  now  that it  is  cold  here in  Omaha.  The  cleanser  is  a  bit  difficult  to  get out  of  the  bottle.</li>
            <li> I am usually not into products that require 3 steps but this proved to be thee exception. Since starting, people have told me my skin looks &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34;  and it feels really good. I love the facial cream, it is thick but is well absorbed, it has a very nice smell and feel. A great buy, i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am new to QuenchOrganics products and like what I&#x27;ve experienced thus far. It took a while to get used to the waxy feel of Cleanse but I can appreciate how it binds to dirt and moisturized my skin. I learned that Quench was best if utilized in small quantities since a little did quite a bit. It felt like a cool gel and wasn&#x27;t too runny. My favorite however, is Erase. It is the icing on the cake for my face at night (it is a bit thick but fine when I apply a thin layer). Upon waking up, my skin is soft and not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;Brava, QuenchOrganics, and thank you for making my skin softer!</li>
            <li> i love the gel and the lotion but couldn&#x27;t get into the cleansing wax - it felt it clogged up my pores and was hard to wash off. not my thing. maybe they can alter that a little to make it &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;the rest of the line is wonderful. hoping it will be available again soon. the lotion feels refreshing the and gel is so so nice as well.</li>
