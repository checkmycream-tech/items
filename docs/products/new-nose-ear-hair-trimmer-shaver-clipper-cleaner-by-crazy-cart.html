            <li>I gave it 4 starts because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>

            <li>Cheap product I wish I didn&#x27;t buy because I may as well threw my money in the trash.  </li>
            <li>The case is cheap plastic but who cares?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid and it works great</li>
            <li>Cheap &amp; flimsy</li>
            <li>For the price this trimmer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read complaints that the materials seem cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made but works.  </li>
            <li>just cheap and took FOREVER to arrive.</li>

            <li>No nose hairs are safe now, and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>Very nice trimmer - better than many more expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I guess the good thing is it&#x27;s resilient enough that all the plastic parts didn&#x27;t break when it dropped out of the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>it is a breeze, quick and clean.  </li>
            <li>No pulling, no biting from this very fast easy to use trimmer.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were expecting for the price point and performs just fine.</li>
            <li>but the job quickly and correct.</li>
            <li>Does the job but not as quickly as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>I took the gift very much!</li>
            <li>Very plastic-y and light.</li>
            <li>Which is honestly rare these days.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>but it does the job &amp; worth the $3 I paid</li>
            <li>Yes, it feels cheap in the hand, but it works well and the price is great as compared to other similar trimmers.</li>
            <li>I can say that it does its job, but it heats very fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap in price, and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will last a lifetime, but the little thing works great.  </li>
            <li>but this product compares most favorably with similar products costing a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>This item did not work when I first received it, but I took it apart and ended up repairing it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the exact opposite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described</li>
            <li>Work exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>for the price well worth it, highly recommend it</li>
            <li>have only used it once but very good so far not much to say about it</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast coming from China.</li>
            <li>not bad at all, I do like it, its just like the old disposable trimmer</li>
            <li>This little thing does the trick - amazing.  </li>
            <li>Works well for the price and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t complain too much for the price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>looks and feels very &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this trimmer if you are thinking of buying one!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is so big and bulky it doesn&#x27;t even fit in my nose.</li>
            <li>Much gentler than the straight blade trimmers.</li>
            <li>works well and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>i wish it was a little smaller or slimmer but other than that its great!</li>
            <li>I only gave three stars as this is my very first ear and nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>the sing along book elmo favorite songs was ok but it should be hard back for a 2 year old</li>
            <li>Uses a single AA battery, was very gentle when using on my nose, I&#x27;m not sure how you could get a better bang for your buck than this, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It is a little on the cheap side</li>
            <li>and it works so far, no problem.</li>
            <li>old one rolled off the sink and broke.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do the total job</li>
            <li>bought these because they are the same design of a older Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>At only a couple of bucks, not bad little trimmer.</li>
            <li>how  much will you use it will last a long time o</li>
            <li>I was about to order a different once because I thought it was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>barely does the job, but what should I expect at this price?</li>
            <li>characters on the box were confusing, but easy enough to insert batteries and turn on the power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but it already seems worth it.</li>
            <li>Works really well for the price, can&#x27; t complain for something less than three dollar with shipping.  </li>
            <li>Directions in foreign language but its not hard to put a battery in and press the start button.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s the exact opposite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described</li>
            <li> Work exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> for the price well worth it, highly recommend it</li>
            <li> have only used it once but very good so far not much to say about it</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast coming from China.</li>
            <li> not bad at all, I do like it, its just like the old disposable trimmer</li>
            <li> This little thing does the trick - amazing.  </li>
            <li> Works well for the price and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t complain too much for the price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> looks and feels very &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this trimmer if you are thinking of buying one!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so big and bulky it doesn&#x27;t even fit in my nose.</li>
            <li> Much gentler than the straight blade trimmers.</li>
            <li> works well and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> i wish it was a little smaller or slimmer but other than that its great!</li>
            <li> I only gave three stars as this is my very first ear and nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> the sing along book elmo favorite songs was ok but it should be hard back for a 2 year old</li>
            <li> Uses a single AA battery, was very gentle when using on my nose, I&#x27;m not sure how you could get a better bang for your buck than this, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the cheap side</li>
            <li> and it works so far, no problem.</li>
            <li> old one rolled off the sink and broke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do the total job</li>
            <li> bought these because they are the same design of a older Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> At only a couple of bucks, not bad little trimmer.</li>
            <li> how  much will you use it will last a long time o</li>
            <li> I was about to order a different once because I thought it was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> barely does the job, but what should I expect at this price?</li>
            <li> characters on the box were confusing, but easy enough to insert batteries and turn on the power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but it already seems worth it.</li>
            <li> Works really well for the price, can&#x27; t complain for something less than three dollar with shipping.  </li>
            <li> Directions in foreign language but its not hard to put a battery in and press the start button.</li>
            <li> The trimmer kind of lags a bit and slows down and speeds up which is weird.</li>
            <li> The thing makes quite a bit of noise and doesn&#x27;t look like it will last long.</li>
            <li> Top attachment is constantly falling off, and I afraid it might fall into drain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ran through my nose twice and still saw long hair, so maybe I&#x27;m doing it</li>
            <li> Foreign (Chinese?)</li>
            <li> THROW it in the TRASH, it&#x27;s priced so you won&#x27;t bother to return,DO NOT CLIP ANY SINGLE HAIR...</li>
            <li> This is such a poor product that the battery went into melt down over night with the unit in the OFF position, left a white powder residue all over the exterior of the unit which led me to open the battery cap to find that the battery ruptured, ergo DANGER</li>
            <li> Love it not as painful as tweezers</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these since they were for sale at my local 99 cent store for .99 cents each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up the few I have bought but will seek out to buy a stronger, longer lasting trimmer.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> My advice, pay a few extra bucks and get a brand name.</li>
            <li> Works well but be careful that you do not drop it.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quicker than I expected as well.</li>
            <li> It works for other people but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> And this is pretty mediocre.</li>
            <li> Well, they do the trick,,,,great bargain.... ,,,,,,,,, ,,,not sure i understand about the issue of getting pieces back up into the motor.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is they all seem to be made at the same factory!(yeah, right)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> did a below average job.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for so build quality seems a little lack luster</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the $2.50.</li>
            <li> cheap piece of crap, broke after a month</li>
            <li> and I was not comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this product its a waste of money!</li>
            <li> The pieces are cheap as possible and quality so bad only China could have done worst.  </li>
            <li> but it looks less painful to use on ears and nose than the personal trimmers they make for women</li>
            <li> I can only say that it rips the hairs out as oppose to cutting them.  </li>
            <li> After using it several times, it seems to have stopped cutting the hairs even though it was still spinning.  </li>
            <li> Slightly slow shipping</li>
            <li> so you have to get down and dirty to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> assumed because it didn&#x27;t have a brand name behind the product that it would be underpowered</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this.</li>
            <li> Always had trouble cutting nose and eat hairs, with this cutter</li>
            <li> The product came in time but arrived damaged and broken.</li>
            <li> The shaving piece is very shallow</li>
            <li> The trimmer works for 2 times then the blades becomes dull &amp; pulls on my nose hairs instead of cutting them &amp; the motor continuously stops before the job is done.</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> did not work at all on nose hair trimming, was disappointed</li>
            <li> Crap!!!!</li>
            <li> Disgusting!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What a great trimmer for the price. Amazon.com you did it again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Does..exactly..what..its..suppose..to..do..fast..shipping.</li>
            <li> Quality is so-so. Top attachment is constantly falling off, and I afraid it might fall into drain.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do. It&#x27;s cheap, and the craftsmanship is cheap too, but that&#x27;s what you get for the price.</li>
            <li> only 4 stars because it is not rechargeable.  Otherwise it works just as good as my Braun trimmer.  I use it for eyebrows, ear, and most important nose.</li>
            <li> Works well for the price and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Love it not as painful as tweezers</li>
            <li> Keeps my nose hair-free and was so cheap. Still works 5 uses later</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!! Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer great price. Doesn&#x27;t come with battery</li>
            <li> I like this for the $ its  good  how  much will you use it will last a long time o&lt;br /&gt;If you dont cut the hair on your head</li>
            <li> I like this product it does the trick and was very cheap however, it took forever to get it; I thought they forgot.</li>
            <li> Works. Took forever to get delivered...</li>
            <li> At only a couple of bucks, not bad little trimmer. I guess we will see how it holds up over time. It did however to forever to arrive, so if your nose hairs need immediate attention, don&#x27;t hold your breath waiting on this to arrive before a month or so</li>
            <li> Great value n easy to use</li>
            <li> I only gave three stars as this is my very first ear and nose hair trimmer so I am not sure what to expect.  I can only say that it rips the hairs out as oppose to cutting them.  I don&#x27;t know if trimming is supposed to do that or not.</li>
            <li> works for its intended purpose, a cheapy but does the job.</li>
            <li> This one work better then that expensive one I have it before.</li>
            <li> best trimmer I ever had and price is right</li>
            <li> Works good and great price!</li>
            <li> Cheap. Works. Still working. No complaints.</li>
            <li> The thing makes quite a bit of noise and doesn&#x27;t look like it will last long. However, I can&#x27;t complain too much for the price.</li>
            <li> It works for other people but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I guess its that popular phrase, &amp;#34;You get what you spend.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As described and pictured. Very pleased with the results. Worked great. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Quit after a while froze up.</li>
            <li> Not too fancy but this product compares most favorably with similar products costing a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;I  recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Cheap but worked get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This little thing does the trick - amazing.  Took forever to arrive but very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> it probably is.  This item did not work when I first received it, but I took it apart and ended up repairing it. I did repeatedly have to fiddle with it to make it work. After using it several times, it seems to have stopped cutting the hairs even though it was still spinning.  Then I knocked it on the floor, and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all no matter what I do. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the $2.50.</li>
            <li> There are more expensive trimmers, but the $$$ thing doesn&#x27;t seem to matter with these rotatory cutters. They seem to have similar results in the upper and lower price range.( I have experienced both.) My only real complaint is they all seem to be made at the same factory!(yeah, right)&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line, these puppies cut through ear and nose hair like, hair! Fantastic..</li>
            <li> good to remove nose hair just buy it not bad try to used it  you will love it yes  .</li>
            <li> The pieces are cheap as possible and quality so bad only China could have done worst.  You get what you pay for.  It lasted me about 1 month until I dropped it on a vinyl floor.</li>
            <li> Which is honestly rare these days.  It&#x27;s cheap in price, and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will last a lifetime, but the little thing works great.  Exactly what we were expecting for the price point and performs just fine.</li>
            <li> THROW it in the TRASH, it&#x27;s priced so you won&#x27;t bother to return,DO NOT CLIP ANY SINGLE HAIR...</li>
            <li> Only used once but the job quickly and correct. Wish there was more trimmer head options. Shipping was pretty fast coming from China.</li>
            <li> This clipper is built out of cheap junky plastic But it works a hell of a lot better than the $40 trimmer I had before this. well worth the money</li>
            <li> This is such a poor product that the battery went into melt down over night with the unit in the OFF position, left a white powder residue all over the exterior of the unit which led me to open the battery cap to find that the battery ruptured, ergo DANGER</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 starts because it was cheap. I&#x27;d give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s cheaply made. Very plastic-y and light. I dropped it and it broke apart. I was about to order a different once because I thought it was completely unusable. I took my time and put it back together and it works so far, no problem. I guess the good thing is it&#x27;s resilient enough that all the plastic parts didn&#x27;t break when it dropped out of the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> did not work at all on nose hair trimming, was disappointed</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that I assumed would be a piece of garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed because it didn&#x27;t have a brand name behind the product that it would be underpowered but it&#x27;s the exact opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy 4 or 5 of these for the same price that you would have purchased 1 of a brand name product.</li>
            <li> good value for the money</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer - better than many more expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> looks and feels very &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Slightly slow shipping but it does the job it&#x27;s made for. No nose hairs are safe now, and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> have only used it once but very good so far not much to say about it but it works fine.</li>
            <li> the sing along book elmo favorite songs was ok but it should be hard back for a 2 year old</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these since they were for sale at my local 99 cent store for .99 cents each. The trimmer works for 2 times then the blades becomes dull &amp; pulls on my nose hairs instead of cutting them &amp; the motor continuously stops before the job is done. I&#x27;ve used up the few I have bought but will seek out to buy a stronger, longer lasting trimmer.</li>
            <li> Has been working fine for one month&lt;br /&gt; Good value.</li>
            <li> Fast delivered, very nice!</li>
            <li> Works like it should. A good inexpensive option. Shipping takes forever, so gotta be patient.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected. Its works, it was cheap and will do the job just fine. Worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> My husband is impressed with this little gadget.</li>
            <li> Cheap product I wish I didn&#x27;t buy because I may as well threw my money in the trash.  Do not buy this product its a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Terrific.</li>
            <li> Crap!!!! Didnt even work when we got it. Threw it away!!!</li>
            <li> I slipped in a battery and it roared to life and trimmed every little hair from my nose and ears perfectly.  The case is cheap plastic but who cares?  It&#x27;s solid and it works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Took several weeks to deliver from China.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described</li>
            <li> cheap piece of crap, broke after a month</li>
            <li> Cheap &amp; flimsy but it does the job &amp; worth the $3 I paid</li>
            <li> For the price this trimmer is fantastic. I&#x27;ve used it on my nose and ears and it trimmed well with no tugging or pincing.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this. Would not even cut the nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Simple trimmer, works well.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son. He says it does a good job.</li>
            <li> barely does the job, but what should I expect at this price?</li>
            <li> Simple, affordable and it works.  I&#x27;ve read complaints that the materials seem cheap.  They are but I didn&#x27;t buy it to caress it, I bought it to trim hair.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works as it should. It is a little on the cheap side but hey, what do you expect?</li>
            <li> works as good as advertised...I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> not bad at all, I do like it, its just like the old disposable trimmer I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just glad that this trimmer works.</li>
            <li> You know what they you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Does the job without pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> Good product, works fine with no problems. Foreign (Chinese?) characters on the box were confusing, but easy enough to insert batteries and turn on the power.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  Cheaply made but works.  Not the best wbut will do in a tight pinch.</li>
            <li> I have never used one of these before, so an instruction booklet would have been nice, but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> just cheap and took FOREVER to arrive. My advice, pay a few extra bucks and get a brand name.</li>
            <li> Works great. Better than one I paid much more for.</li>
            <li> Works really well for the price, can&#x27; t complain for something less than three dollar with shipping.  It doesn&#x27;t seem really worth it, good for the longer hairs that come out your nose but you&#x27;ll need to use it again soon. Has a weird smell after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Excellent, does the job..</li>
            <li> Feels cheap. But works good and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Cheap and crappy. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but it already seems worth it.</li>
            <li> No pulling, no biting from this very fast easy to use trimmer. Would highly recommend this trimmer if you are thinking of buying one!</li>
            <li> And this is pretty mediocre. Will serve the purpose, but I&#x27;ll still rely on an ancient Panasonic I own. Guess I should&#x27;ve bought a pricier one.</li>
            <li> Does the job but not as quickly as I&#x27;d like.  Seems underpowered.</li>
            <li> substandard, you will try it once and throw it in the trash, it&#x27;s priced so you won&#x27;t bother to return it &amp; no way would you want another one.</li>
            <li> lasted for 6 months. just stopped working. did a below average job.</li>
            <li> feels very cheap (because its priced very cheap) does the job, and doesnt hurt my husband.</li>
            <li> Used it. It is working for me. good for the price. I found it safe to use. liked the product.</li>
            <li> I only gave it one star because I couldn&#x27;t give it a zero. This product arrived in a damaged box with hair on it. Disgusting!!!! I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Works great. You get what you pay for so build quality seems a little lack luster but at this price you cant pass it up. Recommended.</li>
            <li> this does what it says works great and its real light.  no fuss no muss. i wish it was a little smaller or slimmer but other than that its great!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so big and bulky it doesn&#x27;t even fit in my nose. I don&#x27;t think petite women are their target market.</li>
            <li> Price so low almost unbelieveable.</li>
            <li> Always had trouble cutting nose and eat hairs, with this cutter it is a breeze, quick and clean.  I ordered 3 more for friends.</li>
            <li> With shipping I paid $4.05 for this item and it works great. Uses a single AA battery, was very gentle when using on my nose, I&#x27;m not sure how you could get a better bang for your buck than this, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Well, they do the trick,,,,great bargain.... ,,,,,,,,, ,,,not sure i understand about the issue of getting pieces back up into the motor. if pieces are going to move, they are going to be blown back-out the exhaust.</li>
            <li> These clippers were so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;But they work .&lt;br /&gt;I got 3 for $7 bucks with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A US company couldn&#x27;t make the boxes these go in for that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because they are the same design of a older Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;That old one rolled off the sink and broke.&lt;br /&gt;You would think they would design these more square then round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work okay . Good night what do you want.... they&#x27;re just nose hair clippers!</li>
            <li> perfect for the guy who likes to stay groomed.  I haven&#x27;t used it but it looks less painful to use on ears and nose than the personal trimmers they make for women</li>
            <li> Product does what it says it will. Great price, couldnt find the price anywhere else, and especially not in store. The trimmer kind of lags a bit and slows down and speeds up which is weird. Directions in foreign language but its not hard to put a battery in and press the start button.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and very good value.</li>
            <li> Yes, it feels cheap in the hand, but it works well and the price is great as compared to other similar trimmers.</li>
            <li> good price...fine quality</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the money.</li>
            <li> Great for the money &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Broke apart at 1st start up.. IT&#x27;s Simply a POS</li>
            <li> Works well but be careful that you do not drop it.  I did and I ended up using glue to fix it.  Works great now</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and cheaply made, but seems to get the job done.  Much gentler than the straight blade trimmers.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  It doesn&#x27;t really do the total job but it gets some of it.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a better quality one now.</li>
            <li> The product came in time but arrived damaged and broken.</li>
            <li> works well and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Cheap and does the job</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> Super cheap product, almost too good to be true. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Light and durable... easy to use and easy on the pocket book.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  Work exactly as described.  Shipped quicker than I expected as well.</li>
            <li> This works great, and for a great price!</li>
            <li> It works for a great price. But it doesn&#x27;t work that well. The shaving piece is very shallow so you have to get down and dirty to get all the hair. I&#x27;ve ran through my nose twice and still saw long hair, so maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, no complaints. It feels like a great purchase and I encourage you to try i for just $2 (Gotta wait a couple weeks for shipment but whatever)</li>
            <li> Works great and gets the hairs out.</li>
            <li> very good product I took the gift very much!</li>
            <li> gets the job done at a great price,, very good value for money</li>
            <li> This product works perfect,......for the price well worth it, highly recommend it i dont no why i have to add more words !</li>
            <li> I can say that it does its job, but it heats very fast and I was not comfortable using it.</li>
