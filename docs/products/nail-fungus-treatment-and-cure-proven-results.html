            <li>Good product.</li>

            <li>It does all that the people said it would do and MORE!</li>
            <li>The most effective one yet!</li>
            <li>awesome product, guaranteed, fast results</li>
            <li>I has a pleasant smell, goes on easy with the brush applicator.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and takes 30 seconds per use.  </li>
            <li>(just waiting for the healthy parts to grow all the way out).  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you are diligent with applying it.</li>
            <li>Nothing from any retail stores or pharmacies is able to fight nail fungus</li>
            <li>Now he&#x27;s worried that he can&#x27;t order more.</li>
            <li>However I am hopeful that this product will work! :)</li>
            <li>Great product - really works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad something otc works.  </li>
            <li>The fungus seems to be giving way to a healthy looking nail.</li>
            <li>but I havent used it for a very significant amount of time</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions, (make sure to follow them).</li>
            <li>This product has been providing me with very nice results so far.</li>
            <li>I would just recommend to file your nails and clean them before applying this product, and you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li>I hav hope for a full healthy nail after 25 years.</li>
            <li>Did not realy help, maybe if you have a more mild case</li>
            <li>I am so happy that an all natural product was actually more effective than a big pharma product!</li>
            <li>I have noticed improvement most of the way through the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>Would have given it 5 stars but the last bottle keeps solidifying, needs warm water bath before every application, more of an inconvenience than anything else.  </li>
            <li>Top wasn&#x27;t on very well when i received it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different products, and this is the best so fs (especially at the price) .</li>
            <li>The effort is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Winning the battle so far.  </li>
            <li>Have tried several different products, this has been by far the best.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a real set of instructions, the most important part is to file down the nail a good as possible..</li>
            <li>I checked the ingredients of this product against a prescription I tried from my doctor  -- same ingredient, just more powerful.  </li>
            <li>It actually has worked better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li>It started curing my problem from the first application.</li>
            <li>I just  ordered 2 more bottles and plan on continuing religiously to use this treatment twice a day.</li>
            <li>I am at the end of my first bottle, started in June, 2014, and all 5 infected toes are clearing up.  </li>
            <li>Before this product I have tried many different one but none seem to have the results that this one does.</li>
            <li>It appears to work, but easy setbacks can occur where the toenail fungus grows back in one day and eliminates a month&#x27;s worth of work with the product.  </li>
            <li>This is the first thing to really work on my husband&#x27;s athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li>my toesnail appear to be growing in much clearer now.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>it REALLY works, I have had nail fungus for years.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 6 months faithfully and have now seen my toes look normal for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to be working, will need to order another bottle</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions on the package, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell, but the product really works.</li>
            <li>This is a real fungul nail treatment.</li>
            <li>I received this product fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really would like to review this again in three months, but after the first month, and I have been following instructions, it seems to be the first product I have tried of many where there is a slow but sure improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased a second bottle to make sure I clear up the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Jeff</li>
            <li>if possible allow to soak in for 1/2 hr &amp; re-apply then put on clean sock&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This product, as well as many others like it, requires constant daily use.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes that I will get rid of my toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, use religiously and you will see results in 3 months, ordered 3 more bottles, very surprised I found something that finally kills this embarrassing fungus.....</li>
            <li>Only I&#x27;m not crazy is when opening bottle, some of liquid does come on cap &amp; smell gets on hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a toenail removed due to this issue, and was heartbroken to see the nail return to it&#x27;s original state.</li>
            <li>This product will take others longer if they are starting out first time.</li>
            <li>I have tried a dozen other products and this is the first one to really show some results.  </li>
            <li>It just comes loose right away.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>so I think if I do it again it will clear up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly all the OTC products with no results.</li>
            <li>This product may help to reduce the fungus growth, but it has not killed the fugus.  </li>
            <li>so as far as i can tell this product seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>, Just buy this product &amp; you&#x27;ll be all set,, can&#x27;t wait til the old nail grows out..</li>
            <li>The smell is not great, but it appears to have been effective.  </li>
            <li>Any nail fungus treatment takes a long time to work, a whole new nail has to grow out.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked like no other product I&#x27;ve tried on what has been a 20+ year problem for me.</li>
            <li>I saw a major improvement in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Eight of ten nails had significant fungal infection, now down to three nails only.  </li>
            <li>this is a great alternative than taking drugs which are really bad for the liver.  </li>
            <li>Wow, it actually works!</li>
            <li>Also, the top doesn&#x27;t stay tight no matter how tight you screw it on.</li>
            <li>I used  this  treatment regularly twice a day and saw a marked improvement after several weeks.</li>

            <li> this is a great alternative than taking drugs which are really bad for the liver.  </li>
            <li> Wow, it actually works!</li>
            <li> Also, the top doesn&#x27;t stay tight no matter how tight you screw it on.</li>
            <li> I used  this  treatment regularly twice a day and saw a marked improvement after several weeks.</li>
            <li> After two years of use it doesn&#x27;t totally get rid of the fungus, but controls it fairly well, preventing fungal outbreaks on other parts of the foot and the nail doesn&#x27;t look too bad.</li>
            <li> This product would probably work all the time if you didn&#x27;t do anything for 6 months and just applied the product each day - no exercise, no long stretches with closed shoes, no direct sunlight on the infected toe.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time but then, I ignored the fungus problem for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I filed down  my  nails as instructed and put on the different products  but could not get  the entire fungus cured.</li>
            <li> I do continue to use it once a day or every other day, to keep it from coming back.</li>
            <li> The problem then passed to my other big toe, &amp; I was in despair.</li>
            <li> I have had a pretty nasty nail for some time now and tried many products to no avail and was told I should try a laser procedure</li>
            <li> just keep filing down the dried fungus and just waiting for the nail to completely grow out.</li>
            <li> Make sure you trim away as much diseased nail as you can, and allow the fungicide to soak in for a few minutes before putting on socks if you can.</li>
            <li> I am hoping in a few months I can come back with a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day with absolutely no effect in reducing nail fungus.</li>
            <li> I will order again since it works as well as other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> i have suffered from toenail fungus for quite some time now due to an accident that caused me to lose a toenail.  </li>
            <li> Having tried laser treatment  for nail fungus, which did not work, I searched for other cures.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients are tea tree oil and emu oil which are bacteriostatic and get rid of those pimple bacteria.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical this would work, but after a few weeks, 2x a day, I&#x27;m finally seeing actual growth of nail &amp; diminishing of white debris under nail.  </li>
            <li> down your nails and put it one twice a day for 3 to 5 months</li>
            <li> since my nails were already filed down I have used fungiban for one week and my nails are 98% cured.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful, but willing to try anything after 15 years of fungus on one big toe.</li>
            <li> Probably waited too long to get serious about treatment, trimming nails, keeping product on, etc.  </li>
            <li> I struggled with one toe nail that had a fungus for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I had doctors recommend removing my toe nail, as I&#x27;d end up with infection in my toe a few times a year.  </li>
            <li> Note that it does take a few months of usage as your toe nail grows out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few for my mother and daughters.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times, and every time I use it I can see the results.</li>
            <li> Your nails will start to look healthier after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just gotten a few day&#x27;s ago..</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about one week now and very slightly started seeing results.  </li>
            <li> even a few thing&#x27;s from the podiatrist, with very little</li>
            <li> I have had a toe fungus issue for the past 9 years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I can put nail polish and still continue to treat.</li>
            <li> They expect you to apply it 3 times per day at least 30 minutes before putting on socks.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day, and the problem has almost gone away entirely over the last couple months, even on the worst toenail.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what a few month&#x27;s of this product can do!!!..</li>
            <li> It has a smell, but could be worse.  </li>
            <li> I am applying as recommended 3 times a day and keeping the nail filed very very thin</li>
            <li> but that is very expensive</li>
            <li> I really am shocked, considering the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Very disappointed it did not work</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Top wasn&#x27;t on very well when i received it and i feel some of the liquid had leaked out because the product inside was a solid gel and it was oily inside the package. Also, the top doesn&#x27;t stay tight no matter how tight you screw it on. It just comes loose right away. Yet to be seen if it actually works.</li>
            <li> Wow, it actually works! I really am shocked, considering the ingredients.  But my toe problem is almost all the way gone (just waiting for the healthy parts to grow all the way out).  Just make sure you are diligent with applying it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month.  I have seen a lot of improvement, but it has not cured it yet.  It actually has worked better than anything else I have used.  I am hoping in a few months I can come back with a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful, but willing to try anything after 15 years of fungus on one big toe. I&#x27;ve tried nearly all the OTC products with no results. Make sure you trim away as much diseased nail as you can, and allow the fungicide to soak in for a few minutes before putting on socks if you can. It has a smell, but could be worse.  Any nail fungus treatment takes a long time to work, a whole new nail has to grow out. Prescription topicals take up to a year, so don&#x27;t be in a hurry.  After two years of use it doesn&#x27;t totally get rid of the fungus, but controls it fairly well, preventing fungal outbreaks on other parts of the foot and the nail doesn&#x27;t look too bad.</li>
            <li> This product may help to reduce the fungus growth, but it has not killed the fugus.  I will order again since it works as well as other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> awesome product, guaranteed, fast results</li>
            <li> i have suffered from toenail fungus for quite some time now due to an accident that caused me to lose a toenail.  I have tried everything on the market to no avail.  my toesnail appear to be growing in much clearer now.  so as far as i can tell this product seems to be helping. thanks</li>
            <li> IF YOU follow the directions it REALLY works, I have had nail fungus for years.  It&#x27;s finally gone!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;File down your nails and put it one twice a day for 3 to 5 months and it really works.</li>
            <li> This product, as well as many others like it, requires constant daily use.  It appears to work, but easy setbacks can occur where the toenail fungus grows back in one day and eliminates a month&#x27;s worth of work with the product.  This product would probably work all the time if you didn&#x27;t do anything for 6 months and just applied the product each day - no exercise, no long stretches with closed shoes, no direct sunlight on the infected toe.  I don &#x27;t have the answer, but combining this treatment with laser may be the way to go (laser needs help too).</li>
            <li> I have had a toe fungus issue for the past 9 years.  I have tried everything, including over the counter as well as something recommended by a podiatrist. Nothing really worked.  However this DID.  I used it for 6 months faithfully and have now seen my toes look normal for the first time in years. I am so happy that an all natural product was actually more effective than a big pharma product!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used. It does all that the people said it would do and MORE! For years I fought nail fungus and I found nothing to get rid of it, until now. It started curing my problem from the first application. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked like no other product I&#x27;ve tried on what has been a 20+ year problem for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  I saw a major improvement in about 2 weeks. Nothing from any retail stores or pharmacies is able to fight nail fungus so that&#x27;s why I tried this product.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients of this product against a prescription I tried from my doctor  -- same ingredient, just more powerful.  The smell is not great, but it appears to have been effective.  I&#x27;m on my way to total repair of the toenail.</li>
            <li> I really would like to review this again in three months, but after the first month, and I have been following instructions, it seems to be the first product I have tried of many where there is a slow but sure improvement.  I hope it continues,  I bought three bottles, each one should last about six  weeks since I have six infected,  Will report again in three months,  and am hopeful the progress will continue.</li>
            <li> I struggled with one toe nail that had a fungus for a few years.  I had doctors recommend removing my toe nail, as I&#x27;d end up with infection in my toe a few times a year.  After trying lots of different products, I tried this one and it worked at solving my symptoms.  Note that it does take a few months of usage as your toe nail grows out.  I do continue to use it once a day or every other day, to keep it from coming back.</li>
            <li> Have tried several different products, this has been by far the best.  Probably waited too long to get serious about treatment, trimming nails, keeping product on, etc.  Eight of ten nails had significant fungal infection, now down to three nails only.  Would have given it 5 stars but the last bottle keeps solidifying, needs warm water bath before every application, more of an inconvenience than anything else.  Hope it works for you</li>
            <li> Used it for about a month and ive seen a bit of improvement. Still hasnt gone away but I havent used it for a very significant amount of time so I think if I do it again it will clear up</li>
            <li> This is the first thing to really work on my husband&#x27;s athlete&#x27;s foot. It made a huge difference in a few weeks. Now he&#x27;s worried that he can&#x27;t order more.</li>
            <li> It really seems to be working, will need to order another bottle soon.&lt;br /&gt;I just keep filing down the dried fungus and just waiting for the nail to completely grow out.</li>
            <li> worked well on my fingernail which seemed to have a yellowish fungus. this is a great alternative than taking drugs which are really bad for the liver.  I also used this on pimples! The active ingredients are tea tree oil and emu oil which are bacteriostatic and get rid of those pimple bacteria. Just dab with a q tip.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions on the package, it works very well.  I don&#x27;t like the smell, but the product really works.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day with absolutely no effect in reducing nail fungus. I&#x27;m Very disappointed it did not work</li>
            <li> The most effective one yet! Having tried laser treatment  for nail fungus, which did not work, I searched for other cures. I used  this  treatment regularly twice a day and saw a marked improvement after several weeks. I recently stopped and I believe the fungus may have re-appeared.  I just  ordered 2 more bottles and plan on continuing religiously to use this treatment twice a day. The effort is worth it.  Use this regularly and generously.</li>
            <li> I have tried a dozen other products and this is the first one to really show some results.  I followed the instructions and within 2 days, I could tell it meant business.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me after religious use.  It did nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a toenail removed due to this issue, and was heartbroken to see the nail return to it&#x27;s original state. The problem then passed to my other big toe, &amp; I was in despair. I tried tea tree oil, which didn&#x27;t work at all for me (but did work for a friend). I am ecstatic to report that this product actually works. I use it once a day, and the problem has almost gone away entirely over the last couple months, even on the worst toenail. I am too thrilled for words to have found this product!</li>
            <li> I am giving this 3.5 stars now...because i just started using the product.  I have been using it for about one week now and very slightly started seeing results.  I am applying as recommended 3 times a day and keeping the nail filed very very thin so the product can soak in.....I will follow back up in December as I am giving it a 4 month trial.  I have had a pretty nasty nail for some time now and tried many products to no avail and was told I should try a laser procedure but that is very expensive, no ins coverage and no gaurantees it will work.........However I am hopeful that this product will work! :)</li>
            <li> it works!  don&#x27;t buy it at the podiatrist ... buy it here instead...</li>
            <li> works great but must use many times a day</li>
            <li> Great product - really works well.</li>
            <li> Winning the battle so far.  Takes diligence and daily applications.</li>
            <li> This formula actually works.  It takes a long time but then, I ignored the fungus problem for a long time.  I am at the end of my first bottle, started in June, 2014, and all 5 infected toes are clearing up.  I use it twice a day.  It is very easy to apply and takes 30 seconds per use.  I have purchased a second bottle to make sure I clear up the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Jeff R.</li>
            <li> Great product! This is a real fungul nail treatment.</li>
            <li> This thing made my toes DARKER than they already were. They expect you to apply it 3 times per day at least 30 minutes before putting on socks. Gook luck if you have a job and a life.</li>
            <li> I have noticed improvement most of the way through the first bottle.  On to the next.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Did nothing for me. Fungi-nail - both pen and brush form - worked. I&#x27;m actually seeing improvement after two months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks and it looks like it might be working. I has a pleasant smell, goes on easy with the brush applicator. I have high hopes that I will get rid of my toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> I received this product fast.  I have purchased a few for my mother and daughters.  I will purchase again from this user.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every product on the market including tea tree oil. I filed down  my  nails as instructed and put on the different products  but could not get  the entire fungus cured. since my nails were already filed down I have used fungiban for one week and my nails are 98% cured. another week and it will be 100% cured. The product is great. This product will take others longer if they are starting out first time. Follow instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Did not help in solving my foot fungi......bad product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products, and this is the best so fs (especially at the price) . Easy to follow directions, (make sure to follow them). my nails are definately improving. Keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t an overnight remedy, as your uninfected nails need to grow out.</li>
            <li> Did not realy help, maybe if you have a more mild case</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times, and every time I use it I can see the results. Your nails will start to look healthier after a few uses. Before this product I have tried many different one but none seem to have the results that this one does. I would just recommend to file your nails and clean them before applying this product, and you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical this would work, but after a few weeks, 2x a day, I&#x27;m finally seeing actual growth of nail &amp; diminishing of white debris under nail.  I&#x27;m glad something otc works.  Not sure if I can put nail polish and still continue to treat. Only I&#x27;m not crazy is when opening bottle, some of liquid does come on cap &amp; smell gets on hand.  So I just use tissue to open &amp; close.</li>
            <li> This product has been providing me with very nice results so far. The fungus seems to be giving way to a healthy looking nail. I hav hope for a full healthy nail after 25 years.</li>
            <li> I was fighting a losing battle over the last 4 year&#x27;s with  a nail infection on my 2 big toes..I&#x27;ve tried everything the local stores had to sell me..even a few thing&#x27;s from the podiatrist, with very little result&#x27;s..&lt;br /&gt;This Fungi-ban product.. I&#x27;ve just gotten a few day&#x27;s ago..&amp; I noticed Immediate result&#x27;s over night..It comes with a real set of instructions, the most important part is to file down the nail a good as possible.. use 2~3 x&#x27;s a day..use a good tinactan spray for youre shoes to kill any fungi spores that are in there..I can&#x27;t wait to see what a few month&#x27;s of this product can do!!!.. the applicator is great..if possible allow to soak in for 1/2 hr &amp; re-apply then put on clean sock&#x27;s..Finally a Product on the market that does what it say&#x27;s it will do..very happy pleased,it does have a bit of an odor to it, but so what..It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve seen thus far!!!If you have the same Issue, Just buy this product &amp; you&#x27;ll be all set,, can&#x27;t wait til the old nail grows out.. don&#x27;t miss any applications also..</li>
            <li> This stuff works, use religiously and you will see results in 3 months, ordered 3 more bottles, very surprised I found something that finally kills this embarrassing fungus.....</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast delivery. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
