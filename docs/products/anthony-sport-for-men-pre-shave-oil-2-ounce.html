    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This must be the best oil I have ver used.</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Smells great too!  </li>
            <li>it is incredible shaving oil i ever seen,</li>
            <li>This is great oil for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The great news is that when I use the Mach 3</li>
            <li>At the price, it&#x27;s a great value.  </li>
            <li>but I would buy this again as it works great for its function....</li>
            <li>* Great scent.  </li>
            <li>Great price point too.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re using one of those fancy pants mach X razors that vibrates with 18 laser guided blades, this stuff is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use mostly unscented products, so I may not be the best judge of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good performer and a very good value, at this price.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anthony Sport makes the best smelling one I&#x27;ve come across, and the most effective in terms of those results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that this oil has no fragrance and for the price is a good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price for the amount.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a 4 star review because the quality of the product itself seems to be good.</li>
            <li>This helps aide in the perfect shave, the blade just slides right off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even pleasant, more like tolerable.</li>
            <li>This really adds to the perfect shave.</li>
            <li>Nice scent that doesn&#x27;t remain after washing</li>
            <li>While my Proraso pre shave is good- this is a better protection against knicks.</li>
            <li>but I find that I can make my own blend cheaper</li>
            <li>and this Anthony product works as good or better.  </li>
            <li>for your money&#x27;s worth and by volume this is the best deal there is in shaving oil, it works better than any i&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Enthusiastic thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li>and honestly I think my face feels better than with just the aftershave.</li>
            <li>Smells great and supports a smooth shave, protecting the skin, keeping it smooth and preventing cuts.</li>
            <li>Well okay, I CAN... provided</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I like the aroma of mine better.  </li>
            <li>The soap/cream adds to moisture, but the oil is what seems to &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; my blade across my face - I love this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing could be better at any price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaving oil that really compliments your razor and soap.</li>
            <li>I just finished the 2 OZ bottle of Anthony Sport (took 6 months or so to use it up), so it is time to get some more oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it did anything to help my razor glide better.</li>
            <li>and I like it much better.  </li>
            <li>There are better products out there.    </li>
            <li>It is cheaper then most</li>
            <li>I used it up but didn&#x27;t reorder because it was just not something that I enjoyed using.  </li>
            <li>I tried a brand of oil with a spray top and it tended to be messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will take them at their word, but would feel better if they offered some details to support this claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rather than gliding over the skin, the blade seemed to tug more on the skin on the oiled side.  </li>
            <li>Just a drop in your palm, rub on your face then use your regular shaving product, and the razor glides, the fur is gone, and your face feels great!  </li>
            <li>This is best for the Winter season for individuals with naturally dry skin.</li>
            <li>The oil is a little thicker than I would prefer, however it is a good product and pre-shave oils do make a great difference in one&#x27;s shave comfort and glide.</li>
            <li>Silky, so the blade glides easily.</li>
            <li>When using the M3, the oil and shaving cream rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this shaving oil and a good alternative to more expensive brands you can find out there or on the web.</li>
            <li>liked the scent pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, first I bought one...</li>
            <li>Look this is a fine shave oil.  </li>
            <li>Smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;great, light scent.  </li>
            <li>if a shave could get better than this, the money i&#x27;d have to spend to upgrade wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.  </li>
            <li>i bought this to get myself to th 25 for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Although the concept seems to be sound, I found no benefit in using this product.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>BUT, they did pre-treat skin for the ensuing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward, and today you have shaving oil available to you, and if you&#x27;re not using it you&#x27;re shaving</li>
            <li>open top, again good for when you are in the shower&lt;</li>
            <li>If you use a safety or straight razor for \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving, then you know that part of the enjoyment is trying out different products to see what works best for you.  </li>
            <li>Use your favorite after shave lotion to smell right when done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes a huge difference when it comes to achieving a clean shave that any woman would enjoy to touch or be touched by, or just for your level of satisfaction with shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Outstanding, and a large qty.</li>
            <li>It has a much better consistency and in general it felt better on my skin.</li>
            <li>With this oil, you really get a better shave.  </li>
            <li>I used about 3 drops which is standard for a good quality shaving oil.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to be fair and objective.  </li>
            <li>this product is not bad.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of the American Crew better, but this stuff still smelled pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this up with bigelow cream, feather blade on my gillette super speed, finished with baxter of california after shave cream.  </li>
            <li>this is as smooth, soft, and cut-free as you can get without dropping much more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a worthy cause.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps reduce razor burn, it keeps your skin soft and free from drying out from your shave cream, it gets the stubborn hairs to rise so they can be sliced away, leaving a clean smooth face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has a pretty good smell although could be a little better</li>
            <li>whatever it is, it&#x27;s not overpowering and i enjoy it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Anthony Sport product smells minty and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It may be worth a try for you.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I dont recommend buying it in a store ($23 at Nordstrom, as little as $9 online).</li>
            <li>favorite product so far has been American Crew, but the plastic top on their product breaks open and leaks.</li>
            <li>nice, a slightly minty smell&lt;br /&gt;Bottle</li>
            <li>Easy on and off and relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t as good as The Art of Shaving oil, IMO, but it is far less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>longer I use this product, the less convinced I am there&#x27;s much left on my face after applying the shaving cream with my brush, but perhaps I \\&quot;work in\\&quot; the cream lather more than most.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re using those instead of a safety razor or a straight razor then stop reviewing.  </li>
            <li>a think oil, so i don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  </li>
            <li>My skin is softer with fewer nicks and scratches, razor burn is reduced (or gone entirely some days!), and I like the minty smell and light tingle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I could have returned it, but by the time I was ready to use it and opened the bottle</li>
            <li>It really does help prevent nicks n cuts.</li>
            <li>I just started shaving with a straight razor and I use this stuff before every shave...</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus and peppermint smell really comes through.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, you really need to wash your hands once or twice with soap after application if you don&#x27;t want to be handling a razor with oily hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regardless of how much water you mix in, it&#x27;s like applying molasses to your face -</li>
            <li>Very lubrication.</li>
            <li>As I shave in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t really clog the blade--just blast it under the shower head.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>was surprised that I didn&#x27;t like this shaving oil, because many Anthony products are very solid.  </li>
            <li>my straight razor shaves are not only comfortable but extremely close and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is the first shave oil I have used, and I immediately could tell improvements over my old shaving ritual.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So don&#x27;t hesitate, add it now and live life with a smoother shave than you&#x27;ve had before!</li>
            <li>The other positive reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li>Smells funny and more importantly, much too thick and goupy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary, if you are using a high quality shave soap or cream applied with a brush, I do not think this product will improve the shave quality based on my experience.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to shavers</li>
            <li>feels refreshing rubbing just a few drops (4-5) into my face before applying a lathered up brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My razor seemed to clog up a lot more with this product, maybe because the heavy oil made my whiskers clump up</li>
            <li>If you are using a quality shave soap or cream, such as Taylor of Old Bond Street or Proraso, with a brush,  I think those provide more than enough lubrication.  </li>
            <li>not only softens the beard and definitely protects the skin (I&#x27;ve used both a straight razor and my usual safety razor with great results)</li>
            <li>I got a good shave with Shave Secret, but the scent was too &#x27;gender neutral&#x27; for me.</li>
            <li>You can check out my other reviews if you want to know about the shaving cream and shaving soap that I use (both available on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer to use foam out of a can, and can live with the inferior shave I get from it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say I am overly fond of the scent, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>The combo of these incredibly sharp Japanese stainless blades, an unagressive  razor, and careful preparation, I can&#x27;t even feel the blade, but my face is incredibly smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>May be it works for you but for me this was a first and last try for shaving oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ability to help your razor glide over the skin is so clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thick enough to get onto your face and to be not just watch it drip straight off</li>
            <li>for the actual effectiveness of the oil, I really like the smell and that it feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin from having it on.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Masculine but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I have never used it with a mach-3 type razor, I have always used it with an old style double-edge razor.</li>
            <li>However, when I checked their web site I could find no information about how much they have actually donated.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re old school and shaving like your grandfather, don&#x27;t even consider going without it.</li>
            <li>Man, was I surprised.  </li>
            <li>If you have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>As far as the functionality of shaving oil....</li>
            <li>If it feels like you are shaving molasses, try 1 less drop of oil until you find your \\&quot;sweet</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the Mach 3 might gum up on this product (since some of the other reviews seemed to indicate it&#x27;s thick -- in a good way).</li>
            <li>Before you shave literally put only 2 to 4 drops in your hand (I recommend 3 to start), add several drops of hot water, rub your hands together apply to face, apply lather over the oil, and shave in your preferred manner.</li>
            <li>then I tried different brands, and in the end, I went back and bought few more at once&lt;</li>
            <li>In general, I like Anthony products.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it seemed like I had more drag than usual.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a safety razor to shave but recently switched back to one of the Gilette Mach 3&#x27;s since I can shave every day without any irritation when I use it.</li>
            <li>suppose you could use it for other areas, but the fact remains it makes the task of shaving much easier to achieve in results and satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell was nice, but it seemed a little too thick and gummy.  </li>
            <li>My skin does not dry out</li>
            <li>I believe this product is at least as good if not better!  </li>
            <li>At first I disliked the product before I figured out how to use it correctly by reading some shave enthusiast websites.</li>
            <li>I use as little as possible after a hot shower and add a golf ball size of Barbasol foam.  </li>
            <li>However, I feel the reverse of those who claim the product is too thick; I just wonder how much is left on my face after I go over it thoroughly with a brush full of soap.  </li>
            <li>enough cost that you do not use less than you really need</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Outstanding, and a large qty.</li>
            <li> It has a much better consistency and in general it felt better on my skin.</li>
            <li> With this oil, you really get a better shave.  </li>
            <li> I used about 3 drops which is standard for a good quality shaving oil.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to be fair and objective.  </li>
            <li> this product is not bad.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of the American Crew better, but this stuff still smelled pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this up with bigelow cream, feather blade on my gillette super speed, finished with baxter of california after shave cream.  </li>
            <li> this is as smooth, soft, and cut-free as you can get without dropping much more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a worthy cause.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps reduce razor burn, it keeps your skin soft and free from drying out from your shave cream, it gets the stubborn hairs to rise so they can be sliced away, leaving a clean smooth face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has a pretty good smell although could be a little better</li>
            <li> whatever it is, it&#x27;s not overpowering and i enjoy it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Anthony Sport product smells minty and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It may be worth a try for you.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I dont recommend buying it in a store ($23 at Nordstrom, as little as $9 online).</li>
            <li> favorite product so far has been American Crew, but the plastic top on their product breaks open and leaks.</li>
            <li> nice, a slightly minty smell&lt;br /&gt;Bottle</li>
            <li> Easy on and off and relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as good as The Art of Shaving oil, IMO, but it is far less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> longer I use this product, the less convinced I am there&#x27;s much left on my face after applying the shaving cream with my brush, but perhaps I \\&quot;work in\\&quot; the cream lather more than most.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re using those instead of a safety razor or a straight razor then stop reviewing.  </li>
            <li> a think oil, so i don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer with fewer nicks and scratches, razor burn is reduced (or gone entirely some days!), and I like the minty smell and light tingle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I could have returned it, but by the time I was ready to use it and opened the bottle</li>
            <li> It really does help prevent nicks n cuts.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a straight razor and I use this stuff before every shave...</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus and peppermint smell really comes through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, you really need to wash your hands once or twice with soap after application if you don&#x27;t want to be handling a razor with oily hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regardless of how much water you mix in, it&#x27;s like applying molasses to your face -</li>
            <li> Very lubrication.</li>
            <li> As I shave in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t really clog the blade--just blast it under the shower head.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> was surprised that I didn&#x27;t like this shaving oil, because many Anthony products are very solid.  </li>
            <li> my straight razor shaves are not only comfortable but extremely close and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is the first shave oil I have used, and I immediately could tell improvements over my old shaving ritual.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So don&#x27;t hesitate, add it now and live life with a smoother shave than you&#x27;ve had before!</li>
            <li> The other positive reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li> Smells funny and more importantly, much too thick and goupy.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary, if you are using a high quality shave soap or cream applied with a brush, I do not think this product will improve the shave quality based on my experience.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to shavers</li>
            <li> feels refreshing rubbing just a few drops (4-5) into my face before applying a lathered up brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My razor seemed to clog up a lot more with this product, maybe because the heavy oil made my whiskers clump up</li>
            <li> If you are using a quality shave soap or cream, such as Taylor of Old Bond Street or Proraso, with a brush,  I think those provide more than enough lubrication.  </li>
            <li> not only softens the beard and definitely protects the skin (I&#x27;ve used both a straight razor and my usual safety razor with great results)</li>
            <li> I got a good shave with Shave Secret, but the scent was too &#x27;gender neutral&#x27; for me.</li>
            <li> You can check out my other reviews if you want to know about the shaving cream and shaving soap that I use (both available on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to use foam out of a can, and can live with the inferior shave I get from it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say I am overly fond of the scent, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> The combo of these incredibly sharp Japanese stainless blades, an unagressive  razor, and careful preparation, I can&#x27;t even feel the blade, but my face is incredibly smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> May be it works for you but for me this was a first and last try for shaving oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ability to help your razor glide over the skin is so clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thick enough to get onto your face and to be not just watch it drip straight off</li>
            <li> for the actual effectiveness of the oil, I really like the smell and that it feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin from having it on.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Masculine but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have never used it with a mach-3 type razor, I have always used it with an old style double-edge razor.</li>
            <li> However, when I checked their web site I could find no information about how much they have actually donated.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re old school and shaving like your grandfather, don&#x27;t even consider going without it.</li>
            <li> Man, was I surprised.  </li>
            <li> If you have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> As far as the functionality of shaving oil....</li>
            <li> If it feels like you are shaving molasses, try 1 less drop of oil until you find your \\&quot;sweet</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the Mach 3 might gum up on this product (since some of the other reviews seemed to indicate it&#x27;s thick -- in a good way).</li>
            <li> Before you shave literally put only 2 to 4 drops in your hand (I recommend 3 to start), add several drops of hot water, rub your hands together apply to face, apply lather over the oil, and shave in your preferred manner.</li>
            <li> then I tried different brands, and in the end, I went back and bought few more at once&lt;</li>
            <li> In general, I like Anthony products.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it seemed like I had more drag than usual.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a safety razor to shave but recently switched back to one of the Gilette Mach 3&#x27;s since I can shave every day without any irritation when I use it.</li>
            <li> suppose you could use it for other areas, but the fact remains it makes the task of shaving much easier to achieve in results and satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was nice, but it seemed a little too thick and gummy.  </li>
            <li> My skin does not dry out</li>
            <li> I believe this product is at least as good if not better!  </li>
            <li> At first I disliked the product before I figured out how to use it correctly by reading some shave enthusiast websites.</li>
            <li> I use as little as possible after a hot shower and add a golf ball size of Barbasol foam.  </li>
            <li> However, I feel the reverse of those who claim the product is too thick; I just wonder how much is left on my face after I go over it thoroughly with a brush full of soap.  </li>
            <li> enough cost that you do not use less than you really need</li>
            <li> I assume that it would last a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read other reviews here that suggested to dilute it with water and/or use less oil, but that didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> The 2oz bottle should last you a long time!</li>
            <li> Currently, I&#x27;ve been using the Close Comfort Shave Gel by Paula&#x27;s Choice (not available here on Amazon - you have to purchase directly from the manufacturer).  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a fairly thin oil, but it rubs on well even with 4-5 days&#x27; growth and only a couple drops worth goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I switched back to the Mach 3 razor (from the Fusion 5 blade) since the blades on the Mach 3 are further apart from each other.  </li>
            <li> For the comment that says it is \\&quot;thick and goopy\\&quot;... it is if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Over the last year and a half, I&#x27;ve tried 3 different kinds of shaving oil:</li>
            <li> When I shave with my straight razor, which I use on weekends, it actually seemed like the oil made it worse.  </li>
            <li> Tugging is not a good thing for a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really</li>
            <li> Sounds complicated, but it is simple and actually costs far less than the supermarket or drugstore blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace an Art of Shaving product that is called Sandlewood but smells nothing like other Sandlewood fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m going to try next...</li>
            <li> For about two weeks I even applied this to one side of my face, but not the other.  </li>
            <li> Then switched sides on other days.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent.  </li>
            <li> The oil and stubble is thick enough to clog the blades to the point where rinsing doesn&#x27;t remove everything.</li>
            <li> Other reviews are spot on!  </li>
            <li> Hate to say that I think I prefer the high-priced AOS product a little better, but if price is the thing (it often is for me)</li>
            <li> I had previously used America Crew shave oil</li>
            <li> , I know others like their preshave a little less oily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind sticking little bits of tp on my face afterwards.</li>
            <li> I do feel things seem to go a little smoother when I use this, although it could be my imagination.  </li>
            <li> I am now a firm believer in a pre shave oil.  </li>
            <li> Shave Secret, American Crew, and Anthony Sport.</li>
            <li> size is not so small that it is hard to handle when using in the shower with wet hands</li>
            <li> Works well as a preshave oil less is more here, The smell is awful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick and gummy, and clogs and ruins your blades.</li>
            <li> no more cuts no red skin,I advise people who they have reaction from the shaving cream beacuse of the parfum they put in it it gave you bad reaction,but with this item you will never get cuts or red skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use alot of types of shaving cream and oil and all of them give me bad reaction for my skin,and give me cuts,even it&#x27;s smells good,but with anthony sport men it&#x27;s really diffrent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who likes a product and usually sticks with it.</li>
            <li> I usually order the art of shaving pre shave oil and have never been dissapointed with it</li>
            <li> You probably could use any salad oil and get the same shaving aid, but you might smell weird.  </li>
            <li> , it was past the return window for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure about it...</li>
            <li> I can still wash away the scum from shaving without having it adversely affect my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is a lot of scraping and cutting, especially with the uber-costly Gillette multi edge cartridges taking off a piece here and there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different shave oils, and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Thick, so it stays on your chin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just perfectly thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and it cleans up well.  </li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it is quite thick.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick and blocks the pores.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean you will.  </li>
            <li> The oil is a little to thick but it keeps you from cutting your face shaving.</li>
            <li> its very thick it almost feels like tree sap when putting it on even with 1 or 2 drops.</li>
            <li> I tried and prefer Shave Secret which is thinner and leaves your skin feeling \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The concept behind them seems sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also of concern are comments I&#x27;ve heard that (any brand) oil is not good to use if you apply the cream or soap with a brush; it gets on the brush, builds up and is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this product i was definately skeptical.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re using a really expensive oil, do yourself a favor and try this to see if you can save yourself some money (i know i will be from now on).</li>
            <li> Although it is expensive</li>
            <li> It does seem to work, albeit its not perfect.</li>
            <li> It was also having weird smell from Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> Use this slightly thick oil for a pre-lather base.</li>
            <li> With those products, which seem to do nothing for me, and I consider to be worthless, you need all the help you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What works for me may not work for you, and just because I hated this shaving oil,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This really adds to the perfect shave. Thick, so it stays on your chin. Silky, so the blade glides easily. Nice scent that doesn&#x27;t remain after washing so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your aftershave.</li>
            <li> I cannot blade-shave without oil. Well okay, I CAN... provided I don&#x27;t mind sticking little bits of tp on my face afterwards. This is a good product, but I dont recommend buying it in a store ($23 at Nordstrom, as little as $9 online). Works well with creams, gels and soaps.</li>
            <li> I used to use alot of types of shaving cream and oil and all of them give me bad reaction for my skin,and give me cuts,even it&#x27;s smells good,but with anthony sport men it&#x27;s really diffrent it is incredible shaving oil i ever seen,no more cuts no red skin,I advise people who they have reaction from the shaving cream beacuse of the parfum they put in it it gave you bad reaction,but with this item you will never get cuts or red skin.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this product i was definately skeptical. I&#x27;m the type of person who likes a product and usually sticks with it. I usually order the art of shaving pre shave oil and have never been dissapointed with it but i decided to give this a shot since it was on sale.  I believe this product is at least as good if not better!  my straight razor shaves are not only comfortable but extremely close and smooth! I was recommend this not only based on the comparable quality but thats its also 1/3 of the price.  5 stars all day!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace an Art of Shaving product that is called Sandlewood but smells nothing like other Sandlewood fragrances.  Anyway, my wife did not like the smell of the Art of Shaving Sandlewood pre-shave oil.  The Anthony Sport product smells minty and fresh.  The oil is a little thicker than I would prefer, however it is a good product and pre-shave oils do make a great difference in one&#x27;s shave comfort and glide.</li>
            <li> I use a Mach 3 and shave in the shower, using the stream from the shower-head to rinse the razor. The oil and stubble is thick enough to clog the blades to the point where rinsing doesn&#x27;t remove everything. I tried and prefer Shave Secret which is thinner and leaves your skin feeling \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I used to use much American Crew Shaving Oil, but switched to this one because it only costs a fraction of that. The Anthony Sport for Men Pre Shave Oil surpassed my expectations. This must be the best oil I have ver used. Smells great and supports a smooth shave, protecting the skin, keeping it smooth and preventing cuts. Love it.</li>
            <li> The oil is a little to thick but it keeps you from cutting your face shaving. I gave it 4 starts cause I don&#x27;t like the peppermint smell it has.. But works like a charm for shaving</li>
            <li> Works very well. Helps prevent razor burn. I would recommend this shave oil if you haven&#x27;t used shave oil before.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of shave oils of varying cost from the Clarins shave oil ($28 for 1oz) to making it myself! This is great oil for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thick enough to get onto your face and to be not just watch it drip straight off you hands&lt;br /&gt;Low enough cost that you do not use less than you really need&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice, a slightly minty smell&lt;br /&gt;Bottle size is not so small that it is hard to handle when using in the shower with wet hands&lt;br /&gt;Easy open top, again good for when you are in the shower&lt;br /&gt;It works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to go with the rest of my shaving armada. I normally use a safety razor to shave but recently switched back to one of the Gilette Mach 3&#x27;s since I can shave every day without any irritation when I use it. I was concerned that the Mach 3 might gum up on this product (since some of the other reviews seemed to indicate it&#x27;s thick -- in a good way). The great news is that when I use the Mach 3 it&#x27;s just perfectly thick. I can still wash away the scum from shaving without having it adversely affect my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual effectiveness of the oil, I really like the smell and that it feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin from having it on. I&#x27;ve stopped putting on my aftershave lotion when I shave with this and honestly I think my face feels better than with just the aftershave.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil after running out of the Art of Shaving sandalwood oil.  At the price, it&#x27;s a great value.  Functionally, it seems equal to the aforementioned oil. Pre-shave oil is necessary for shaving with a safety razor.  My only complaint is the scent.  It borders on antiseptic.  It&#x27;s not even pleasant, more like tolerable.</li>
            <li> Virtually eliminates knicks and cuts!  Easy on and off and relatively inexpensive.  Highly recomended! I am now a firm believer in a pre shave oil.  While my Proraso pre shave is good- this is a better protection against knicks.</li>
            <li> Works well but I find that I can make my own blend cheaper and I like the aroma of mine better.  I mix it and then fill this bottle with it.</li>
            <li> This product is a part of my daily shave.  The oil does in fact protect the skin and it also allows the razor to get closer to the root of the hairs.  I switched back to the Mach 3 razor (from the Fusion 5 blade) since the blades on the Mach 3 are further apart from each other.  When using the M3, the oil and shaving cream rinses off easily.  I&#x27;ve also used more expensive versions of shave oil and this Anthony product works as good or better.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Use this slightly thick oil for a pre-lather base. I like that this oil has no fragrance and for the price is a good buy. Hate to say that I think I prefer the high-priced AOS product a little better, but if price is the thing (it often is for me) this product is not bad.</li>
            <li> Look this is a fine shave oil.  It does the job. It&#x27;s not too thick and it cleans up well.  Smooth.  Like Sade&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin.  This pre shave oil lubricates as well as helps his whiskers stand out, which makes for a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> do not use this oil with cartridge blades... that&#x27;s not what it was meant for.  if you&#x27;re using those instead of a safety razor or a straight razor then stop reviewing.  if you&#x27;re reading someone&#x27;s review that uses a cartridge and it neg&#x27;s this product, stop reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great, light scent.  definitely a bit of citrus.  whatever it is, it&#x27;s not overpowering and i enjoy it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a think oil, so i don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  feels refreshing rubbing just a few drops (4-5) into my face before applying a lathered up brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;paired this up with bigelow cream, feather blade on my gillette super speed, finished with baxter of california after shave cream.  if a shave could get better than this, the money i&#x27;d have to spend to upgrade wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.  this is as smooth, soft, and cut-free as you can get without dropping much more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re not using a preshave oil, do yourself a favor and try this out.  if you&#x27;re using a really expensive oil, do yourself a favor and try this to see if you can save yourself some money (i know i will be from now on).</li>
            <li> I switched from Art of Shaving oil to save some $$$. Works well, but smell could be improved (reminds me of Linseed Oil). Use your favorite after shave lotion to smell right when done.</li>
            <li> i bought this to get myself to th 25 for free shipping. its very thick it almost feels like tree sap when putting it on even with 1 or 2 drops. im not a fan and didnt notice any improved shave.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but not too strong.  It&#x27;s ability to help your razor glide over the skin is so clear.  I have used several blades and tried w/ Oil and with Soap - then w/ oil and with cream....  The difference isn&#x27;t the soap or cream - it&#x27;s the oil.  The soap/cream adds to moisture, but the oil is what seems to &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; my blade across my face - I love this product.</li>
            <li> for your money&#x27;s worth and by volume this is the best deal there is in shaving oil, it works better than any i&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Saw it in GQ magazine. Its a part if my shaving regimen especially if you are dealing with razor bumps</li>
            <li> Outstanding, and a large qty. for the price!  Smells great too!  Other reviews are spot on!  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the first shave oil I have used, and I immediately could tell improvements over my old shaving ritual.  My skin is softer with fewer nicks and scratches, razor burn is reduced (or gone entirely some days!), and I like the minty smell and light tingle on my skin.  It seems to be a fairly thin oil, but it rubs on well even with 4-5 days&#x27; growth and only a couple drops worth goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You probably could use any salad oil and get the same shaving aid, but you might smell weird.  With this oil, you really get a better shave.  I use as little as possible after a hot shower and add a golf ball size of Barbasol foam.  Nothing could be better at any price.  I also use Feather double edge blades in a Merkur razor.  I have been shaving since 1942 which is a lot of scraping and cutting, especially with the uber-costly Gillette multi edge cartridges taking off a piece here and there.  The combo of these incredibly sharp Japanese stainless blades, an unagressive  razor, and careful preparation, I can&#x27;t even feel the blade, but my face is incredibly smooth and comfortable.  I rub in the residual oil for an after shave.  Sounds complicated, but it is simple and actually costs far less than the supermarket or drugstore blades.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving oil that really compliments your razor and soap. My skin does not dry out and I have not had any knicks or cuts or in-grown hairs after 5 shaves. It seems to maintain the life of your razor as well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Over the last year and a half, I&#x27;ve tried 3 different kinds of shaving oil: Shave Secret, American Crew, and Anthony Sport. I just finished the 2 OZ bottle of Anthony Sport (took 6 months or so to use it up), so it is time to get some more oil. I won&#x27;t be re-ordering this brand, because of its viscosity. As others have mentioned, it is quite thick. I read other reviews here that suggested to dilute it with water and/or use less oil, but that didn&#x27;t really work for me. My razor seemed to clog up a lot more with this product, maybe because the heavy oil made my whiskers clump up more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the scent pretty well. Masculine but not overpowering. I liked the smell of the American Crew better, but this stuff still smelled pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite product so far has been American Crew, but the plastic top on their product breaks open and leaks. I got a good shave with Shave Secret, but the scent was too &#x27;gender neutral&#x27; for me. Not sure what I&#x27;m going to try next... maybe something more expensive.</li>
            <li> In general, I like Anthony products.  I&#x27;ve tried several.  I didn&#x27;t care for this shaving oil.  The smell was nice, but it seemed a little too thick and gummy.  I used about 3 drops which is standard for a good quality shaving oil.  I don&#x27;t feel that it did anything to help my razor glide better. In fact, it seemed like I had more drag than usual.  I used it for a week or two and then threw it out.  I had previously used America Crew shave oil [[ASIN:B001GV2P3C American Crew Lubricating Shave Oil, 1.7 Ounce]] and I like it much better.  It has a much better consistency and in general it felt better on my skin. Currently, I&#x27;ve been using the Close Comfort Shave Gel by Paula&#x27;s Choice (not available here on Amazon - you have to purchase directly from the manufacturer).  It&#x27;s actually not a shaving oil - rather it&#x27;s a non-foaming shaving lotion, but I use it in place of the shaving oil, followed up with my shaving cream.  You can check out my other reviews if you want to know about the shaving cream and shaving soap that I use (both available on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t like this shaving oil, because many Anthony products are very solid.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I always say that grooming products are very personal. What works for me may not work for you, and just because I hated this shaving oil, doesn&#x27;t mean you will.  It may be worth a try for you.  If you use a safety or straight razor for \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving, then you know that part of the enjoyment is trying out different products to see what works best for you.  Plenty of people seem to like this shaving oil.  Maybe you will.  For me, it was a pricey mistake.  Perhaps I could have returned it, but by the time I was ready to use it and opened the bottle, it was past the return window for Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells funny and more importantly, much too thick and goupy.  Avoid. Goes on thick and blocks the pores.  There are better products out there.    It is cheaper then most but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It really does help prevent nicks n cuts. For the comment that says it is \\&quot;thick and goopy\\&quot;... it is if you use too much. The trick to this product is \\&quot;MODERATION\\&quot;! Before you shave literally put only 2 to 4 drops in your hand (I recommend 3 to start), add several drops of hot water, rub your hands together apply to face, apply lather over the oil, and shave in your preferred manner. If it feels like you are shaving molasses, try 1 less drop of oil until you find your \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; for shaving. At first I disliked the product before I figured out how to use it correctly by reading some shave enthusiast websites. The 2oz bottle should last you a long time! Hope this help out anyone that has never used it. I have never used it with a mach-3 type razor, I have always used it with an old style double-edge razor.</li>
            <li> This shave oil works well to condition your face for shaving.  I used it up but didn&#x27;t reorder because it was just not something that I enjoyed using.  I prefer to use foam out of a can, and can live with the inferior shave I get from it.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a straight razor and I use this stuff before every shave...it has a pretty good smell although could be a little better (that is why 4 stars)...but I would buy this again as it works great for its function....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working my way through a 50 blade variety pack, so I have a number of variables to factor in.  I do feel things seem to go a little smoother when I use this, although it could be my imagination.  However, I feel the reverse of those who claim the product is too thick; I just wonder how much is left on my face after I go over it thoroughly with a brush full of soap.  Is there any left, or did the brush/soap wash it all off?  I&#x27;m not really certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/26/2012&lt;br /&gt;The longer I use this product, the less convinced I am there&#x27;s much left on my face after applying the shaving cream with my brush, but perhaps I \\&quot;work in\\&quot; the cream lather more than most.  Also of concern are comments I&#x27;ve heard that (any brand) oil is not good to use if you apply the cream or soap with a brush; it gets on the brush, builds up and is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Although I have read mixed reviews on whether the pre-shave oils actually work in the shaving forums, I decided to give them a try.  The concept behind them seems sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes&lt;br /&gt;* Great scent.  The eucalyptus and peppermint smell really comes through.&lt;br /&gt;* I like the pop up opening on the bottle.  I tried a brand of oil with a spray top and it tended to be messy.&lt;br /&gt;* Although it is expensive I assume that it would last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;* They claim to donate a portion of sales to Prostate cancer research.  This is a worthy cause. I applaud companies that do this. However, when I checked their web site I could find no information about how much they have actually donated.  I will take them at their word, but would feel better if they offered some details to support this claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike&lt;br /&gt;* Your hand will be oily after applying this.  This is not a fault of the product, and it makes sense that they should.  However, you really need to wash your hands once or twice with soap after application if you don&#x27;t want to be handling a razor with oily hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Although the concept seems to be sound, I found no benefit in using this product.  I have tried to be fair and objective.  For about two weeks I even applied this to one side of my face, but not the other.  Then switched sides on other days.  For double edge shaving, I could detect no difference in shave quality. I also saw no difference on skin irritation comparing each side. Both the oiled and un-oiled sides felt the same.  When I shave with my straight razor, which I use on weekends, it actually seemed like the oil made it worse.  Rather than gliding over the skin, the blade seemed to tug more on the skin on the oiled side.  Tugging is not a good thing for a straight razor.  If you are using a quality shave soap or cream, such as Taylor of Old Bond Street or Proraso, with a brush,  I think those provide more than enough lubrication.  If you are using shave creams or shave gels youbought at the grocery or drug store, then maybe this might help you. With those products, which seem to do nothing for me, and I consider to be worthless, you need all the help you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary, if you are using a high quality shave soap or cream applied with a brush, I do not think this product will improve the shave quality based on my experience.  I understand that others, with different beards, skin and shaving techniques may have a different experience.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it. It&#x27;s the alternative that I use to the Art of Shaving Pre-Shave Oil (Lemon Scent). It&#x27;s a good price for the amount. I&#x27;ve ordered it about 3 times.</li>
            <li> Years ago in the barber business they didn&#x27;t have shaving oil.  BUT, they did pre-treat skin for the ensuing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward, and today you have shaving oil available to you, and if you&#x27;re not using it you&#x27;re shaving wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to add this into your shaving routine, seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a huge difference when it comes to achieving a clean shave that any woman would enjoy to touch or be touched by, or just for your level of satisfaction with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps reduce razor burn, it keeps your skin soft and free from drying out from your shave cream, it gets the stubborn hairs to rise so they can be sliced away, leaving a clean smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose you could use it for other areas, but the fact remains it makes the task of shaving much easier to achieve in results and satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Sport makes the best smelling one I&#x27;ve come across, and the most effective in terms of those results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t hesitate, add it now and live life with a smoother shave than you&#x27;ve had before!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different shave oils, and this is by far the worst. Regardless of how much water you mix in, it&#x27;s like applying molasses to your face - it&#x27;s thick and gummy, and clogs and ruins your blades. The smell is also rather off-putting.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, first I bought one...then I tried different brands, and in the end, I went back and bought few more at once&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for me , it works</li>
            <li> Probably would have given it a 3.5 stars, if there was that option.  Very lubrication. I like that, I know others like their preshave a little less oily.  As I shave in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t really clog the blade--just blast it under the shower head.  it isn&#x27;t as good as The Art of Shaving oil, IMO, but it is far less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I am overly fond of the scent, but I can live with it. It has a medicine-like scent.  I use mostly unscented products, so I may not be the best judge of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good performer and a very good value, at this price.</li>
            <li> Get it. It works. The other positive reviews are accurate. Great price point too. Enthusiastic thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical but I ordered anyway. It does seem to work, albeit its not perfect. Pleasant scent as well.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for Christmas (stocking stuffer) and was amazed by it.  After I ran out, I tried baby oil, olive oil, veg. oil, but nothing came close to Anthony P/S oil.&lt;br /&gt;It not only softens the beard and definitely protects the skin (I&#x27;ve used both a straight razor and my usual safety razor with great results) but it closes the pores up too.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you&#x27;re using one of those fancy pants mach X razors that vibrates with 18 laser guided blades, this stuff is great stuff.  If you&#x27;re old school and shaving like your grandfather, don&#x27;t even consider going without it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaving oil and a good alternative to more expensive brands you can find out there or on the web.</li>
            <li> Works well as a preshave oil less is more here, The smell is awful. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, not expecting much.  Man, was I surprised.  Just a drop in your palm, rub on your face then use your regular shaving product, and the razor glides, the fur is gone, and your face feels great!  I feel like a shill for this product, but I&#x27;m not. Really.</li>
            <li> Will buy again.  I used to buy the same oil in the glass container and this is the same.  If you have naturally oily skin then this product is not for you.  This is best for the Winter season for individuals with naturally dry skin.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 4 star review because the quality of the product itself seems to be good. As far as the functionality of shaving oil....I&#x27;m really not sure about it...I&#x27;ve tried using the shaving oil and I have not seen any difference than fro just using shaving cream or soap. May be it works for you but for me this was a first and last try for shaving oil.</li>
            <li> This helps aide in the perfect shave, the blade just slides right off. the face. I would highly recommend to shavers</li>
            <li> This is nothing but mint perfumed castor oil and Olive Oil, i could have bought 1 gallon of it for $11. It was also having weird smell from Castor Oil.</li>
