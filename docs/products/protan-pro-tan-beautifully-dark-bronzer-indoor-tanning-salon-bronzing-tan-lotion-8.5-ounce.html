            <li> For the price this lotion is a lot better than I expected. I have used it tanning 1-2 times per week for the past 6 weeks. I have a nice golden tan...not the fake bronze color. I would have given 5 stars because I really do think this lotion is a great deal compared to what you are spending in the salon, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the sent. It kind of has a hint of vanilla musk and personally I am not a fan BUT I would purchase again. Too good of a deal not too!! :)</li>
            <li> This is junk, the $5 indoor stuff I bought at target was so much better than this.. dont waste your $$$</li>
