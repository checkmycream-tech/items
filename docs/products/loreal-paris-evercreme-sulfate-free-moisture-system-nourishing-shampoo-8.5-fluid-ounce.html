            <li>Who knew :)?</li>

            <li>Being sulfate free</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with how this product makes my hair feel; more like it felt 20 years ago, soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>The Evercreme Nourishing Shampoo does what it claims it will do, leaves your hair feeling smooth and shiny yet clean &amp; full as well.</li>
            <li>May be great for really dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair never felt clean.</li>
            <li>Loreal intense nourishing shampoo works better for me.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, fuzzy hair and thought it was cool to find an inexpensive shampoo that was free of sulfates and free of supposedly anything that would weigh my hair</li>
            <li>After the first use I thought it did a great job, but after a few uses my hair started getting very greasy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.)</li>
            <li>Used this line since it first came out.</li>
            <li>First time I have been faithful to a hair care brand and line.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free, great low price especially through amazon, makes hair soft and shiny, smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Cons: rich and heavy</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t afford to lose any, I don&#x27;t have much to begin with.</li>
            <li>I like it so much .</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and also highly recommend the evercreme mask for anyone with dry wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz.</li>
            <li>It makes hair very soft and shiny and smells lovely, however is still pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>There was a huge hole in its side, so the product spilled everywhere, including all over my four other items.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty regular guy, jeans and a t-shirt, I drive a Ford truck...</li>
            <li>My girl has curly, very dry, blonde and fine hair..</li>
            <li>Now I look like my whole life is a shampoo commercial.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it frequently without problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After shampooing hair doest feel soft.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a though combination and this complete line</li>
            <li>what I do have is short, straight, fine, lifeless hair that is getting drier by the day &amp; starting to fall out, partly due to some medications I have to take.</li>
            <li>It is a strong smell when wet, but once dry, you must bury your nose in the hair to smell the scent.</li>
            <li>I have been looking a long time for a shampoo/conditioner system that would help my particular needs.</li>
            <li>Finally, I decided to try a different shampoo and conditioner, and lo and behold, my hair is now clean and yet still moisturized; plus, I have noticed less hair in my comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even expensive salon brands have those toxic chemicals and so i was happy to find these products from L&#x27;Oreal for much less.</li>
            <li>This is recommended for dry to normal hair, but I think it will work for all hair types.</li>
            <li>obviously sulfates are no good, so this clean shampoo solved the problem.</li>

            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner together for the past couple months.</li>
            <li> I really like Loreal and their sulfate-free products, but the EverCreme STINKS!</li>
            <li> I have neither frizzy, curly, or thick hair at all, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even started practicing the slow motion hair shake when I take my hat off</li>
            <li> took this as a try for my teen son, who suffers from dandruff now, and it helped!</li>
            <li> Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Drives the women crazy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in a L&#x27;Oreal product yet.</li>
            <li> sum up succinctly, this shampoo is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the scent of this shampoo,Leaves my hair shiny</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and I prefer to use L&#x27;Oreal products on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking a long time for a shampoo/conditioner system that would help my particular needs. I have neither frizzy, curly, or thick hair at all, but what I do have is short, straight, fine, lifeless hair that is getting drier by the day &amp; starting to fall out, partly due to some medications I have to take. I really can&#x27;t afford to lose any, I don&#x27;t have much to begin with. I am so pleased with how this product makes my hair feel; more like it felt 20 years ago, soft &amp; smooth. And I no longer have a bunch of fallen hair in my hands or my shower. Thank you, L&#x27;oreal! I will be trying more products in this line.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and have been using it for years.  Being sulfate free it&#x27;s not harsh on my hair and it smells great.  Recently it has become hard to find in the stores I normally shop in, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> love that its sulfate and silicone free, great shapoo, it cleanses and nourishes really well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in a L&#x27;Oreal product yet. The Evercreme Nourishing Shampoo does what it claims it will do, leaves your hair feeling smooth and shiny yet clean &amp; full as well. The shampoo has NO sulfates to strip your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it with the dry nappy look. This is recommended for dry to normal hair, but I think it will work for all hair types. It also has a wonderful scent, reminds me of coconuts!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCreme Sulfate-Free Moisture System Nourishing Shampoo is  very good. I like it so much . Thank you for great seller. He sent to me quickly and in excellent packet.</li>
            <li> Great product! Keeps my hair looking healthy and smells amazing! The tube seems small, but you don&#x27;t need much at all. I have long, thick, wavy hair and I use less than I would any other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty regular guy, jeans and a t-shirt, I drive a Ford truck... But this stuff has taken my hair game to a whole new level.  Now I look like my whole life is a shampoo commercial.  I&#x27;ve even started practicing the slow motion hair shake when I take my hat off (I haven&#x27;t had a haircut in 6 months or better.)  Drives the women crazy.  And some of the men too.  Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(In all seriousness, this is excellent shampoo and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this product based on the product itself. I am solely basing this review off of the condition which the product arrived in. There was a huge hole in its side, so the product spilled everywhere, including all over my four other items. Super disappointed and I can&#x27;t even use this product now.</li>
            <li> I really like Loreal and their sulfate-free products, but the EverCreme STINKS! It makes me nauseous. I will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is simply perfect to my red hair!&lt;br /&gt;I always felt comfortable with L&#x27;Oreal products, and this one makes me feel my hair perfect, soft, manageable and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it frequently without problems.&lt;br /&gt;The store was a great dealer with fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
            <li> took this as a try for my teen son, who suffers from dandruff now, and it helped! obviously sulfates are no good, so this clean shampoo solved the problem. and smell is nice</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smell great as well as look amazing.</li>
            <li> Does not work for my frizzy hair. After shampooing hair doest feel soft. Loreal intense nourishing shampoo works better for me.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner together for the past couple months. It makes hair very soft and shiny and smells lovely, however is still pretty heavy. I usually wash my hair every other day or even once every three days if it doesn&#x27;t look greasy. Halfway through the second day in the summer, my hair looks like it could use a wash again. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy but it starts to look very flat and a bit too oily. I might save the other half of this bottle for the dry winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Sulfate free, great low price especially through amazon, makes hair soft and shiny, smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Cons: rich and heavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please hit the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button below:</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and also highly recommend the evercreme mask for anyone with dry wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz. Rich creamy lather with a warm but clean scent. Used this line since it first came out. First time I have been faithful to a hair care brand and line.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and shiny.  Works well with the conditioner and deep conditioner.  Does not suds though, so if you judge a shampoo by its sudsiness, you may not like this product.  Overall satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of hair products for some time because I had been looking for products without the harmful and drying sulfates and parabens found in most shampoos/conditioners. Even expensive salon brands have those toxic chemicals and so i was happy to find these products from L&#x27;Oreal for much less.</li>
            <li> After the first use I thought it did a great job, but after a few uses my hair started getting very greasy. May be great for really dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and the corresponding conditioner for quite some time. I have very curly, fuzzy hair and thought it was cool to find an inexpensive shampoo that was free of sulfates and free of supposedly anything that would weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept ignoring the fact that my hair had such a gunky residue, especially at the roots. I thought maybe it was from my styling products. My hair never felt clean. Finally, I decided to try a different shampoo and conditioner, and lo and behold, my hair is now clean and yet still moisturized; plus, I have noticed less hair in my comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up succinctly, this shampoo is horrible.</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of products. Multiple persons comment on how good it smells! It is a strong smell when wet, but once dry, you must bury your nose in the hair to smell the scent.</li>
            <li> LIKE IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONTAIN SULFAT, ALLEGEDLY</li>
            <li> Love the texture and smell of the product.  Knowing it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates in it make a world of difference</li>
            <li> This is L&#x27;Oreal shampoo - the best :)  I buy it all the time (and the conditioner of course).  Quality is exceptional.  I like to read on the labels that something is not included and something is.  Who knew :)?</li>
            <li> Used with the combination of shampoo and conditioner...it made my hair look fuller, and was definitely more manageable.</li>
            <li> My girl has curly, very dry, blonde and fine hair.. that&#x27;s a though combination and this complete line its making a difference in her hair.. I recomend it!!</li>
