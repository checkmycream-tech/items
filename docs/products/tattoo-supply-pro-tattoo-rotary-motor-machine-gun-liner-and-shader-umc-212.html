            <li>ALL &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; artists who arent sure of what style of machine they prefer to work with should test this baby out.</li>
            <li>Great little machine if you&#x27;re in a pinch or great as a backup.</li>
            <li>the top knob popped off but its easily fixable.</li>
            <li>I love it and enjoy working with it</li>
            <li>enjoy the money you guys got, I could of made a better machine from a stick of gum and a pen.</li>
            <li>I love the light weight of it.</li>
            <li>Love the gun, its light weight and runs smoothly with easy adjustments.</li>
            <li>it has a bunch places where gunk can get in  cant be easily cleaned</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Stays accurate, strong, and lightweight.</li>
            <li>ITS REALLY LIGHT</li>
            <li>GIVE GREAT LINES WITH ONLY ONE PASS</li>
            <li>it is light weight</li>
            <li>works well light weight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plastic, it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I really want to buy a nice rotary now.</li>
            <li>Flimsy &amp; cheap looking.</li>
            <li>good little gun, well made, very light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Pretty good machine so far... the price speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>and the cheap price for the market right now .</li>
            <li>, i know some are better than others,but they are all mostly the same .</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>but they quickly corrected it and promptly delivered the right products i would buy from them again</li>
            <li>Nice little gun but its more of a one time use deal.</li>
            <li>Works well and no crazy calibration or rubber bands needed.</li>
            <li>i got a blue one and i,ve run it almost everday for the last 4 mounths and its still strong,they got some strong motors and go sweet throw for a line or shader,i got tierd of hearing about these guns that are the real dragon fly or beetle bug or what ever, they all made in china or japan,</li>
            <li>is  the lubricant that was sent  was  in a  little  baggy  and not in a  more suitable  form for application  to the machine  </li>
            <li>Coil machines are pretty hot right now, but I, &amp;#34;personally&amp;#34; like lining w/ this lil momma right here !</li>
            <li>just like a boy say a cams off one of them 125.00 stealth fit on his 12.00 torture rack 1, rotary guns that looks just like the high dollar one</li>
            <li>It was quiet, light weight, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works great ill probably buy acouple more.</li>
            <li>hits nice and solid and VERY consistant.</li>
            <li>even paid more for it because I wanted the yellow one arrrrggghhhh</li>
            <li>It fell apart first time I used it</li>
            <li>Because I like hand made,silent, powerful machines you can run 12-15 hours straight that don&#x27;t over heat or make your hand hot</li>
            <li>aware...</li>
            <li>was actually pretty good.its</li>
            <li>Broke after first time using it.</li>
            <li>Went to test the gun when I first got it</li>
            <li>Thumb screw stripped on first use.</li>
            <li>the  motor dont get hot  </li>
            <li>The knob on top adjusts a little too easily.</li>
            <li>It is different, obviously, than the coil guns, but definitely love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing, I&#x27;ve used cool machines for the past 5 years and this little thing runs crazy good, eliminates many problems you have with a coil, this thing is slightly down scale from the actual dragonfly but a huge price difference, most def worth the price plus way more</li>
            <li>I have a real one and wanted to see how well this one was built compared.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>i am wondering if they sell a machined  aluminum  or  stainless drive  </li>
            <li>I was only able to complete about 20 outlines with this machine before the motor died.</li>
            <li>I am new to tattooing, this is my first rotary machine, and I must say it is much lighter and quiter that my coil machines.</li>
            <li>but for lining its not heavy enough, for shading not heavy enough ,but for the price i got to tear it apart and build my own machine!</li>
            <li>Overall, great little machine!</li>
            <li>I kept it clean and oiled and properly adjusted, but it just didn&#x27;t have the life span.</li>
            <li>its cool when i used for lining and shading, in future i will order again.</li>
            <li>The adjustment screw at the top is just a cap you have to take that off and use needle nose plyers to screw it down or up.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really say anything more than that.</li>
            <li>All plastic, requires high voltage and needle tensioner wheel doesn&#x27;t line up.</li>
            <li>I kinda love the little thing.</li>
            <li>so had to get a new metal one.  </li>
            <li>Not very good for color, the ones I got can do Black and Gray no problem, very cheap parts though all plastic, needle bar stableizer doesnt line up with the needle bar, the plastic tube chuck striped pretty quick</li>
            <li>I love the way they are quiet and use little voltage to run but they are cheaply made the plastic on them for the vice strips out and the needle tends to jump due to the needle stabilizer.</li>
            <li>Every thing else is straight forward as it gets.plus doesn&#x27;t get hot nor does it need rebuilt constantly as apose To traditional tat guns.</li>
            <li>seems a little cheaply made, haven&#x27;t tried it out yet will probably just stick with coil machines though  may change my mind after using it</li>
            <li>lol crazy rick</li>
            <li>this is coming from a licensed, and professional artist of sixteen years.</li>
            <li>Cant really complain it was only like $7.00 Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone though.</li>
            <li>really surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li>Direct to the trash bin.</li>
            <li>not less you go in them.its</li>
            <li>,i bet these guns got the same motor all of the high dollar ones have ,you don&#x27;nt</li>
            <li>The needle tensioner is plastic, and the knob that u read about in most reviews that say it don&#x27;t do anything, that it&#x27;s for look does actually work, it controls how hard the needle hits.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the new style rotary&#x27; sand overall</li>

            <li> seems a little cheaply made, haven&#x27;t tried it out yet will probably just stick with coil machines though  may change my mind after using it</li>
            <li> lol crazy rick</li>
            <li> this is coming from a licensed, and professional artist of sixteen years.</li>
            <li> Cant really complain it was only like $7.00 Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone though.</li>
            <li> really surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li> Direct to the trash bin.</li>
            <li> not less you go in them.its</li>
            <li> ,i bet these guns got the same motor all of the high dollar ones have ,you don&#x27;nt</li>
            <li> The needle tensioner is plastic, and the knob that u read about in most reviews that say it don&#x27;t do anything, that it&#x27;s for look does actually work, it controls how hard the needle hits.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the new style rotary&#x27; sand overall</li>
            <li> I am not used to the fact that its so light, I have to used metal grips (i hate it) (for safety reasons) other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> hits  pretty hard  </li>
            <li> i really like the way the machine fits  in the hand  and  has very little vibration and  </li>
            <li> The only let down is the needlle tensioner as i personally like rubberbands.</li>
            <li> but  the  main drive linkage for the  \\&quot;armature\\&quot; seems  to be  made of a  a hard pvc or plastic</li>
            <li> i said its all the same shit from over seas,now inks a different story</li>
            <li> Put a drop of oil down the shaft and put the cap back on.</li>
            <li> But after contacting the seller a few times, got the purchase price and shipping was returned back onto my card!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected thank you</li>
            <li> Hands don&#x27;t get tired as fast and the weight is awsome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little shaky, runs a little hot, feels flimsy and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> at first i was angry that they screwed up my order</li>
            <li> if so i would recommend ordering that as well other than that  </li>
            <li> other words over sea&#x27;s</li>
            <li> weak, not powerful enough to actually use</li>
            <li> Only problem, the tensioner screw is a little hard to turn, but if you cut the spring down that will fix it.</li>
            <li> It is presently somewhere in the bush having been disposed of unceremoniously for being such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont waste your time buy a rotary that has weight</li>
            <li> Wasnt suprised that I wasted money on it but hoped otherwise.  </li>
            <li> The product broke immediately, waste of money.</li>
            <li> To long of a stroke for lining to weak of a motor for color packing.</li>
            <li> also the stroke knob has very little adjustment to it, but what the hell is that for any way.</li>
            <li> it worked for the first week and took a crap on me</li>
            <li> solid machine ill give you that!</li>
            <li> then it was broken before I could start working with it</li>
            <li> Poor product.</li>
            <li> The plastic knob (two pieces) was broken out of the package.</li>
            <li> all a advertising game</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and the vibration irritates the nerves in my hand but if it was not the size and type of gun it would be much worse!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Red one and that one looks and feels worst.  </li>
            <li> The stroke knob doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s because is just a fake knob.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the false advertising of this machine   </li>
            <li> TOTALLY UNHAPPY.</li>
            <li> disappointed when i opened the package.</li>
            <li> I hate people who misadvertise their products   </li>
            <li> Worst rotary machine out!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> weak, not powerful enough to actually use</li>
            <li> The best gun I&#x27;ve bought for a tenth of the price</li>
            <li> this machine works wonderful and very good quality I love it and enjoy working with it</li>
            <li> Came as described !👍🏽</li>
            <li> at first i was angry that they screwed up my order but they quickly corrected it and promptly delivered the right products i would buy from them again because i know s*** happens but i know now if it does happen again i will be taken care of thanks for the tattoo gun with the rotary engine great product as well great feel better than in the picture has needle tensioner which i didnt even know it came with thank you to my supplier love the product</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS GUN ITS REALLY LIGHT ITS LIKE USING A INK PIN OR PENCIL GIVE GREAT LINES WITH ONLY ONE PASS</li>
            <li> Better then I could have imagined. Works well and no crazy calibration or rubber bands needed. The only Cali is tube to needle bepth and voltage. Every thing else is straight forward as it gets.plus doesn&#x27;t get hot nor does it need rebuilt constantly as apose To traditional tat guns. Witch require constant tooling to keep in synk.</li>
            <li> This is a nice tatt gun and would recommend to others! It is different, obviously, than the coil guns, but definitely love it! Ordered the red one too, but it did not come as it was not in stock? But after contacting the seller a few times, got the purchase price and shipping was returned back onto my card! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t work. Haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work. Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Works fine. I got what I paid fire.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little shaky, runs a little hot, feels flimsy and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;But it just keeps on laying in the ink like it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;Look I been tattooing for 20 years and I&#x27;ve used a ton of machines that cost a lot more but this one just works.&lt;br /&gt;Not for beginners though. If you don&#x27;t know what you are doing you will lay someone open. Pros.</li>
            <li> this machine is not yellow and I specifically wanted the yellow color not GOLD!!!! even paid more for it because I wanted the yellow one arrrrggghhhh I hate people who misadvertise their products   I expect this purchase to be refunded as soon as possible I am very unhappy with the false advertising of this machine   I WANT A REFUND NOW!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It dont work the way i wanted it to work so i was not veary happy with it but i needed it so....</li>
            <li> It fell apart first time I used it</li>
            <li> Love the gun, its light weight and runs smoothly with easy adjustments. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> Works great ill probably buy acouple more. .Fast shipping. Great product ..what eles can you ask for ...need more color options</li>
            <li> Is disposable to use it twice lost the screws and springs are disarmed alone do not recommend</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this machine. I have the red and the yellow and they work great</li>
            <li> Supply pro is the best tool to work!</li>
            <li> it atwroks good. it is light weight and it fits in my hand perfect. i  recommend it to everybody. it is great.</li>
            <li> This unit lasted about 5 hours and then just went into burn out mode and stopped working. It is presently somewhere in the bush having been disposed of unceremoniously for being such a disappointment. My son did question why it was only $15.00. I told him to give it a try which we have now done. Another more costly one is on the way.</li>
            <li> I recieved this machine and keeped an open mind to its performance. It works really good. Stays accurate, strong, and lightweight. The only let down is the needlle tensioner as i personally like rubberbands. But you may like the tentioner for yourself. To each their own. Put a drop of oil down the shaft and put the cap back on. Overall, great little machine!</li>
            <li> Because I like hand made,silent, powerful machines you can run 12-15 hours straight that don&#x27;t over heat or make your hand hot</li>
            <li> Machine works great. Hands don&#x27;t get tired as fast and the weight is awsome. I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> To long of a stroke for lining to weak of a motor for color packing. Look elsewhere for your next machine.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, love using this machine. its cool when i used for lining and shading, in future i will order again.</li>
            <li> Dont buy this....plastic all over...ran it once then it was broken before I could start working with it ....looked nice tho smh</li>
            <li> Machine worked great as a liner. I wanted to try the new style rotary&#x27; sand overall I loved this machine. It was quiet, light weight, and easy to use. The depressor was awesome, However it&#x27;s life was short lived. I was only able to complete about 20 outlines with this machine before the motor died. I kept it clean and oiled and properly adjusted, but it just didn&#x27;t have the life span. Great little machine if you&#x27;re in a pinch or great as a backup. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily shop use.</li>
            <li> love it but one post needed to be resodered</li>
            <li> Nice little gun but its more of a one time use deal. Made of plastic it has a bunch places where gunk can get in  cant be easily cleaned</li>
            <li> what I got was not what I ordered. what I got was a flimsy piece of plastic garbage. this is coming from a licensed, and professional artist of sixteen years. this is not a scratcher review. what I wanted was metal not plastic. enjoy the money you guys got, I could of made a better machine from a stick of gum and a pen. you get the point. TOTALLY UNHAPPY.</li>
            <li> works well light weight id recommend it  all around a good product packaged kind of crappy  but that&#x27;s okay it worked</li>
            <li> Not very good for color, the ones I got can do Black and Gray no problem, very cheap parts though all plastic, needle bar stableizer doesnt line up with the needle bar, the plastic tube chuck striped pretty quick so had to get a new metal one.  The adjustment screw at the top is just a cap you have to take that off and use needle nose plyers to screw it down or up.  Cant really complain it was only like $7.00 Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone though.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping</li>
            <li> really surprised by the quality. much better than i thought for the price. the top knob popped off but its easily fixable. I love the light weight of it. I have fibromyalgia and the vibration irritates the nerves in my hand but if it was not the size and type of gun it would be much worse!</li>
            <li> Better than the rest.</li>
            <li> Really nice an light machine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic, it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s a toy, but i&#x27;/ll be DAMNED if it doesn&#x27;t work!  I kinda love the little thing. After my experience with this I really want to buy a nice rotary now.</li>
            <li> works excellent just like any pro setup</li>
            <li> My gun has already stopped working</li>
            <li> solid machine ill give you that! but for lining its not heavy enough, for shading not heavy enough ,but for the price i got to tear it apart and build my own machine! so i guess i win? lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont waste your time buy a rotary that has weight or youll be tearin this apart and making your own machine!</li>
            <li> I am new to tattooing, this is my first rotary machine, and I must say it is much lighter and quiter that my coil machines. The chassis is aluminum, not plastic as I read in some reviews. The needle tensioner is plastic, and the knob that u read about in most reviews that say it don&#x27;t do anything, that it&#x27;s for look does actually work, it controls how hard the needle hits. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price. Wish I started with this machine. A++</li>
            <li> seems a little cheaply made, haven&#x27;t tried it out yet will probably just stick with coil machines though  may change my mind after using it</li>
            <li> I have been tattooing for  about 5 years now and have always used a traditional tattoo machine. A friend of mine told me about the rotatory machines so I thought would test them out. I love the way they are quiet and use little voltage to run but they are cheaply made the plastic on them for the vice strips out and the needle tends to jump due to the needle stabilizer. I have gotten 3 of these machine now and plan on going back to the traditional machines.</li>
            <li> thought this would be an ok machine, I was wrong it worked for the first week and took a crap on me I wouldn&#x27;t waist my money</li>
            <li> excelent product and faster shiping !!! and the cheap price for the market right now . I recomend it good!!!!</li>
            <li> el producto esta bien, aunque no es un producto que se ve duradero debido a que la carcasa de la maquina al parecer es un material plástico.</li>
            <li> Pretty good machine so far... the price speaks for itself. The frame is made well. The knob on top adjusts a little too easily. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really say anything more than that.</li>
            <li> good little gun, well made, very light and easy to use. Only problem, the tensioner screw is a little hard to turn, but if you cut the spring down that will fix it. also the stroke knob has very little adjustment to it, but what the hell is that for any way. hits nice and solid and VERY consistant. great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome machine for linning work. i recommend you yo try it out &#x3D;) excellent item thanks for the good service, i wish you continue with the great service and the good quality of all your items!</li>
            <li> Worst rotary machine out!!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy.  I have a real one and wanted to see how well this one was built compared. Wasnt suprised that I wasted money on it but hoped otherwise.  All plastic, requires high voltage and needle tensioner wheel doesn&#x27;t line up. Junk.</li>
            <li> Looks like a solid product, we have not had the chance to use it, but it came with extra rubber bands, and looks very solid.</li>
            <li> I am not used to the fact that its so light, I have to used metal grips (i hate it) (for safety reasons) other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> Couldnt even finish a 2 hour tattoo, motor started going out. For a good cheap rotary try the &amp;#34;rotary motor w1 tattoo machine&amp;#34;. Ive done more than 40 hours with no problems at all!</li>
            <li> This is a machine, not a gun, guns kill people, and the correct name for the \\&quot;real\\&quot; machine is a \\&quot;Dragonfly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The product broke immediately, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Flimsy &amp; cheap looking. won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Good machine....as advertised. ALL &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; artists who arent sure of what style of machine they prefer to work with should test this baby out. I like being different and not follow what &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; is doing. Coil machines are pretty hot right now, but I, &amp;#34;personally&amp;#34; like lining w/ this lil momma right here !</li>
            <li> received the machines today. fast delivery. disappointed when i opened the package. the body of this machine is made of plastic. Not composite not aluminum. this is the Yellow machine. I also ordered the Red one and that one looks and feels worst.  The stroke knob doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s because is just a fake knob. but i guess that was what i paid for, right???&lt;br /&gt;the stroke is set and can&#x27;t be adjusted. will see how it does. i was looking for a stroke adjuster type machine.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to look somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be aware...</li>
            <li> there is no directions or instructions of any sort with this packages</li>
            <li> Junk broke in 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these machines and only 1 worked when i recieved them.the one that worked was actually pretty good.its ashame they all didnt work</li>
            <li> Poor product. Broke after first time using it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all</li>
            <li> Amazing, I&#x27;ve used cool machines for the past 5 years and this little thing runs crazy good, eliminates many problems you have with a coil, this thing is slightly down scale from the actual dragonfly but a huge price difference, most def worth the price plus way more</li>
            <li> Went to test the gun when I first got it and it stopped working and now will not even work at all. Faulty gun was sent to me</li>
            <li> The part that tightens the stem to the gun broke... Do u have replacement parts ?</li>
            <li> Very cheap product. The plastic knob (two pieces) was broken out of the package. Thumb screw stripped on first use. Not even going to attempt using this on a person. Direct to the trash bin.</li>
            <li> i just bought  this  machine  received  it about  a week er 2 ago  it runs  very quiet  hits  pretty hard  shipping  was  awesome  the only thing  i see  is  the lubricant that was sent  was  in a  little  baggy  and not in a  more suitable  form for application  to the machine  the  motor dont get hot  but  the  main drive linkage for the  \\&quot;armature\\&quot; seems  to be  made of a  a hard pvc or plastic i am wondering if they sell a machined  aluminum  or  stainless drive  for this machine  if so i would recommend ordering that as well other than that  i really like the way the machine fits  in the hand  and  has very little vibration and  very pleased  with how consistant this machine  hits  and  runs</li>
            <li> i got a blue one and i,ve run it almost everday for the last 4 mounths and its still strong,they got some strong motors and go sweet throw for a line or shader,i got tierd of hearing about these guns that are the real dragon fly or beetle bug or what ever, they all made in china or japan,other words over sea&#x27;s,i bet these guns got the same motor all of the high dollar ones have ,you don&#x27;nt no whats in the guts of them guns not less you go in them.its all a advertising game, i know some are better than others,but they are all mostly the same . just like a boy say a cams off one of them 125.00 stealth fit on his 12.00 torture rack 1, rotary guns that looks just like the high dollar one,what does that tell you.like i said its all the same shit from over seas,now inks a different story ,you need to buy usa ink not china ink,because you might end up at the hopital. lol crazy rick</li>
            <li> this was a good deal! it works just as good as 200$ tattoo gun! its great for a gift to someone who does tattoos. very happy with it</li>
