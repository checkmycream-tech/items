            <li>when i received it on the mail it came good and everything, the bad side is when you bend this</li>

            <li> when i received it on the mail it came good and everything, the bad side is when you bend this they dont quite stay in place but it made my hair good curls, also i only gave 4 because i dont know how durable they r gonna be</li>
            <li> Very good. Fast delivery from China. 10 days to get shipped to me. It was a little smaller than what I expected. I wish they could have taken a picture of the rollers with an object just to have an idea on how big the rollers are</li>
            <li> Great product for doing curls without heat, first time trying it and it did worked .. Happy with the item</li>
            <li> AAA Not really the right size but exactly what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> Sooooo thin.... I wish I had read other reviews .. It&#x27;s good if someone wants perms lol</li>
            <li> Great for sleeping as we&#x27;ll not hurting while u lieing down</li>
            <li> They make pretty curls , depending on your hair you might have somewhat trouble putting them in but it&#x27;s easier the more you use it</li>
            <li> Works just like a conair brand</li>
            <li> the are really short i do think its a little to expensive for what it is its probably better to go to a local store and purchase something similar</li>
            <li> These are great. Although they are small and for short hair. I did try them on my long hair and the curls were tight. They arrived before the due date. Don&#x27;t know if I would buy another pack due to the s/h charges that cost more than sponge foam rollers.</li>
            <li> Good. They came as they said they would. I could&#x27;ve sworn that I ordered 4 packs abd I only got 3 so that was a bit confusing.</li>
            <li> These things are the size of a pencil. This picture is deceiving. They are very very thin. Not good for people with long thick natural hair. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking every where for these, and when I found these the price was just right and they were exactly what I was looking for. They arrived at my earlier than the shipping required and are working great.  thank you</li>
            <li> They worked extremely well but they fell out a few times while I was doing them, it worked a little to well like I got a perm</li>
            <li> A little cheaply made, the ends can get caught in your hair, but it is for a cheap price so its a good deal for that price!</li>
            <li> They have a strong rubber smell that causes headache. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell of car tires on your hair go for it!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted but worked just fine</li>
            <li> Work well if used overnight.  My granddaughter loved her curls.  However, do not brush - comb out using your fingers for the best results.</li>
            <li> gets caught and rips your hair</li>
