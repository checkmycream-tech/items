            <li>After recent surgery, these were just perfect for the sponge bath phase.</li>
            <li>They are much more like washcloths than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Awesome to keep in your bag or the back of your car.</li>
            <li>and I even give have gifted them to friends.</li>
            <li>It was my fault I bought way more than I needed.</li>
            <li>The instructions will tell you to use all the contents of one pack for cleaning, but I think that applies more to a clinical environment.</li>
            <li>My experience differs from most.  </li>
            <li>satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for after a moderate workout at the gym.</li>
            <li>I have tried the &#x27;survival&#x27; body wash towels, but they are more than six times the cost.  </li>
            <li>but after that okay.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do anything for the hair, of course, but the body felt nice and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that, these have a nice clean, but not perfumed, scent.  </li>
            <li>Great to even keep take with you for a quick &amp; easy way to cool off / freshen up when you are out and about in the heat.  </li>

            <li>They are super handy for camping.</li>
            <li>These are very substantial and are the perfect thing for after a workout at the gym when there&#x27;s not time for a shower or when the workout has not been extremely intense.</li>
            <li>They have a nice clean fragrance and are easily disposable in the garbage can.</li>
            <li>Other than that, awesome product and I&#x27;ll buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>The scent is great and you really do feel clean after using.</li>
            <li>and most important</li>
            <li>and I love them for a quick, refreshing body cleansing when I don&#x27;t have time for a shower.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to freshen up on the trail.  </li>

            <li>Easy to microwave</li>
            <li>They are a nice quick clean up when you need one.</li>

            <li>I particularly like the good size of the wipes and the fact they are not flimsy.</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>More convenient than taking a shower, and gets the job done quick.</li>
            <li>They are to use when a quick &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; is needed and they are well worth having a pack handy.</li>
            <li>Refreshing clean scent and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The other day my sister asked me what kind of soap did I use because I smelled so nice!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and smells clean.</li>
            <li>I felt refreshed and my skin felt smooth too.</li>
            <li>Like others say, this is a great product, but you definitely don&#x27;t need one for each part of the body.</li>
            <li>Great for bathing following surgery.</li>
            <li>They really come in handy when you are traveling, or for an emergency.</li>
            <li>I workout during my lunch break at work and these allow me to fit my workout and lunch in a 1 hour time limit.  </li>
            <li>These are the best yet for those who have trouble getting out of bed.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and keeps you clean smelling between showers.</li>
            <li>As the label on the back recommends, these are great for ridding the perianal region of foul odors.</li>
            <li>Works great and so nice after a long hot hike.</li>
            <li>Love these for quick clean up on the run.</li>
            <li>Works good in the wild</li>
            <li>They are also very useful for traveling.</li>
            <li>They would probably be great for camping, but I don&#x27;t clean myself when I&#x27;m out in the woods because I&#x27;m not a big sissy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also great to have in the car to wipe hands clean of grease and such.</li>
            <li>Leave skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy, very convenient (we even used them while my husband was in the hospital)....</li>
            <li>The scent if very light and the towels are high quality and do not rip easily.  </li>
            <li>Kept me clean and fresh out in my 3-4 day camping excursion with no facilities in sight!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t cheap if you wanted to use them regularly for any reason, but they were good for my situation.</li>
            <li>I just felt clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll come in handy for my multiple interstitial catheter radiation treatments also, because I won&#x27;t be able to shower during the time the catheters are in.</li>
            <li>After running three ~7 mile legs over a 32 hour period I felt fairly clean, as reportedly did everyone else in the van.</li>
            <li>I recommend, affordable way to keep clean outdoors or when you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I use these to clean up after a sweaty day at work and they do the job.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses them now after horseback riding, where there&#x27;s nothing but a hose to clean with.</li>
            <li>Clean the body well and removed the funk</li>
            <li>I misread those instructions when I got my first 5-pack, and I&#x27;m glad I did, or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them again as one pack would be good for only two uses.</li>
            <li>I mtn bike at lunch at work and keeping these in the fridge leaves me feeling cool and clean after.</li>
            <li>I worked up a good sweat every day, and got into some dirty places, but these were great in making sure I was clean when I crawled into my sleeping bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good and the wipes are larger size.</li>
            <li>They have a mild, clean scent.</li>
            <li>These were very helpful refreshing me in the hospital.</li>
            <li>I always take these along and feel very refreshed to be able to &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; a bit on an outdoor adventure.</li>
            <li>For a quick clean up-can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li>not bad...</li>
            <li>These wipes keep you clean and fresh, when you can not bathe.</li>
            <li>They leave me feeling fresh and clean and I just toss them when I am done.</li>
            <li>I used on a 6 day backcountry backpacking trip and smelled clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>In convenient packages with resealable tops, so the rest of the pkg stays moist.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for every age, where mobility may be a factor, or just a quick refresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years for quick &amp;#34;bathing&amp;#34; during my camping trips.  </li>
            <li>and we now keep them around in the car for quick cleanups when needed.  </li>
            <li>These are life savers when you are camping, we were out in some very hot and humid weather and used these in the evening to refresh ourselves before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li>They are much thicker than the usual wipes, more like a felt wash cloth than a wipe, and I think this makes them more effective.  </li>
            <li>the fact that the package reseals after each towel is used makes it one of the most useful male hygiene products available.  </li>
            <li>However, I was able to out-stink them with my old fart BO.</li>
            <li>And they not only allow for a quick cleanup, but have a refreshing, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a useful product.</li>
            <li>I honestly have found multiple uses</li>
            <li>The 5-pack is useful for keeping one in a travel bag, backpack, car, one in the desk at work, etc.</li>
            <li>i absolutly love these wipes, they do a great job in cleaning and leave no residue behind, i used to buy the from walgreens till they stoped selling them and replaced the with a walgreens knock-off of them, the knock-offs</li>
            <li>does what its meant to do--very useful</li>
            <li>2 days traveling in the same clothes - these would have came in handy.  </li>
            <li>This is like a big moistened disposable towel, but it effectively cleans body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Extremely useful for those with skin problems, or people who can&#x27;t use a tub or shower for some reason.  </li>
            <li>Many times I&#x27;m not sweaty enough to need a shower and don&#x27;t have a lot of time - these leave me clean and smelling nice going back to work.</li>
            <li>I bought these for a friend who&#x27;s bedridden with cancer, and she says these wipes make her feel very clean and refreshed, and leave her skin feeling soft, without the sticky residue that some wipes impart, or the drying effect of others.</li>
            <li>These are just right,  And</li>
            <li>Loved these right after surgery and for the few weeks following as a full on shower was and is still a big production so these give a great alternative to that.  </li>
            <li>Great for traveling and camping and places where you want to be refreshed but are not able to bathe in a shower or tub.</li>
            <li>An absolute necessity when a full shower or bath is out of the question.  </li>
            <li>Perfect to wipe yourself down after a long day of hiking!</li>
            <li>Now let me preface this by saying that when I workout I don&#x27;t sweat very much.  </li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am older and have poor balance, this product is excellent for me.  </li>
            <li>These wipes are very sturdy and clean very well.</li>
            <li>One seems to do an appropriate job with all the major parts, but I would suggest two for a whole body swab.</li>
            <li>Nice and big, very moist, and leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and</li>
            <li>These really work!</li>
            <li>These are great if you&#x27;re camping and just want to freshen up, or if you&#x27;re running late for work and don&#x27;t have time to shower.</li>
            <li>This product is the best thing to have when you are unable to take a shower.  </li>
            <li>First saw them when my husband was in the hospital and they heated them up and gave them to him to use for a &#x27;bed bath&#x27;.</li>
            <li>So I went camping in the keys in June and it was quite hot...</li>
            <li>face first, chest, then underarms and &amp;#34;privates&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>There was more than enough &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; on the wipe to make it over a 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; frame.</li>
            <li>I only used one, and used it on mr from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>We are avid campers, backpackers, rafters, and hikers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t feel like they left any residue, they felt quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am able to wash my entire body with 2 wipes.  </li>
            <li>It works quite well and refreshing, especially in the summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good heavy quality.  </li>
            <li>A road warrior would never have to shower -- just a hair wash in a sink every few days, and you&#x27;re good.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a quick holdover for a shower.</li>
            <li>I generally used two wipes after each leg, although probably could have done fine just using one.</li>
            <li>I like it a whole lot better than the baby wipes I used to use, especially since it didn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to do my bit to conserve every drop of water I can, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on personal hygiene.</li>
            <li>They will need to be rewet during your woe down with warm water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who feels like it&#x27;s necessary to take a shower pretty much every day, but these worked fine while camping.  </li>
            <li>Product make it easy for me as a care giver, to care for the cleansing needs of my relative.</li>
            <li>Be sure to dry the skin afterward; they are quite moist, which is why they do the job.</li>
            <li>When they arrived I realized I&#x27;d underestimated how large the packs and wipes are - the photo is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li>Great product - nicely packed, good-size wipes (like the size of a handkerchief) with thick cloth-like material, and very, very little scent.</li>
            <li>fine when I had to take sink baths after a back surgery.</li>
            <li>bathing wipe is large and can be used for a reasonable area.  </li>
            <li>With 1 sheet you can clean pretty much your entire body.</li>
            <li>Better than cheap wet wipes, but only a bit.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to bath my mom and the 8 count</li>
            <li>This product has been very helpful to me.</li>
            <li>She really appreciated this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>worked great when my husband had his broken and couldnt bath</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, they are very moist and do the job well.</li>
            <li>These bathing wipes worked very well.  </li>
            <li>These worked really well.</li>
            <li>Made post-surgery for breast cancer so much easier because I couldn&#x27;t shower for a while.</li>
            <li>These wipes worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to bring with you to the hiking trips.</li>
            <li>Fast Ship.  </li>
            <li>Used it for a trek in Peru, one wipe cleaned my whole body</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I was using baby wipes this whole time...</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and fast drying, they take the grime off and allow me not to suffer the horrors of the shower at work.</li>
            <li>These are very convenient.</li>
            <li>They really are &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This cloth is thick and is moist with a nice and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, the cloths are thick and do a good job of cleaning oneself.</li>
            <li>Did not use on burn areas but excellent for someone with limited mobility, not steady on feet or anyone who is not near a shower but would like to stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have purchased multiple times and never disappointed.</li>
            <li>I ran a Ragnar Relay recently and bought a pack of these to use between legs of the race (since showers didn&#x27;t appear to be easily accessible</li>
            <li>For the physically challenged, it is a way to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I loved these wipes and will definitely use them again for post-jogging and other camping/hiking trips!</li>
            <li>No Rinse bathing wipes smell better than the other wipes and are nice and thick.</li>
            <li>These are thick and strong and leave my skin feeling CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>I recommend them, highly.  </li>
            <li>Other products of this kind have the same problem.</li>
            <li>I can say that during ten days in the back country hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering, dune climbing, and white water rafting, these kept me clean and odor free.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and really helps my tired feet once the boots are off.</li>
            <li>Great when someone is ill - but lots of uses for them when everyone is well.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I only needed one per session since I was not particularly dirty.</li>
            <li>These are awesome after a long hike and unable to shower.</li>
            <li>When you open and close the package, they are fresh &amp; not all</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick wipe</li>
            <li>Thick towels with a nice scent</li>
            <li>If you are recovering from surgery and have limited movement or cannot get into the bath, they will keep you clean.</li>
            <li>I get tired of having to shower daily, great to use if your wife complains.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re really tall/big or sweaty--one sheet is enough for your whole body.  </li>
            <li>Nice, thickly padded, soft cloths.</li>
            <li>Lightly damp when taken from the wrapper, it is just the right balance between being too wet and too dry.</li>
            <li>I then used them out in the desert pretty much daily.  </li>
            <li>These worked pretty well actually.</li>
            <li>Kind of a strong baby powder smell, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li>folks who between showers or baths wanting some freshness can appreciate this product.&lt;br /&gt;These wipes clean without having rinse--you only wipe dry.</li>
            <li>Discovered this product when I was in the hospital and completely bed ridden.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am a frequent user of this product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use them frequently because they use an antibacterial chemical and</li>
            <li>Have not bathed in 37 days so far</li>
            <li>It is really intended for bathing,  although no water or rinsing is necessary.</li>
            <li>and they recommend one wipe per body part, but by applying strategically, you only need one wipe for your whole body-</li>
            <li>1or 2 is enough for the whole body</li>
            <li>Once I got to the bottom of my legs, the wipe didn&#x27;t have as much moisture left, but it did</li>
            <li>The wipes are of uniform quality - the wipe size is fairly standard to similar products, and the wipes held plenty of moisture fresh from the package.</li>
            <li>The towels are thick and fragrant and feel more like a cloth towel than a flimsy paper towel.  </li>
            <li>These provide a good alternative on those days, and they last a long time even after  opening as long as you press all air out of package and reseal the package tightly.  </li>
            <li>Due to disability, a full shower is just not possible on some days.</li>
            <li>They are very moist so you may want to use a towel to dry yourself after use.</li>
            <li>Likewise, it feels sticky for a few minutes, then that sensation quickly fades.</li>
            <li>The cloths themselves are nice and thick, and not overly wet.  </li>
            <li>I have bad pain and find it hard to bath every day works great for keeping hands clean.</li>
            <li>These are great for people who are sick and can&#x27;t or just don&#x27;t feel like taking a shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you are covered in grime, one single wipe can do the whole body if you plan the &#x27;cleansing logistics&#x27; properly (face, then arms, descending towards the unmentionables)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I would be stuck in a van with a bunch of other people for 32 hours straight).</li>
            <li>Also good when you are in a jam and unable to use the shower at home!</li>
            <li>Water rationing in the late &#x27;70s was so restrictive in the county in which I now live that residents couldn&#x27;t bathe or shower every day and even then, it was a pretty sketchy affair.</li>
            <li>This really does help keep down your smell on the trail without making you smell like a perfume factory.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers thought they were too small, but they are just right for me.  </li>
            <li>: In another review, \\&quot;bogmonkey\\&quot; wisely points out that using one cloth for every section of the body (as the package instructions recommend) is unnecessary, and seems a bit excessive (unless you&#x27;ve just emerged from a mud bath).</li>
            <li>The two main downsides of the product are: Sticky residue left on skin after use (much worse than other comparable &#x27;no rinse&#x27; wipes); and the package is not resealable - be sure to put them into a plastic bag after opening or they will dry out in a day.</li>

            <li> and I even give have gifted them to friends.</li>
            <li> It was my fault I bought way more than I needed.</li>
            <li> The instructions will tell you to use all the contents of one pack for cleaning, but I think that applies more to a clinical environment.</li>
            <li> My experience differs from most.  </li>
            <li> satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for after a moderate workout at the gym.</li>

            <li> but after that okay.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do anything for the hair, of course, but the body felt nice and clean.</li>

            <li> They are to use when a quick &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; is needed and they are well worth having a pack handy.</li>
            <li> Refreshing clean scent and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> The other day my sister asked me what kind of soap did I use because I smelled so nice!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and smells clean.</li>
            <li> I felt refreshed and my skin felt smooth too.</li>
            <li> Like others say, this is a great product, but you definitely don&#x27;t need one for each part of the body.</li>
            <li> Great for bathing following surgery.</li>
            <li> They really come in handy when you are traveling, or for an emergency.</li>
            <li> I workout during my lunch break at work and these allow me to fit my workout and lunch in a 1 hour time limit.  </li>
            <li> These are the best yet for those who have trouble getting out of bed.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and keeps you clean smelling between showers.</li>
            <li> As the label on the back recommends, these are great for ridding the perianal region of foul odors.</li>
            <li> Works great and so nice after a long hot hike.</li>
            <li> Love these for quick clean up on the run.</li>
            <li> Works good in the wild</li>
            <li> They are also very useful for traveling.</li>
            <li> They would probably be great for camping, but I don&#x27;t clean myself when I&#x27;m out in the woods because I&#x27;m not a big sissy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also great to have in the car to wipe hands clean of grease and such.</li>
            <li> Leave skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy, very convenient (we even used them while my husband was in the hospital)....</li>
            <li> The scent if very light and the towels are high quality and do not rip easily.  </li>
            <li> Kept me clean and fresh out in my 3-4 day camping excursion with no facilities in sight!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t cheap if you wanted to use them regularly for any reason, but they were good for my situation.</li>
            <li> I just felt clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll come in handy for my multiple interstitial catheter radiation treatments also, because I won&#x27;t be able to shower during the time the catheters are in.</li>
            <li> After running three ~7 mile legs over a 32 hour period I felt fairly clean, as reportedly did everyone else in the van.</li>
            <li> I recommend, affordable way to keep clean outdoors or when you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean up after a sweaty day at work and they do the job.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses them now after horseback riding, where there&#x27;s nothing but a hose to clean with.</li>
            <li> Clean the body well and removed the funk</li>
            <li> I misread those instructions when I got my first 5-pack, and I&#x27;m glad I did, or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them again as one pack would be good for only two uses.</li>
            <li> I mtn bike at lunch at work and keeping these in the fridge leaves me feeling cool and clean after.</li>
            <li> I worked up a good sweat every day, and got into some dirty places, but these were great in making sure I was clean when I crawled into my sleeping bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells good and the wipes are larger size.</li>
            <li> They have a mild, clean scent.</li>
            <li> These were very helpful refreshing me in the hospital.</li>
            <li> I always take these along and feel very refreshed to be able to &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; a bit on an outdoor adventure.</li>
            <li> For a quick clean up-can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> not bad...</li>
            <li> These wipes keep you clean and fresh, when you can not bathe.</li>
            <li> They leave me feeling fresh and clean and I just toss them when I am done.</li>
            <li> I used on a 6 day backcountry backpacking trip and smelled clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> In convenient packages with resealable tops, so the rest of the pkg stays moist.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for every age, where mobility may be a factor, or just a quick refresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years for quick &amp;#34;bathing&amp;#34; during my camping trips.  </li>
            <li> and we now keep them around in the car for quick cleanups when needed.  </li>
            <li> These are life savers when you are camping, we were out in some very hot and humid weather and used these in the evening to refresh ourselves before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li> They are much thicker than the usual wipes, more like a felt wash cloth than a wipe, and I think this makes them more effective.  </li>
            <li> the fact that the package reseals after each towel is used makes it one of the most useful male hygiene products available.  </li>
            <li> However, I was able to out-stink them with my old fart BO.</li>
            <li> And they not only allow for a quick cleanup, but have a refreshing, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a useful product.</li>
            <li> I honestly have found multiple uses</li>
            <li> The 5-pack is useful for keeping one in a travel bag, backpack, car, one in the desk at work, etc.</li>
            <li> i absolutly love these wipes, they do a great job in cleaning and leave no residue behind, i used to buy the from walgreens till they stoped selling them and replaced the with a walgreens knock-off of them, the knock-offs</li>
            <li> does what its meant to do--very useful</li>
            <li> 2 days traveling in the same clothes - these would have came in handy.  </li>
            <li> This is like a big moistened disposable towel, but it effectively cleans body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extremely useful for those with skin problems, or people who can&#x27;t use a tub or shower for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Many times I&#x27;m not sweaty enough to need a shower and don&#x27;t have a lot of time - these leave me clean and smelling nice going back to work.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend who&#x27;s bedridden with cancer, and she says these wipes make her feel very clean and refreshed, and leave her skin feeling soft, without the sticky residue that some wipes impart, or the drying effect of others.</li>
            <li> These are just right,  And</li>
            <li> Loved these right after surgery and for the few weeks following as a full on shower was and is still a big production so these give a great alternative to that.  </li>
            <li> Great for traveling and camping and places where you want to be refreshed but are not able to bathe in a shower or tub.</li>
            <li> An absolute necessity when a full shower or bath is out of the question.  </li>
            <li> Perfect to wipe yourself down after a long day of hiking!</li>
            <li> Now let me preface this by saying that when I workout I don&#x27;t sweat very much.  </li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am older and have poor balance, this product is excellent for me.  </li>
            <li> These wipes are very sturdy and clean very well.</li>
            <li> One seems to do an appropriate job with all the major parts, but I would suggest two for a whole body swab.</li>
            <li> Nice and big, very moist, and leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and</li>
            <li> These really work!</li>
            <li> These are great if you&#x27;re camping and just want to freshen up, or if you&#x27;re running late for work and don&#x27;t have time to shower.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing to have when you are unable to take a shower.  </li>
            <li> First saw them when my husband was in the hospital and they heated them up and gave them to him to use for a &#x27;bed bath&#x27;.</li>
            <li> So I went camping in the keys in June and it was quite hot...</li>
            <li> face first, chest, then underarms and &amp;#34;privates&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There was more than enough &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; on the wipe to make it over a 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; frame.</li>
            <li> I only used one, and used it on mr from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> We are avid campers, backpackers, rafters, and hikers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t feel like they left any residue, they felt quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am able to wash my entire body with 2 wipes.  </li>
            <li> It works quite well and refreshing, especially in the summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good heavy quality.  </li>
            <li> A road warrior would never have to shower -- just a hair wash in a sink every few days, and you&#x27;re good.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a quick holdover for a shower.</li>
            <li> I generally used two wipes after each leg, although probably could have done fine just using one.</li>
            <li> I like it a whole lot better than the baby wipes I used to use, especially since it didn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to do my bit to conserve every drop of water I can, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> They will need to be rewet during your woe down with warm water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who feels like it&#x27;s necessary to take a shower pretty much every day, but these worked fine while camping.  </li>
            <li> Product make it easy for me as a care giver, to care for the cleansing needs of my relative.</li>
            <li> Be sure to dry the skin afterward; they are quite moist, which is why they do the job.</li>
            <li> When they arrived I realized I&#x27;d underestimated how large the packs and wipes are - the photo is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> Great product - nicely packed, good-size wipes (like the size of a handkerchief) with thick cloth-like material, and very, very little scent.</li>
            <li> fine when I had to take sink baths after a back surgery.</li>
            <li> bathing wipe is large and can be used for a reasonable area.  </li>
            <li> With 1 sheet you can clean pretty much your entire body.</li>
            <li> Better than cheap wet wipes, but only a bit.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to bath my mom and the 8 count</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpful to me.</li>
            <li> She really appreciated this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> worked great when my husband had his broken and couldnt bath</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , they are very moist and do the job well.</li>
            <li> These bathing wipes worked very well.  </li>
            <li> These worked really well.</li>
            <li> Made post-surgery for breast cancer so much easier because I couldn&#x27;t shower for a while.</li>
            <li> These wipes worked very well.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to bring with you to the hiking trips.</li>
            <li> Fast Ship.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a trek in Peru, one wipe cleaned my whole body</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I was using baby wipes this whole time...</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and fast drying, they take the grime off and allow me not to suffer the horrors of the shower at work.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient.</li>
            <li> They really are &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This cloth is thick and is moist with a nice and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, the cloths are thick and do a good job of cleaning oneself.</li>
            <li> Did not use on burn areas but excellent for someone with limited mobility, not steady on feet or anyone who is not near a shower but would like to stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have purchased multiple times and never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ran a Ragnar Relay recently and bought a pack of these to use between legs of the race (since showers didn&#x27;t appear to be easily accessible</li>
            <li> For the physically challenged, it is a way to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I loved these wipes and will definitely use them again for post-jogging and other camping/hiking trips!</li>
            <li> No Rinse bathing wipes smell better than the other wipes and are nice and thick.</li>
            <li> These are thick and strong and leave my skin feeling CLEAN.  </li>
            <li> I recommend them, highly.  </li>
            <li> Other products of this kind have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I can say that during ten days in the back country hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering, dune climbing, and white water rafting, these kept me clean and odor free.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and really helps my tired feet once the boots are off.</li>
            <li> Great when someone is ill - but lots of uses for them when everyone is well.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I only needed one per session since I was not particularly dirty.</li>
            <li> These are awesome after a long hike and unable to shower.</li>
            <li> When you open and close the package, they are fresh &amp; not all</li>
            <li> It is a nice thick wipe</li>
            <li> Thick towels with a nice scent</li>
            <li> If you are recovering from surgery and have limited movement or cannot get into the bath, they will keep you clean.</li>
            <li> I get tired of having to shower daily, great to use if your wife complains.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re really tall/big or sweaty--one sheet is enough for your whole body.  </li>
            <li> Nice, thickly padded, soft cloths.</li>
            <li> Lightly damp when taken from the wrapper, it is just the right balance between being too wet and too dry.</li>
            <li> I then used them out in the desert pretty much daily.  </li>
            <li> These worked pretty well actually.</li>
            <li> Kind of a strong baby powder smell, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> folks who between showers or baths wanting some freshness can appreciate this product.&lt;br /&gt;These wipes clean without having rinse--you only wipe dry.</li>
            <li> Discovered this product when I was in the hospital and completely bed ridden.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am a frequent user of this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use them frequently because they use an antibacterial chemical and</li>
            <li> Have not bathed in 37 days so far</li>
            <li> It is really intended for bathing,  although no water or rinsing is necessary.</li>
            <li> and they recommend one wipe per body part, but by applying strategically, you only need one wipe for your whole body-</li>
            <li> 1or 2 is enough for the whole body</li>
            <li> Once I got to the bottom of my legs, the wipe didn&#x27;t have as much moisture left, but it did</li>
            <li> The wipes are of uniform quality - the wipe size is fairly standard to similar products, and the wipes held plenty of moisture fresh from the package.</li>
            <li> The towels are thick and fragrant and feel more like a cloth towel than a flimsy paper towel.  </li>
            <li> These provide a good alternative on those days, and they last a long time even after  opening as long as you press all air out of package and reseal the package tightly.  </li>
            <li> Due to disability, a full shower is just not possible on some days.</li>
            <li> They are very moist so you may want to use a towel to dry yourself after use.</li>
            <li> Likewise, it feels sticky for a few minutes, then that sensation quickly fades.</li>
            <li> The cloths themselves are nice and thick, and not overly wet.  </li>
            <li> I have bad pain and find it hard to bath every day works great for keeping hands clean.</li>
            <li> These are great for people who are sick and can&#x27;t or just don&#x27;t feel like taking a shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you are covered in grime, one single wipe can do the whole body if you plan the &#x27;cleansing logistics&#x27; properly (face, then arms, descending towards the unmentionables)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I would be stuck in a van with a bunch of other people for 32 hours straight).</li>
            <li> Also good when you are in a jam and unable to use the shower at home!</li>
            <li> Water rationing in the late &#x27;70s was so restrictive in the county in which I now live that residents couldn&#x27;t bathe or shower every day and even then, it was a pretty sketchy affair.</li>
            <li> This really does help keep down your smell on the trail without making you smell like a perfume factory.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers thought they were too small, but they are just right for me.  </li>
            <li> : In another review, \\&quot;bogmonkey\\&quot; wisely points out that using one cloth for every section of the body (as the package instructions recommend) is unnecessary, and seems a bit excessive (unless you&#x27;ve just emerged from a mud bath).</li>
            <li> The two main downsides of the product are: Sticky residue left on skin after use (much worse than other comparable &#x27;no rinse&#x27; wipes); and the package is not resealable - be sure to put them into a plastic bag after opening or they will dry out in a day.</li>
            <li> However, these left such a sticky film on my skin, that I felt more dirty after using them.  </li>
            <li> But it really isn&#x27;t that hard to wipe a second time.</li>
            <li> Definitely need at least 4 to do your whole body, so count on that.  </li>
            <li> If you are an athlete, you can quickly wipe off after a game or the gym, and head out.</li>
            <li> While you may go through a few packs in a weekend outing, the convenience far out weighs the cost of these.</li>
            <li> They are moist enough without being so wet that you worry about squeezing it and making a puddle on the floor.</li>
            <li> I have tried using this myself after a long travel.</li>
            <li> They are thick and one will do the job for the whole body.</li>
            <li> used for a week long dry camping event</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the scent, but at least it&#x27;s fresh and not overbearing or perfumey.</li>
            <li> One packet lasted approx 2 days on average, I bought the 5-pack and had one untouched pack to bring home for future use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find I only need to use one if I start &amp;#34;at the top&amp;#34; and work my way down.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like these, they left me feeling slightly sticky.</li>
            <li> For my use, I&#x27;d like them to be a little smaller and in lighter packaging.</li>
            <li> I remember using them to help with my aged mother.</li>
            <li> But a few weeks later, I always get a call, or text, with a story telling me how the product was a lifesaver one day.</li>
            <li> If you only use a few keep the opened package upright when it is stored or in a sealed plastic bag I found five minutes of air-drying was sufficient.</li>
            <li> I spent 5 days using these towels, and except for the hair, I wasn&#x27;t that smelly, jejeje</li>
            <li> I am disabled and it is taxing to shower daily.  </li>
            <li> Sent some to the military overseas, use them for camping.  </li>
            <li> We use this product regularly when a family member is not able to take shower.  </li>
            <li> My friends think its a weird gift, at first.</li>
            <li> I had nine other people with me, and</li>
            <li> I tried baby wipes and other body wipes, but they always leave a film or a scent I do not like.  </li>
            <li> Though they are expensive compared to other wipes, one uses far fewer of them than one would other wipes, thus making them approximately equal in cost.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product last year for my dad who broke his shoulder and had a hard time getting into the shower.</li>
            <li> They are thick and sturdy like a rag so you only need one.  </li>
            <li> The wipes are heavy and slightly wet.</li>
            <li> but I recommend wiping yourself down afterward anyway with a water-moistened cloth.  </li>
            <li> in fact, one night on the trail I tried to rip one in half to share with another hiker and we couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had used a different brand of the same type of product and these were quite s bit less expensive</li>
            <li> It pretty much made one of her arms useless, and very difficult for her to shower without some help.  </li>
            <li> Used these when hospitalized &amp; wanted to keep a few as back-up when not feeling well.</li>
            <li> Why waste?</li>
            <li> I am disabled and sometimes cannot tolerate the shower.</li>
            <li> Sometimes our adventures take us places where we might not have access to a shower for a few days.</li>
            <li> I broke my foot and had a lot of trouble getting in and out of the tub.  </li>
            <li> I packet coveres one complete bathing; it&#x27;s makes these wipes expensive.</li>
            <li> dried out when you use them again.  </li>
            <li> I even felt clean after an unintentional dip in a very dirty lake.  </li>
            <li> Very thick for sponge bath, too thick for general wiping</li>
            <li> When you are too tired to take shower after a long day of work, use these!</li>
            <li> A little hard to pull out until you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> I drove cross country and heated them in a microwave sometimes, other times used them cold.  </li>
            <li> but it is there in a small way</li>
            <li> After I had surgery I was unable to shower for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I use these instead with an assistive device for hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now ordering some for myself through Amazon just in case water rationing in California becomes as severe as it was in the late 1970s.</li>
            <li> If you are staying for a period of time, I suggest buying at least 3.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Thick cloth-like wipes.  </li>
            <li> quality, thick &amp;#34;washcloth&amp;#34;-feel material - highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> They are thick and hold together.  </li>
            <li> We use them all the time, they maybe a little expensive but well&lt;br /&gt;worth it.</li>
            <li> Heaven for cleaning babies that have bad diaper day in public.</li>
            <li> I detect a very faint antiseptic-like odor for a minute, but when dry, it has no scent.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry your skin out too badly but might want to bring your lotion just in case.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very thick (almost like a washcloth)</li>
            <li> I was so tired and my bones ached too.</li>
            <li> Also non irritating.</li>
            <li> I expect that all bathing wipes are like this, though some much worse.</li>
            <li> I started using these after reading pointers on recuperating from a broken fifth metatarsal.  </li>
            <li> Some folks who are ill and are not mobile need a helping hand too.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;re sitting at home.  </li>
            <li> The dispensable towlette wipes are useless and smell bad.  </li>
            <li> But dirty?</li>
            <li> Maybe if you&#x27;re particularly dirty, one for each region of the body.</li>
            <li> I visit my father on occasion and it is impossible to shower in his home</li>
            <li> This product helps when is physically impossible to take a shower, nothing can replace water and soap.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want any of my bad skin bacteria to build up a resistance.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless you shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I put some in the camper as well because the shower in the camper is practically worthless and I like to use these in between attempts to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wipes for months for my husband, who has dementia and is fearful of showering.</li>
            <li> Horrible  didn&#x27;t help</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got these for camping/traveling.  I drove cross country and heated them in a microwave sometimes, other times used them cold.  I then used them out in the desert pretty much daily.  They&#x27;re alright.  Better than cheap wet wipes, but only a bit.  Definitely need at least 4 to do your whole body, so count on that.  Kind of a strong baby powder smell, but not too bad.  Overall, they got the job done, but I wished they were bigger.</li>
            <li> Some folks don&#x27;t have the luxury of jumping in the tub for a luxurious bath or shower. Some folks who are ill and are not mobile need a helping hand too.&lt;br /&gt;Even folks who between showers or baths wanting some freshness can appreciate this product.&lt;br /&gt;These wipes clean without having rinse--you only wipe dry. In convenient packages with resealable tops, so the rest of the pkg stays moist.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for every age, where mobility may be a factor, or just a quick refresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen George. author and reviewer</li>
            <li> I have bad pain and find it hard to bath every day works great for keeping hands clean. Heaven for cleaning babies that have bad diaper day in public. Discovered this product when I was in the hospital and completely bed ridden.</li>
            <li> I got the wipes for use during a bathroom remodel and they did a very effectively job of cleaning. I only needed one per session since I was not particularly dirty. I recommend keeping some around for emergency situations.</li>
            <li> Needed this for a pre-op and post-op procedure.  These really work!</li>
            <li> These are very handy when you just need a quick cleanup.</li>
            <li> Works great and so nice after a long hot hike. Very refreshing and really helps my tired feet once the boots are off. This really does help keep down your smell on the trail without making you smell like a perfume factory. Also good when you are in a jam and unable to use the shower at home!</li>
            <li> Love these. So much easier to bath my mom and the 8 count is a good deal.</li>
            <li> These are very substantial and are the perfect thing for after a workout at the gym when there&#x27;s not time for a shower or when the workout has not been extremely intense. Some reviewers thought they were too small, but they are just right for me.  Update:  I have ordered these again.  They stay in my gym bag and are also great for travel.</li>
            <li> I am older and have poor balance, this product is excellent for me.  It is a nice thick wipe and I have sensitive skin but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It doesn&#x27;t have perfume which I am so glad about.</li>
            <li> I had surgery and couldn&#x27;t shower for over a week. I bought these in anticipation of my showering hiatus. These worked pretty well actually. They aren&#x27;t cheap if you wanted to use them regularly for any reason, but they were good for my situation.</li>
            <li> Saves me time from taking showers, love it. I get tired of having to shower daily, great to use if your wife complains.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I use them after I run to work to wipe off in the bathroom and I don&#x27;t think anyone can tell that I just ran 5 miles.  They are thick and sturdy like a rag so you only need one.  They would probably be great for camping, but I don&#x27;t clean myself when I&#x27;m out in the woods because I&#x27;m not a big sissy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years for quick &amp;#34;bathing&amp;#34; during my camping trips.  Love them and was so glad to see them on this site.  I know I will order again.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product.  These wipes keep you clean and fresh, when you can not bathe.</li>
            <li> One Star&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like these, they left me feeling slightly sticky. I will be buying the Nemo Helio from Amazon and sticking to showers instead of wipes.</li>
            <li> This is the product you need to purchase if you are camping or if you are hurt and cannot take showers daily. It smells good and the wipes are larger size.</li>
            <li> Love these for quick clean up on the run.</li>
            <li> Had knee surgery and used these for a week or so.  They work great in lieu of a shower.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent user of this product. This product has been very helpful to me. The fragrance is pleasant and the product is durable.</li>
            <li> While you may go through a few packs in a weekend outing, the convenience far out weighs the cost of these. I have now added these to my list of camping must haves.</li>
            <li> No surprises with this product. Works good in the wild</li>
            <li> These are great if you&#x27;re camping and just want to freshen up, or if you&#x27;re running late for work and don&#x27;t have time to shower. I wouldn&#x27;t use them frequently because they use an antibacterial chemical and I like having the healthy bacteria on my skin. I don&#x27;t want any of my bad skin bacteria to build up a resistance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who feels like it&#x27;s necessary to take a shower pretty much every day, but these worked fine while camping.  I even felt clean after an unintentional dip in a very dirty lake.  They don&#x27;t do anything for the hair, of course, but the body felt nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice large-size wipes like they give you in the hospital and they can be warmed in the microwave. Not a huge fan of the scent, but at least it&#x27;s fresh and not overbearing or perfumey. Does the job, and I only gave the four stars instead of 5 because I wish they came in an unscented option.</li>
            <li> Love these. I mtn bike at lunch at work and keeping these in the fridge leaves me feeling cool and clean after. Great price as well. When you can&#x27;t shower these are a good substitute.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t call it as good as a shower, but it&#x27;s a lot better than anything else when a shower isn&#x27;t a possibility. I pack these to use after biking to work and it works great. As another reviewer mentioned, one wipe can do it all. They are moist enough without being so wet that you worry about squeezing it and making a puddle on the floor.</li>
            <li> I actually got these for different purposes.  I put one pack in my backpacking gear, so it&#x27;s easy to freshen up on the trail.  I put some in the camper as well because the shower in the camper is practically worthless and I like to use these in between attempts to use it.  I recently gave a pack to my mom who underwent wrist reconstruction surgery.  It pretty much made one of her arms useless, and very difficult for her to shower without some help.  She really appreciated this.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, these have a nice clean, but not perfumed, scent.  One seems to do an appropriate job with all the major parts, but I would suggest two for a whole body swab. The cloths themselves are nice and thick, and not overly wet.  I think an upgrade to the design might be had if they add a quilted side to it.</li>
            <li> They were just what I wanted</li>
            <li> The wipes are of uniform quality - the wipe size is fairly standard to similar products, and the wipes held plenty of moisture fresh from the package. I use these when showers aren&#x27;t possible while camping or biking. The two main downsides of the product are: Sticky residue left on skin after use (much worse than other comparable &#x27;no rinse&#x27; wipes); and the package is not resealable - be sure to put them into a plastic bag after opening or they will dry out in a day.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use for my daughter who suffered burns and could not shower.  Did not use on burn areas but excellent for someone with limited mobility, not steady on feet or anyone who is not near a shower but would like to stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bathing wipe is large and can be used for a reasonable area.  Have purchased multiple times and never disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are the one thing I ALWAYS pack when I go camping. Perfect to wipe yourself down after a long day of hiking!</li>
            <li> Product make it easy for me as a care giver, to care for the cleansing needs of my relative.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend who&#x27;s bedridden with cancer, and she says these wipes make her feel very clean and refreshed, and leave her skin feeling soft, without the sticky residue that some wipes impart, or the drying effect of others. I&#x27;m now ordering some for myself through Amazon just in case water rationing in California becomes as severe as it was in the late 1970s. I&#x27;m happy to do my bit to conserve every drop of water I can, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on personal hygiene. Water rationing in the late &#x27;70s was so restrictive in the county in which I now live that residents couldn&#x27;t bathe or shower every day and even then, it was a pretty sketchy affair. So I plan to be prepared with the entire line of No Rinse products and will put a pack or two in my emergency preparedness kit as well. So... Drought? Looks like it. But dirty? Not with these handy cleansing wipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: In another review, \\&quot;bogmonkey\\&quot; wisely points out that using one cloth for every section of the body (as the package instructions recommend) is unnecessary, and seems a bit excessive (unless you&#x27;ve just emerged from a mud bath). I misread those instructions when I got my first 5-pack, and I&#x27;m glad I did, or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them again as one pack would be good for only two uses. Using one cloth for torso, ams and legs (feet last) and another for those pesky private parts seems sufficient.</li>
            <li> These are life savers when you are camping, we were out in some very hot and humid weather and used these in the evening to refresh ourselves before going to sleep.  They work well and we now keep them around in the car for quick cleanups when needed.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted. I couldn&#x27;t find these locally. even in San Mateo. And it&#x27;s got a great price too.</li>
            <li> The wipes have a nice thickness--sufficient heft to make usage easy.  Re-sealable package is a nice touch if you don&#x27;t need to use them all at once.  The smell is pleasant and leave the skin clean.  They are super handy for camping.</li>
            <li> These get the job done on camping trips.  It says no rinse but I recommend wiping yourself down afterward anyway with a water-moistened cloth.  Otherwise you smell like baby wipes.</li>
            <li> I use these in my RV shower. They&#x27;re very thick (almost like a washcloth) so they work well to scrub dirt off after hiking. They have a mild, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Very good product and works as described.</li>
            <li> We love this product for both camping and hunting.  Easy to use and smells clean. They were moist enough&lt;br /&gt;to really do a good job. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> When you are too tired to take shower after a long day of work, use these! With 1 sheet you can clean pretty much your entire body.</li>
            <li> Love these after my morning bike commute to the office. Seems to do the trick to curb smells for the day.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing to have when you are unable to take a shower.  I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Have not bathed in 37 days so far and I&#x27;m still odor free !!! These things are great...just kidding of course, but not about the goodness of the wipes.  They are to use when a quick &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; is needed and they are well worth having a pack handy.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my dad to use if he couldn&#x27;t take a shower. I am writing this review b&#x27;coz I have tried using this myself after a long travel. I was so tired and my bones ached too. So instead of going to a shower, I used this wipes to freshen myself. I felt refreshed and my skin felt smooth too.This wipes is different compared to the baby wipes I buy from Costco. It is really intended for bathing,  although no water or rinsing is necessary. Almost the same like the one in the hospital. I should have given it 5 stars if it comes with more wipes in the pack.</li>
            <li> worked great when my husband had his broken and couldnt bath</li>
            <li> This come in handed when no one dont feeling like take a bath or shower....i use they sometime cuz i cant get in the bath tub that nuch cuz health prombles....</li>
            <li> No Rinse bathing wipes smell better than the other wipes and are nice and thick. Also non irritating. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Nice, thickly padded, soft cloths. They&#x27;re great for when you can&#x27;t shower, or if you just need a quick freshening up.</li>
            <li> These are great for people who are sick and can&#x27;t or just don&#x27;t feel like taking a shower. Refreshing clean scent and leaves you feeling clean. First saw them when my husband was in the hospital and they heated them up and gave them to him to use for a &#x27;bed bath&#x27;.</li>
            <li> These were very helpful refreshing me in the hospital. Even the nurses thought it was a great idea bringing these along in addition to their sponge baths. Thick towels with a nice scent, they are very moist and do the job well. If you are staying for a period of time, I suggest buying at least 3. I bought 5 and still have 2 left and was in the hospital for a week.</li>
            <li> So I went camping in the keys in June and it was quite hot...obviously. When we were on the go and a shower just wasn&#x27;t possible these did the trick. They are thick and one will do the job for the whole body. The do a great job of ridding any sweat and dirt issues you may have in a hot humid day. They do have a bit of a baby wipe smell....not bad...but it is there in a small way but it does not seem to linger. I was definitely glad I had these and considering how many you get for a great price I was very pleased. I&#x27;ll keep a pack in my Jeep and in my pack wherever I go just in case. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. A nurse used a few of them for our baby before the baby could get a real bath in a baby bathtub. The wipes are also great for the times when the baby spits up on herself or himself right after a bath and you don&#x27;t have time or energy to do another bath. They are also great for a wipe bath if you don&#x27;t get to a real one when the baby needs a bath.</li>
            <li> Love this product have used it for years and this seller delived in the 2 days as promoted by amazon  as prime.</li>
            <li> I used these traveling in Africa where I didn&#x27;t have access to running water.  However, these left such a sticky film on my skin, that I felt more dirty after using them.  I would wake up in the morning with sticky skin and it was really gross.</li>
            <li> We needed this product while bathroom is being remodeled. I remember using them to help with my aged mother. They worked great and had no offensive odor. I expect these to do the same.</li>
            <li> These did the best job of any wipe I tried. However, I was able to out-stink them with my old fart BO. I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong w/the product, though.</li>
            <li> awesome shower substitute. used for a week long dry camping event</li>
            <li> the family member who received this item&lt;br /&gt;said it left a bit of residue afterwards.</li>
            <li> We use this product regularly when a family member is not able to take shower.  This cloth is thick and is moist with a nice and fresh smell.  Would recommend this product to anyone with a similar situation as ours.</li>
            <li> These are a staple in my personal hygiene regiment.  Due to disability, a full shower is just not possible on some days. These provide a good alternative on those days, and they last a long time even after  opening as long as you press all air out of package and reseal the package tightly.  I like the scent of these also.</li>
            <li> Only draw back is when yo try to take one, a bunch come out. Should be designed so one at a time comes out. Other products of this kind have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Used these when hospitalized &amp; wanted to keep a few as back-up when not feeling well.</li>
            <li> Horrible  didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> Nice and big, very moist, and leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and just like you had a bath. No residue feeling. I have used for my elderly mother and  for myself on camping trips.  These are the best wipes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Loved these right after surgery and for the few weeks following as a full on shower was and is still a big production so these give a great alternative to that.  I still like to take a damp towel to wipe off as it can leave a soapy feel on the skin. But it really isn&#x27;t that hard to wipe a second time.</li>
            <li> I visit my father on occasion and it is impossible to shower in his home so these wipes are great for those times when I visit. The wipes are heavy and slightly wet. I use about 4 at a time so that I get 2 bathing experiences with one pack. They have a nice clean fragrance and are easily disposable in the garbage can. Great for traveling and camping and places where you want to be refreshed but are not able to bathe in a shower or tub.</li>
            <li> I bought these wipes to use for hiking the 4-day Inca Trail in Peru. They come in 8-count packs which was great. The wipes are maybe 5x7 (?) and they recommend one wipe per body part, but by applying strategically, you only need one wipe for your whole body- face first, chest, then underarms and &amp;#34;privates&amp;#34; last. Why waste? There was more than enough &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; on the wipe to make it over a 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; frame. They did not leave a baby smell like a lot of wipes. They also do not tear well at all- in fact, one night on the trail I tried to rip one in half to share with another hiker and we couldn&#x27;t. We had to find a knife to cut it! I loved these wipes and will definitely use them again for post-jogging and other camping/hiking trips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wipes for months for my husband, who has dementia and is fearful of showering. These wipes are an excellent substitute for a shower, and they leave no residue. Be sure to dry the skin afterward; they are quite moist, which is why they do the job.</li>
            <li> Great for travel! 1or 2 is enough for the whole body</li>
            <li> After recent surgery, these were just perfect for the sponge bath phase.</li>
            <li> Great for camping, and I keep some handy in the shop and my truck.  And they not only allow for a quick cleanup, but have a refreshing, clean scent.  Really a handy item, you and those close to you will appreciate them.</li>
            <li> After I had surgery I was unable to shower for several weeks.  These bathing wipes worked very well.  They are much thicker than the usual wipes, more like a felt wash cloth than a wipe, and I think this makes them more effective.  Though they are expensive compared to other wipes, one uses far fewer of them than one would other wipes, thus making them approximately equal in cost.  A good purchase.</li>
            <li> These worked really well. I only used one, and used it on mr from top to bottom. Once I got to the bottom of my legs, the wipe didn&#x27;t have as much moisture left, but it did it&#x27;s job. I like it a whole lot better than the baby wipes I used to use, especially since it didn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue on my skin. I just felt clean.</li>
            <li> Like others say, this is a great product, but you definitely don&#x27;t need one for each part of the body. Maybe if you&#x27;re particularly dirty, one for each region of the body. Very refreshing when backpacking!</li>
            <li> Easy to use....arrive in prompt manner. The cost is also great. Great for bathing following surgery.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and sometimes cannot tolerate the shower. Because of that I worry about body odor. These cloths are amazing. They leave me feeling fresh and clean and I just toss them when I am done. The other day my sister asked me what kind of soap did I use because I smelled so nice!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my boyfriend after his surgery and they worked GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> These work well.  My wife has Alzheimer&#x27;s, and is seldom out of bed, and they have been a big help.  They are much more like washcloths than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Awesome to keep in your bag or the back of your car. If you are an athlete, you can quickly wipe off after a game or the gym, and head out. If you are in a hurry after work and you need to freshen up before meeting someone for a drink it&#x27;s a useful product. Awesome for camping. If you are recovering from surgery and have limited movement or cannot get into the bath, they will keep you clean. I honestly have found multiple uses and I even give have gifted them to friends. My friends think its a weird gift, at first. But a few weeks later, I always get a call, or text, with a story telling me how the product was a lifesaver one day.</li>
            <li> We are avid campers, backpackers, rafters, and hikers. Sometimes our adventures take us places where we might not have access to a shower for a few days. I always take these along and feel very refreshed to be able to &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; a bit on an outdoor adventure. I am a repeat buyer and very pleased.</li>
            <li> Made post-surgery for breast cancer so much easier because I couldn&#x27;t shower for a while. It&#x27;ll come in handy for my multiple interstitial catheter radiation treatments also, because I won&#x27;t be able to shower during the time the catheters are in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these after walks during lunch. More convenient than taking a shower, and gets the job done quick.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific products instead of using a regular washcloth!  We use them all the time, they maybe a little expensive but well&lt;br /&gt;worth it.</li>
            <li> They really come in handy when you are traveling, or for an emergency. Great way to freshen up anywhere, anytime</li>
            <li> An absolute necessity when a full shower or bath is out of the question.  They come in handy when you are in a hurry and do not need a full shower.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a week camping at Burning Man with no showers.  When they arrived I realized I&#x27;d underestimated how large the packs and wipes are - the photo is a bit misleading. However this was a good thing as I was using the wipes twice a day to freshen up every morning and evening. One packet lasted approx 2 days on average, I bought the 5-pack and had one untouched pack to bring home for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t feel like they left any residue, they felt quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> I brought these along on a ten day backpacking trip to Colorado. I knew I wouldn&#x27;t have shower access during the trip. These wipes worked very well. I know some reviewers were left with what felt like a soapy residue after use, but I didn&#x27;t experience this. I had nine other people with me, and no one else mentioned it either. I can say that during ten days in the back country hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering, dune climbing, and white water rafting, these kept me clean and odor free. I worked up a good sweat every day, and got into some dirty places, but these were great in making sure I was clean when I crawled into my sleeping bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 would the weight. I understand this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you&#x27;re not a backpacker. For my use, I&#x27;d like them to be a little smaller and in lighter packaging. Other than that, awesome product and I&#x27;ll buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> It was my fault I bought way more than I needed. The instructions will tell you to use all the contents of one pack for cleaning, but I think that applies more to a clinical environment. Aside from that, the cloths are thick and do a good job of cleaning oneself. They are very moist so you may want to use a towel to dry yourself after use. If you only use a few keep the opened package upright when it is stored or in a sealed plastic bag I found five minutes of air-drying was sufficient.</li>
            <li> My experience differs from most.  This product did not hold heat when I warmed it in the microwave and carried it to the bedroom for my elderly mother&#x27;s bathing needs. A big disappointment.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great product - nicely packed, good-size wipes (like the size of a handkerchief) with thick cloth-like material, and very, very little scent. Lightly damp when taken from the wrapper, it is just the right balance between being too wet and too dry. I detect a very faint antiseptic-like odor for a minute, but when dry, it has no scent. Likewise, it feels sticky for a few minutes, then that sensation quickly fades. I expect that all bathing wipes are like this, though some much worse. The 5-pack is useful for keeping one in a travel bag, backpack, car, one in the desk at work, etc. I particularly like the good size of the wipes and the fact they are not flimsy. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to bring with you to the hiking trips. I spent 5 days using these towels, and except for the hair, I wasn&#x27;t that smelly, jejeje</li>
            <li> These worked great for when I had a cast on my leg and could not take a shower.</li>
            <li> Use these while hunting for 10 days.  One a day.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought these to keep in my gym bag when I get out for a workout during the work day. Many times I&#x27;m not sweaty enough to need a shower and don&#x27;t have a lot of time - these leave me clean and smelling nice going back to work.</li>
            <li> Thick cloth-like wipes.  Extremely comfortable and easy to use.  Quality/price that&#x27;s virtually unbeatable, especially when ordered by the 5-pack for what is now $15 with Prime membership.  $0 shipping.  Excellent shower substitute when there&#x27;s no time, access, or it&#x27;s just not totally necessary.  Only the hair shampoo will be missed.  In the immortal words of Yossi Dina of Beverly Hills Pawn, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t think about it, just buy it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great item for quick refreshing</li>
            <li> i absolutly love these wipes, they do a great job in cleaning and leave no residue behind, i used to buy the from walgreens till they stoped selling them and replaced the with a walgreens knock-off of them, the knock-offs sucked.&lt;br /&gt;  very fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> Now let me preface this by saying that when I workout I don&#x27;t sweat very much.  I workout during my lunch break at work and these allow me to fit my workout and lunch in a 1 hour time limit.  Taking a shower would add extra time.  The scent if very light and the towels are high quality and do not rip easily.  They don&#x27;t dry your skin out too badly but might want to bring your lotion just in case.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I ran a Ragnar Relay recently and bought a pack of these to use between legs of the race (since showers didn&#x27;t appear to be easily accessible and I would be stuck in a van with a bunch of other people for 32 hours straight). Everyone on the team used them, and everybody seemed to be happy we had them. After running three ~7 mile legs over a 32 hour period I felt fairly clean, as reportedly did everyone else in the van. I generally used two wipes after each leg, although probably could have done fine just using one. I plan to use the remaining packs for camping trips. I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a quick holdover for a shower.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I use the wipes for the in between days I do not give my mom who has dementia showers. Easy to microwave and the product smells good and easy to use when needed. I purchased this product last year for my dad who broke his shoulder and had a hard time getting into the shower. Will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Works great for times you can&#x27;t shower, two wipes took care of me after a Spartan race.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Fast Ship.  A+++!!</li>
            <li> does what its meant to do--very useful</li>
            <li> Convenient, refreshing and a nice mild smell.</li>
            <li> These are the best yet for those who have trouble getting out of bed.  Just dispose of used ones in a  plastic bag and tie it shut and you are done.</li>
            <li> Does the job beautifully</li>
            <li> These are awesome after a long hike and unable to shower. Used it for a trek in Peru, one wipe cleaned my whole body</li>
            <li> These are perfect for after a moderate workout at the gym. I find I only need to use one if I start &amp;#34;at the top&amp;#34; and work my way down.</li>
            <li> Oh how I needed these on my recent business trip to Hawaii.  Whew..... missed flight - and ended up in LA over night.  2 days traveling in the same clothes - these would have came in handy.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;re sitting at home.  NOTE:  Next time I travel take a pack of these.</li>
            <li> Great, come in handy when no time to take a shower. Product works well.</li>
            <li> I stayed a week out in the desert and used these things every morning. I felt sufficiently clean, great product. I used only 2 wipes per day and i am 6&#x27; tall.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I am disabled and it is taxing to shower daily.  I use these instead with an assistive device for hard to reach areas.  I have used these for 2 years now.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> They are a nice quick clean up when you need one. I recommend them, highly.  We used them for someone that is bed ridden, but would work in any circumstance.</li>
            <li> easy to use and keeps you clean smelling between showers.</li>
            <li> Good heavy quality.  Smells great.  I can get cleaned up with just one wipe.  I use it after a walk during my work lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sender:  Item arrived on time, product as described.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re really tall/big or sweaty--one sheet is enough for your whole body.  Used it when we went to Coachella to freshen up between showers.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful if you don&#x27;t have the time nor inclination to take a shower. They are also very useful for traveling. I can&#x27;t always find a handicap room at a motel and these make an excellent substitute for getting in a non-handicapped shower.</li>
            <li> I loved these!  I broke my foot and had a lot of trouble getting in and out of the tub.  I started using these after reading pointers on recuperating from a broken fifth metatarsal.  The towels are thick and fragrant and feel more like a cloth towel than a flimsy paper towel.  I am able to wash my entire body with 2 wipes.  The pack also reseals nicely.  I am thinking about giving some to my elderly mother.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Ummm... I got shower caps... Not wipes. So.... I know nothing of the wipes.</li>
            <li> These are great! Bought them to keep in my desk at work for the occasions that I work out mid-day.</li>
            <li> LOL! These come in packets of 5, and the instructions state to use &amp;#34;one separate wipe for each area&amp;#34; (i.e. one for each arm, one for each leg, one for the face, etc)...this is not needed in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are covered in grime, one single wipe can do the whole body if you plan the &#x27;cleansing logistics&#x27; properly (face, then arms, descending towards the unmentionables)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product to freshen up after my daily lunchtime 4-mile walk here in Florida. I literally feel as if I have taken a shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top quality, thick &amp;#34;washcloth&amp;#34;-feel material - highest recommendation. Going on my camping list from now on...just brilliant. Can&#x27;t believe I was using baby wipes this whole time...</li>
            <li> This is like a big moistened disposable towel, but it effectively cleans body.&lt;br /&gt;It is very handy to have for traveling and camping. It works quite well and refreshing, especially in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great to have in the car to wipe hands clean of grease and such.</li>
            <li> As the label on the back recommends, these are great for ridding the perianal region of foul odors.</li>
            <li> Good value-fast delivery with PRIME</li>
            <li> Excellent for cleaning up after a lunchtime workout. I find using 1 cloth works for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for camping and hiking. The scent is great and you really do feel clean after using. I recommend, affordable way to keep clean outdoors or when you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> For the physically challenged, it is a way to keep clean. This product helps when is physically impossible to take a shower, nothing can replace water and soap.  This product is able to maintaining you clean.</li>
            <li> Terrific for sponge bathing my bedridden mother.</li>
            <li> Get the job done.  They will need to be rewet during your woe down with warm water.  Use like a wash cloth and throw away when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did fine when I had to take sink baths after a back surgery.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product.  Extremely useful for those with skin problems, or people who can&#x27;t use a tub or shower for some reason.  Leave skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Kept me clean and fresh out in my 3-4 day camping excursion with no facilities in sight!</li>
            <li> I got these because quite honestly, the shower at work frightens me. I use these to clean up after a sweaty day at work and they do the job. Gentle on the skin and fast drying, they take the grime off and allow me not to suffer the horrors of the shower at work.</li>
            <li> I packet coveres one complete bathing; it&#x27;s makes these wipes expensive.</li>
            <li> We are using these in-between bed baths, to freshen up at the end of the day, etc. Very easy, very convenient (we even used them while my husband was in the hospital)....and most important, they&#x27;re very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I had used a different brand of the same type of product and these were quite s bit less expensive so thought I would try them. They work well and I love them for a quick, refreshing body cleansing when I don&#x27;t have time for a shower. This is not as moist as the others I have used but still do the job.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size, strength, and price.  It is convenient and effective.  I have tried the &#x27;survival&#x27; body wash towels, but they are more than six times the cost.  The dispensable towlette wipes are useless and smell bad.  These are just right,  And the fact that the package reseals after each towel is used makes it one of the most useful male hygiene products available.  A road warrior would never have to shower -- just a hair wash in a sink every few days, and you&#x27;re good.  My daughter uses them now after horseback riding, where there&#x27;s nothing but a hose to clean with.</li>
            <li> Work well. Very thick for sponge bath, too thick for general wiping</li>
            <li> These work and are awesome. If you camp or go to the field for a length of time without a shower, these are for you. Over 2 weeks no shower and only used these nightly. It was like a shower everynight. Clean the body well and removed the funk</li>
            <li> These are very convenient.</li>
            <li> These wipes are very sturdy and clean very well.</li>
            <li> For a quick clean up-can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> These are absolutely wonderful.  They are thick and hold together.  They really are &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34;.  When you open and close the package, they are fresh &amp; not all dried out when you use them again.  Great to even keep take with you for a quick &amp; easy way to cool off / freshen up when you are out and about in the heat.  Great when someone is ill - but lots of uses for them when everyone is well.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> Use these when backpacking and when I go to the gym at lunch.  I tried baby wipes and other body wipes, but they always leave a film or a scent I do not like.  These are thick and strong and leave my skin feeling CLEAN.  I used on a 6 day backcountry backpacking trip and smelled clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are as advertised.  I use them for my own use and they are a great help.  My only comment is that they are not as moist as I hoped.  Nevertheless you shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.  A little hard to pull out until you get the hang of it but after that okay.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these.  Sent some to the military overseas, use them for camping.  When I had surgery, I used them.  They are great!</li>
