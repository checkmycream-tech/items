            <li>more thing that I absolutely love is how easy it is to clean!!</li>
            <li>We still love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Despite a gazillion reviews about this brush, I noticed that most of the reviewers either didn&#x27;t have my hair type or didn&#x27;t mention what hair type they have.  </li>
            <li>love this brush</li>
            <li>but my daughter likes it better than the electric detangler we have.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it has longer bristles for my curly and somewhat course hair.</li>
            <li>Now the Vizeri Brush works better and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li>Really it is more like a 4 1/2 stars.  </li>
            <li>Does everything as said by the seller, plus the really cute design.</li>
            <li>Love this purchase for my daughter&#x27;s waist-long hair.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for designing such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I think the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush or knockoffs work better.</li>
            <li>Then I ordered one for myself and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I *love*</li>
            <li>love, love, love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I would like it better if the handle was longer.</li>
            <li>this brush works a hell of a lot better than any &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>however I think it will be better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>She actually enjoyed brushing her hair with this brush.</li>
            <li>She is better with it after a couple of weeks.  </li>

            <li>SHE HAS BOUGHT MANY BRUSHES BUT</li>
            <li>COULDN&#x27;T GET OVER THE MAGIC OF VISERI</li>
            <li>Great on the hair, gentle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work like MAGIC as the description.</li>
            <li>I love the products.</li>
            <li>am thinking of ordering more as favors for her birthday party.</li>
            <li>The bristles I thought would cause static but believe it or not it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>love this brush.  </li>
            <li>and I have found a better brush for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush also was able to handle the mane of hair and get the tangles out.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this brush.  </li>

            <li>Thank you for such a great brush!</li>
            <li>when I was done I was able to run my fingers through my hair with no problem.</li>
            <li>The different length bristles also make it an awesome head massager while your brushing!</li>
            <li>I even love how the bristles massage my head.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love to  borrow it.</li>
            <li>I love their products and will cont to order them thru Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Many brushes I have tried just don&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
            <li>I love the design of this brush, it fits into the palm of your hand so that it grips better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
            <li>Fantastic detangling brush!</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this brush in my hand.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I primarily use it on my curly extensions and it does an amazing job on detangling the hair without pulling it out from the weft.</li>
            <li>We are pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t dislike this item, but found it equally able to detangle my hair as my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter appreciates it! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I am in love with this brush.  </li>
            <li>no women should be without this:)</li>
            <li>Great brush that really does brush out tangles efficiently, and mostly painlessly.</li>
            <li>I’m going to order more.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of rigidity to pull at those tangles, but it also knows when to give so as to keep these locks in gorgeous harmony.</li>
            <li>Plus they sent extra information to my e-mail which was very nice!</li>
            <li>When the brush arrived, I was very excited to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best detangling brush I&#x27;ve used by a long shot, but it does work ok.</li>
            <li>It is also super cute!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty averagely good.  </li>
            <li>I hope this is true because I will be continuing to use it for the nice feeling it gives me.  </li>
            <li>She loves her long hair now that I have found the perfect brush for her tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy for her to use as well!</li>

            <li>I love how easy this fits into my hand.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most incredible inventions out there, and yet it is a simple brush.  </li>
            <li>Also it is a very pretty color and fits nicely in her hand😀</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with the brush.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this product that I received as a free product for my unbias opinion.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with this product, and I would happily try out other products by this company.</li>
            <li>The ergonomic style of the brush makes it easy to hold as you brush your hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>My 2 y/o daughter can use it easily.</li>
            <li>and it gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased a $5 comb from Great Clips used to help detangle and that works much much better.</li>
            <li>This product took out every knot easily.</li>
            <li>And I am not an easy sell.</li>
            <li>The handle shape made it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>This brush easily glides through hair and detangles hair without pulling.  </li>
            <li>With the multi-height and staggered bristles the hairs easily glide through this brush and detangle with ease.</li>
            <li>Combs through hair easily</li>
            <li>My hair knots really easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a straightener, so my hair tangles easily again, but tamed w/ this brush.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>The bristles are strong</li>
            <li>It easily made it through my tangles and my hair looked so healthy and full of volume after I used it.</li>
            <li>I was losing a great deal of hair with every combing out, but with this brush, there is barely any hair loss at all.</li>
            <li>Bought this brush for my daughter who has curly but fine hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter finds it incredibly easy and pain free to use the brush.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is another fine product.  </li>
            <li>It did not work for her hair, but it was fine for my fine, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Sure enough the brush was there when she got home from her successful HAIR APPOINTMENT.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and a lot of it, and this brush detangles my hair with ease.  </li>
            <li>have a lot of problems with tangles in my hair since it&#x27;s so fine.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m wearing a fine chain on a necklace, you can guarantee that my hair is going to get stuck in it.</li>
            <li>This seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>I have smooth wavy hair that gets easily tangled</li>
            <li>Out of frustration I did a quick google search for top rated detangling combs, and zeroed in on this one.</li>
            <li>This Brush really works its magic!</li>
            <li>Great little brush--smooths out hair nicely.</li>
            <li>The brush glides through my just washed hair leaving it quite smooth and tangle</li>
            <li>This brush makes it hassle free.</li>
            <li>It made a great Christmas present for both of us.</li>
            <li>Great brush for younger girls hair.  </li>
            <li>Glides smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>so when I received an offer for this I thought why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the brush is unusual but it fits nicely in the hand.  </li>
            <li>received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>you kind of put your whole hand around the brush itself.</li>
            <li>The brush is stylish and looks nice in my bathroom with it&#x27;s cute bubble design on the back.  </li>
            <li>I was even brave enough to try it with damp bair.</li>
            <li>I was astounded at how light the brush was.</li>
            <li>It is really light and ergonomic</li>
            <li>It is sooo smooth sounding &amp; feeling.</li>
            <li>Handle is comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and she loves the purple color.  </li>
            <li>She also uses it for her American Girl dolls hair and it works great for that as well.  </li>
            <li>Excellent detangler, especially on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great brush for smoothing out tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Works great just wish the handle of the brush was smaller</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair (almost to my waist) and it detangles beautifully.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!!!  </li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter who has very curly hair, she loves it!!!  </li>
            <li>and I found it to be very useful.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing tool !</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Works great on my daughter &#x27;s long hair and my medium length hair too.  </li>
            <li>My daughter says the brush works great on my granddaughters long hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair this is a great brush .</li>
            <li>I love the style, the colour, its basically a first girlie girl accessory I bought for my daughter.</li>
            <li>works great in my daughters long hair but the price was a mit</li>
            <li>I bought the brush to use on my daughter&#x27;s long hair and it works great to untangle.</li>
            <li>I purchased two more after using the first one on my toddler grandchild.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very well made!!</li>
            <li>this is a great buy for long hair and children!</li>
            <li>This would be the perfect brush for someone with a sensitive scalp or your daughter who just hates getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m super pleased with this hairbrush and even more pleased with the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I loved the boar bristle brush I gifted the pink one to my niece.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite things about this brush!</li>
            <li>I was even more impressed after the shower when the brush only took about five minutes to cut through wet hair and make everything smooth as a button.</li>
            <li>The hair comes right off making it so easy to clean!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to get her something really special because if \\&quot;Gram\\&quot; gives her money</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend :)) (and its pretty looking too) :)</li>
            <li>I like the tiered concept of the brush though as it makes it simpler and more effective detangling my long hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is great de-tangling my hair when it is wet.  </li>
            <li>on my hair, especially in the morning when first brushing, it works great on detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>They actually ask me to brush their hair sometimes just because it feels good.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 8 years old and insists on fixing her own hair.</li>
            <li>So if you like me are seeking a good quality hairbrush, possibly look at this one.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t guarantee you will have good results like mine because everyone has different hair, but for the price</li>
            <li>Who knows for sure she is very tender headed</li>
            <li>but the brush really does work through the knots better...</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>brush detangled my hair in minutes (not exaggerating) and was not painful either.</li>
            <li>design of the brush is really cool....</li>
            <li>I wish I could be one of those women in the commercials with thick, luxurious hair that perfectly bounces with each step but</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have tangle issues myself, and I&#x27;m the one who uses this brush the most</li>
            <li>it was in a nice clear plastic</li>
            <li>So far brushing  been nice.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brush because it leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Love it, super fast shipping ,thank you</li>
            <li>This brush feels wonderful on the scalp, but the fact is, when fine, thin hair is tangled after a shower, hair will fall come out.</li>
            <li>It even made my normally dreaded task for brush my 4 and 6 years old hair easy and painless thank you for making such an awesome brush</li>
            <li>One of my favorite new products!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend this much on a brush, but it is more than worth it.</li>
            <li>Hair extensions tend to knot and shed more than regular hair - Using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair brushes pulls at the knots which causes even more shedding/pulls at the scalp which can cause bald spots, etc.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and tangle free!  </li>
            <li>she noted the stylist using an unusual brush and when done her hair had never been so smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even ashamed to admit I brushed my hair for ten minutes, going over my scalp a million times because it felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend this strangling brush :)</li>
            <li>I bought the first one (as reviewed above) and the company contacted me to offer a free brush in exchange for an honest review (and now a free brush for adding a photo).  </li>
            <li>My daughter has long hair and it is prone to getting tangled, but it is very easy to detangle her hair with this comb!</li>
            <li>Since receiving our brush (very fast!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly there was no pull or breakage and the brush was hair free after brushing through the tangles a several times.</li>
            <li>It has a cute color and design on the back that also makes it more fun.</li>
            <li>I love my new Detangling Hair Brush.  </li>
            <li>Less breakage  and damage is a great thing</li>
            <li>Love this product &amp; really has helped my hair &amp; does exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to manage now thanks to their shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This one is more compact, which is nice for traveling, but I was really missing the full length handle and curved brush design.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Works great, but would be better for my girls if the bristles were longer and thicker for very thick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay brush, suitable for damp/dry hair not right after washing your hair.</li>
            <li>I knew it was a success when he asked to do it himself.</li>
            <li>When I brushed my hair it gave me a nice scalp massage feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the brush so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, invest in this nifty brush, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>But, overall its well made and resourceful.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 18 month old and IT is absolutely FANTASTIC for brushing her hair!</li>
            <li>That personal touch was nice.</li>
            <li>If I have a particularly knotted or matted area in my hair, this brush makes it so easy and painless to get out</li>
            <li>I also use it to smooth the top of my hair after back combing and teasing.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried several other de tangling brushes and haven&#x27;t been impressed.</li>
            <li>I pre-brushed using the Vizeri brush and the knots fell out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This brush is a bit bigger than I expected from the picture shown, however it feels awesome when I brush my hair, and it really does &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>I felt like the other brushes were just wimpy and skimmed over a good knot</li>
            <li>Just right for her lil hands.</li>
            <li>This brush went right through it without us fighting or her screaming.</li>
            <li>It glides right through my hair.</li>
            <li>The hair just comes right out of this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush does not hurt her head and we can brush with no fuss and move right along now</li>
            <li>It slides right through my curly mop.</li>
            <li>The brush is super light and not very large, so it will be super easy to travel with as well.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for wet hair or dry hair or any textured hair.</li>
            <li>My two 11 year olds and 9 year old daughters,and even my 7 year old son love it!</li>
            <li>She has long, curly kind of frizzy hair and is ALWAYS tangly.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for little girls who feel like its torture to get their hair brushed!</li>
            <li>Our only wish is that it came in blue or yellow, as those are our favorite colors, but pink is nice and girly, so it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has fine long hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised at how easily the brush fits in your hand.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was also very fast.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shopping.  </li>
            <li>It does its job without a whole lot of pull and to boot all its pretty!</li>
            <li>When they say &amp;#34;The best brush&amp;#34;, they mean it!!</li>
            <li>but this has made doing hair so much more easy and less time consuming for me</li>
            <li>I let them work at it themselves first, and then I finish up, brushing out the snarls they couldn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>At first I was astounded at the price.</li>
            <li>But then I read the reviews and decided that if it really eliminated the wailing and gnashing of teeth we experience at our house over brushing our hair, it would be worth every penny.</li>
            <li>You do have to brush it in sections from the bottom first</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s funny is that I let a friend with smoother, thinner hair try it</li>
            <li>I only just received the item, but I expect my daughter will love it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush !</li>
            <li>Maybe it is the shape because I prefer traditional shaped brushes.. they seem to give me better control.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re curly girls and most regular brushes</li>
            <li>Cute, small, light weight, and does its job!</li>
            <li>This brush is magic in that she actually lets me use it on her.</li>
            <li>Finally a brush my grand daughter will use with out complaining.</li>
            <li>, I am so pleased with this brush I am purchasing a second one today.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in buying a detangling brush, buy this item without hesitation.  </li>
            <li>I have had problems for years and this brush really works!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the claims of this brush being the best.  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first detangler ever</li>
            <li>it is not expensive yet it worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>This was much needed!</li>
            <li>This is the first brush when I was brushing the hair</li>
            <li>With the bleaching and dying, it gets really tangled!</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>thanks for that too!)</li>
            <li>This brush comes exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>After using the brush regularly now, I love the bristles.  </li>
            <li>But it works very well for all of that!</li>
            <li>I love brushing her tiny scalp with it and my darling daughter loves the strokes of it on her hair.</li>
            <li>every time I saw him, is now much thinner - and I don&#x27;t want to lose anymore of it!  </li>
            <li>so I have to deal with tangled hair for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Well-designed, light-weight, fits nicely in the hand and it&#x27;s pink and black--what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>Normally I would have a brush full of precious hair in the bristles left over from the battle</li>
            <li>All I needed do was glean the existing Amazon buyer reviews to pretty much confirm this might be a useful purchase, and the price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans easily and no sharp points.</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised!!!!</li>
            <li>net results are what count, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair looking better pretty much from the first day of use (guessing part of that</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good little brush!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this is an amazing brush.</li>
            <li>however this one only works great if the hair is wet.</li>
            <li>bristles are plastic so initially I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would be strong enough to work through my hair.</li>
            <li>With most plastic and nylon brushes I am either breaking to much of my hair or causing myself pain while obtaining mixed results.  </li>
            <li>i really like these brushes for my daughters hair, its much more forgiving that the standard brush when brushing out tangles.</li>
            <li>I am super excited to start using it daily, without ripping out so much hair.</li>
            <li>I do not understand why it works better than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hairbrushes, but it absolutely does, and there is less hair to clean out afterward.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair smooth and soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>My hair is much more manageable, and I think it will make my hair healthier in the long run by not breaking it just by brushing it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much Vizeri Beauty!</li>
            <li>I love having long hair</li>
            <li>and I never thought my hair could be this full or soft.  </li>
            <li>It was soft, shiny, and full of body.</li>
            <li>I am very particular on what brushes I will use for my hair.  </li>
            <li>A perfect brush for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li>, not only can we easily and painlessly get her tangles out, she can brush her own hair, and when I brush her hair, it&#x27;s a pleasant experience, because we can talk without being distracted by pain and anger.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and this brush detangles very gently!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li>AMAZING for little kid hair.</li>
            <li>and it works really well for detangling and shine.  </li>
            <li>and my kids have really curly hair.</li>
            <li>She has straight hair but curly underneath which is a recipe for lots of knots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this brush.</li>
            <li>I really like the shape of the brush too.</li>
            <li>She even hates having her hair washed or really even just touched.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this hair brush.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I helps gently remove tangles.  </li>
            <li>I got this brush for my daughter as a birthday gift she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>This is working very well for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY tender headed, but this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>I still have to gently work the brush through LO&#x27;s hair -</li>
            <li>I really do like this brush.  </li>
            <li>The shape helps you to gently maneuver through your hair.</li>
            <li>brush really amazed me..</li>
            <li>But now its not a problem thanks to this brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plastic but don&#x27;t let that fool you, the multi level bristles really help to untangle the hair with snagging.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a very tender head and mornings, bath time and bed time was always a fight to brush her hair.</li>
            <li>I used it and it really does &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend purchasing this brush!</li>
            <li>She really needs to quit pulling &amp; breaking her hair.  </li>
            <li>I and my 2 daughters have very tangly hair.</li>
            <li>One of the things that I appreciated was that when I ordered it, I received an email from Vizeri Beauty about how to use it and keep care of the brush.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I absolutely ❤</li>
            <li>This is definitely a pain free brush as it says.</li>
            <li>It really does move through tangles without snagging.  </li>
            <li>I received this brush a couple of weeks ago and my curls thanks it.  </li>
            <li>Takes tangles out gently and efficiently without ripping the hair.</li>
            <li>So when my whole hair is tangled</li>
            <li>Where has this been my whole tangled hair life?</li>
            <li>just used this on my really tangled hair and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>package arrived extremly fast and when I opened it,  </li>
            <li>I like using it most when hair is wet, in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel and look of this brush.</li>
            <li>it is soft enough to get the job done without pulling more out than it should.</li>
            <li>I was truly surprised to see how nicely this brush glided through my wet, matted relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will be good with her thick hair</li>
            <li>With this brush, far less comes than would with a normal brush, which is good.</li>
            <li>sleek design makes the brush easy to maneuver and the bristles are soft enough to not pull my hair, but strong enough to loosen the knots.</li>
            <li>The brushes are pretty too and caught my eye when I was shopping for a new brush.</li>
            <li>and she is excited to order one herself, because she has the same struggles with her daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Gets the knots out better than other de-knotting brushes we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair the way many other combs and brushes do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to untangle any better then other brushes.</li>
            <li>I only had the chance to use this the first few times but it’s good</li>
            <li>Bought this amazing brush for my grand daughter who has long thick hair.</li>
            <li>It does work to detangle, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than our other one.  </li>
            <li>Very good for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that gets tangled easily but this brush is surprisingly gentle even when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush for anyone with long fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing brush I usually have to fight with my daughters to bruth their hair</li>
            <li>I really do like this brush and it will make a little girl or a big girl like myself happy because of the color almost like a Barbie doll brush but real for Human hair.</li>
            <li>But my hair now have more volume and less falling down!&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>By brushing the hair the hair stays vibrant</li>
            <li>A decent quality brush.</li>
            <li>Sure enough this is the same brush and since using it my wife no longer complains about tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>I got this brush at a highly disconted price however this does not affect my review in any way*</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to anyone and all..</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Product as described and high quality.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine and gets snarled pretty easily, but I don&#x27;t seem to be losing near the hair in this brush as I do with others.  </li>
            <li>Still, overall, I&#x27;m happy with the brush because I can use it when my hair&#x27;s wet or dry</li>
            <li>This brush has made my daily routine run much smoother!!</li>
            <li>I did pick up a little static while brushing but sprayed it with &amp;</li>
            <li>it was just a little bit longer for a better grip.</li>
            <li>Vizeri, you have no idea of how much time, effort, and pain this lovely little brush has saved me!</li>
            <li>, this one gently works through it and my daughter now won&#x27;t let anything else near her head.</li>
            <li>normally we struggle with a comb for close to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Normally I get bunches when I use a brush for that...</li>
            <li>I really think that a mosquito could come just blow a tiny puff of air on my hair, and my hair would be in absolute knots!</li>
            <li>My daughter said it was better than the one we got a few years ago.</li>
            <li>Normally when I brush my hair it comes out a lot and hurts while I brush as it rips out of my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of normal wiggling as I brush her hair, she stood still for me.</li>
            <li>hair detangler brush got all my tangles out with ease and in a fraction of the time and pain it would take me with a normal brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine hair past my shoulders and it is quite tangled when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It works great on my granddaughter&#x27;s long curly locks when they are wet or  dry.  </li>
            <li>Typically, I&#x27;d have had a brush that had to be regularly cleaned of my own pulled-out hair by using a comb.</li>
            <li>my new brush!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles were falling out, so it was time for a new brush.  </li>
            <li>I clean it: turn bristles down and with few fast strokes shake again softer surface ( such as my own leg) all hair from inside brush will me moved on surface of the bristles and you can remove it with fingers.</li>
            <li>I did not have high hopes, but I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive head and with this brush I dont get headaches from brushing out my hair.</li>
            <li>First I ordered one of your brushes for a fragile poodle mix.  </li>
            <li>I immediately threw my old brush out!</li>
            <li>she usually makes sure that everyone gets something and before you know it her Christmas Gift is gone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, just different.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and glide through my hair!</li>
            <li>No crying or yelling at me to stop when I used this!  </li>
            <li>Everyone in my home loves it including my 13 year old son!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I can brush my four year old girls hair with her complaining!</li>
            <li>Only good for very small hands.</li>
            <li>I have long, bleached, platinum blonde hair that is very fine and fragile.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not hard but not too soft either.</li>
            <li>I can brush from my hair from the scalp down to the ends and the brush goes through smoothly.</li>
            <li>The handle isn&#x27;t quite long enough to be completly comfortable.</li>
            <li>I now own three of these, 2 pink and 1 black.  </li>
            <li>This brush works amazing on my 15 month old who is blessed with long curly hair but like any other baby doesn&#x27;t want his hair brushed when it hurts.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but it did definitely not work on my daughters long and tangled hair at all.</li>
            <li>Having invested in the NIOXIN hair care system to prevent further hair loss, I figured a special comb or brush that detangles without snagging hair was also worth a small investment.</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d this brush in a neat lil clear plastic box.</li>
            <li>It is easier to clean out because there is less hair found in the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There has been no crying since it was delivered.</li>
            <li>AND her hair is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>The handle makes it much easier to handle than some similar products (i.e. knot genie).</li>
            <li>For me bore brushes have always been too soft.</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter is a young mom and she lives in PA.  </li>
            <li>I have a young child and with the hair it is always getting knotted up.</li>
            <li>Maybe think about someone who is going through chemo and would like a soft brush</li>
            <li>Professional quality.</li>
            <li>Now a days, I keep my hair at a shoulders link but still have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This style of brush completely eliminates that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if I want to really style my hair, I have to use a different brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just received this brush about a week ago and have been pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>Basically you have to hold the brush by the back to really use it.</li>
            <li>She is 9, and is sensitive to pulling hair while de tangling.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair really gets tangled in the back</li>
            <li>I ultimately wouldn&#x27;t  much care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is VERY tender headed and her hair is in constant knots.</li>
            <li>few big notable things here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush works OK for my daughter&#x27;s fine/thin hair but it can&#x27;t get through my thick hair.</li>
            <li>This brush seemed to tame and smooth the natural frizz that comes with curls.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick red hair that is turning gray ( wirery hairs) and this brush goes through my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair brush because my hair was dry, full of tangles and my large amounts of hair would get pulled out whenever I used other wide-tooth combs and brushes to groom my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it was not very effective at removing tangles without pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a ton of thick long hair and the brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>After the third day, older sister and mom were caught using the brush every day.</li>
            <li>I saw the bristles were in a bunch of high and low rows.</li>
            <li>This solved a major problem for me !&lt;</li>
            <li>I used it both on wet and dry hair and both times she noticed a huge difference in how it felt.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that tangles easily and find it so frustrating to brush.  </li>
            <li>It had a very different shape than a normal brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not exactly fond of pink, but if it worked, I figured</li>
            <li>love this brush because i can use on wet hair with little or no breakage....</li>
            <li>The handle is a little short, but overall it works very well on my daughter&#x27;s super curly and tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>I got her one last year and figured shed like another one with a new design .</li>
            <li>I have very long straight to wavy hair</li>
            <li>BUT NOT SO MUCH WHEN DRY</li>
            <li>The only complaint would be that it needs a better handle that is easier to grip.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to untangle my thick, curly hair with no pain.</li>
            <li>My wife has extremely long hair and no matter how much she brushed through it she could never seem to get it completely detangled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a guy with full, curly/wavy hair, and have gone thru half a dozen various brushes and combs.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how easily this brush detangled my hair without excessive hair loss or any discomfort!</li>
            <li>It works really slow, but definitely painless, which is huge for my 3 year old and 9 month old.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s constantly making me feel how soft her hair is now.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old hates getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>My old brush would constantly pull out hair which didn&#x27;t help my hair falling out from having a baby.</li>
            <li>She must have the world&#x27;s most tender scalp; her hair isn&#x27;t all that thick or long, so I don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Morning come hate ideal of combing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little hard to tell how good it would be unless you have really thick hair, but it appears to work OK if you have average hari.</li>
            <li>I braced myself half expecting for this brush to snatch me bald on the first</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, thin straight hair</li>
            <li>This brush worked much better than my ordinary paddle brush, but not as well as Vizeri&#x27;s other Boar&#x27;s Hair Detangling Brush.</li>
            <li>I have very thick long hair and this brush makes getting the tangles out very easy.</li>
            <li>I was convinced that if there was something that was able to get through my tangled mess - wet or dry, I would have discovered it by now.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old has very long but thin &amp; fine hair to her butt!</li>
            <li>So I have 3 daughters, two of which are old enough to tell me they detest having their hair brushed.</li>
            <li>saw a commercial for this product and, while she was thrilled at the promise that it would never hurt to use, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li>I works particularly well on wet hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is very gentle on my hair and gets knots out when my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>i think it may work best on thin hair or in very thin sections of hair.</li>
            <li>Obviously it makes sense to brush your hair sensibly, but this is much easier on my hair than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>By the end of a 6 hour work shift (not long at all)</li>
            <li>I have been struggling to get the tangles out of my 2 year old daughters long hair with a comb.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is autistic so at first she didnt like it because she equates the noise with her hair being pulled.  </li>
            <li>This brush not only fights the tangles with less pain than any other product, but it&#x27;s bristles are strong enough to actually do the job,</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>The only other brush that worked was one I got from Avon many years ago with hard plastic tines.</li>
            <li>but it really does work well on both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>She really loves it and can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>my 11 year old, with waist length hair, used it for the first time last night and with wet hair, it took less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>I also color my hair and it gets pretty rough trying to brush it when I am due to recolor the gray hair my &amp;#34;ungreatfuls&amp;#34; put upon me with stress and worry.</li>
            <li>After having used the brush for a little while now, I&#x27;ll admit that there are times when I&#x27;ll have to brush my hair out from the bottom and work my way up because my hair is really tangled up.</li>
            <li>It is tough to find a hairbrush that will work through all my tangles smoothly and without ripping knots out of my head.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m honest here.</li>
            <li> It is cute and good size to keep in the hand bag or travel with it.</li>

            <li> only is it great for my below shoulder length hair, but it is a perfect brush for my Golden Retriever dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews were brilliant not a negative one to the bunch.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with</li>
            <li> It is fine but there is a lot of it !</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping and nice packaging.  </li>
            <li> I also love that the handle shape makes it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> more thing that I absolutely love is how easy it is to clean!!</li>
            <li> We still love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Despite a gazillion reviews about this brush, I noticed that most of the reviewers either didn&#x27;t have my hair type or didn&#x27;t mention what hair type they have.  </li>
            <li> love this brush</li>
            <li> but my daughter likes it better than the electric detangler we have.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it has longer bristles for my curly and somewhat course hair.</li>
            <li> Now the Vizeri Brush works better and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> Really it is more like a 4 1/2 stars.  </li>
            <li> Does everything as said by the seller, plus the really cute design.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase for my daughter&#x27;s waist-long hair.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for designing such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I think the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush or knockoffs work better.</li>
            <li> Then I ordered one for myself and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I *love*</li>
            <li> love, love, love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I would like it better if the handle was longer.</li>
            <li> this brush works a hell of a lot better than any &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> however I think it will be better for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> She actually enjoyed brushing her hair with this brush.</li>
            <li> She is better with it after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my grand daughter with shoulder length, somewhat Curley hair.</li>

            <li> This brush is really cute.</li>
            <li> Since I bought this brush, it has became my daughter&#x27;s favorite brush.</li>
            <li> SHE HAS BOUGHT MANY BRUSHES BUT</li>
            <li> COULDN&#x27;T GET OVER THE MAGIC OF VISERI</li>
            <li> Great on the hair, gentle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like MAGIC as the description.</li>
            <li> I love the products.</li>
            <li> am thinking of ordering more as favors for her birthday party.</li>
            <li> The bristles I thought would cause static but believe it or not it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> love this brush.  </li>
            <li> and I have found a better brush for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush also was able to handle the mane of hair and get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and will be buying more&lt;</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This made her hair brushing experience so much better.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t think it would work on my hair, but it detangles better than my comb.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  </li>
            <li> and it was much better after that.  </li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have never used a better brush than this.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love the tangles and pain of brushing/combing them out.</li>
            <li> I was able to part the hair I. Sections</li>
            <li> Love the brush.</li>
            <li> You just never know! :)</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great brush!</li>
            <li> when I was done I was able to run my fingers through my hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> The different length bristles also make it an awesome head massager while your brushing!</li>
            <li> I even love how the bristles massage my head.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love to  borrow it.</li>
            <li> I love their products and will cont to order them thru Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Many brushes I have tried just don&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
            <li> I love the design of this brush, it fits into the palm of your hand so that it grips better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
            <li> Fantastic detangling brush!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this brush in my hand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I primarily use it on my curly extensions and it does an amazing job on detangling the hair without pulling it out from the weft.</li>
            <li> We are pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t dislike this item, but found it equally able to detangle my hair as my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter appreciates it! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I am in love with this brush.  </li>
            <li> no women should be without this:)</li>
            <li> Great brush that really does brush out tangles efficiently, and mostly painlessly.</li>
            <li> I’m going to order more.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of rigidity to pull at those tangles, but it also knows when to give so as to keep these locks in gorgeous harmony.</li>
            <li> Plus they sent extra information to my e-mail which was very nice!</li>
            <li> When the brush arrived, I was very excited to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best detangling brush I&#x27;ve used by a long shot, but it does work ok.</li>
            <li> It is also super cute!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pretty averagely good.  </li>
            <li> I hope this is true because I will be continuing to use it for the nice feeling it gives me.  </li>
            <li> She loves her long hair now that I have found the perfect brush for her tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy for her to use as well!</li>
            <li> Works best on dry hair for her.</li>
            <li> I love how easy this fits into my hand.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most incredible inventions out there, and yet it is a simple brush.  </li>
            <li> Also it is a very pretty color and fits nicely in her hand😀</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the brush.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this product that I received as a free product for my unbias opinion.</li>
            <li> Great helper in elimination of the drama a 4yr old can make when brushing her hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, and I would happily try out other products by this company.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic style of the brush makes it easy to hold as you brush your hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> My 2 y/o daughter can use it easily.</li>
            <li> and it gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased a $5 comb from Great Clips used to help detangle and that works much much better.</li>
            <li> This product took out every knot easily.</li>
            <li> And I am not an easy sell.</li>
            <li> The handle shape made it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This brush easily glides through hair and detangles hair without pulling.  </li>
            <li> With the multi-height and staggered bristles the hairs easily glide through this brush and detangle with ease.</li>
            <li> Combs through hair easily</li>
            <li> My hair knots really easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a straightener, so my hair tangles easily again, but tamed w/ this brush.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> The bristles are strong</li>
            <li> It easily made it through my tangles and my hair looked so healthy and full of volume after I used it.</li>
            <li> I was losing a great deal of hair with every combing out, but with this brush, there is barely any hair loss at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my daughter who has curly but fine hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter finds it incredibly easy and pain free to use the brush.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is another fine product.  </li>
            <li> It did not work for her hair, but it was fine for my fine, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Sure enough the brush was there when she got home from her successful HAIR APPOINTMENT.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and a lot of it, and this brush detangles my hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> have a lot of problems with tangles in my hair since it&#x27;s so fine.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m wearing a fine chain on a necklace, you can guarantee that my hair is going to get stuck in it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> I have smooth wavy hair that gets easily tangled</li>

            <li> Glides smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> so when I received an offer for this I thought why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the brush is unusual but it fits nicely in the hand.  </li>
            <li> received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> you kind of put your whole hand around the brush itself.</li>
            <li> The brush is stylish and looks nice in my bathroom with it&#x27;s cute bubble design on the back.  </li>
            <li> I was even brave enough to try it with damp bair.</li>
            <li> I was astounded at how light the brush was.</li>
            <li> It is really light and ergonomic</li>

            <li> Handle is comfortable.</li>

            <li> She also uses it for her American Girl dolls hair and it works great for that as well.  </li>
            <li> Excellent detangler, especially on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great brush for smoothing out tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Works great just wish the handle of the brush was smaller</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (almost to my waist) and it detangles beautifully.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!!!  </li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who has very curly hair, she loves it!!!  </li>
            <li> and I found it to be very useful.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing tool !</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter &#x27;s long hair and my medium length hair too.  </li>
            <li> My daughter says the brush works great on my granddaughters long hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair this is a great brush .</li>
            <li> I love the style, the colour, its basically a first girlie girl accessory I bought for my daughter.</li>
            <li> works great in my daughters long hair but the price was a mit</li>
            <li> I bought the brush to use on my daughter&#x27;s long hair and it works great to untangle.</li>
            <li> I purchased two more after using the first one on my toddler grandchild.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very well made!!</li>
            <li> this is a great buy for long hair and children!</li>
            <li> This would be the perfect brush for someone with a sensitive scalp or your daughter who just hates getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m super pleased with this hairbrush and even more pleased with the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I loved the boar bristle brush I gifted the pink one to my niece.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite things about this brush!</li>
            <li> I was even more impressed after the shower when the brush only took about five minutes to cut through wet hair and make everything smooth as a button.</li>
            <li> The hair comes right off making it so easy to clean!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to get her something really special because if \\&quot;Gram\\&quot; gives her money</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend :)) (and its pretty looking too) :)</li>
            <li> I like the tiered concept of the brush though as it makes it simpler and more effective detangling my long hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is great de-tangling my hair when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> on my hair, especially in the morning when first brushing, it works great on detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> They actually ask me to brush their hair sometimes just because it feels good.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 8 years old and insists on fixing her own hair.</li>
            <li> So if you like me are seeking a good quality hairbrush, possibly look at this one.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee you will have good results like mine because everyone has different hair, but for the price</li>
            <li> Who knows for sure she is very tender headed</li>
            <li> but the brush really does work through the knots better...</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> brush detangled my hair in minutes (not exaggerating) and was not painful either.</li>
            <li> design of the brush is really cool....</li>
            <li> I wish I could be one of those women in the commercials with thick, luxurious hair that perfectly bounces with each step but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have tangle issues myself, and I&#x27;m the one who uses this brush the most</li>
            <li> it was in a nice clear plastic</li>
            <li> So far brushing  been nice.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush because it leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it, super fast shipping ,thank you</li>
            <li> This brush feels wonderful on the scalp, but the fact is, when fine, thin hair is tangled after a shower, hair will fall come out.</li>
            <li> It even made my normally dreaded task for brush my 4 and 6 years old hair easy and painless thank you for making such an awesome brush</li>
            <li> One of my favorite new products!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much on a brush, but it is more than worth it.</li>
            <li> Hair extensions tend to knot and shed more than regular hair - Using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair brushes pulls at the knots which causes even more shedding/pulls at the scalp which can cause bald spots, etc.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and tangle free!  </li>
            <li> she noted the stylist using an unusual brush and when done her hair had never been so smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even ashamed to admit I brushed my hair for ten minutes, going over my scalp a million times because it felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend this strangling brush :)</li>
            <li> I bought the first one (as reviewed above) and the company contacted me to offer a free brush in exchange for an honest review (and now a free brush for adding a photo).  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair and it is prone to getting tangled, but it is very easy to detangle her hair with this comb!</li>
            <li> Since receiving our brush (very fast!  </li>
            <li> Most importantly there was no pull or breakage and the brush was hair free after brushing through the tangles a several times.</li>
            <li> It has a cute color and design on the back that also makes it more fun.</li>
            <li> I love my new Detangling Hair Brush.  </li>
            <li> Less breakage  and damage is a great thing</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; really has helped my hair &amp; does exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to manage now thanks to their shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This one is more compact, which is nice for traveling, but I was really missing the full length handle and curved brush design.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, but would be better for my girls if the bristles were longer and thicker for very thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush, suitable for damp/dry hair not right after washing your hair.</li>
            <li> I knew it was a success when he asked to do it himself.</li>
            <li> When I brushed my hair it gave me a nice scalp massage feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the brush so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, invest in this nifty brush, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> But, overall its well made and resourceful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 18 month old and IT is absolutely FANTASTIC for brushing her hair!</li>
            <li> That personal touch was nice.</li>
            <li> If I have a particularly knotted or matted area in my hair, this brush makes it so easy and painless to get out</li>
            <li> I also use it to smooth the top of my hair after back combing and teasing.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried several other de tangling brushes and haven&#x27;t been impressed.</li>
            <li> I pre-brushed using the Vizeri brush and the knots fell out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit bigger than I expected from the picture shown, however it feels awesome when I brush my hair, and it really does &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I felt like the other brushes were just wimpy and skimmed over a good knot</li>
            <li> Just right for her lil hands.</li>
            <li> This brush went right through it without us fighting or her screaming.</li>
            <li> It glides right through my hair.</li>
            <li> The hair just comes right out of this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush does not hurt her head and we can brush with no fuss and move right along now</li>
            <li> It slides right through my curly mop.</li>
            <li> The brush is super light and not very large, so it will be super easy to travel with as well.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for wet hair or dry hair or any textured hair.</li>
            <li> My two 11 year olds and 9 year old daughters,and even my 7 year old son love it!</li>
            <li> She has long, curly kind of frizzy hair and is ALWAYS tangly.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for little girls who feel like its torture to get their hair brushed!</li>
            <li> Our only wish is that it came in blue or yellow, as those are our favorite colors, but pink is nice and girly, so it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has fine long hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised at how easily the brush fits in your hand.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was also very fast.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shopping.  </li>
            <li> It does its job without a whole lot of pull and to boot all its pretty!</li>
            <li> When they say &amp;#34;The best brush&amp;#34;, they mean it!!</li>
            <li> but this has made doing hair so much more easy and less time consuming for me</li>
            <li> I let them work at it themselves first, and then I finish up, brushing out the snarls they couldn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> At first I was astounded at the price.</li>
            <li> But then I read the reviews and decided that if it really eliminated the wailing and gnashing of teeth we experience at our house over brushing our hair, it would be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> You do have to brush it in sections from the bottom first</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s funny is that I let a friend with smoother, thinner hair try it</li>
            <li> I only just received the item, but I expect my daughter will love it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush !</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the shape because I prefer traditional shaped brushes.. they seem to give me better control.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re curly girls and most regular brushes</li>
            <li> Cute, small, light weight, and does its job!</li>
            <li> This brush is magic in that she actually lets me use it on her.</li>
            <li> Finally a brush my grand daughter will use with out complaining.</li>
            <li> , I am so pleased with this brush I am purchasing a second one today.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in buying a detangling brush, buy this item without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> I have had problems for years and this brush really works!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the claims of this brush being the best.  </li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first detangler ever</li>
            <li> it is not expensive yet it worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> This was much needed!</li>
            <li> This is the first brush when I was brushing the hair</li>
            <li> With the bleaching and dying, it gets really tangled!</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> thanks for that too!)</li>
            <li> This brush comes exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> After using the brush regularly now, I love the bristles.  </li>
            <li> But it works very well for all of that!</li>
            <li> I love brushing her tiny scalp with it and my darling daughter loves the strokes of it on her hair.</li>
            <li> every time I saw him, is now much thinner - and I don&#x27;t want to lose anymore of it!  </li>
            <li> so I have to deal with tangled hair for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> Well-designed, light-weight, fits nicely in the hand and it&#x27;s pink and black--what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> Normally I would have a brush full of precious hair in the bristles left over from the battle</li>
            <li> All I needed do was glean the existing Amazon buyer reviews to pretty much confirm this might be a useful purchase, and the price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans easily and no sharp points.</li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised!!!!</li>
            <li> net results are what count, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair looking better pretty much from the first day of use (guessing part of that</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little brush!  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this is an amazing brush.</li>
            <li> however this one only works great if the hair is wet.</li>
            <li> bristles are plastic so initially I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would be strong enough to work through my hair.</li>
            <li> With most plastic and nylon brushes I am either breaking to much of my hair or causing myself pain while obtaining mixed results.  </li>
            <li> i really like these brushes for my daughters hair, its much more forgiving that the standard brush when brushing out tangles.</li>
            <li> I am super excited to start using it daily, without ripping out so much hair.</li>
            <li> I do not understand why it works better than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hairbrushes, but it absolutely does, and there is less hair to clean out afterward.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair smooth and soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> My hair is much more manageable, and I think it will make my hair healthier in the long run by not breaking it just by brushing it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much Vizeri Beauty!</li>
            <li> I love having long hair</li>
            <li> and I never thought my hair could be this full or soft.  </li>
            <li> It was soft, shiny, and full of body.</li>
            <li> I am very particular on what brushes I will use for my hair.  </li>
            <li> A perfect brush for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> , not only can we easily and painlessly get her tangles out, she can brush her own hair, and when I brush her hair, it&#x27;s a pleasant experience, because we can talk without being distracted by pain and anger.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this brush detangles very gently!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> AMAZING for little kid hair.</li>
            <li> and it works really well for detangling and shine.  </li>
            <li> and my kids have really curly hair.</li>
            <li> She has straight hair but curly underneath which is a recipe for lots of knots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this brush.</li>
            <li> I really like the shape of the brush too.</li>
            <li> She even hates having her hair washed or really even just touched.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this hair brush.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I helps gently remove tangles.  </li>
            <li> I got this brush for my daughter as a birthday gift she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> This is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY tender headed, but this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> I still have to gently work the brush through LO&#x27;s hair -</li>
            <li> I really do like this brush.  </li>
            <li> The shape helps you to gently maneuver through your hair.</li>
            <li> brush really amazed me..</li>
            <li> But now its not a problem thanks to this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic but don&#x27;t let that fool you, the multi level bristles really help to untangle the hair with snagging.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very tender head and mornings, bath time and bed time was always a fight to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> I used it and it really does &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend purchasing this brush!</li>
            <li> She really needs to quit pulling &amp; breaking her hair.  </li>
            <li> I and my 2 daughters have very tangly hair.</li>
            <li> One of the things that I appreciated was that when I ordered it, I received an email from Vizeri Beauty about how to use it and keep care of the brush.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I absolutely ❤</li>
            <li> This is definitely a pain free brush as it says.</li>
            <li> It really does move through tangles without snagging.  </li>
            <li> I received this brush a couple of weeks ago and my curls thanks it.  </li>
            <li> Takes tangles out gently and efficiently without ripping the hair.</li>
            <li> So when my whole hair is tangled</li>
            <li> Where has this been my whole tangled hair life?</li>
            <li> just used this on my really tangled hair and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> package arrived extremly fast and when I opened it,  </li>
            <li> I like using it most when hair is wet, in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and look of this brush.</li>
            <li> it is soft enough to get the job done without pulling more out than it should.</li>
            <li> I was truly surprised to see how nicely this brush glided through my wet, matted relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will be good with her thick hair</li>
            <li> With this brush, far less comes than would with a normal brush, which is good.</li>
            <li> sleek design makes the brush easy to maneuver and the bristles are soft enough to not pull my hair, but strong enough to loosen the knots.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty too and caught my eye when I was shopping for a new brush.</li>
            <li> and she is excited to order one herself, because she has the same struggles with her daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Gets the knots out better than other de-knotting brushes we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair the way many other combs and brushes do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to untangle any better then other brushes.</li>
            <li> I only had the chance to use this the first few times but it’s good</li>
            <li> Bought this amazing brush for my grand daughter who has long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It does work to detangle, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than our other one.  </li>
            <li> Very good for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that gets tangled easily but this brush is surprisingly gentle even when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush for anyone with long fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush I usually have to fight with my daughters to bruth their hair</li>
            <li> I really do like this brush and it will make a little girl or a big girl like myself happy because of the color almost like a Barbie doll brush but real for Human hair.</li>
            <li> But my hair now have more volume and less falling down!&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> By brushing the hair the hair stays vibrant</li>
            <li> A decent quality brush.</li>
            <li> Sure enough this is the same brush and since using it my wife no longer complains about tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> I got this brush at a highly disconted price however this does not affect my review in any way*</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush to anyone and all..</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Product as described and high quality.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine and gets snarled pretty easily, but I don&#x27;t seem to be losing near the hair in this brush as I do with others.  </li>
            <li> Still, overall, I&#x27;m happy with the brush because I can use it when my hair&#x27;s wet or dry</li>
            <li> This brush has made my daily routine run much smoother!!</li>
            <li> I did pick up a little static while brushing but sprayed it with &amp;</li>
            <li> it was just a little bit longer for a better grip.</li>
            <li> Vizeri, you have no idea of how much time, effort, and pain this lovely little brush has saved me!</li>
            <li> , this one gently works through it and my daughter now won&#x27;t let anything else near her head.</li>
            <li> normally we struggle with a comb for close to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Normally I get bunches when I use a brush for that...</li>
            <li> I really think that a mosquito could come just blow a tiny puff of air on my hair, and my hair would be in absolute knots!</li>
            <li> My daughter said it was better than the one we got a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Normally when I brush my hair it comes out a lot and hurts while I brush as it rips out of my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of normal wiggling as I brush her hair, she stood still for me.</li>
            <li> hair detangler brush got all my tangles out with ease and in a fraction of the time and pain it would take me with a normal brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine hair past my shoulders and it is quite tangled when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> It works great on my granddaughter&#x27;s long curly locks when they are wet or  dry.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I&#x27;d have had a brush that had to be regularly cleaned of my own pulled-out hair by using a comb.</li>
            <li> my new brush!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles were falling out, so it was time for a new brush.  </li>
            <li> I clean it: turn bristles down and with few fast strokes shake again softer surface ( such as my own leg) all hair from inside brush will me moved on surface of the bristles and you can remove it with fingers.</li>
            <li> I did not have high hopes, but I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive head and with this brush I dont get headaches from brushing out my hair.</li>
            <li> First I ordered one of your brushes for a fragile poodle mix.  </li>
            <li> I immediately threw my old brush out!</li>
            <li> she usually makes sure that everyone gets something and before you know it her Christmas Gift is gone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, just different.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and glide through my hair!</li>
            <li> No crying or yelling at me to stop when I used this!  </li>
            <li> Everyone in my home loves it including my 13 year old son!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I can brush my four year old girls hair with her complaining!</li>
            <li> Only good for very small hands.</li>
            <li> I have long, bleached, platinum blonde hair that is very fine and fragile.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not hard but not too soft either.</li>
            <li> I can brush from my hair from the scalp down to the ends and the brush goes through smoothly.</li>
            <li> The handle isn&#x27;t quite long enough to be completly comfortable.</li>
            <li> I now own three of these, 2 pink and 1 black.  </li>
            <li> This brush works amazing on my 15 month old who is blessed with long curly hair but like any other baby doesn&#x27;t want his hair brushed when it hurts.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but it did definitely not work on my daughters long and tangled hair at all.</li>
            <li> Having invested in the NIOXIN hair care system to prevent further hair loss, I figured a special comb or brush that detangles without snagging hair was also worth a small investment.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this brush in a neat lil clear plastic box.</li>
            <li> It is easier to clean out because there is less hair found in the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There has been no crying since it was delivered.</li>
            <li> AND her hair is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> The handle makes it much easier to handle than some similar products (i.e. knot genie).</li>
            <li> For me bore brushes have always been too soft.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter is a young mom and she lives in PA.  </li>
            <li> I have a young child and with the hair it is always getting knotted up.</li>
            <li> Maybe think about someone who is going through chemo and would like a soft brush</li>
            <li> Professional quality.</li>
            <li> Now a days, I keep my hair at a shoulders link but still have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This style of brush completely eliminates that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if I want to really style my hair, I have to use a different brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just received this brush about a week ago and have been pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> Basically you have to hold the brush by the back to really use it.</li>
            <li> She is 9, and is sensitive to pulling hair while de tangling.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair really gets tangled in the back</li>
            <li> I ultimately wouldn&#x27;t  much care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is VERY tender headed and her hair is in constant knots.</li>
            <li> few big notable things here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush works OK for my daughter&#x27;s fine/thin hair but it can&#x27;t get through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This brush seemed to tame and smooth the natural frizz that comes with curls.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick red hair that is turning gray ( wirery hairs) and this brush goes through my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair brush because my hair was dry, full of tangles and my large amounts of hair would get pulled out whenever I used other wide-tooth combs and brushes to groom my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it was not very effective at removing tangles without pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a ton of thick long hair and the brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> After the third day, older sister and mom were caught using the brush every day.</li>
            <li> I saw the bristles were in a bunch of high and low rows.</li>
            <li> This solved a major problem for me !&lt;</li>
            <li> I used it both on wet and dry hair and both times she noticed a huge difference in how it felt.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that tangles easily and find it so frustrating to brush.  </li>
            <li> It had a very different shape than a normal brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not exactly fond of pink, but if it worked, I figured</li>
            <li> love this brush because i can use on wet hair with little or no breakage....</li>
            <li> The handle is a little short, but overall it works very well on my daughter&#x27;s super curly and tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> I got her one last year and figured shed like another one with a new design .</li>
            <li> I have very long straight to wavy hair</li>
            <li> BUT NOT SO MUCH WHEN DRY</li>
            <li> The only complaint would be that it needs a better handle that is easier to grip.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to untangle my thick, curly hair with no pain.</li>
            <li> My wife has extremely long hair and no matter how much she brushed through it she could never seem to get it completely detangled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy with full, curly/wavy hair, and have gone thru half a dozen various brushes and combs.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how easily this brush detangled my hair without excessive hair loss or any discomfort!</li>
            <li> It works really slow, but definitely painless, which is huge for my 3 year old and 9 month old.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s constantly making me feel how soft her hair is now.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old hates getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> My old brush would constantly pull out hair which didn&#x27;t help my hair falling out from having a baby.</li>
            <li> She must have the world&#x27;s most tender scalp; her hair isn&#x27;t all that thick or long, so I don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Morning come hate ideal of combing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to tell how good it would be unless you have really thick hair, but it appears to work OK if you have average hari.</li>
            <li> I braced myself half expecting for this brush to snatch me bald on the first</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin straight hair</li>
            <li> This brush worked much better than my ordinary paddle brush, but not as well as Vizeri&#x27;s other Boar&#x27;s Hair Detangling Brush.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair and this brush makes getting the tangles out very easy.</li>
            <li> I was convinced that if there was something that was able to get through my tangled mess - wet or dry, I would have discovered it by now.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has very long but thin &amp; fine hair to her butt!</li>
            <li> So I have 3 daughters, two of which are old enough to tell me they detest having their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> saw a commercial for this product and, while she was thrilled at the promise that it would never hurt to use, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I works particularly well on wet hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is very gentle on my hair and gets knots out when my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> i think it may work best on thin hair or in very thin sections of hair.</li>
            <li> Obviously it makes sense to brush your hair sensibly, but this is much easier on my hair than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> By the end of a 6 hour work shift (not long at all)</li>
            <li> I have been struggling to get the tangles out of my 2 year old daughters long hair with a comb.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is autistic so at first she didnt like it because she equates the noise with her hair being pulled.  </li>
            <li> This brush not only fights the tangles with less pain than any other product, but it&#x27;s bristles are strong enough to actually do the job,</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> The only other brush that worked was one I got from Avon many years ago with hard plastic tines.</li>
            <li> but it really does work well on both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> She really loves it and can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> my 11 year old, with waist length hair, used it for the first time last night and with wet hair, it took less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> I also color my hair and it gets pretty rough trying to brush it when I am due to recolor the gray hair my &amp;#34;ungreatfuls&amp;#34; put upon me with stress and worry.</li>
            <li> After having used the brush for a little while now, I&#x27;ll admit that there are times when I&#x27;ll have to brush my hair out from the bottom and work my way up because my hair is really tangled up.</li>
            <li> It is tough to find a hairbrush that will work through all my tangles smoothly and without ripping knots out of my head.</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time getting the tangles out when I get out of the shower but with this brush I can brush right through my hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not long enough in fact they are short for long hair to go through</li>
            <li> have thick curly hair and this detangling brush glided right through my curls.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely thick hair and this brush goes right through it without any problems.  </li>
            <li> but my 3 year old won&#x27;t let me run any other brush or comb through her hair.</li>
            <li> I had not brushed my hair for a long time and decided to deep condition</li>
            <li> This brush did a pretty good job with some of the worst tangles</li>
            <li> i really like how it fits ergonomically in my hands and makes brushing out my long hair easier with less tangling!</li>
            <li> so I am not sure what really will work.</li>
            <li> was easier to untangle my daughters long hair than with  a standard hair brush.</li>
            <li> Works well on my daughter&#x27;s long hair--it is no longer a fight to get it brushed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does this (according to the product info, the different , varying lengths of the teeth are one way it works) , but I am SOLD, and will be holding on to this brush for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, fine and thinning hair due to my meds and usually loose at least a handful of hair every time I have comb or brush my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and the brush went through it easily, even when wet!</li>
            <li> And when I use it on dry hair, less hair than with a normal brush does fall out, so this is also a plus.</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost 3 years old and has definetly inherited my hair and she never ever complains when we use this brush on her hair (&amp; she has hair down to her waist)</li>
            <li> I have a 4 year old with hair down to her butt.</li>
            <li> I often have a hard time getting my long hair brushed out, especially after a windy day or too much hair spray.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with extra long hair!</li>
            <li> The only question they had is why only pink.</li>
            <li> Works well, only draw back is the handle is hollow</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was going to be awkward using because of the shape of the whole brush and</li>
            <li> I got thi for my girl who wanted to brush her long hairs but didn&#x27;t like to undo the tangles.</li>
            <li> I also ordered several Wet Brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my firlfriend who has long hair</li>
            <li> have long hair that tangles easily,and this brush just glided thru them tangles ,without ripping and pulling my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my young niece whose curls always get tangled and messy.</li>
            <li> This brush did nothing for my daughters hip long hair.</li>
            <li> As a child I had long stringy hair</li>
            <li> This brush detangles my hair effortlessly, especially when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this as well and his only wish is that it wasn&#x27;t in pink.</li>
            <li> Having long hair to my waist, my hair often gets knotted and tangled.</li>
            <li> My daughters all have long hair.  </li>
            <li> Have thick hair and this is much easier and kinder to my scalp -  </li>
            <li> I mean, really, 15 bucks for a hairbrush??</li>
            <li> I have long dry hair.</li>
            <li> And now I am here writing a 5-star review for an expensive (but worth it!)</li>
            <li> Other brushes only went through my hair one layer at a time.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star the handle/design of the brush was a little different to me and took some getting use</li>
            <li> It is much different than any other brush I have used</li>
            <li> BUT - there is definitely no more crying involved and it is much much easier compared to a regular comb.</li>
            <li> At first brush, it did hurt a little (I&#x27;m not sure why)</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m taking one star due to the short handle on the brush.</li>
            <li> that I haven&#x27;t even had to use any detangler spray, whereas before with other brushes I was regularly using detangling</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, losing my hair due to lillness, plus have very expensive sensitive extensions.</li>
            <li> her hair is very long</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY LONG HIP LENGTH HAIR .</li>
            <li> can use it on her dry washed-the-night- before hair.</li>
            <li> If hair becomes dry and tangle, it will talk a while to untangle hair.</li>
            <li> I only use a wide tooth comb on my wet</li>
            <li> My daughter has super thick hair &amp; usually has to use a ton of detangling spray on her hair &amp; still struggles with brushing it.</li>
            <li> She never cried and complained this much with any other brush I used before.</li>
            <li> It would work for small hands as well as adult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting my granddaughter one because she uses a brush on her wet long hair.  </li>
            <li> This hair brush is really amazing, I shed like crazy and this hair brush has minimized the loss of hair that usually occurs when I brush through my long hair wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> This brush is a miracle, you can use it on wet or dry hair and it does not pull at all, I bought one for me, one for my granddaughter and others for Christmas presents to all the girls in the family.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I get less shedding</li>
            <li> is it doesn&#x27;t tug at the hair, which means there is less hair loss than with a traditional brush.  </li>
            <li> With a typical brush, cleaning out the hair I lost is such a pain.</li>
            <li> We can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the black one for my baby boy and my wee lad loves it same as his twin sister.</li>
            <li> This works on wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> Daughters hair is almost impossible to keep brushed and tangle free.</li>
            <li> This brush gets through my knots in half the time I usually take with a normal brush without pulling out tons of hairs or hurting me.</li>
            <li> Previously I had received the pink brush as a gift from the seller when I purchased the boar bristle brush of the same brand.</li>
            <li> I have spent the past 10 years using a wide toothed comb &amp; different types of hair conditioners/detanglers and ONLY bought this brush because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I was curious how it worked, and ran it through my thick, long, permed hair, and while it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a pick does for me, it was not at all painful, which was surprising to me.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, the brush gently removes tangles with little or no hair loss.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my wet hair &amp; my daughter</li>
            <li> It is pink and  has designs on it.</li>
            <li> I have babyfine hair and always used a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> The wet brush blows this brush away as a detangler brush.  </li>
            <li> HELPS WHEN HAIR IS WET</li>
            <li> This brush is not what i expected.</li>
            <li> I have both wet brush and this brush.</li>
            <li> have to admit that I do not use it in wet hair....</li>
            <li> I never dared use any type of hairbrish on my wet hair either.</li>
            <li> So when my hairdresser told me about this pink detangling brush she found online, I had to try it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thus I purchased pink one for her and ever since then</li>
            <li> I have been relaxing it since the age of 12 and would never dream of going natural even if the chemicals are slowly killing me.  </li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair that comes to my waist</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very long (small of my back), very wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my bottom, so it&#x27;s about 3 1/2-4 feet long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plain and simply nappy.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because this brush is a different style than traditional paddle type brushes I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> They either pull my hair, or are not strong enough to go through my hair due to the length and thickness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about new products, because I never notice a difference, but I actually did notice a difference using this brush.</li>
            <li> I am left with very little hair in the brush afterwards.  </li>
            <li> and he said what some other reviewers said about the bristles scratching his scalp.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to go back and re-brush the back...usually pulling her hair due to knots.</li>
            <li> Even works on wet, lightened hair!  </li>
            <li> and she had a problem with other brushes they would pull her hair out of her head</li>
            <li> It just worked like any other brush for me.</li>
            <li> The bristles do not hurt you like in other brushes.</li>
            <li> I already ordered another one for one of my other kids.</li>
            <li> The other Vizeri Beauty products pictured still get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other brush now</li>
            <li> but this is a total sham!</li>
            <li> The bristles are sharp.</li>
            <li> So I would have to wash it or be lazy and just throw it back up.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t run in the other direction when I bring this brush out.</li>
            <li> and she prefers this brush over the other 3 detangling brushes we have.</li>
            <li> To my amazement, it doesn&#x27;t rip out strands of hair like other detangling brushes.</li>
            <li> but I will be the first to admit I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this one hoping it would be easier to hold than the other detangling brush we have that has no handle.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s any easier to hold than our other brush.  </li>
            <li> since this was not fixed, it was a wasted purchase for us.</li>
            <li> The only qualm I have is that the bristles are a little too harsh on my scalp.</li>
            <li> When I go to brush the hair I am always frustrated that it never gets knots out easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to function differently from an ordinary brush and for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair, it definitely doesn&#x27;t get all the tangles out.</li>
            <li> Definitely detangles well, and there is a lot less hair left behind on this brush compared to my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Compared to other brushes there is less hair in this brush than the other ones.</li>
            <li> Let me start off saying that FINALLY I have a brush that helps with my long thick hair!</li>
            <li> The bristles themselves are a little rough, but it works wonders on the tangles.</li>
            <li> hard to hold handle to short</li>
            <li> The others I&#x27;ve bought were not worth the money/hassle.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the brushes shape.</li>
            <li> Not worth $15.</li>
            <li> And I have to still use my regular brush at times because my hair is so thick I still can&#x27;t get this one through it all the way.</li>
            <li> I laid the brush down &amp;</li>
            <li> I get home and take my hair down and it looks like a rats nest.</li>
            <li> She uses it every day and has even demonstrated on other people showing them how well it works!</li>
            <li> The only thing that would help me would be a slightly thinner, longer handle, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers and this is truly a miracle in a box!!!</li>
            <li> I had hoped less would fall out than does, however.</li>
            <li> When I detangle my hair in the shower, there is less hair in the brush</li>
            <li> She is 7 and hates brushing a lot less using this brush.</li>
            <li> I did notice a bit less hair loss, also.</li>
            <li> My hair is ultra fine and tangles like crazy!</li>
            <li> I have a lot less hair in my brush also.</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a day and my hair seems to be less tangled with each use.</li>
            <li> There was no painfull pulling of my hair like before and it took less time for me to brush because I had an easier time getting through my tangled hair.</li>
            <li> It cuts time in half making mornings easier</li>
            <li> I would even suggest that they make this brush in black too, since curly hair runs in my family and I will be using it on my sons</li>
            <li> We both have very thick, long, and slightly wavy hair, and it had gotten to the point that she would not let me brush her hair, she could not do a thorough job, and when I would finally pin her down to do the brushing with her old brush, she would be in pain, crying and so angry with me.  </li>
            <li> Trying to get through the tangled mess that I call my hair has been a life-long battle.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and brushing my hair has always been a pain in the rear.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thick long hair</li>
            <li> This usually resulted in less crying, but not much.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anybody who has a hard time detangling their hair!</li>
            <li> She has very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have VERY long almost waist length hair that is INCREDIBLY thick as well.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well in my daughters long thick hair!</li>
            <li> a little shine gloss can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Me and my little girl</li>
            <li> I use this on my little girl also and she does not cry anymore while trying to get her tangles out.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem extremely sturdy; it&#x27;s fairly small and plastic, but that has its advantages.</li>
            <li> It usually takes us about 10 minutes to brush her hair with other detangling brushes.</li>
            <li> I have extremly thin and thinning hair and it tangles all the time I have to deal with a matted mess in the back under par of my hair</li>
            <li> The handle is too short and the brush itself is tough on my hair, pulls it out.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy any other brush!!</li>
            <li> I thought it might help a little, but really did not expect it to get through my morning hair (uncombed and crazy tangled from sleep) without washing it</li>
            <li> My scalp and hair can sometimes feel very sensitive and painful due to health problems which can make tangled hair even harder to deal with.</li>
            <li> So now everyday that she picks it up to use it</li>
            <li> No matter what, she will start crying and/or yell that it&#x27;s hurting.</li>
            <li> I was wrong and pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> but and it is a struggle to brush her hair everyday.</li>
            <li> With this brush we are done in a few minutes and no tears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but I am assuming it&#x27;s because of the staggered bristles, so there is less pulling on hair, so none get accidentally pulled out.</li>
            <li> This brush has cut that time in half!</li>
            <li> I am still working the tight knots out of my hair with very little loss.</li>
            <li> My other daughter and myself have thick hair which can be a handful at time.</li>
            <li> I had a horrendous mess from being unable to tend my very long hair due to illness.</li>
            <li> My 5 year-old daughter hates having her hair brushed and has a lot of dramatic reactions when I try to get out tangles or knots after a bath or in the mornings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not really easy to use to style your hair though, if I just need to brush my hair, I can use this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> old daughter who has fine thin hair that tangles horribly.</li>

            <li> I have long thin hair.</li>
            <li> She complained it hurt when I tried to brush her hair with this brush, which is also very hard to hold because of the short handle.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little uncomfortable, there isn&#x27;t enough of it to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> My hair does still occasionally get very bad tangles that I have to gently work through with my fingers before using the brush</li>
            <li> They usually complain when I comb out their hair but as soon as I tried it on my toddler</li>
            <li> No more pain while detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is the &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; technology or massaging effect of this brush.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use Pik to get thru my hair.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years, I have been using a bamboo handle brush.  </li>
            <li> Usually I buy a brush and the bristles break off and pop off and get stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> However some of my hair overtime due to poor hairbrushes became too matted and will just have to be cut out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not nearly as happy with this brush as some of the other buyers.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair and is difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this brush because it has an odd shape and plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li> It worked but the hard plastic sometimes hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to hold and handle.</li>
            <li> If you have tangles and have a hard time with it my wife wholeheartedly endorses this brush.</li>
            <li> I have delicate, fine (evil) hair..)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was amazed at how well it brushed out the crazy knots my hair can get into.</li>

            <li> I have thick, curly, waist length hair...</li>
            <li> Brushing my hair with this brush feels like a massage, no more prickly brush bristles for me!.</li>
            <li> cringe no more!</li>
            <li> No more screaming!</li>
            <li> I always struggle to get my hair de-tangled after shampooing and usually always wind up with a ton of broken strands in my comb when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously, when it arrive I thought what is this piece of  &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;  about-</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and hate the tugging feeling</li>
            <li> I have been having to wash my hair every day, which is actually not good for it.</li>

            <li> Stiff at the base and a little bendy at the end.</li>
            <li> I am an idiot for not trying something like this a LONG time ago!</li>
            <li> She is usually frustrated and crying by the time we are done.</li>

            <li> My hair is too thicker and the brush is too weak!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works great on my granddaughter&#x27;s long curly locks when they are wet or  dry.  It is easy to grip and the bristles are great.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic style of the brush makes it easy to hold as you brush your hair. The brush glides through my just washed hair leaving it quite smooth and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it great for my below shoulder length hair, but it is a perfect brush for my Golden Retriever dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s another market for you.</li>
            <li> I got thi for my girl who wanted to brush her long hairs but didn&#x27;t like to undo the tangles. I saw this and ordered it and we both like it. Just right for her lil hands.</li>
            <li> What a great brush! I can use it on my wet hair &amp; my daughter can use it on her dry washed-the-night- before hair. Happy I made the purchase. Worth it!</li>
            <li> So I have 3 daughters, two of which are old enough to tell me they detest having their hair brushed. I let them work at it themselves first, and then I finish up, brushing out the snarls they couldn&#x27;t get. This usually resulted in less crying, but not much. Somehow I stumbled across this hairbrush while looking for something else on Amazon. At first I was astounded at the price. I mean, really, 15 bucks for a hairbrush?? But then I read the reviews and decided that if it really eliminated the wailing and gnashing of teeth we experience at our house over brushing our hair, it would be worth every penny. So I ordered it.  And now I am here writing a 5-star review for an expensive (but worth it!) hairbrush. There has been no crying since it was delivered. My girls get up and brush their hair without being asked!  They actually ask me to brush their hair sometimes just because it feels good. I, myself, am astounded at how well it works on my own hair. I do not understand why it works better than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hairbrushes, but it absolutely does, and there is less hair to clean out afterward.  I even told a friend of mine about it and she is excited to order one herself, because she has the same struggles with her daughter&#x27;s hair.  UPDATE: I now own three of these, 2 pink and 1 black.  I bought the first one (as reviewed above) and the company contacted me to offer a free brush in exchange for an honest review (and now a free brush for adding a photo).  We still love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait awhile before writing my review, as some people have said it destroyed their hair after using it.  I really do love this brush! After over a month, it has been great on my hair and I have a lot to brush.  You do have to brush it in sections from the bottom first like you are supposed to but it really does work well on both wet and dry hair.  I have very long straight to wavy hair and it works really well for detangling and shine.  Sometimes it does make it frizzy, but it&#x27;s nothing a little shine gloss can&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;ve also tried the Goody version of this brush, but the shape of the Vizeri brush is easier to use and more effective!  One of my favorite new products!</li>
            <li> Easy to hold. Easy to use. Just wish it was curved.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, wavy hair. Having invested in the NIOXIN hair care system to prevent further hair loss, I figured a special comb or brush that detangles without snagging hair was also worth a small investment. This brush feels wonderful on the scalp, but the fact is, when fine, thin hair is tangled after a shower, hair will fall come out. With this brush, far less comes than would with a normal brush, which is good. And when I use it on dry hair, less hair than with a normal brush does fall out, so this is also a plus. (A wide-toothed comb is better in this regard, but fails to comb hair as thoroughly as a brush.) I had hoped less would fall out than does, however. Perhaps my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> Kids request this brush over others.</li>
            <li> I didnt think this would work....but it does!!! Amazing! When I detangle my hair in the shower, there is less hair in the brush and I think its also faster to detangle my hair. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I wanted it for both my kids and myself. I have sort or wavy hair and my kids have really curly hair. They usually complain when I comb out their hair but as soon as I tried it on my toddler I knew it was a success when he asked to do it himself. Thank you !</li>
            <li> I bought it for my granddaughters. If you could see the happiness and the joy brushing their hair without any pain you will know that we need more then 5 STARS to rate it. The only question they had is why only pink.</li>
            <li> This brush reminds me of the Hair Bean I bought my daughter. This time I picked this one up for myself because its larger and it looks sleek but yet girly like. Of course my daughter and I can share . When I brushed my hair it gave me a nice scalp massage feeling. It left my hair smooth and soft and tangle free. I really do like this brush and it will make a little girl or a big girl like myself happy because of the color almost like a Barbie doll brush but real for Human hair.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical. Despite a gazillion reviews about this brush, I noticed that most of the reviewers either didn&#x27;t have my hair type or didn&#x27;t mention what hair type they have.  I am mixed, but God forgot to give me mixed hair.  It&#x27;s plain and simply nappy.  My mom had it cut off into a boy cut when I was about 5 or 6 because she just couldn&#x27;t handle it.  Traumatic!  I have been relaxing it since the age of 12 and would never dream of going natural even if the chemicals are slowly killing me.  I was convinced that if there was something that was able to get through my tangled mess - wet or dry, I would have discovered it by now. How wrong can you be? This is one of the most incredible inventions out there, and yet it is a simple brush.  I was hesitant to spend this much on a brush, but it is more than worth it. Wish I had this years ago! What&#x27;s funny is that I let a friend with smoother, thinner hair try it and he said what some other reviewers said about the bristles scratching his scalp.  I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing because I can&#x27;t even feel the bristles touch my scalp in the middle of my head where my hair is thickest! The only thing that would help me would be a slightly thinner, longer handle, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers and this is truly a miracle in a box!!!</li>
            <li> love this brush it is easy to use feels great simply love it</li>
            <li> I have never seen a brush like this so I was hesitant. I have long thick hair and brushing my hair has always been a pain in the rear. This helps instantly detangle my hair. It is also super cute! It is pink and  has designs on it. This also works great on my step daughter, she is 3 and gets fussy while I&#x27;m brushing her hair. This brush makes it hassle free.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my daughter who has curly but fine hair. She really loves it and can use it wet or dry. It was delivered very promptly with excellent follow up customer service. My daughter finds it incredibly easy and pain free to use the brush.</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter &#x27;s long hair and my medium length hair too.  I was skeptical but my daughter likes it better than the electric detangler we have.  It made a great Christmas present for both of us.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. I can finally brush the tangles from my hair after washing it without pain.</li>
            <li> my 11 year old, with waist length hair, used it for the first time last night and with wet hair, it took less than 10 minutes!  normally we struggle with a comb for close to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the brush for my daughter. She has very long, thick hair. She absolutely loves it!!!  She&#x27;s 8 years old and insists on fixing her own hair. I usually have to go back and re-brush the back...usually pulling her hair due to knots. Since she started using this awesome new brush, I hadn&#x27;t had to touch it AND her hair is extremely soft. She&#x27;s constantly making me feel how soft her hair is now.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I love it because it has longer bristles for my curly and somewhat course hair. I also like the longer handle and bigger brush space.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vizeri Detangling Brush for over two weeks now and I love it!!!! I have very thick red hair that is turning gray ( wirery hairs) and this brush goes through my hair quickly and easily. Other brushes only went through my hair one layer at a time. The only other brush that worked was one I got from Avon many years ago with hard plastic tines. It worked but the hard plastic sometimes hurt my scalp. Now the Vizeri Brush works better and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> Works perfect couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with brushing and combing my mid-back length extremely thick, curly hair. I could not believe how easily this brush detangled my hair without excessive hair loss or any discomfort! It stimulates the scalp and leaves my hair looking healther and smoother. I am so grateful I took a chance and ordered this brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush for tangles.  Works great on my 2 year olds curly hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  We have had this product for about a week now. I have not received any complaints from baby girl.  She has straight hair but curly underneath which is a recipe for lots of knots. This product has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm...daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Really it is more like a 4 1/2 stars.  Me and my little girl Ioves this brush.  I don&#x27;t have to fight her to brush her hair or let me brush her tender head anymore.  Very quick shipping and nice packaging.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star the handle/design of the brush was a little different to me and took some getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this brush for $1 to give a my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I only just received the item, but I expect my daughter will love it.  I&#x27;m hoping it will be good with her thick hair</li>
            <li> brilliant - just right for my granddaughter!!</li>
            <li> Useless! My hair is too thicker and the brush is too weak!</li>
            <li> I have babyfine hair and always used a wide tooth comb. I really like this brush ! It&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Does everything as said by the seller, plus the really cute design. My 2 y/o daughter can use it easily.</li>
            <li> I also ordered several Wet Brushes.  The wet brush blows this brush away as a detangler brush.  I would not recommend it or purchase another one.  I have fine hair and it was not very effective at removing tangles without pain.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase for my daughter&#x27;s waist-long hair.  Gets the knots out better than other de-knotting brushes we&#x27;ve tried. The handle makes it much easier to handle than some similar products (i.e. knot genie). This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life?! I have really long, thin hair and it gets tangled easily. Every day, I&#x27;d have to get a comb and untangle my hair from the bottom up, but that&#x27;s not the case with this brush. I can brush from my hair from the scalp down to the ends and the brush goes through smoothly. I&#x27;m amazed.    Edit:  After having used the brush for a little while now, I&#x27;ll admit that there are times when I&#x27;ll have to brush my hair out from the bottom and work my way up because my hair is really tangled up. Still, overall, I&#x27;m happy with the brush because I can use it when my hair&#x27;s wet or dry and it doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair the way many other combs and brushes do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the brush so far. My hair is much more manageable, and I think it will make my hair healthier in the long run by not breaking it just by brushing it.  I&#x27;m always skeptical about new products, because I never notice a difference, but I actually did notice a difference using this brush. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to a regular brush again.</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING!! Very pleased with my purchase. Thank you for designing such a wonderful product! No more pain while detangling my hair. Will definitely recommend it to my friends, and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> was easier to untangle my daughters long hair than with  a standard hair brush.</li>
            <li> love this brush because i can use on wet hair with little or no breakage....</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this brush. I think the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush or knockoffs work better. It doesn&#x27;t seem to untangle any better then other brushes. Maybe it is the shape because I prefer traditional shaped brushes.. they seem to give me better control. Don&#x27;t get one of these brushes for more then a couple of $$!</li>
            <li> I decided to try one of these brushes I see so often talked about online - And I am honestly impressed! This brush is a bit bigger than I expected from the picture shown, however it feels awesome when I brush my hair, and it really does &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> First I ordered one of your brushes for a fragile poodle mix.  Perfect for her.  Then I ordered one for myself and I love it.  So now I&#x27;m about to order one for my sister.  We&#x27;re curly girls and most regular brushes rip our hair out.  This one is the answer to a hair prayer.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little short, but overall it works very well on my daughter&#x27;s super curly and tangled hair.  She even grabbed the brush and wanted to use it herself.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my firlfriend who has long hair and I was amazed how well it de-tangles her hair.</li>
            <li> HELPS WHEN HAIR IS WET BUT NOT SO MUCH WHEN DRY</li>
            <li> It works pretty good. It still pulls some of my hair but not a lot. And I have to still use my regular brush at times because my hair is so thick I still can&#x27;t get this one through it all the way.</li>
            <li> Great brush for younger girls hair.  ( I have two !) So wish I bought one of these years ago to save MANY struggles over snagging hair !!  Works as well as it says.</li>
            <li> Even works on wet, lightened hair!  Love this one!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It does not pull out my hair.Glides smoothly through my hair. The bristles are not hard but not too soft either. Brushing my hair with this brush feels like a massage, no more prickly brush bristles for me!. I really like the shape of the brush too. I like the short handle.The brushes are pretty too and caught my eye when I was shopping for a new brush. I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and I seem to have tangles that are impossible to get rid of. This brush did a pretty good job with some of the worst tangles and I&#x27;m very pleased. However some of my hair overtime due to poor hairbrushes became too matted and will just have to be cut out. For me bore brushes have always been too soft. They control frizz, and make my hair shine on the surface but lack any kind of pull so that overtime my hair will get out of control. With most plastic and nylon brushes I am either breaking to much of my hair or causing myself pain while obtaining mixed results.  With that said,  this brush does a very nice job at keeping my hair under control and giving it that beautiful luster. It has just the right amount of rigidity to pull at those tangles, but it also knows when to give so as to keep these locks in gorgeous harmony. So if you like me are seeking a good quality hairbrush, possibly look at this one.  I can&#x27;t guarantee you will have good results like mine because everyone has different hair, but for the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> hard to hold handle to short</li>
            <li> I *love* my new brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Ragdoll cat loves the one I got for him too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Cute, small, light weight, and does its job!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this brush.  I have colored hair and this brusht untangles it without damage.  Cleans easily and no sharp points.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the brush. Have thick hair and this is much easier and kinder to my scalp -  using a comb to take out knots is painful.  It was a happy accident that I came upon your site.</li>
            <li> This works. I don&#x27;t know why or how it works but my 3 year old won&#x27;t let me run any other brush or comb through her hair. She even hates having her hair washed or really even just touched. This brush is magic in that she actually lets me use it on her.</li>
            <li> Finally a brush my grand daughter will use with out complaining.</li>
            <li> My daughter says the brush works great on my granddaughters long hair.  it works great</li>
            <li> This brush is not what i expected. It&#x27;s hard to hold and handle. We dont even use it.</li>
            <li> Like the product. Use it often.</li>
            <li> I only had the chance to use this the first few times but it’s good</li>
            <li> I would like it better if the handle was longer.</li>
            <li> Pretty averagely good.  It&#x27;s a little hard to tell how good it would be unless you have really thick hair, but it appears to work OK if you have average hari.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST detangling brush I ever purchased.  My granddaughter has fine long hair that tangles easily and she cried every time we try to brush it.  This brush is a miracle, you can use it on wet or dry hair and it does not pull at all, I bought one for me, one for my granddaughter and others for Christmas presents to all the girls in the family.  I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter and she said it didn&#x27;t work! Who knows for sure she is very tender headed so I am not sure what really will work. I did try to brush her hair with it and I didn&#x27;t find it easy to use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with extra long hair!</li>
            <li> This is another fine product.  This helps to enhance the effects of the comb.  By brushing the hair the hair stays vibrant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush, suitable for damp/dry hair not right after washing your hair. I wish they had wooden-brush version which would look a lot nicer than the plastic one.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tangles easily. I have spent the past 10 years using a wide toothed comb &amp; different types of hair conditioners/detanglers and ONLY bought this brush because of the reviews. I did not have high hopes, but I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised. I purchased this brush 8 months ago and it&#x27;s the only thing I use now. My hair does still occasionally get very bad tangles that I have to gently work through with my fingers before using the brush but I never use any type of detangling  spray anymore and it has no problem getting out 99% of my tangles. My daughter is almost 3 years old and has definetly inherited my hair and she never ever complains when we use this brush on her hair (&amp; she has hair down to her waist), I am so pleased with this brush I am purchasing a second one today.</li>
            <li> does not help our 5 year olds tangles at all. just works like a simple brush in my opinion. still searching for our detangling brush!!</li>
            <li> Works great, but would be better for my girls if the bristles were longer and thicker for very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing hair extensions for years (currently wearing tape in ones now). While browsing various hair extension websites I came across this type of brush... Since this brush had good reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a try (ordered it a month ago). Hair extensions tend to knot and shed more than regular hair - Using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair brushes pulls at the knots which causes even more shedding/pulls at the scalp which can cause bald spots, etc. Even though I still have to hold my hair at my scalp (to prevent the hair extension from being pulled out - ripping my hair out with it. I have delicate, fine (evil) hair..) this brush works a hell of a lot better than any &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush I&#x27;ve used. Not only do I get less shedding but the brush really does work through the knots better... Nothing is perfect but this brush is a great improvement and I am super happy I purchased it! I wish there was a travel size so I could bring it along in a clutch (for events/going out).</li>
            <li> Exactly as I ordered. Love this product &amp; really has helped my hair &amp; does exactly as described. Plus they sent extra information to my e-mail which was very nice!</li>
            <li> Very good for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this hair brush.  It is comfortable to hold.  It works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 yr. old daughter who has fine thin hair that tangles horribly. We&#x27;ve tried several other de tangling brushes and haven&#x27;t been impressed. My daughter tried this one and loved it! She uses it every day and has even demonstrated on other people showing them how well it works!</li>
            <li> It is much different than any other brush I have used however I think it will be better for my hair.  My hair is very thick and the brush went through it easily, even when wet!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have very thick long hair and this brush makes getting the tangles out very easy. I think it&#x27;s well made a very nice looking as well.    *I got this brush at a highly disconted price however this does not affect my review in any way*</li>
            <li> This is literally the only brush that has ever worked for me. I cant believe that i was skeptical! Perfect for wet hair or dry hair or any textured hair. I will never buy any other brush!!</li>
            <li> It works really slow, but definitely painless, which is huge for my 3 year old and 9 month old. I am very impressed and happy to find something that works :-)</li>
            <li> This brush works great!  My 6 year old hates getting her hair brushed. She actually enjoyed brushing her hair with this brush. The knots disappeared instantly.</li>
            <li> Works well, only draw back is the handle is hollow so it makes a lot of noise.  My daughter is autistic so at first she didnt like it because she equates the noise with her hair being pulled.  She is better with it after a couple of weeks.  I might shoot some spray foam insulation in the handle to deaden it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my grand daughter with shoulder length, somewhat Curley hair. She actually let me brush her hair several times a day. After the third day, older sister and mom were caught using the brush every day. Yep, it works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to function differently from an ordinary brush and for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair, it definitely doesn&#x27;t get all the tangles out.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair brush because my hair was dry, full of tangles and my large amounts of hair would get pulled out whenever I used other wide-tooth combs and brushes to groom my hair.  I was desperate so I decided to give this product a try.  I tried this item and I am happy to say that it is a great product.  I helps gently remove tangles.  My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and tangle free!  I would highly recommend this product.  The delivery was also very fast.  If you are interested in buying a detangling brush, buy this item without hesitation.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great brush. I have knotty curly hair, and this brush helps detangle. Great grip, love it</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my daughter as a birthday gift she absolutely loves it her hair is very long and she had a problem with other brushes they would pull her hair out of her head this brush goes through her hair with no problem. Also it is a very pretty color and fits nicely in her hand😀</li>
            <li> A decent quality brush. The only qualm I have is that the bristles are a little too harsh on my scalp. I like the tiered concept of the brush though as it makes it simpler and more effective detangling my long hair. I got this brush during a promotion so I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.Love the handle .I have long hair that tangles easily,and this brush just glided thru them tangles ,without ripping and pulling my hair. best brush I ever used</li>
            <li> This brush is great. I bought it for my young niece whose curls always get tangled and messy. It works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It makes it easy to untangle my thick, curly hair with no pain.</li>
            <li> I had a horrendous mess from being unable to tend my very long hair due to illness. I saw this Viseri brush and ordered it and it is what has saved my hair. I am still working the tight knots out of my hair with very little loss. I would have had to have, at the very least, my hair layered and cut. The design is perfect ergonomics to the shape of my hand. Thank you, Viseri! I also purchased the Argan shampoo and conditioner. But that is another miraculous story!</li>
            <li> This is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> pretty happy with this brush! i really like how it fits ergonomically in my hands and makes brushing out my long hair easier with less tangling! this is a great buy for long hair and children!</li>
            <li> This brush is really cute. It feels great on my scalp too. I&#x27;m VERY tender headed, but this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I immediately threw my old brush out!</li>
            <li> Great brush!!! My daughter tried it also, and asked why didn&#x27;t I buy her one... Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honest here. This brush did nothing for my daughters hip long hair. She complained it hurt when I tried to brush her hair with this brush, which is also very hard to hold because of the short handle. She never cried and complained this much with any other brush I used before. It did not work for her hair, but it was fine for my fine, shoulder length hair. It just worked like any other brush for me. Nothing special, but it did definitely not work on my daughters long and tangled hair at all.</li>
            <li> Great detangling brush. It is cute and good size to keep in the hand bag or travel with it. Since I bought this brush, it has became my daughter&#x27;s favorite brush. It is doing its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter is a young mom and she lives in PA.  I wanted to get her something really special because if \\&quot;Gram\\&quot; gives her money she usually makes sure that everyone gets something and before you know it her Christmas Gift is gone.  So Grandma&#x27;s I had a brilliant idea.  I called PA and scheduled a Hair Cut and Color apt for her.  Then I scoured AMAZON for the BEST HAIR BRUSH so she could have something to open on Christmas.  The reviews were brilliant not a negative one to the bunch.  Sure enough the brush was there when she got home from her successful HAIR APPOINTMENT.  SHE LOVES IT!  SHE HAS BOUGHT MANY BRUSHES BUT COULDN&#x27;T GET OVER THE MAGIC OF VISERI So now everyday that she picks it up to use it she smiles and thinks of me, her Gram.  I just bought another one for my daughter...I am a total fan!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best hair brush I have ever used. I have had problems for years and this brush really works!</li>
            <li> My wife has extremely long hair and no matter how much she brushed through it she could never seem to get it completely detangled. When at the hair salon she noted the stylist using an unusual brush and when done her hair had never been so smooth and tangle free. When she got home she went on Amazon and found the brush that the stylist was using and ordered it. Sure enough this is the same brush and since using it my wife no longer complains about tangled hair. If you have tangles and have a hard time with it my wife wholeheartedly endorses this brush. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle. Great on the hair, gentle. Feels great on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Definitely detangles well, and there is a lot less hair left behind on this brush compared to my other brushes. The shape is a bit odd, and I&#x27;m still trying to figure out where best to hold the brush for the greatest comfort. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, just different.</li>
            <li> The brush is great de-tangling my hair when it is wet.  I have a lot of very fine hair past my shoulders and it is quite tangled when I get out of the shower.  The only complaint would be that it needs a better handle that is easier to grip.</li>
            <li> Bought this amazing brush for my grand daughter who has long thick hair. It definitely makes brushing her hair easier and faster. She is 7 and hates brushing a lot less using this brush. Works best on dry hair for her.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like MAGIC as the description. I still have to gently work the brush through LO&#x27;s hair - BUT - there is definitely no more crying involved and it is much much easier compared to a regular comb.</li>
            <li> I have not had the pleasure of using this brush yet, but if it will help my hair I am all for it.  I have been using Vizeri shampoo and conditioner for about 2 weeks now and I never thought my hair could be this full or soft.  I love the products.</li>
            <li> We did receive our order and the brush is an excellent choice for my daughter&#x27;s tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of ordering more as favors for her birthday party.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the claims of this brush being the best.  I&#x27;ve been a user of a Kent bristle brush for years so when I received an offer for this I thought why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the brush is unusual but it fits nicely in the hand.  The bristles I thought would cause static but believe it or not it doesn&#x27;t.  My hair is easy to manage now thanks to their shampoo and conditioner.  (My hair has improved in appearance too since switching).  This brush works through the hair easily and I don&#x27;t have as many knots and the best thing is it doesn&#x27;t tug at the hair, which means there is less hair loss than with a traditional brush.  The bristles are at different heights so I&#x27;m guessing this has something with the way it works through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush.  It&#x27;s easy to use wet or dry hair.  I have a very sensitive scalp and hate the tugging feeling you get when trying to work a brush through, but there is none of that.  Goodbye Mr Kent Brush I had a great relationship with you over the years, unfortunately our time has come to an end and I have found a better brush for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, invest in this nifty brush, it&#x27;s worth it and you won&#x27;t regret it either.  Your hair deserves it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very well made!!</li>
            <li> This bush works so well that i bought one for my granddaughter. So i would recommed it. It bushes through as they avertize and it stimulates and makes your scalp feel so good. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, or brake your ends.  I would recommend it to anyone man or woman it so nice.</li>
            <li> this brush did not work on my daughters hair at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not nearly as happy with this brush as some of the other buyers. It doesn&#x27;t work as I was expecting. I actually purchased a $5 comb from Great Clips used to help detangle and that works much much better.</li>
            <li> I have both wet brush and this brush. I like them all however this one only works great if the hair is wet. If hair becomes dry and tangle, it will talk a while to untangle hair. The good part of this brush is it is easy to hold and carry.</li>
            <li> My 5 year-old daughter hates having her hair brushed and has a lot of dramatic reactions when I try to get out tangles or knots after a bath or in the mornings. I&#x27;ve used brushes, combs, and picks and have let her try to do it with each. We&#x27;ve used leave-in and rinse-out conditioners, as well as detangling sprays. No matter what, she will start crying and/or yell that it&#x27;s hurting. She must have the world&#x27;s most tender scalp; her hair isn&#x27;t all that thick or long, so I don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;We saw a commercial for this product and, while she was thrilled at the promise that it would never hurt to use, I was skeptical. I decided to give it a try. My daughter loves brushing her own hair now and does it twice a day. She swears it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and is very excited to own this brush. I guess it works!</li>
            <li> Works extremely well in my daughters long thick hair! No more whining from her!! Light weight and easy for her to use as well! thanks!</li>
            <li> Great little brush--smooths out hair nicely.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush. At first brush, it did hurt a little (I&#x27;m not sure why) but afterwards when I tried it a second time, it worked well, and didn&#x27;t hurt. The brush is awesomely designed and I will be using this for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush I usually have to fight with my daughters to bruth their hair but this has made doing hair so much more easy and less time consuming for me</li>
            <li> This hair brush is really amazing, I shed like crazy and this hair brush has minimized the loss of hair that usually occurs when I brush through my long hair wet or dry.  It fits in my hand perfectly and is easy to clean.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I must say this is one of the best purchases I have made for my kids and myself. One of my daughters have very thin hair but it tangles like crazy. This brush went right through it without us fighting or her screaming. My other daughter and myself have thick hair which can be a handful at time. This brush also was able to handle the mane of hair and get the tangles out. It worked perfectly when brushing my hair to get it up in a pony tail too. Normally I get bunches when I use a brush for that...I love this brush and will be buying more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes. All reviews are 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush. Seriously. I have very thick, very long (small of my back), very wavy hair. My hair is impossible. Brushing it always hurts no matter what conditioner, oils, whatever I use in it. I opened this brush and used it as soon as I got it. It glides right through my hair. On top of that, the bristles feel amazing on my scalp. I&#x27;m not even ashamed to admit I brushed my hair for ten minutes, going over my scalp a million times because it felt wonderful. Like someone was massaging my head. Best part is, the brush is easy to clean. With a typical brush, cleaning out the hair I lost is such a pain. The hair just comes right out of this brush. I did notice a bit less hair loss, also. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I am assuming it&#x27;s because of the staggered bristles, so there is less pulling on hair, so none get accidentally pulled out.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! I have medium length hair but I&#x27;m always having to use tons of conditioner just to be able to brush my hair out! Not any more! This brush is aMaZiNg!!! The bristles are soft and glide through my hair! Perfect for little girls who feel like its torture to get their hair brushed! Must try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really do like this brush.  It makes my scalp tingle and I believe that is increasing the circulation.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I do not use it in wet hair....I only use a wide tooth comb on my wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;But on my hair, especially in the morning when first brushing, it works great on detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My two 11 year olds and 9 year old daughters,and even my 7 year old son love it! It is so easy to brush their hair! My daughter has long hair and it is prone to getting tangled, but it is very easy to detangle her hair with this comb! And the brush also makes your hair beautiful and silky:)  The shape helps you to gently maneuver through your hair. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who has a hard time detangling their hair! The bristles do not hurt you like in other brushes. There are no words to describe how wonderful this comb is! Now I can easily brush my daughter&#x27;s hair without getting screams! Thanks so much Vizeri Beauty!</li>
            <li> Works well on my daughter&#x27;s long hair--it is no longer a fight to get it brushed.</li>
            <li> This is my first detangler ever and I found it to be very useful. I have very thick hair and brushing it can be a hassle. This product took out every knot easily. I will purchase another when this one wears out. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have VERY long almost waist length hair that is INCREDIBLY thick as well. I constantly struggle with tangled hair..sometimes I just give up if I&#x27;m not going out anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this brush, since it is advertised as a detangling brush. I thought it might help a little, but really did not expect it to get through my morning hair (uncombed and crazy tangled from sleep) without washing it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush really amazed me..it is not expensive yet it worked wonders on my hair. I am an idiot for not trying something like this a LONG time ago! I have been having to wash my hair every day, which is actually not good for it. And then STILL struggle to get a comb or brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush detangled my hair in minutes (not exaggerating) and was not painful either. I don&#x27;t know how it does this (according to the product info, the different , varying lengths of the teeth are one way it works) , but I am SOLD, and will be holding on to this brush for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REALLY happy with it.</li>
            <li> This brush works amazing on my 15 month old who is blessed with long curly hair but like any other baby doesn&#x27;t want his hair brushed when it hurts. But now its not a problem thanks to this brush. I already ordered another one for one of my other kids.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything the advertising said it would be. I love it. And I am not an easy sell. I have fine hair, losing my hair due to lillness, plus have very expensive sensitive extensions. This is the best brush for all three I have found so far. I hope to buy a second one soon. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Lj from Los Angeles, CA</li>
            <li> This brush is great!! I have baby fine hair and a lot of it, and this brush detangles my hair with ease.  It&#x27;s plastic but don&#x27;t let that fool you, the multi level bristles really help to untangle the hair with snagging.</li>
            <li> This was much needed! Daughters hair is almost impossible to keep brushed and tangle free. This made her hair brushing experience so much better.  No crying or yelling at me to stop when I used this!  I used it both on wet and dry hair and both times she noticed a huge difference in how it felt.  The handle shape made it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This brush works great!</li>
            <li> Best brush for any hair type</li>
            <li> I’m impressed, I didn&#x27;t think it would work on my hair, but it detangles better than my comb. I love it!  A great product and will be purchasing 2 more for my granddaughters. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush.  It didn&#x27;t look like it could handle a mane of hair like I have!  I was wrong and pleasantly surprised.  I have thick naturally curly hair that comes to my waist and this brush handled it like a champ!  I am often left with handfuls of hair in my brush and extra breakage.  However, this brush seems to detangle without pulling or causing breakage.  I am left with very little hair in the brush afterwards.  This brush seemed to tame and smooth the natural frizz that comes with curls.  I&#x27;m LOVING it.</li>
            <li> This brush has made my daily routine run much smoother!! My daughter has a very tender head and mornings, bath time and bed time was always a fight to brush her hair. This brush does not hurt her head and we can brush with no fuss and move right along now</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  It detangles without pulling!  It&#x27;s amazing.  Everyone in my home loves it including my 13 year old son!</li>
            <li> Wow!  This has got to be one of the best hairbrushes I have ever owned for my grand daughter!  She has long, curly kind of frizzy hair and is ALWAYS tangly.  We always have to use some type of detangling on it.  But this brush works great on her hair!!&lt;br /&gt;She doesn&#x27;t scream and cry when I try to brush her hair.&lt;br /&gt;The design of the brush is really cool....you kind of put your whole hand around the brush itself.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this brush because it has an odd shape and plastic bristles.  I used it and it really does &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; your scalp and makes your scalp feel wonderful!  It claims to improve blood circulation which will stimulate hair growt. I hope this is true because I will be continuing to use it for the nice feeling it gives me.  I did pick up a little static while brushing but sprayed it with &amp;#34;static guard&amp;#34; anti-static spray and it was much better after that.  The brush is stylish and looks nice in my bathroom with it&#x27;s cute bubble design on the back.  I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have a young child and with the hair it is always getting knotted up. When I go to brush the hair I am always frustrated that it never gets knots out easily. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! This is the first brush when I was brushing the hair it was not hurting the child&#x27;s hair. It has a nice handle and good size brush. It would work for small hands as well as adult. Maybe think about someone who is going through chemo and would like a soft brush so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the scalp. This would be one I would suggest. During chemo a person&#x27;s hair is very fragile with this brush it is soft enough to get the job done without pulling more out than it should.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this brush detangles very gently!</li>
            <li> Seriously, when it arrive I thought what is this piece of  &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;  about- no difference visually from my regular brush. I give it a try for 2-3 weeks. I notice my hair stop falling compare to time I did not use this brush.Not sure what is the &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; technology or massaging effect of this brush. But my hair now have more volume and less falling down!&lt;br /&gt;How I clean it: turn bristles down and with few fast strokes shake again softer surface ( such as my own leg) all hair from inside brush will me moved on surface of the bristles and you can remove it with fingers.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair and is difficult to brush. My old brush would constantly pull out hair which didn&#x27;t help my hair falling out from having a baby. I absolutely love this brush! Good quality, fits my hand great (ergonomic!), and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out and brushes out with ease. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic! I have never used a better brush than this. I have very thick, long, wavy hair. It is tough to find a hairbrush that will work through all my tangles smoothly and without ripping knots out of my head. I never dared use any type of hairbrish on my wet hair either. The Vizeri Beauty brush is perfect. It easily made it through my tangles and my hair looked so healthy and full of volume after I used it. It was soft, shiny, and full of body. Loved my results! I was even brave enough to try it with damp bair. It had no trouble combing thrpugh my wet tresses. There was no pain and I am happy to be able to use this on my child as well. The only thing I would change is the handle. I wiah it was just a little bit longer for a better grip. Other than that, this is an amazing brush. Professional quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair brush! My daughter has super thick hair &amp; usually has to use a ton of detangling spray on her hair &amp; still struggles with brushing it. Not with this brush, goes through her hair with ease!</li>
            <li> I love having long hair but I don&#x27;t love the tangles and pain of brushing/combing them out. My scalp and hair can sometimes feel very sensitive and painful due to health problems which can make tangled hair even harder to deal with. Luckily I&#x27;ve found this wonderful brush! I was amazed at how well it worked and how painless it was to use. The bristles are different heights so you don&#x27;t have the painful tug a regular brush would give. I also love that the handle shape makes it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I love how easy this fits into my hand. This is my new favorite brush because it leaves my hair silky smooth. I have been telling everyone about this awesome brush!</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair and it&#x27;s curly and she just got an hombre.  With the bleaching and dying, it gets really tangled! I was able to part the hair I. Sections and it was easy to brush through!  Thank goodness for detanglers!</li>
            <li> Love the brush. I have thick hair, the brush gently removes tangles with little or no hair loss. Thanks!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Brush really works its magic!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. I have long, fine and thinning hair due to my meds and usually loose at least a handful of hair every time I have comb or brush my hair. When I wash my hair I usually have to use Pik to get thru my hair. This brush did an amazing thing when I used it detangled my hair and when I cleaned out the brush there was only maybe 20 strands of hair in it. I was so pleased with this product that I received as a free product for my unbias opinion. I would highly recommend this brush to anyone and all..</li>
            <li> Works great! Finally a brush that doesn&#x27;t make my daughter cry!</li>
            <li> This brush is the stuff! As a child I had long stringy hair and I deplored having my mom and grandmother brush it. Now a days, I keep my hair at a shoulders link but still have a sensitive scalp. I also color my hair and it gets pretty rough trying to brush it when I am due to recolor the gray hair my &amp;#34;ungreatfuls&amp;#34; put upon me with stress and worry. I rec&#x27;d this brush in a neat lil clear plastic box. I was astounded at how light the brush was. IT is super light weight!!! I braced myself half expecting for this brush to snatch me bald on the first come through. Boy was I surprised!!!! The brush flowed through my hair effortlessly. Yes, I typed effortlessly! I don&#x27;t know how it works so well only that it works and it&#x27;s perfect for my tender head. This may be Christmas gifts for my daughters in law. You just never know! :)</li>
            <li> This brush is beyond awesome! I can brush my four year old girls hair with her complaining! It works just as its stated. Thank you for such a great brush! The others I&#x27;ve bought were not worth the money/hassle.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it is supposed to do. I had not brushed my hair for a long time and decided to deep condition it one day. After I had washed my hair out I decided to use this brush, it detangled my hair so well and it did not even hurt, when I was done I was able to run my fingers through my hair with no problem. I highly reccommend purchasing this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is very nice. It gets the job done. The only complaint I have is the brushes shape. The handle isn&#x27;t quite long enough to be completly comfortable. But, overall its well made and resourceful.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush.  It is really light and ergonomic so you can hold it in the palm of your hand.  My hair is thin and fine and gets snarled pretty easily, but I don&#x27;t seem to be losing near the hair in this brush as I do with others.  The different length bristles also make it an awesome head massager while your brushing!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  It really fits in your hand &amp; feels so good on your scalp!  It does the job for detangling without ripping my hair out or breaking the ends off!  I laid the brush down &amp; the next thing I knew, my cat was rubbing his chin on it!  A sure sign that it&#x27;s a good brush!  I&#x27;m getting my granddaughter one because she uses a brush on her wet long hair.  She really needs to quit pulling &amp; breaking her hair.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! It fits in the palm of my hand so there is easy control! Would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> This is amazing awesome hair brush. I and my 2 daughters have very tangly hair. We can use it on wet or dry hair. I even love how the bristles massage my head. I have a very sensitive head and with this brush I dont get headaches from brushing out my hair. This is a MUST have for all kids and adults! A+</li>
            <li> I often have a hard time getting my long hair brushed out, especially after a windy day or too much hair spray. This brush worked much better than my ordinary paddle brush, but not as well as Vizeri&#x27;s other Boar&#x27;s Hair Detangling Brush. This one is more compact, which is nice for traveling, but I was really missing the full length handle and curved brush design.</li>
            <li> My hair is ultra fine and tangles like crazy! I really think that a mosquito could come just blow a tiny puff of air on my hair, and my hair would be in absolute knots! Trying to get through the tangled mess that I call my hair has been a life-long battle. So, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try out the Best Detangling Hair Brush! This brush detangles my hair effortlessly, especially when my hair is wet. I am very pleased with this product, and I would happily try out other products by this company. Vizeri, you have no idea of how much time, effort, and pain this lovely little brush has saved me! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush !!!!  I always have a hard time getting the tangles out when I get out of the shower but with this brush I can brush right through my hair. I have a lot less hair in my brush also. I use this on my little girl also and she does not cry anymore while trying to get her tangles out.</li>
            <li> I Love this brush! My 4 year old has very long but thin &amp; fine hair to her butt! THIS BRUSH is the ONLY brush that helps get out her tangles!! It is sooo smooth sounding &amp; feeling. It is so easy to hold!! Highly Recommend :)) (and its pretty looking too) :)</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!!!  I struggled getting the tangles out of my 4 year olds hair after bath, but with the detangling brush it&#x27;s a breeze now.  I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this wonderful brush!  You have detangled my relationship with my 10-year-old daughter.  We both have very thick, long, and slightly wavy hair, and it had gotten to the point that she would not let me brush her hair, she could not do a thorough job, and when I would finally pin her down to do the brushing with her old brush, she would be in pain, crying and so angry with me.  Since receiving our brush (very fast!  thanks for that too!), not only can we easily and painlessly get her tangles out, she can brush her own hair, and when I brush her hair, it&#x27;s a pleasant experience, because we can talk without being distracted by pain and anger.  I was curious how it worked, and ran it through my thick, long, permed hair, and while it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a pick does for me, it was not at all painful, which was surprising to me.  Wonderful innovation!  Our only wish is that it came in blue or yellow, as those are our favorite colors, but pink is nice and girly, so it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have wavy hair that gets tangled easily but this brush is surprisingly gentle even when my hair is wet. I was skeptical because it&#x27;s plastic but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and makes my hair feel smoother!</li>
            <li> I wish I could be one of those women in the commercials with thick, luxurious hair that perfectly bounces with each step but alas, I am one of those women with thin, tangle prone hair that will bounce whenever it feels like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of problems with tangles in my hair since it&#x27;s so fine. If I wear a scarf the hair that rubs on the scarf tangles into these weird knots. If I&#x27;m wearing a fine chain on a necklace, you can guarantee that my hair is going to get stuck in it. So when my hairdresser told me about this pink detangling brush she found online, I had to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how well it brushed out the crazy knots my hair can get into. Before I got into the shower I pre-brushed using the Vizeri brush and the knots fell out pretty quickly. I was even more impressed after the shower when the brush only took about five minutes to cut through wet hair and make everything smooth as a button. Overall, I&#x27;m super pleased with this hairbrush and even more pleased with the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever wondered just how the heck your hair got into a million knots and then cringed at the thought of the detangling process. . . cringe no more! This is totally the brush you need to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair.  This brush easily glides through hair and detangles hair without pulling.  Handle is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 18 month old and IT is absolutely FANTASTIC for brushing her hair! No more screaming!</li>
            <li> I bought this for review and I&#x27;m glad I did because it fits perfectly in my hand and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or scratch my scalp !</li>
            <li> My sister has this brush &amp; I love to  borrow it. It&#x27;s a very good brush. I think I&#x27;ll get my own.  Now, I&#x27;m taking one star due to the short handle on the brush. The other Vizeri Beauty products pictured still get 5 stars. I love their products and will cont to order them thru Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> love love love THIS BRUSH !!! I HAVE VERY LONG HIP LENGTH HAIR . It is fine but there is a lot of it ! Works great does not pull or damage my hair. If you have long hair this is a great brush . Totally recommend !</li>
            <li> This brush detangles without pulling</li>
            <li> This seems to be working just fine. I have naturally curly hair and my son does as well. This brush does not pull on my hair and make feel that I need to pull out my hairs with the snarls. My son has been using this as well and his only wish is that it wasn&#x27;t in pink. It seems to be working though because he keeps using it. This brush comes exactly as pictured. One of the things that I appreciated was that when I ordered it, I received an email from Vizeri Beauty about how to use it and keep care of the brush. That personal touch was nice.</li>
            <li> i really like these brushes for my daughters hair, its much more forgiving that the standard brush when brushing out tangles. I got her one last year and figured shed like another one with a new design . Product as described and high quality.</li>
            <li> I was truly surprised to see how nicely this brush glided through my wet, matted relaxed hair. Most importantly there was no pull or breakage and the brush was hair free after brushing through the tangles a several times. Less breakage  and damage is a great thing so I&#x27;m sold on this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush!!! I have hair down to my bottom, so it&#x27;s about 3 1/2-4 feet long.  My hair is also extremely thick. For the past couple of years, I have been using a bamboo handle brush.  The bristles were falling out, so it was time for a new brush.  I am very particular on what brushes I will use for my hair.  Many brushes I have tried just don&#x27;t seem to work.  They either pull my hair, or are not strong enough to go through my hair due to the length and thickness of my hair.  I had been wanting to try a brush that was the same style as this Vizeri brush.  After comparing styles and prices I decided to try this Vizeri brush.  I was a little nervous because this brush is a different style than traditional paddle type brushes I have tried in the past.  When the brush arrived, I was very excited to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised at how easily the brush fits in your hand.  How the handle is shaped, it fits perfectly in your hand, and is actually very comfortable to hold.  Standard style brushes with a handle would put force on my wrist, often causing my wrist to be sore.  This style of brush completely eliminates that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are plastic so initially I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would be strong enough to work through my hair. After using the brush regularly now, I love the bristles.  The pattern the bristles make is perfect and they glide right through my hair.  If I have a particularly knotted or matted area in my hair, this brush makes it so easy and painless to get out that I haven&#x27;t even had to use any detangler spray, whereas before with other brushes I was regularly using detangling spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing that I absolutely love is how easy it is to clean!! This is by far one of my favorite things about this brush! The hair comes right off making it so easy to clean!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this brush and wish I would have tried it sooner!!</li>
            <li> Very fast shopping.  Won&#x27;t use any other brush now</li>
            <li> Another daughter..Margaret McCorkle</li>
            <li> My Wife likes it ... i</li>
            <li> Having long hair to my waist, my hair often gets knotted and tangled. I love the design of this brush, it fits into the palm of your hand so that it grips better. This brush does what it says it does. I use it a couple times a day and my hair seems to be less tangled with each use. It does not pull or tug at the hair. It is easier to clean out because there is less hair found in the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
            <li> When they say &amp;#34;The best brush&amp;#34;, they mean it!! What a wonderful brush!! I have long, bleached, platinum blonde hair that is very fine and fragile. I always struggle to get my hair de-tangled after shampooing and usually always wind up with a ton of broken strands in my comb when I&#x27;m done. This brush has eliminated the breakage almost 100%. I also use it to smooth the top of my hair after back combing and teasing. Even the frizz somehow is gone on my ends after blowing my hair out. I would give this brush 10 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> I am loving this brush!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly hair and this detangling brush glided right through my curls.&lt;br /&gt;It has the perfect shape and the bristles do not hurt my scalp whatsoever. It also cleans up with ease.  I  highly recommend this strangling brush :)</li>
            <li> I Received my brush quickly and it is the best brush for de tangling hair. My daughter said it was better than the one we got a few years ago. Love it!</li>
            <li> A perfect brush for my long thick hair. Tangles will no longer be a problem! Gotta love it!</li>
            <li> The handle is too short and the brush itself is tough on my hair, pulls it out.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  My daughter has extremely thick hair and this brush goes right through it without any problems.  It is easy to clean and she loves the purple color.  She also uses it for her American Girl dolls hair and it works great for that as well.  Dual purpose - win/win!</li>
            <li> Works great on tangly hair and feel really good on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Fantastic detangling brush! With the multi-height and staggered bristles the hairs easily glide through this brush and detangle with ease. This brush is very gentle on my hair and gets knots out when my hair is wet or dry. I love the feel of this brush in my hand. It&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to grip. This brush gets through my knots in half the time I usually take with a normal brush without pulling out tons of hairs or hurting me. This would be the perfect brush for someone with a sensitive scalp or your daughter who just hates getting her hair brushed. It&#x27;s gentle and very effective! *promotional discount received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Combs through hair easily</li>
            <li> Best brush ever!!! This definitely makes brushing hair painless. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; in our house.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who has very curly hair, she loves it!!!  I also have curly hair so now it&#x27;s our brush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> This was what we have searched for for 6.5 years for my daughters hair! We had tried every brush in the store, as well as the recommended &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; off of amazon. This brush not only fights the tangles with less pain than any other product, but it&#x27;s bristles are strong enough to actually do the job, haha. I felt like the other brushes were just wimpy and skimmed over a good knot, this one gently works through it and my daughter now won&#x27;t let anything else near her head. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought the brush on a whim, and I didn’t expect it to work as well as it does. I works particularly well on wet hair. I have long hair (almost to my waist) and it detangles beautifully. I think this is a great product. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed if you buy this.</li>
            <li> Love it, super fast shipping ,thank you</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product! I have long, fine, thin straight hair and it&#x27;s colored to boot! It takes me forever to comb it out after showering and washing it. This brush has cut that time in half! Also, there is virtually no hair in the brush afterward! I was losing a great deal of hair with every combing out, but with this brush, there is barely any hair loss at all. I would give it 10 stars!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little brush!  It&#x27;s not the best detangling brush I&#x27;ve used by a long shot, but it does work ok. I don&#x27;t really have tangle issues myself, and I&#x27;m the one who uses this brush the most and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really easy to use to style your hair though, if I just need to brush my hair, I can use this brush.  However, if I want to really style my hair, I have to use a different brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely ❤️❤️❤️❤️ my Vizeri Brush! I primarily use it on my curly extensions and it does an amazing job on detangling the hair without pulling it out from the weft. I also use it to massage my scalp for the purpose of stimulating hair growth. It&#x27;s also a great scalp massager as well. An added bonus was the exemplary customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a typical 1-start review person I try to atleast give products 2 starts if they are horrible but this is a total sham! I have reverted to the Conair paddle brush for $6 at Walgreen because this couldn&#x27;t even detangle 2 inches of my hair. The bristles are sharp. Stiff at the base and a little bendy at the end. They are also very short. i think it may work best on thin hair or in very thin sections of hair. Not worth $15.</li>
            <li> So happy I bought this hairbrush. Normally when I brush my hair it comes out a lot and hurts while I brush as it rips out of my head. Wet hair is the worst for me but this brush went through almost like butter. There was no painfull pulling of my hair like before and it took less time for me to brush because I had an easier time getting through my tangled hair. My hair is a little longer than shoulder length. The design of this brush also makes it feel great in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> love it for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I also used on my kids. Our hair types and hair length are all different. This is definitely a pain free brush as it says. My daughter has thick long hair and she didn&#x27;t want to try it and did. Now I have to go find it in her room as she tried to hide it to I cannot use it. She loves her long hair now that I have found the perfect brush for her tangled hair. We don&#x27;t even have to put in spray detangler. I would highly recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
            <li> Just received this brush about a week ago and have been pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  It really does move through tangles without snagging.  Obviously it makes sense to brush your hair sensibly, but this is much easier on my hair than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.  The size is very handy, too -- it will easily fit in a purse or your car.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to several friends.</li>
            <li> I received this brush a couple of weeks ago and my curls thanks it.  It doesnt pull at my hair and does not create additional frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is the worst, and this detangling brush makes it manageable! I highly recommend this brush!&lt;br /&gt;The sleek design makes the brush easy to maneuver and the bristles are soft enough to not pull my hair, but strong enough to loosen the knots.</li>
            <li> AMAZING for little kid hair.</li>
            <li> This brush detangles my hair as if it tangled at all. Im impressed. It even made my normally dreaded task for brush my 4 and 6 years old hair easy and painless thank you for making such an awesome brush</li>
            <li> Let me start off saying that FINALLY I have a brush that helps with my long thick hair! My hair knots really easily. By the end of a 6 hour work shift (not long at all) I get home and take my hair down and it looks like a rats nest. So I would have to wash it or be lazy and just throw it back up. I absolutely love this brush! It cuts time in half making mornings easier and I actually am motivated to do something with my hair besides throwing it back. Usually I buy a brush and the bristles break off and pop off and get stuck in my hair. That has NOT happened yet! This is definitely a GREAT brush! And let me say I spend a lot of money on brushes!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I have curly hair and I can brush my hair without ripping my hair out. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Excellent detangler, especially on wet hair.  Takes tangles out gently and efficiently without ripping the hair. The handle is a little uncomfortable, there isn&#x27;t enough of it to hold onto.  Basically you have to hold the brush by the back to really use it. But it works very well for all of that!</li>
            <li> I love my new Detangling Hair Brush.  I have very curly hair that tangles easily and find it so frustrating to brush.  This brush just glided through my tangled curls and worked like magic!!! The brush is super light and not very large, so it will be super easy to travel with as well.  It fit great in the palm of my hand.  I am super excited to start using it daily, without ripping out so much hair. I would even suggest that they make this brush in black too, since curly hair runs in my family and I will be using it on my sons hair too and would be great if it was more gender neutral. I cannot be happier with this purchase!</li>
            <li> an awesome detaching brush. I have a 4 year old with hair down to her butt. Now She loves getting her hair brushed!</li>
            <li> Just received this item and I love ergonomic handle!! Does not pull out or break my hair!! Must have for the ease of brushing and removing knots!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good detangling brush. Doesn&#x27;t seem extremely sturdy; it&#x27;s fairly small and plastic, but that has its advantages. It does what it says and is lightweight and compact.</li>
            <li> I have smooth wavy hair that gets easily tangled and this brush has helped with it a lot! I don&#x27;t see a lot of hair breakage and that&#x27;s a big plus for me. Would recommend this brush to anyone looking for a good quality hair brush!</li>
            <li> I bought the hairbrush for my daughter.  She said that it works as good as the commercials promised.  She is 9, and is sensitive to pulling hair while de tangling.  It has been working well for her for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair.This brush detangle them but the holder is very short and the brush is small,bristles are also short.Looks like a toy brush.Only good for very small hands.</li>
            <li> Previously I had received the pink brush as a gift from the seller when I purchased the boar bristle brush of the same brand. Since I loved the boar bristle brush I gifted the pink one to my niece. But when my baby girl started growing hair I needed something for her thus I purchased pink one for her and ever since then I love brushing her tiny scalp with it and my darling daughter loves the strokes of it on her hair. I love the style, the colour, its basically a first girlie girl accessory I bought for my daughter. I also purchased the black one for my baby boy and my wee lad loves it same as his twin sister.</li>
            <li> works great in my daughters long hair but the price was a mit much.but it works and doesn&#x27;t pull her hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the Vizeri brush because my hair was knotting after washing so I keep it in the shower with me and it&#x27;s terrific - it glides through my hair without ripping it out.  My hair, which used to be so thick it made my hairdresser cry every time I saw him, is now much thinner - and I don&#x27;t want to lose anymore of it!  It works! Yes, I love it!</li>
            <li> Good product easy to comb.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle.  Gets knots out of hair very easily.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush to use on my daughter&#x27;s long hair and it works great to untangle. I plan on buying one now for my hair also. We are pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing tool ! I have thick, curly, waist length hair...detangling is no longer a chore...it is more like massage therapy !!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are not long enough in fact they are short for long hair to go through</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t dislike this item, but found it equally able to detangle my hair as my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. It untangles every one of your hair without even hurting you. So when my whole hair is tangled I can easily untangle it! Great and amazing product. Wonderful hairbrush!</li>
            <li> This is great.  I recently got hair extensions so I have to deal with tangled hair for the first time in my life.  This works on wet and dry hair and it&#x27;s pain-free.  Well-designed, light-weight, fits nicely in the hand and it&#x27;s pink and black--what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I saw this brush and knew I needed to try it in my daughter. She is 1 1/2 and her hair is so unruly. It tangles up within an hour of brushing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of normal wiggling as I brush her hair, she stood still for me. She did say &#x27;ouch&#x27; once, but it did great! It was a lot faster getting the tangles out. Definitely a great find! My daughter appreciates it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought to use on very coarse African American hair.  It works. It&#x27;s not a straightener, so my hair tangles easily again, but tamed w/ this brush.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.  Where has this been my whole tangled hair life? This brush does exactly what it promises. I have extremly thin and thinning hair and it tangles all the time I have to deal with a matted mess in the back under par of my hair every day.&lt;br /&gt;I just used this on my really tangled hair and it worked wonders. Not only did it not hurt trying to get the tangles out but it didn&#x27;t even pull out much hair only a few strands. Normally I would have a brush full of precious hair in the bristles left over from the battle I just had trying to get my hair untangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair detangler brush got all my tangles out with ease and in a fraction of the time and pain it would take me with a normal brush.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived extremly fast and when I opened it,  it was in a nice clear plastic so you could see the product.  Once opened I saw the bristles were in a bunch of high and low rows. I think this is the secret to the awesomeness of this brush! It had a very different shape than a normal brush but once I have put it in my hand i realized the design was spot on and fit in my hand perfectly and gave me the right control for getting those pesky tangles out. I am in love with this brush.  If you have hair you need this brush. Once I get paid I will be buying some for all the women i know for xmas Becuase no women should be without this:)</li>
            <li> The best hair brush ever!!!! My daughter has hair to her but and it is a struggle to brush her hair everyday. It usually takes us about 10 minutes to brush her hair with other detangling brushes. She is usually frustrated and crying by the time we are done. With this brush we are done in a few minutes and no tears. Thank you for making a brush that works wonders on her hair. We had debated cutting her hair short, now we don&#x27;t have to. I highly recommend this brush for anyone with long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t brushed my hair for years. Because this said it&#x27;s good for detangling I purchase it. I have long dry hair. Wear it up at bed time.Morning come hate ideal of combing it. So far brushing  been nice.</li>
            <li> This really is a great brush. I have been struggling to get the tangles out of my 2 year old daughters long hair with a comb.  She doesn&#x27;t run in the other direction when I bring this brush out. In fact she is starting to ask for me brush her hair.</li>
            <li> This comb works great. The bristles themselves are a little rough, but it works wonders on the tangles. Great helper in elimination of the drama a 4yr old can make when brushing her hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Great brush that really does brush out tangles efficiently, and mostly painlessly. My daughter&#x27;s hair really gets tangled in the back and she prefers this brush over the other 3 detangling brushes we have. So that&#x27;s saying something about the brushes abilities. It has a cute color and design on the back that also makes it more fun. Overall a great brush for smoothing out tangled hair.</li>
            <li> This solved a major problem for me !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy with full, curly/wavy hair, and have gone thru half a dozen various brushes and combs. Out of frustration I did a quick google search for top rated detangling combs, and zeroed in on this one. All I needed do was glean the existing Amazon buyer reviews to pretty much confirm this might be a useful purchase, and the price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly fond of pink, but if it worked, I figured I ultimately wouldn&#x27;t  much care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few big notable things here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It slides right through my curly mop. I like using it most when hair is wet, in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. To my amazement, it doesn&#x27;t rip out strands of hair like other detangling brushes. Typically, I&#x27;d have had a brush that had to be regularly cleaned of my own pulled-out hair by using a comb. Not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The scalp massage using this brush is a big deal. It&#x27;s a challenge getting scalp massage with regular brushes or combs, and again, only if you like getting hair pulled out, which this brush just doesn&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The net results are what count, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair looking better pretty much from the first day of use (guessing part of that is from the deep scalp massage, which obviously would increase scalp circulation etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always been my belief that one way to get ahead in life is to have the best tools. And this, for me, is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! The bristles are strong so it seems this brush will last a while.</li>
            <li> The brush works OK for my daughter&#x27;s fine/thin hair but it can&#x27;t get through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I adore this brush! I thought at first it was going to be awkward using because of the shape of the whole brush and the handle is curvy but I will be the first to admit I was wrong. It works perfectly and fits in your hand just as well. It does its job without a whole lot of pull and to boot all its pretty! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Gave to my 8yr daughter for Christmas. She is VERY tender headed and her hair is in constant knots. This brush works suprisingly well. I was skeptical. But she even uses it on her own. Very comfortable to use. She doesnt cringe when I use it.</li>
            <li> This brush is made really good.  Weird shape but that doesn&#x27;t affect the out come. I have brushed my hair a bunch of times with this brush. Compared to other brushes there is less hair in this brush than the other ones. I really like the feel and look of this brush. I had the opportunity to review this brush from Vizeri Beauty.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!  It’s awesome!  I have a ton of thick long hair and the brush is amazing.  I’m going to order more.  My daughters all have long hair.  This brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> Does what it says! I purchased two more after using the first one on my toddler grandchild.</li>
            <li> I bought this one hoping it would be easier to hold than the other detangling brush we have that has no handle.  The handle on this one is very short and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s any easier to hold than our other brush.  It does work to detangle, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than our other one.  The only reason I was looking to try something different was because of the issue of holding it, since this was not fixed, it was a wasted purchase for us.</li>
            <li> Works great just wish the handle of the brush was smaller</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as they claim.</li>
