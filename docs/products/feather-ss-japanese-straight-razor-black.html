    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The ease of blade insertion and removal is superb, and the razor head slides apart to allow for a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great care is still required!</li>
            <li>best razor</li>
            <li>Very happy that I have this razor over the folding type.</li>
            <li>a cheaper and in my opinion nicer case is this one that I just bought, and it fits perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M3638S/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With feather razors I get the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>would recommend this, excellent product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, best in his class</li>
            <li>The balance of this radar is perfect.</li>
            <li>you should shave each section of your face for the best shave.  </li>
            <li>The grip on the disposable razor promotes the perfect angle for shaving.  </li>
            <li>Imagine getting your razor to the perfect sharpen, the perfect finish and the perfect strop.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.leave a perfect bald spot on your arm.  </li>
            <li>Imagine getting your razor to the perfect sharpen, the perfect finish and the perfect strop.  </li>
            <li>The material used on the handle provides excellent grip for the fingers and prevents slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautifully designed razor, great look and feel!</li>
            <li>He is very good at showing you the correct way to shave.</li>
            <li>Very nice razor giving an excellent shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the handle doesn&#x27;t fold, and it&#x27;s somewhat cushioned so you can get a great grip.</li>
            <li>Great razor.  </li>
            <li>The Feather is highest quality and great to use.  </li>
            <li>I was also really happy to find out that it comes with a pack of 3 of the Safety Guard blades and the snap on protection cover for the blade itself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great blade for beginners also.</li>
            <li>Literally a great razor</li>
            <li>Great place to start.  </li>
            <li>Great razor with the reccomended feather blades.</li>
            <li>that said, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>that said, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>As for the razor itself, it is very nice and well built, lightweight, and has a great, grippy handle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, a really nice product that I&#x27;m now very happy to own!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for making accurate lines too.</li>
            <li>Fit and finish are excellent, but I think the MSRP of $150 is steep.</li>
            <li>This razor is really good.  </li>
            <li>Great quality and nice to have removable blades</li>
            <li>Ships form Japan so it takes a while to arrive, mine took 2 1/2 weeks, which is good time</li>
            <li>Great product - Nice workmanship</li>
            <li>--  I find the positioning of the blade and the angle of the blade holder, and the way the holder guides the blade are not as good as the folding version, which I used for a while before I got this.</li>
            <li>Good with shaping of beard and moustache.</li>
            <li>Stopped using my feather as-d2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs good technique.</li>
            <li>Both of those things turned out to be a good thing.  </li>
            <li>A light graze across your arm will leave a perfect bald spot on your arm.  </li>
            <li>and you just get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you just get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so this razor has to be good to take care of it</li>
            <li>Good  fast services excellent product</li>
            <li>Watch some videos and read the shaving forums before use and you&#x27;ll have a better experience!</li>
            <li>Outstanding product!</li>
            <li>This razor is about as safe to use as an electric shaver!</li>
            <li>nothing compares to the this razor for giving a close and safe shave!</li>
            <li>so far:&lt;br /&gt;I love it!  </li>
            <li>But amazing results.</li>
            <li>That having been said, I am thrilled with the razor.  </li>
            <li>For ease of use, nothing IMO beats a DE razor, shaving oil, brush with shaving soap and good blades - cheapest, most practical way to go.</li>
            <li>I also own a Merkur FUTUR and plan on using both from time to time.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this straight handle blade is the best option - it gives you much more ergonomic control.</li>
            <li>I am, so far, really impressed.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor amazing</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I find I have an easier time gripping this straight handle and therefore keeping the best angle more easily.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Weight-wise, it is very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light.  </li>
            <li>My face prefers the Kai Captain Mild in this razor over the Feather Pro, and the Pro Guards seem to be quite good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for the fine detail work, but first time users are going to bleed!</li>
            <li>After using it for a couple of days now, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>However, I got the hang of this on the second shave and it was one of my best shaves ever!  </li>
            <li>I love Feather Products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While my favorite shave comes from the Dovo</li>
            <li>With the folding razors I find that the scales tend to get in the way more often than not.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that it came with these.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I have it.  </li>
            <li>Keep it away from kids as there is no cover for safe storing.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li>really love safety razors for the quickness</li>
            <li>This razor completes me :-)</li>
            <li>I just upgraded to this razor from a safety razor using feather blades and the closeness of the shave is outstanding.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>But  after a week of using this razor, I was feeling much more confident, and getting the quality shaves I  was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Very nice straight razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Order one of these, it&#x27;s worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to easily reach.  </li>
            <li>But the grippy handle is great and overall, a nice  product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to take apart and clean when you are finished shaving.  </li>
            <li>You dont need to apply any pressure when shaving, just let the razor do all the work, the more pressure you apply, the more likely you will slit your throat lol.</li>
            <li>OK so this is the best razor I have ever used hands down.  </li>
            <li>It holds the disposable blade securely, yet replacing the blade is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the exact URL for it, but there is a nice diagram out there demonstrating the differences between the styles.</li>
            <li>Many of my purchases were vintage shaving gear, and many of them I enjoyed very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love using this razor because it feels quite right in the hand and leaves a great shave, albeit old school.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have a great respect for Japanese craftsmanship, and I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase a Feather kamisori for quite some</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t junk, and it isn&#x27;t cheap by any means.</li>
            <li>Keep the styptic pencil at hand, and enjoy the process of learning how to shave with this.</li>
            <li>Overall great purchase</li>
            <li>If you get the shavette, relax, take your time, enjoy the shave</li>
            <li>It is light and balanced with a comfortable rubber grip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable during use.  </li>
            <li>Equally easy to clean without the hassle of stropping and honing.</li>
            <li>It is important to watch some of the U Tube instructional segments which feature this razor, and to begin with the ProGuard Blade.  </li>
            <li>I also use a pre-shave oil and natural shave cream and its as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li>YouTube can help you, but you will spill some blood before you&#x27;ll be able to do it right.</li>
            <li>All clean, smooth and close.</li>
            <li>The key to success with this razor for me has been to use good shaving products with it,  to take my time, and  use a very light touch.</li>
            <li>Pros - good quality, easy to replace blades (open chamber) adapted system if you use the feather brand blades (auto load)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>BUT, when I do take the time, I am never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I had to purchase another Feather SS Shavette just in case my original gets dropped or something.  </li>
            <li>Then in comes the Feather - a smoother, closer, and more consistent shaving experience than all of the others.</li>
            <li>It is also important to use a good pre-shave oil or face perpetration,  a good brush, and a thick lather from a quality shaving soap or cream.</li>
            <li>We tend to romanticize straight razor shaving and it may be good for some purists who like nostalgia; but by and large if you&#x27;re in a hurry</li>
            <li>Cuts close and clean.</li>
            <li>The Feather SS is ideal for me because it uses disposable blades and doesn&#x27;t require sharpening like traditional straight razors.  </li>
            <li>The grip on it is outstanding and the shavette fits very comfortably in my fairly large hand.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t as large of a razor as I have thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly wish i had tried this type of straight razor first because that is what i would have stuck with.  </li>
            <li>, I am definitely glad I bought it and absolutely recommend it, but learn from my mistake and prepare yourself beforehand, and know what you&#x27;re doing before using it.</li>
            <li>but I love straight razors for the elegance of it and the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Not that the quality isn&#x27;t good, but the manufacturer definitely knows they have a niche product and they are charging a premium for it.  </li>
            <li>The ProGuard blades make this pretty easy.</li>
            <li>After a couple months of use now, it&#x27;s a remarkable shave without a single nick.  </li>
            <li>There are the Feather Pro, Super Pro, Pro Guard, and Lite.</li>
            <li>And Feather&#x27;s chief competitor, Kai, offers its versions of most of the foregoing, all of which will fit in the razor.</li>
            <li>Based on great reviews I got the Feather Razor Artist Club SS without ever using a straight razor, only using a double-edge razor before.</li>
            <li>I also got a pack of 20 of the Super blades which I haven&#x27;t tried out yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only a little experienced with straight razors and got a great comfotable clean shave the first time with no cuts.</li>
            <li>Practice on your arm or somewhere inconspicuous first!  </li>
            <li>Fantastic low-maintenance alternative to a western-style straight razor.</li>
            <li>this was helpful, and I hope you enjoy this razor as much as I do</li>
            <li>I really like it and use it every weekend when I can take the time and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Shave in the shower, you&#x27;ll rarely ever get cut.</li>
            <li>This Japanese straight feels more comfortable, secure and is easier to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>There are several detailed reviews already on here, so I won&#x27;t bother to elaborate.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback to this razor is that it is a bit pricey, but to be honest it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>However for this price, even discounted it doesn&#x27;t seem totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Awesome alternative to a traditional Japanese straight.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good product, but It should have a lower price point.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, a single pass is an easy work-ready shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finding the right blade will take some experimentation.</li>
            <li>Those who use the classic &amp;#34;cut-throat&amp;#34; keep that in mind the first time you try it !!</li>
            <li>But these are quiet excellent, and at $0.50 a piece or less?</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was hoping that wouldn&#x27;t be the case because I love my traditional razors, but I definitely understand why they made that claim.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the proper angle and touch, you will really get an amazingly close shave.  </li>
            <li>, have a few more shaves under my belt, and I&#x27;m shaving much much better with it.  </li>
            <li>I like this razor very much.</li>
            <li>As far as the razor goes, it handles well, feels perfect in your hand, and is a definite improvement over the standard folding straight razor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first shave with it was super tricky as it was my first time using a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I find this razor to be of excellent quality, far above many of the lesser designs/brands available at major American retailers.</li>
            <li>Good, adequate weight (although may be lighter than some folding handles if you prefer a very heavy feel), with a rubber grip.</li>
            <li>You CANNOT shave against the grain on the first pass.</li>
            <li>Even with the ProGuard blades you can really cut yourself!</li>
            <li>I also watched Geo fat boy&#x27;s videos on Youtube before attempting my first shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I still have a couple fading scars from that first shave with the heasitant hand...</li>
            <li>a lot before I took to my first shave.  </li>
            <li>The first razor I bought was a cheaper version of this model, the Sam Seong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just got my Feather in the mail and tried it out for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Wear pants your first couple of time shaving...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Theres a learning curve, you will cut your face at first.</li>
            <li>After using for the first week, I expect to get 4 shaves out of a blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple of notes:&lt;br /&gt;-I seem to be getting 7-10 shaves out of the blades, depending on how many passes I do on a regular day.  </li>
            <li>I now feel comfortable using either the ProGuard or the Professional  blades.  </li>
            <li>As far as straight razors go, this razor is fan-frickin-tastic!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for people who already familiar with DE razors and straight razors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a good option if you don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money for the Feather SS, but the design of the Seong is definitely inferior to this razor.</li>
            <li>If you are new at straight razor shaving, as I am, I recommend getting a pack of the Pro Guard blades, and the Kai Captain Mild.</li>
            <li>Personally, I selected the &amp;#34;Feather Artist Club Professional&amp;#34; blades available from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really can&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re all thumbs with a straight razor you could give yourself an \\&quot;Al</li>
            <li>Just bought the DE Stainless Steel Razor.  </li>
            <li>With the Pro Guard blade I really did very well.  </li>
            <li>Easier to control then a straight edge.  </li>
            <li>Prefer this refillable straight to the folding handle type.  </li>
            <li>It shaves close and very well.  </li>
            <li>if you have no experience with a straight or shavette, go to YouTube</li>
            <li>Sometimes I remove the holding piece and slide it back into place, feels that smooth.</li>
            <li>Watch a whole bunch of videos on youtube before you start using it.</li>
            <li>: Been straight razor shaving for years now.  </li>
            <li>Very  well  packaged, and  promt  </li>
            <li>thanks  again.</li>
            <li>I can shave almost as fast as a safety razor and get the straight razor</li>
            <li>It really is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had to date</li>
            <li>Aside from the blades, I find the actual razor handle to be extremely comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li>After several uses, almost blood free.</li>
            <li>It turns out that that really isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>It turns out that that really isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>I started using this razor almost a month ago, having never used a straight razor before.  </li>
            <li>Learning to use a straight razor is like learning to ride a bicycle.</li>
            <li>The packaging was better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Could a professional honemeister tailor a better edge for an individual?</li>
            <li>and although it&#x27;s tricky to learn how to use this properly at first (if you are new to straight razors), you will eventually get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all hard to pick up; my first shave with the Feather was excellent, and I anticipate all future shaves will be equally fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this razor for the ability to use Feather blades, they are sharpe, offer a rounded corner version, and have more length than than some blades used in my other shavette holder.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the folding straights (possibly due to my experience with kitchen knives).</li>
            <li>That edge paired with the more rigid blades used in the SS makes for an extremely well controlled shave.  </li>
            <li>As I hone my own razors, I can say that I believe I can often sharpen my razors to a &amp;#34;sharper&amp;#34; edge, but I&#x27;d have a hard time honing them to a smoother edge as consistently.</li>
            <li>This razor is WAY better than a conventional straight razor -</li>
            <li>Pros: Solid, comfortable, easy to grip with grippy handle, easy to load, affordable, easy to clean, scary sharp, well weighted, well balanced.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend this product, but only if you&#x27;re not in a rush clean up.</li>
            <li>I use the feather professional blades with this, and one piece of advice that you should know when using a new blade, is that it is extremely sharp and very easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>This Japanese style blade gives better control of the angle with less effort, and just has a much more solid feel to it.</li>
            <li>get a decent brush, cream, aftershave (I also use a preshave cream)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Main reservation</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that stated that the SS promotes a better angle than the much more expensive DX</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I have several straight razors now and so far I have found this Japanese style is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The rubber handle stays grippy even when wet, and the design allow for smooth shaving with no hang ups.  </li>
            <li>yes this is not your normal straight razor, but it is MUCH MUCH easier to control than a standard straight razor or shavette.  </li>
            <li>The blades are quite sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>These razors are plenty sharp, AND smooth.</li>
            <li>It is my new razor of choice in all</li>
            <li>When you get this razor delivered, the first thing you realize is that you&#x27;ve probably bought items of similar quality from Target for around 10 bucks.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve never shaved with a straight before and are interested in traditional shaving, maybe with an eye towards the Japanese style razor?</li>
            <li>It is wicked sharp, and I cut myself many times the first few times I used it, but that&#x27;s just the trait of a high-quality blade.</li>
            <li>If you do a lot of straight razor shaving (professionally as I do, or just for personal use), this razor can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>That being said, &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; is far from all that matters where razors are concerned.</li>
            <li>but I will admit it really does give the closest possible shave.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely go through the learning experience again (differently I hope) to have the shave experience I do NOW.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew from experience that you have to have a soft touch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping my old folder for nostalgia.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend others to try it out if you like straight razors or are even just getting started out.  </li>
            <li>I use the Feather Professional Blades (outstanding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The securing mechanism and part is very well made, feels and holds the blade solidly.</li>
            <li>(btw I&#x27;m using the feather professional blades).  </li>
            <li>I picked up the Feather Professional blades.  </li>
            <li>The Feather SS Straight Razor is the ultimate shaving instrument.</li>
            <li>I had been using a Weber double edge safety razor, and decided to graduate to the straight razor.</li>
            <li>There are going to be some minor mistakes at first.</li>
            <li>EVEN WITH DUE CAUTION YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SUFFER SOME NICKS AND WEEPERS UNTIL YOU REALLY GET THE HANG OF IT.</li>
            <li>but i found its a very good razor handle a little slick when wet but works</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love it, and I&#x27;m seriously considering putting up my collection of vintage razors for sale...</li>
            <li>removal\\&quot;: The technique is with the grain first pass; across the grain second pass; and then you MAY shave against the grain to touch up some areas of stubble (but not the upper lip!) - increasing the angle of the blade to the skin on each pass.</li>
            <li>My understanding is that the super blades are sharper and longer lasting, but these are definitely the sharpest objects that I personally have ever come in contact with.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, Amazon has it available for significantly less, and I believe their price to be quite reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a few Dovo straight razors as well as the the a few Dovo shavettes on top of that I have around 10 safety razors from Dovo / Merkur, M&amp;uuml;hle, Gillette, Parker, etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave with the AC is incredibly smooth, and the blade is extremely sharp - something I expected from Feather&#x27;s reputation for DE blades.</li>
            <li>to other reviewers, I have to respectfully disagree about a few items I&#x27;ve read:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>the last several years, I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of money, first on DE and SE safety razors, then later on straight razors, hones, and strops.  </li>
            <li>This was completely my fault, and NOT the razor&#x27;s, because I tried to shave the opposite side of my face with my dominant hand instead of switching hands, like you&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re a shave geek like I am, with a serious case of RAD (razor acquisition disorder), who wants to try straight razor shaving without the chores of stropping, honing, etc., or whether you&#x27;re a veteran straight razor shaver, I think you&#x27;ll find this a terrific tool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a long time straight razor user who enjoys traditional kamisori razors along with traditional straights.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and works extremely well with a variety of gel, soap and cream shaving products.</li>
            <li>But that being said, I&#x27;ve been shaving with conventional straight razors for a while</li>
            <li>I think it gives me a bit more control than the folding handles I&#x27;ve used in the past, and the slightly shorter handle allows me to get some angles</li>
            <li>The first shave gave me quite a few nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>The first couple times I used this I was getting a lot of razor burn and several knicks, but patience and a slow steady shave is starting to produce the results I was</li>
            <li>This is not to put down the product: It&#x27;s very well crafted.</li>
            <li>The handle is easily big enough for my larger hands and the smaller blade length makes the &#x27;careful&#x27; elements of the shave much easier.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The ease of blade insertion and removal is superb, and the razor head slides apart to allow for a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great care is still required!</li>
            <li> best razor</li>
            <li> Very happy that I have this razor over the folding type.</li>
            <li> a cheaper and in my opinion nicer case is this one that I just bought, and it fits perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M3638S/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With feather razors I get the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> would recommend this, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, best in his class</li>
            <li> The balance of this radar is perfect.</li>
            <li> you should shave each section of your face for the best shave.  </li>
            <li> The grip on the disposable razor promotes the perfect angle for shaving.  </li>
            <li> Imagine getting your razor to the perfect sharpen, the perfect finish and the perfect strop.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.leave a perfect bald spot on your arm.  </li>
            <li> Imagine getting your razor to the perfect sharpen, the perfect finish and the perfect strop.  </li>
            <li> The material used on the handle provides excellent grip for the fingers and prevents slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beautifully designed razor, great look and feel!</li>
            <li> He is very good at showing you the correct way to shave.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor giving an excellent shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the handle doesn&#x27;t fold, and it&#x27;s somewhat cushioned so you can get a great grip.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  </li>
            <li> The Feather is highest quality and great to use.  </li>
            <li> I was also really happy to find out that it comes with a pack of 3 of the Safety Guard blades and the snap on protection cover for the blade itself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great blade for beginners also.</li>
            <li> Literally a great razor</li>
            <li> Great place to start.  </li>
            <li> Great razor with the reccomended feather blades.</li>
            <li> that said, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> that said, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> As for the razor itself, it is very nice and well built, lightweight, and has a great, grippy handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, a really nice product that I&#x27;m now very happy to own!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for making accurate lines too.</li>
            <li> Fit and finish are excellent, but I think the MSRP of $150 is steep.</li>
            <li> This razor is really good.  </li>
            <li> Great quality and nice to have removable blades</li>
            <li> Ships form Japan so it takes a while to arrive, mine took 2 1/2 weeks, which is good time</li>
            <li> Great product - Nice workmanship</li>
            <li> --  I find the positioning of the blade and the angle of the blade holder, and the way the holder guides the blade are not as good as the folding version, which I used for a while before I got this.</li>
            <li> Good with shaping of beard and moustache.</li>
            <li> Stopped using my feather as-d2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs good technique.</li>
            <li> Both of those things turned out to be a good thing.  </li>
            <li> A light graze across your arm will leave a perfect bald spot on your arm.  </li>
            <li> and you just get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you just get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this razor has to be good to take care of it</li>
            <li> Good  fast services excellent product</li>
            <li> Watch some videos and read the shaving forums before use and you&#x27;ll have a better experience!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!</li>
            <li> This razor is about as safe to use as an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> nothing compares to the this razor for giving a close and safe shave!</li>
            <li> so far:&lt;br /&gt;I love it!  </li>
            <li> But amazing results.</li>
            <li> That having been said, I am thrilled with the razor.  </li>
            <li> For ease of use, nothing IMO beats a DE razor, shaving oil, brush with shaving soap and good blades - cheapest, most practical way to go.</li>
            <li> I also own a Merkur FUTUR and plan on using both from time to time.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this straight handle blade is the best option - it gives you much more ergonomic control.</li>
            <li> I am, so far, really impressed.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor amazing</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I find I have an easier time gripping this straight handle and therefore keeping the best angle more easily.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Weight-wise, it is very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very light.  </li>
            <li> My face prefers the Kai Captain Mild in this razor over the Feather Pro, and the Pro Guards seem to be quite good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for the fine detail work, but first time users are going to bleed!</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of days now, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> However, I got the hang of this on the second shave and it was one of my best shaves ever!  </li>
            <li> I love Feather Products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While my favorite shave comes from the Dovo</li>
            <li> With the folding razors I find that the scales tend to get in the way more often than not.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that it came with these.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I have it.  </li>
            <li> Keep it away from kids as there is no cover for safe storing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li> really love safety razors for the quickness</li>
            <li> This razor completes me :-)</li>
            <li> I just upgraded to this razor from a safety razor using feather blades and the closeness of the shave is outstanding.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> But  after a week of using this razor, I was feeling much more confident, and getting the quality shaves I  was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Very nice straight razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Order one of these, it&#x27;s worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to easily reach.  </li>
            <li> But the grippy handle is great and overall, a nice  product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to take apart and clean when you are finished shaving.  </li>
            <li> You dont need to apply any pressure when shaving, just let the razor do all the work, the more pressure you apply, the more likely you will slit your throat lol.</li>
            <li> OK so this is the best razor I have ever used hands down.  </li>
            <li> It holds the disposable blade securely, yet replacing the blade is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the exact URL for it, but there is a nice diagram out there demonstrating the differences between the styles.</li>
            <li> Many of my purchases were vintage shaving gear, and many of them I enjoyed very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love using this razor because it feels quite right in the hand and leaves a great shave, albeit old school.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have a great respect for Japanese craftsmanship, and I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase a Feather kamisori for quite some</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t junk, and it isn&#x27;t cheap by any means.</li>
            <li> Keep the styptic pencil at hand, and enjoy the process of learning how to shave with this.</li>
            <li> Overall great purchase</li>
            <li> If you get the shavette, relax, take your time, enjoy the shave</li>
            <li> It is light and balanced with a comfortable rubber grip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable during use.  </li>
            <li> Equally easy to clean without the hassle of stropping and honing.</li>
            <li> It is important to watch some of the U Tube instructional segments which feature this razor, and to begin with the ProGuard Blade.  </li>
            <li> I also use a pre-shave oil and natural shave cream and its as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li> YouTube can help you, but you will spill some blood before you&#x27;ll be able to do it right.</li>
            <li> All clean, smooth and close.</li>
            <li> The key to success with this razor for me has been to use good shaving products with it,  to take my time, and  use a very light touch.</li>
            <li> Pros - good quality, easy to replace blades (open chamber) adapted system if you use the feather brand blades (auto load)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> BUT, when I do take the time, I am never disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had to purchase another Feather SS Shavette just in case my original gets dropped or something.  </li>
            <li> Then in comes the Feather - a smoother, closer, and more consistent shaving experience than all of the others.</li>
            <li> It is also important to use a good pre-shave oil or face perpetration,  a good brush, and a thick lather from a quality shaving soap or cream.</li>
            <li> We tend to romanticize straight razor shaving and it may be good for some purists who like nostalgia; but by and large if you&#x27;re in a hurry</li>
            <li> Cuts close and clean.</li>
            <li> The Feather SS is ideal for me because it uses disposable blades and doesn&#x27;t require sharpening like traditional straight razors.  </li>
            <li> The grip on it is outstanding and the shavette fits very comfortably in my fairly large hand.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t as large of a razor as I have thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly wish i had tried this type of straight razor first because that is what i would have stuck with.  </li>
            <li> , I am definitely glad I bought it and absolutely recommend it, but learn from my mistake and prepare yourself beforehand, and know what you&#x27;re doing before using it.</li>
            <li> but I love straight razors for the elegance of it and the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Not that the quality isn&#x27;t good, but the manufacturer definitely knows they have a niche product and they are charging a premium for it.  </li>
            <li> The ProGuard blades make this pretty easy.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of use now, it&#x27;s a remarkable shave without a single nick.  </li>
            <li> There are the Feather Pro, Super Pro, Pro Guard, and Lite.</li>
            <li> And Feather&#x27;s chief competitor, Kai, offers its versions of most of the foregoing, all of which will fit in the razor.</li>
            <li> Based on great reviews I got the Feather Razor Artist Club SS without ever using a straight razor, only using a double-edge razor before.</li>
            <li> I also got a pack of 20 of the Super blades which I haven&#x27;t tried out yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only a little experienced with straight razors and got a great comfotable clean shave the first time with no cuts.</li>
            <li> Practice on your arm or somewhere inconspicuous first!  </li>
            <li> Fantastic low-maintenance alternative to a western-style straight razor.</li>
            <li> this was helpful, and I hope you enjoy this razor as much as I do</li>
            <li> I really like it and use it every weekend when I can take the time and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Shave in the shower, you&#x27;ll rarely ever get cut.</li>
            <li> This Japanese straight feels more comfortable, secure and is easier to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> There are several detailed reviews already on here, so I won&#x27;t bother to elaborate.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback to this razor is that it is a bit pricey, but to be honest it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> However for this price, even discounted it doesn&#x27;t seem totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Awesome alternative to a traditional Japanese straight.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a good product, but It should have a lower price point.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, a single pass is an easy work-ready shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finding the right blade will take some experimentation.</li>
            <li> Those who use the classic &amp;#34;cut-throat&amp;#34; keep that in mind the first time you try it !!</li>
            <li> But these are quiet excellent, and at $0.50 a piece or less?</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was hoping that wouldn&#x27;t be the case because I love my traditional razors, but I definitely understand why they made that claim.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the proper angle and touch, you will really get an amazingly close shave.  </li>
            <li> , have a few more shaves under my belt, and I&#x27;m shaving much much better with it.  </li>
            <li> I like this razor very much.</li>
            <li> As far as the razor goes, it handles well, feels perfect in your hand, and is a definite improvement over the standard folding straight razor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first shave with it was super tricky as it was my first time using a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I find this razor to be of excellent quality, far above many of the lesser designs/brands available at major American retailers.</li>
            <li> Good, adequate weight (although may be lighter than some folding handles if you prefer a very heavy feel), with a rubber grip.</li>
            <li> You CANNOT shave against the grain on the first pass.</li>
            <li> Even with the ProGuard blades you can really cut yourself!</li>
            <li> I also watched Geo fat boy&#x27;s videos on Youtube before attempting my first shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I still have a couple fading scars from that first shave with the heasitant hand...</li>
            <li> a lot before I took to my first shave.  </li>
            <li> The first razor I bought was a cheaper version of this model, the Sam Seong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just got my Feather in the mail and tried it out for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Wear pants your first couple of time shaving...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Theres a learning curve, you will cut your face at first.</li>
            <li> After using for the first week, I expect to get 4 shaves out of a blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of notes:&lt;br /&gt;-I seem to be getting 7-10 shaves out of the blades, depending on how many passes I do on a regular day.  </li>
            <li> I now feel comfortable using either the ProGuard or the Professional  blades.  </li>
            <li> As far as straight razors go, this razor is fan-frickin-tastic!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for people who already familiar with DE razors and straight razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a good option if you don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money for the Feather SS, but the design of the Seong is definitely inferior to this razor.</li>
            <li> If you are new at straight razor shaving, as I am, I recommend getting a pack of the Pro Guard blades, and the Kai Captain Mild.</li>
            <li> Personally, I selected the &amp;#34;Feather Artist Club Professional&amp;#34; blades available from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really can&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re all thumbs with a straight razor you could give yourself an \\&quot;Al</li>
            <li> Just bought the DE Stainless Steel Razor.  </li>
            <li> With the Pro Guard blade I really did very well.  </li>
            <li> Easier to control then a straight edge.  </li>
            <li> Prefer this refillable straight to the folding handle type.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close and very well.  </li>
            <li> if you have no experience with a straight or shavette, go to YouTube</li>
            <li> Sometimes I remove the holding piece and slide it back into place, feels that smooth.</li>
            <li> Watch a whole bunch of videos on youtube before you start using it.</li>
            <li> : Been straight razor shaving for years now.  </li>
            <li> Very  well  packaged, and  promt  </li>
            <li> thanks  again.</li>
            <li> I can shave almost as fast as a safety razor and get the straight razor</li>
            <li> It really is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had to date</li>
            <li> Aside from the blades, I find the actual razor handle to be extremely comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li> After several uses, almost blood free.</li>
            <li> It turns out that that really isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> It turns out that that really isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> I started using this razor almost a month ago, having never used a straight razor before.  </li>
            <li> Learning to use a straight razor is like learning to ride a bicycle.</li>
            <li> The packaging was better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Could a professional honemeister tailor a better edge for an individual?</li>
            <li> and although it&#x27;s tricky to learn how to use this properly at first (if you are new to straight razors), you will eventually get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all hard to pick up; my first shave with the Feather was excellent, and I anticipate all future shaves will be equally fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for the ability to use Feather blades, they are sharpe, offer a rounded corner version, and have more length than than some blades used in my other shavette holder.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the folding straights (possibly due to my experience with kitchen knives).</li>
            <li> That edge paired with the more rigid blades used in the SS makes for an extremely well controlled shave.  </li>
            <li> As I hone my own razors, I can say that I believe I can often sharpen my razors to a &amp;#34;sharper&amp;#34; edge, but I&#x27;d have a hard time honing them to a smoother edge as consistently.</li>
            <li> This razor is WAY better than a conventional straight razor -</li>
            <li> Pros: Solid, comfortable, easy to grip with grippy handle, easy to load, affordable, easy to clean, scary sharp, well weighted, well balanced.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend this product, but only if you&#x27;re not in a rush clean up.</li>
            <li> I use the feather professional blades with this, and one piece of advice that you should know when using a new blade, is that it is extremely sharp and very easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> This Japanese style blade gives better control of the angle with less effort, and just has a much more solid feel to it.</li>
            <li> get a decent brush, cream, aftershave (I also use a preshave cream)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Main reservation</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that stated that the SS promotes a better angle than the much more expensive DX</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I have several straight razors now and so far I have found this Japanese style is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The rubber handle stays grippy even when wet, and the design allow for smooth shaving with no hang ups.  </li>
            <li> yes this is not your normal straight razor, but it is MUCH MUCH easier to control than a standard straight razor or shavette.  </li>
            <li> The blades are quite sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> These razors are plenty sharp, AND smooth.</li>
            <li> It is my new razor of choice in all</li>
            <li> When you get this razor delivered, the first thing you realize is that you&#x27;ve probably bought items of similar quality from Target for around 10 bucks.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve never shaved with a straight before and are interested in traditional shaving, maybe with an eye towards the Japanese style razor?</li>
            <li> It is wicked sharp, and I cut myself many times the first few times I used it, but that&#x27;s just the trait of a high-quality blade.</li>
            <li> If you do a lot of straight razor shaving (professionally as I do, or just for personal use), this razor can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> That being said, &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; is far from all that matters where razors are concerned.</li>
            <li> but I will admit it really does give the closest possible shave.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely go through the learning experience again (differently I hope) to have the shave experience I do NOW.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew from experience that you have to have a soft touch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping my old folder for nostalgia.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend others to try it out if you like straight razors or are even just getting started out.  </li>
            <li> I use the Feather Professional Blades (outstanding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The securing mechanism and part is very well made, feels and holds the blade solidly.</li>
            <li> (btw I&#x27;m using the feather professional blades).  </li>
            <li> I picked up the Feather Professional blades.  </li>
            <li> The Feather SS Straight Razor is the ultimate shaving instrument.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Weber double edge safety razor, and decided to graduate to the straight razor.</li>
            <li> There are going to be some minor mistakes at first.</li>
            <li> EVEN WITH DUE CAUTION YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SUFFER SOME NICKS AND WEEPERS UNTIL YOU REALLY GET THE HANG OF IT.</li>
            <li> but i found its a very good razor handle a little slick when wet but works</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love it, and I&#x27;m seriously considering putting up my collection of vintage razors for sale...</li>
            <li> removal\\&quot;: The technique is with the grain first pass; across the grain second pass; and then you MAY shave against the grain to touch up some areas of stubble (but not the upper lip!) - increasing the angle of the blade to the skin on each pass.</li>
            <li> My understanding is that the super blades are sharper and longer lasting, but these are definitely the sharpest objects that I personally have ever come in contact with.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, Amazon has it available for significantly less, and I believe their price to be quite reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a few Dovo straight razors as well as the the a few Dovo shavettes on top of that I have around 10 safety razors from Dovo / Merkur, M&amp;uuml;hle, Gillette, Parker, etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave with the AC is incredibly smooth, and the blade is extremely sharp - something I expected from Feather&#x27;s reputation for DE blades.</li>
            <li> to other reviewers, I have to respectfully disagree about a few items I&#x27;ve read:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> the last several years, I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of money, first on DE and SE safety razors, then later on straight razors, hones, and strops.  </li>
            <li> This was completely my fault, and NOT the razor&#x27;s, because I tried to shave the opposite side of my face with my dominant hand instead of switching hands, like you&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re a shave geek like I am, with a serious case of RAD (razor acquisition disorder), who wants to try straight razor shaving without the chores of stropping, honing, etc., or whether you&#x27;re a veteran straight razor shaver, I think you&#x27;ll find this a terrific tool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a long time straight razor user who enjoys traditional kamisori razors along with traditional straights.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and works extremely well with a variety of gel, soap and cream shaving products.</li>
            <li> But that being said, I&#x27;ve been shaving with conventional straight razors for a while</li>
            <li> I think it gives me a bit more control than the folding handles I&#x27;ve used in the past, and the slightly shorter handle allows me to get some angles</li>
            <li> The first shave gave me quite a few nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> The first couple times I used this I was getting a lot of razor burn and several knicks, but patience and a slow steady shave is starting to produce the results I was</li>
            <li> This is not to put down the product: It&#x27;s very well crafted.</li>
            <li> The handle is easily big enough for my larger hands and the smaller blade length makes the &#x27;careful&#x27; elements of the shave much easier.  </li>
            <li> I mean literally it is a fun shave, you don&#x27;t have to worry about stropping and honing because its a shavette.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional barber and have been using a Feather Nape and a Feather Artist SS for quite some time, but have been very curious about moving to a Japanese style razor.  </li>
            <li> I read some other reviews where people mentioned that they would never use their old razor again.  </li>
            <li> If it had a cool red stingray leather handle than it would be, but the rubber handle, although functional feels chintzy and poorly portioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only shaved with it approx 10 times, but thought I&#x27;d review it based on my limited experience</li>
            <li> The blade of this handle only version must be managed more carefully and is less predictable, not sure why.</li>
            <li> In short, I cut my cheek pretty bad on my first attempt that will probably leave a one-inch scar.</li>
            <li> This item took a long time to arrive from Japan, but it was within the dates promised when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> In short, no matter how careful you are, you&#x27;re going to get cut.</li>
            <li> I have a problem keeping the blade sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Cons: Haven&#x27;t had it before now, only get to use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> This razor is  both hefty and sharp enough for me to allow it to do the work.</li>
            <li> trouble is I can&#x27;t find a decent place to set this razor down as I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll bump into it and cut my hand.</li>
            <li> So i don&#x27;t get to use a straight razor everyday because i don&#x27;t have time; so I use a safety razor and apparently I can do it quick without missing hairs or cutting myself (given how long people say it takes them to shave).  </li>
            <li> On a side note, I was surprised how small this razor is in person.  </li>
            <li> Watch the guy on You Tube first at least a few times.</li>
            <li> As stated by other reviewers, I tried using traditional straight razors for a long time, but tired of all the stropping, honing, which never gets it this sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned:  if you&#x27;re new to this style of shaving, use no pressure, take your time, EASE the blade on to your face rather than just setting down on your skin, and keep your angle fairly small, about 20 to 30 degrees.</li>
            <li> razor is little smaller than I had imagined.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve nicked myself a couple of times when I went to grab it (but entirely my own stupid fault) .</li>
            <li> One has to be careful and take time while getting used to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time through only got a few nicks.  </li>
            <li> The fact is that Feather has been manufacturing razor blades for a LONG time, and they have their technique and quality control down to a science.</li>
            <li> I have to go extremely slow because the blades I bought, the Feather Professional, are the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve come across in my lifetime and are pretty scary to use, and I&#x27;m learning which shaving angles work well without getting into my skin.</li>
            <li> Tough beard, very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> - learn to use both hands to shave, cut yourself if your beard is stubborn, not a quick process, requires patience and time.</li>
            <li> Took a little bit to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The DX is a little heavier which I like.  </li>
            <li> first couple times I shaved with the SS Shavette, it felt a little awkward, I nicked myself a few times, and had trouble shaving close under my jawline.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does take a little longer to shave, but you cannot beat the closeness of this shave.</li>
            <li> you can probably tell I&#x27;m having perhaps a little remorse over the price but not the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little nervous about the sharpness of the blades when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be a little hurried</li>

            <li> these are not cheap</li>
            <li> Remember SLOW and CAREFUL!!</li>
            <li> Double edge, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Just go slow, focus on your angle and technique, and you&#x27;ll do fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this with the Feather &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; blades for thick beards and it just glides.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to and not really for the faint hearted!</li>

            <li> Very nice razor giving an excellent shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few thoughts and bit of background:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long time straight razor user who enjoys traditional kamisori razors along with traditional straights. Additionally, I have a great respect for Japanese craftsmanship, and I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase a Feather kamisori for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyone who, like me, wonders what the differences are between the blades for the artist club razors are, I&#x27;d recommend doing an internet search for them. I don&#x27;t have the exact URL for it, but there is a nice diagram out there demonstrating the differences between the styles. Personally, I selected the &amp;#34;Feather Artist Club Professional&amp;#34; blades available from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to other reviewers, I have to respectfully disagree about a few items I&#x27;ve read:&lt;br /&gt;1. I find this razor to be of excellent quality, far above many of the lesser designs/brands available at major American retailers. This isn&#x27;t junk, and it isn&#x27;t cheap by any means. Fit and finish are excellent, but I think the MSRP of $150 is steep. Obviously, Amazon has it available for significantly less, and I believe their price to be quite reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;2. The blades are quite sharp and smooth. That being said, &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; is far from all that matters where razors are concerned. These razors are plenty sharp, AND smooth. As I hone my own razors, I can say that I believe I can often sharpen my razors to a &amp;#34;sharper&amp;#34; edge, but I&#x27;d have a hard time honing them to a smoother edge as consistently. The fact is that Feather has been manufacturing razor blades for a LONG time, and they have their technique and quality control down to a science. My $0.02 is that these blades were no exception. Could a professional honemeister tailor a better edge for an individual? Maybe - maybe not. But these are quiet excellent, and at $0.50 a piece or less? They really can&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle is different from either traditionalstraights or kamisori blades. It&#x27;s not at all hard to pick up; my first shave with the Feather was excellent, and I anticipate all future shaves will be equally fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never shaved with a straight before and are interested in traditional shaving, maybe with an eye towards the Japanese style razor? Try it! Just go slow, focus on your angle and technique, and you&#x27;ll do fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a really nice product that I&#x27;m now very happy to own!</li>
            <li> This item took a long time to arrive from Japan, but it was within the dates promised when I ordered it.  I am so used to things from Amazon arriving in a day or two I guess....  That having been said, I am thrilled with the razor.  I am a professional barber and have been using a Feather Nape and a Feather Artist SS for quite some time, but have been very curious about moving to a Japanese style razor.  After using it for a couple of days now, I absolutely love it.  It is my new razor of choice in all applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order one of these, it&#x27;s worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re a shave geek like I am, with a serious case of RAD (razor acquisition disorder), who wants to try straight razor shaving without the chores of stropping, honing, etc., or whether you&#x27;re a veteran straight razor shaver, I think you&#x27;ll find this a terrific tool. I like the fact that the handle doesn&#x27;t fold, and it&#x27;s somewhat cushioned so you can get a great grip. The ease of blade insertion and removal is superb, and the razor head slides apart to allow for a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the right blade will take some experimentation. There are the Feather Pro, Super Pro, Pro Guard, and Lite. And Feather&#x27;s chief competitor, Kai, offers its versions of most of the foregoing, all of which will fit in the razor. If you are new at straight razor shaving, as I am, I recommend getting a pack of the Pro Guard blades, and the Kai Captain Mild. My face prefers the Kai Captain Mild in this razor over the Feather Pro, and the Pro Guards seem to be quite good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned:  if you&#x27;re new to this style of shaving, use no pressure, take your time, EASE the blade on to your face rather than just setting down on your skin, and keep your angle fairly small, about 20 to 30 degrees. EVEN WITH DUE CAUTION YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SUFFER SOME NICKS AND WEEPERS UNTIL YOU REALLY GET THE HANG OF IT. DON&#x27;T BE DISCOURAGED! Keep the styptic pencil at hand, and enjoy the process of learning how to shave with this.</li>
            <li> We tend to romanticize straight razor shaving and it may be good for some purists who like nostalgia; but by and large if you&#x27;re in a hurry it&#x27;s a bad idea, and just not worth the hassle when a DE razor will give you a barbershop quality shave. This is not to put down the product: It&#x27;s very well crafted. One caveat: It has a learning curve: In short, no matter how careful you are, you&#x27;re going to get cut. You CANNOT shave against the grain on the first pass. Think \\&quot;incremental beard removal\\&quot;: The technique is with the grain first pass; across the grain second pass; and then you MAY shave against the grain to touch up some areas of stubble (but not the upper lip!) - increasing the angle of the blade to the skin on each pass. Very short strokes when you get to the chin, take your time. Stretch the skin up over the jaw line especially under the ear. It takes getting used to but I will admit it really does give the closest possible shave. For ease of use, nothing IMO beats a DE razor, shaving oil, brush with shaving soap and good blades - cheapest, most practical way to go. Shave in the shower, you&#x27;ll rarely ever get cut. All clean, smooth and close. Double edge, you can&#x27;t go wrong. If you&#x27;re all thumbs with a straight razor you could give yourself an \\&quot;Al Capone\\&quot;. Remember SLOW and CAREFUL!! Watch the guy on You Tube first at least a few times. This razor is WAY better than a conventional straight razor - I doubt anyone can ever hone a razor to the sharpness of Feather blades just remember the learning curve and take your time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic low-maintenance alternative to a western-style straight razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for shaving my head. The ProGuard blades make this pretty easy. Great care is still required! Even with the ProGuard blades you can really cut yourself! Watch some videos and read the shaving forums before use and you&#x27;ll have a better experience!</li>
            <li> best razor i ever touched my face with</li>
            <li> This razor is really good.  My first shave with it was super tricky as it was my first time using a straight razor.  The first shave gave me quite a few nicks and cuts.  However, I got the hang of this on the second shave and it was one of my best shaves ever!  I also watched Geo fat boy&#x27;s videos on Youtube before attempting my first shave.  I also own a Merkur FUTUR and plan on using both from time to time.  I highly recommend this for people who already familiar with DE razors and straight razors.  THIS RAZOR IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS!</li>
            <li> Practice on your arm or somewhere inconspicuous first!  After a couple months of use now, it&#x27;s a remarkable shave without a single nick.  I would absolutely go through the learning experience again (differently I hope) to have the shave experience I do NOW.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I still have a couple fading scars from that first shave with the heasitant hand...</li>
            <li> Took a little bit to get the hang of it. Great quality and nice to have removable blades so I don&#x27;t have to hone/sharpen.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product! Construction is solid. It holds the disposable blade securely, yet replacing the blade is very easy and quick. I use this razor for my face and head. It&#x27;s perfect for making accurate lines too.</li>
            <li> Based on great reviews I got the Feather Razor Artist Club SS without ever using a straight razor, only using a double-edge razor before. In short, I cut my cheek pretty bad on my first attempt that will probably leave a one-inch scar. This was completely my fault, and NOT the razor&#x27;s, because I tried to shave the opposite side of my face with my dominant hand instead of switching hands, like you&#x27;re supposed to. As for the razor itself, it is very nice and well built, lightweight, and has a great, grippy handle. On a side note, I was surprised how small this razor is in person.  I&#x27;ve used the Feather Razor a few times now and it&#x27;s definitely taking some getting used to. I have to go extremely slow because the blades I bought, the Feather Professional, are the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve come across in my lifetime and are pretty scary to use, and I&#x27;m learning which shaving angles work well without getting into my skin. Just like anything else, it just takes practice, I am definitely glad I bought it and absolutely recommend it, but learn from my mistake and prepare yourself beforehand, and know what you&#x27;re doing before using it.</li>
            <li> This razor is about as safe to use as an electric shaver! It gives a very close shave and works extremely well with a variety of gel, soap and cream shaving products. I have several DE razors and another shavette...nothing compares to the this razor for giving a close and safe shave!</li>
            <li> I love Feather Products.  Just bought the DE Stainless Steel Razor.  Wanted to try using a shavette again after 35 years and bought this one.  I knew from experience that you have to have a soft touch.  With the Pro Guard blade I really did very well.  Once you get the proper angle and touch, you will really get an amazingly close shave.  I shave one pass with the grain and one across and it&#x27;s smoother then a 3 pass with a DE razor.  I saw a DX for sale on E-Bay and got it for $100.  I have now used both and found there is a angle difference in shaving.  The DX is a little heavier which I like.  I like the shorter handles.  Easier to control then a straight edge.  These are my weekend shavers when I have the time to perform Surgery the correct way.  I also noticed I wasn&#x27;t getting razor burns using the shavettes.  I also use a pre-shave oil and natural shave cream and its as good as it gets.  I watched GeoFatboy on Utube a lot before I took to my first shave.  He is very good at showing you the correct way to shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  I had a CJB knock off of this razor.  Very cheaply made.  The Feather is highest quality and great to use.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have to admit that I don&#x27;t use this everyday;...BUT, when I do take the time, I am never disappointed.  Prefer this refillable straight to the folding handle type.  This Japanese straight feels more comfortable, secure and is easier to maneuver.  Very happy that I have this razor over the folding type.</li>
            <li> I like this razor very much. I also have the Feather SS Artist Club folding version. I find I have an easier time gripping this straight handle and therefore keeping the best angle more easily. For me that means not nicking myself. I have yet to do so with this version of the Feather AC since I got it two weeks ago!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  There are several detailed reviews already on here, so I won&#x27;t bother to elaborate.  This is the only razor I still use.  I&#x27;m keeping my old folder for nostalgia.</li>
            <li> Love using this razor because it feels quite right in the hand and leaves a great shave, albeit old school.</li>
            <li> Pros - good quality, easy to replace blades (open chamber) adapted system if you use the feather brand blades (auto load)&lt;br /&gt;Cons - learn to use both hands to shave, cut yourself if your beard is stubborn, not a quick process, requires patience and time. YouTube can help you, but you will spill some blood before you&#x27;ll be able to do it right. Used it for 3months. Back to Gillette.</li>
            <li> As far as straight razors go, this razor is fan-frickin-tastic!!! The only drawback to this razor is that it is a bit pricey, but to be honest it is worth the investment. This is the smoothest/closest shave I have ever had, that includes barber shop shaves. I use the feather professional blades with this, and one piece of advice that you should know when using a new blade, is that it is extremely sharp and very easy to cut yourself. It takes a bit of practice to find your groove, but after a couple shaves it becomes muscle memory. You dont need to apply any pressure when shaving, just let the razor do all the work, the more pressure you apply, the more likely you will slit your throat lol. The first razor I bought was a cheaper version of this model, the Sam Seong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.ebay.com/itm/Sam-Seong-Kamisori-Style-Razor-Similar-to-Feather-Artist-Club-and-CJB-Kai/121554093639?_trksid&#x3D;p2050601.c100265.m3460&amp;_trkparms&#x3D;aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20140813131434%26meid%3D2bd2ae2b0b7c40a29fc9c80d70f1fe3e%26pid%3D100265%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D4%26sd%3D121554093639%26clkid%3D5190502105464886763&amp;_qi&#x3D;RTM2067267&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a good option if you don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money for the Feather SS, but the design of the Seong is definitely inferior to this razor. The lock mechanism of the Seong is not sturdy, but is manageable if you aren&#x27;t a stickler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a problem with storing the Seong, because there isn&#x27;t a safety razor case for it unlike the Feather SS: http://www.amazon.com/FEATHER-Artist-Straight-Safety-SNC-500/dp/B00LGGUYHG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428086481&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;feather+safety+razor+case , but a cheaper and in my opinion nicer case is this one that I just bought, and it fits perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M3638S/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful, and I hope you enjoy this razor as much as I do</li>
            <li> I have several straight razors now and so far I have found this Japanese style is my favorite. I also have feather folding razor, and a Dovo folding razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my favorite shave comes from the Dovo I have a problem keeping the blade sharp enough. With feather razors I get the best of both worlds. With the folding razors I find that the scales tend to get in the way more often than not. This Japanese style blade gives better control of the angle with less effort, and just has a much more solid feel to it.</li>
            <li> Just got my Feather in the mail and tried it out for the first time.  I am, so far, really impressed.  It shaves close and very well.  I was also really happy to find out that it comes with a pack of 3 of the Safety Guard blades and the snap on protection cover for the blade itself.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that it came with these.  I also got a pack of 20 of the Super blades which I haven&#x27;t tried out yet.  Overall great purchase and I am glad I have it.  I would definitely recommend others to try it out if you like straight razors or are even just getting started out.  It&#x27;s a great blade for beginners also.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase another Feather SS Shavette just in case my original gets dropped or something.  I&#x27;ve only shaved with it approx 10 times, but thought I&#x27;d review it based on my limited experience so far:&lt;br /&gt;I love it!  I have despised shaving for years, now I find myself chomping at the bit to shower and shave...seriously&lt;br /&gt;The first couple times I shaved with the SS Shavette, it felt a little awkward, I nicked myself a few times, and had trouble shaving close under my jawline.  I watched some instructional vids on YouTube, have a few more shaves under my belt, and I&#x27;m shaving much much better with it.  The grip on it is outstanding and the shavette fits very comfortably in my fairly large hand.&lt;br /&gt;1. must have&lt;br /&gt;2. if you have no experience with a straight or shavette, go to YouTube watch some vids&lt;br /&gt;3. if you are in a rush to shave, stick with a Gillette Mach X.  If you get the shavette, relax, take your time, enjoy the shave&lt;br /&gt;4. get a decent brush, cream, aftershave (I also use a preshave cream)&lt;br /&gt;5. I use the Feather Professional Blades (outstanding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend this product, but only if you&#x27;re not in a rush clean up.</li>
            <li> Wear pants your first couple of time shaving...its that sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Theres a learning curve, you will cut your face at first. But once you get the hang of it, its all good.&lt;br /&gt;Good product. Ships form Japan so it takes a while to arrive, mine took 2 1/2 weeks, which is good time considering.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Good, adequate weight (although may be lighter than some folding handles if you prefer a very heavy feel), with a rubber grip. The securing mechanism and part is very well made, feels and holds the blade solidly. Sometimes I remove the holding piece and slide it back into place, feels that smooth. I bought this razor for the ability to use Feather blades, they are sharpe, offer a rounded corner version, and have more length than than some blades used in my other shavette holder.</li>
            <li> Beautifully designed razor, great look and feel! Takes a little getting used to and not really for the faint hearted! I bought the razor for a different experience while shaving. One has to be careful and take time while getting used to it. Watch a whole bunch of videos on youtube before you start using it. Definitely worth buying. Keep it away from kids as there is no cover for safe storing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, best in his class</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor.  The rubber handle stays grippy even when wet, and the design allow for smooth shaving with no hang ups.  I use this with the Feather &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; blades for thick beards and it just glides.  It did take me some time to get use to the open blade, however.  Because it doesn&#x27;t fold into itself like a traditional razor, when I&#x27;m not paying attention I&#x27;ve nicked myself a couple of times when I went to grab it (but entirely my own stupid fault) .</li>
            <li> Great product - Nice workmanship</li>
            <li> I love this razor amazing</li>
            <li> Pros: Solid, comfortable, easy to grip with grippy handle, easy to load, affordable, easy to clean, scary sharp, well weighted, well balanced. Cons: Haven&#x27;t had it before now, only get to use it every other day.  My situation: Tough beard, very sensitive skin.  Thoughts: Been straight razor shaving for years now.  I find the sharper the blade, the easier it is to shave.  A razor without scales is easier to handle (when learning).  Feather is an unparalleled blade, without the work of sharpening.  Edit: After using for the first week, I expect to get 4 shaves out of a blade.</li>
            <li> I really like it and use it every weekend when I can take the time and enjoy it. As stated by other reviewers, I tried using traditional straight razors for a long time, but tired of all the stropping, honing, which never gets it this sharp. Main reservation --  I find the positioning of the blade and the angle of the blade holder, and the way the holder guides the blade are not as good as the folding version, which I used for a while before I got this. The blade of this handle only version must be managed more carefully and is less predictable, not sure why. But the grippy handle is great and overall, a nice  product.</li>
            <li> exelent  razor  will  never  go  back  to  anything  else. Very  well  packaged, and  promt  service  thanks  again.</li>
            <li> Terrific blade. I had never used a straight-razor before but after trying it I&#x27;m convinced this straight handle blade is the best option - it gives you much more ergonomic control. It is wicked sharp, and I cut myself many times the first few times I used it, but that&#x27;s just the trait of a high-quality blade. The grip on the handle is also terrific, same stuff Oakley puts on the ears of their sunglasses so they don&#x27;t fall off your head.&lt;br /&gt;Only trouble is I can&#x27;t find a decent place to set this razor down as I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll bump into it and cut my hand.</li>
            <li> The balance of this radar is perfect. Takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it you will be rewarded!</li>
            <li> OK so this is the best razor I have ever used hands down.  I have a few Dovo straight razors as well as the the a few Dovo shavettes on top of that I have around 10 safety razors from Dovo / Merkur, M&amp;uuml;hle, Gillette, Parker, etc.  (Yes i like razors)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love safety razors for the quickness but I love straight razors for the elegance of it and the closeness of the shave.  So i don&#x27;t get to use a straight razor everyday because i don&#x27;t have time; so I use a safety razor and apparently I can do it quick without missing hairs or cutting myself (given how long people say it takes them to shave).  Either or no joke with this razor I can shave almost as fast as a safety razor and get the straight razor feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes this is not your normal straight razor, but it is MUCH MUCH easier to control than a standard straight razor or shavette.  I honestly wish i had tried this type of straight razor first because that is what i would have stuck with.  I mean literally it is a fun shave, you don&#x27;t have to worry about stropping and honing because its a shavette.  Literally a great razor I am thinking of getting a second one to leave at work and for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Amazed this has become my shaving instrument of choice. Cuts close and clean. Good with shaping of beard and moustache. Stopped using my feather as-d2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs good technique. But amazing results. This razor completes me :-)</li>
            <li> Very nice straight razor.  Weight-wise, it is very light. Those who use the classic &amp;#34;cut-throat&amp;#34; keep that in mind the first time you try it !!</li>
            <li> I just upgraded to this razor from a safety razor using feather blades and the closeness of the shave is outstanding. It really is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had to date (btw I&#x27;m using the feather professional blades).  It cuts through my beard like a knife through butter and although it&#x27;s tricky to learn how to use this properly at first (if you are new to straight razors), you will eventually get the hang of it.  I recommend watching some videos on YouTube and looking at a shaving map which shows which direction you should shave each section of your face for the best shave.  The first couple times I used this I was getting a lot of razor burn and several knicks, but patience and a slow steady shave is starting to produce the results I was looks for.  Aside from the blades, I find the actual razor handle to be extremely comfortable in hand. It is light and balanced with a comfortable rubber grip.  It&#x27;s also very easy to take apart and clean when you are finished shaving.  Once upon a time I started off using schick razors. Eventually I upgraded to a safety razors and now I&#x27;m using the feather as artist. Yes, it does take a little longer to shave, but you cannot beat the closeness of this shave. It&#x27;s just a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> Great place to start.  Feels comfortable during use.  Quality product.  Recommend over folding variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time through only got a few nicks.  After several uses, almost blood free.</li>
            <li> Great razor with the reccomended feather blades. I&#x27;m only a little experienced with straight razors and got a great comfotable clean shave the first time with no cuts. However for this price, even discounted it doesn&#x27;t seem totally worth it. If it had a cool red stingray leather handle than it would be, but the rubber handle, although functional feels chintzy and poorly portioned. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product, but It should have a lower price point.</li>
            <li> When you get this razor delivered, the first thing you realize is that you&#x27;ve probably bought items of similar quality from Target for around 10 bucks.  Not that the quality isn&#x27;t good, but the manufacturer definitely knows they have a niche product and they are charging a premium for it.  As far as the razor goes, it handles well, feels perfect in your hand, and is a definite improvement over the standard folding straight razor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can probably tell I&#x27;m having perhaps a little remorse over the price but not the product.  That&#x27;s definitely the case.  But that being said, I&#x27;ve been shaving with conventional straight razors for a while and I absolutely love this razor.  I read some other reviews where people mentioned that they would never use their old razor again.  Honestly, I was hoping that wouldn&#x27;t be the case because I love my traditional razors, but I definitely understand why they made that claim.  This razor is outstanding.  The grip on the disposable razor promotes the perfect angle for shaving.  I read some reviews that stated that the SS promotes a better angle than the much more expensive DX but I can&#x27;t comment on that having only the one of the two versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is little smaller than I had imagined.  It&#x27;s also very light.  Both of those things turned out to be a good thing.  The handle is easily big enough for my larger hands and the smaller blade length makes the &#x27;careful&#x27; elements of the shave much easier.  I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t as large of a razor as I have thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the blades... This review is of the razor itself, but I don&#x27;t think it would be a sufficient review without mentioning the blades as well.  I picked up the Feather Professional blades.  My understanding is that the super blades are sharper and longer lasting, but these are definitely the sharpest objects that I personally have ever come in contact with.  They cut EVERYTHING they touch.  A light graze across your arm will leave a perfect bald spot on your arm.  They&#x27;re scary sharp.  Imagine getting your razor to the perfect sharpen, the perfect finish and the perfect strop.  Add an extra 15% to that and that&#x27;s where these blades are at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little nervous about the sharpness of the blades when I ordered this.  I tend to be a little hurried sometimes when I shave and I had imagined myself getting into troubles with this razor that a styptic pencil just couldn&#x27;t pull me out of.  It turns out that that really isn&#x27;t the case.  The blades are evil sharp, but the angle and control of the razor helps to adjust for that and you just get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.  I&#x27;ll still say that you&#x27;re paying close to $100 for a piece of equipment that should cost well under $20.  But since there isn&#x27;t anyone selling them at that price, I&#x27;d rather have paid what I did for it than to have gone without it. I did a lot of research before I made this purchase and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.leave a perfect bald spot on your arm.  They&#x27;re scary sharp.

            <li> these are not cheap but i found its a very good razor handle a little slick when wet but works well i dont always shave every day so this razor has to be good to take care of it</li>
            <li> Bought this b/c I wanted to try a kamisori style razor and I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad I did. I like it better than the folding straights (possibly due to my experience with kitchen knives).</li>
            <li> Great for the fine detail work, but first time users are going to bleed!</li>
            <li> Awesome alternative to a traditional Japanese straight. Equally easy to clean without the hassle of stropping and honing.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeballing the Feather replaceable blade razors for quite a while, but with the cost, I kept hesitating. I wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last several years, I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of money, first on DE and SE safety razors, then later on straight razors, hones, and strops.  Many of my purchases were vintage shaving gear, and many of them I enjoyed very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Then in comes the Feather - a smoother, closer, and more consistent shaving experience than all of the others. Why did I wait?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave with the AC is incredibly smooth, and the blade is extremely sharp - something I expected from Feather&#x27;s reputation for DE blades. That edge paired with the more rigid blades used in the SS makes for an extremely well controlled shave.  After shaving with the SS for a month or so, I don&#x27;t think I can go back to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes:&lt;br /&gt;-I seem to be getting 7-10 shaves out of the blades, depending on how many passes I do on a regular day.  Most of the time, a single pass is an easy work-ready shave. If I&#x27;m dressing up for a night out with my fiancee, a second pass is nice.&lt;br /&gt;-I took a chance and picked up the Japanese-style non-folding handle.. I&#x27;m glad I did. I think it gives me a bit more control than the folding handles I&#x27;ve used in the past, and the slightly shorter handle allows me to get some angles I hadn&#x27;t been able to easily reach.  The material used on the handle provides excellent grip for the fingers and prevents slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con:  I wish it came with a cover for the blade I could use when travelling for business. I&#x27;ve tried a couple home-grown solutions, but it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it, and I&#x27;m seriously considering putting up my collection of vintage razors for sale... I don&#x27;t see myself going back.</li>
            <li> The Feather SS Straight Razor is the ultimate shaving instrument. I started using this razor almost a month ago, having never used a straight razor before.  I had been using a Weber double edge safety razor, and decided to graduate to the straight razor. The Feather SS is ideal for me because it uses disposable blades and doesn&#x27;t require sharpening like traditional straight razors.  It is important to watch some of the U Tube instructional segments which feature this razor, and to begin with the ProGuard Blade.  Learning to use a straight razor is like learning to ride a bicycle. There are going to be some minor mistakes at first. But  after a week of using this razor, I was feeling much more confident, and getting the quality shaves I  was looking for.  The beauty of this razor is that it allows me to hold it in a variety of ways depending on what part of my face, and the angle I&#x27;m shaving. I now feel comfortable using either the ProGuard or the Professional  blades.  It is also important to use a good pre-shave oil or face perpetration,  a good brush, and a thick lather from a quality shaving soap or cream. The key to success with this razor for me has been to use good shaving products with it,  to take my time, and  use a very light touch. This razor is  both hefty and sharp enough for me to allow it to do the work.</li>
            <li> The razor is solid and my order came with the travel case. The packaging was better than expected.  This review was for the shipping and product before use.  Will update after I put it to use.</li>
            <li> Good  fast services excellent product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and excellent packaging. While my co-workers found the item a little cheaper, I had mine in my hands before theirs were even shipped and we all ordered on the same day!&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself, it&#x27;s perfection. If you do a lot of straight razor shaving (professionally as I do, or just for personal use), this razor can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
