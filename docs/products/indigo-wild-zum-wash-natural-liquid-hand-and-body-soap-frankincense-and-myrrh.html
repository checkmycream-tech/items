            <li>Love that!  </li>
            <li>I really LOVE this hand soap!</li>
            <li>Smells great and it is easy on your skin.</li>
            <li>Frankincense is pleasant but my favorite essence for both the liquid and bar soap is the rosemary mint.</li>

            <li>I love how it smells, my daughter always remarks that I smell good after I wash my hands.</li>

            <li>The scent stays with you but it is kind on the hands.</li>
            <li>The oils do moisturize nicely.</li>
            <li>It is also kind of drying.</li>
            <li>Nice lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably much better used as a hand soap than a shower gel, but I still love the spray!  </li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to find this in liquid form.  </li>
            <li>We have care givers and I seek wonderful scents to encourage frequent hand washing.  </li>
            <li>I will find another pump top in the house to use -</li>
            <li>cant put my finger on why i didn&#x27;t like it since i normally love this scent.</li>

            <li>We love this product.</li>
            <li>It is a great natural refreshing soap.</li>
            <li>Nice strong smelling soap that washes clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll see what other products Zum makes in this scent, because I think it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re ever in Kansas City, go to their home store - it&#x27;s too cool!</li>
            <li>I use it as a body wash because I love the scent, clean and earthy without the reeking like a head-shop.  </li>
            <li>EASY, PEASY,</li>
            <li>Strong scent, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>too strong of a smell maybe?</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love Zum and particularly the frankincense and myrrh scents.</li>
            <li>It is attractive next to the sink too.</li>
            <li>This way you can enjoy Zum Wash longer.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love the fact that this soap uses natural ingredients -- it smells incredible.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and refreshing (and not very common).  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of the Indigo Wild Zum Frankincense and Myrrh spray and thought I would love to use it as a shower gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the chance to use it once, and so far, I am pleased!  </li>
            <li>Love this soap has a very long lasting and wonderful</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at Whole Foods Memphis, but they stopped carrying it; I&#x27;m grateful to be able to get it on the AZ marketplace.</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much</li>
            <li>If you want a clean, fresh, gender-neutral body wash, Zum Frankincense and Myrrh is it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent, lathers beautifully &amp; soft on the hands :).  </li>
            <li>I quickly found Zum&#x27;s version on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It was quite a bit &#x27;thinner&#x27; than I expected, but it smells wonderful and leaves my face feeling really soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product recently at my super market.</li>
            <li>A great value, as compared to other body soaps!</li>
            <li>highly suggest all Zum products, but this soap is great for all skin types, especially if you have Eczema.</li>
            <li>little pricey but great product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick, so I dilute it with water &amp; use a foaming dispenser, &amp; it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and it comes through where the bar soaps fall short.  </li>
            <li>It makes you feel calm</li>
            <li>I loved it so much and am now on my second bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love Indigo Wild Zum Wash and Zum Bar.</li>
            <li>For one thing, this give \\&quot;Eau de toilette\\&quot; a more accurate meaning of toilet water.</li>
            <li>I feel clean after I wash (I use it as a body wash) where other body washes leave me feeling kind of oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this at my sisters&#x27; house and loved it - from the smell and the way it left my skin to using it as a facial cleanser - it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more olfactory based than the average, and this scent is absolutely unique!</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have gotten several compliments from people who have used it at my home :)</li>
            <li>i love zum and regularly use their lotion and bar soap, but this just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the bar in the shower as it seems to lather better.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of my recent trip to coastal California - woodsy, mysterious and free - like a warm hug.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>All about the scent and the gentle cleansing.....fabulous!</li>
            <li>I first used this at a friend&#x27;s house, who couldn&#x27;t tell me where to get it because she had received it as a gift.</li>
            <li>I first tried the Zum Frankincense hand soap in 2005.</li>
            <li>had the bar soap first, then got the pump.  </li>
            <li>I have this soap in my Guest powder room and it has such a lovely scent that I often have guests comment on it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is lovely soap that doesn&#x27;t dry with a nice fragrance that won&#x27;t make you sneeze and isn&#x27;t so strong as to scare dogs and small children.</li>
            <li>The scent is initially strong (that&#x27;s the woodsy part) but fades to barely noticeable</li>
            <li>well, it depends on how much you are willing to spend for an absolutely heavenly hand washing experience!</li>
            <li>I love the regular hand soap bar-very expensive, but love that kind of soap-purchased the bottle of zum wash-</li>
            <li>My hands feel fine afterward, and they still smell like Frankincense/Myrrh an hour later.  </li>
            <li>This really speaks to quality inspection while it is getting packaged not to the product itself</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle lather kick</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this soap Fast delivery</li>
            <li>have now put ALL Zum frankincense and myrrh products on my wishlist and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>The smell of the hand and body wash is still awesome, but quite frankly, I am disappointed that the scent dissipates so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would return to their original formula (or cleanse the manufacturing facilities to make it feel the same as before).</li>
            <li>The top of the pump bottle was not secure and there was product lost.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Have always been a fan of this scent, and this body soap gives off a fresh scent long after the shower</li>
            <li>It is now much more watered down and does not feel the same as before.</li>
            <li>If you like natural fragrances than this is for you.  </li>
            <li>Especially this  particular scent, I can only describe it as being a very comforting smell.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients and essential oils.</li>
            <li>It does not dry you out.</li>
            <li>I am a really big fan of this product as a hand soap, but unfortunately when I use it in the shower it makes my eczema break out, and left a kind of residual feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I love the product and the fragrance, I was very disappointed to receive it without the pump top.  </li>
            <li>It is a little spicy and very emoillent.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m more olfactory based than the average, and this scent is absolutely unique!</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have gotten several compliments from people who have used it at my home :)</li>
            <li> i love zum and regularly use their lotion and bar soap, but this just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the bar in the shower as it seems to lather better.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of my recent trip to coastal California - woodsy, mysterious and free - like a warm hug.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> All about the scent and the gentle cleansing.....fabulous!</li>
            <li> I first used this at a friend&#x27;s house, who couldn&#x27;t tell me where to get it because she had received it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Zum Frankincense hand soap in 2005.</li>
            <li> had the bar soap first, then got the pump.  </li>
            <li> I have this soap in my Guest powder room and it has such a lovely scent that I often have guests comment on it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is lovely soap that doesn&#x27;t dry with a nice fragrance that won&#x27;t make you sneeze and isn&#x27;t so strong as to scare dogs and small children.</li>
            <li> The scent is initially strong (that&#x27;s the woodsy part) but fades to barely noticeable</li>
            <li> well, it depends on how much you are willing to spend for an absolutely heavenly hand washing experience!</li>
            <li> I love the regular hand soap bar-very expensive, but love that kind of soap-purchased the bottle of zum wash-</li>
            <li> My hands feel fine afterward, and they still smell like Frankincense/Myrrh an hour later.  </li>
            <li> This really speaks to quality inspection while it is getting packaged not to the product itself</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle lather kick</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this soap Fast delivery</li>
            <li> have now put ALL Zum frankincense and myrrh products on my wishlist and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> The smell of the hand and body wash is still awesome, but quite frankly, I am disappointed that the scent dissipates so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would return to their original formula (or cleanse the manufacturing facilities to make it feel the same as before).</li>
            <li> The top of the pump bottle was not secure and there was product lost.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Have always been a fan of this scent, and this body soap gives off a fresh scent long after the shower</li>
            <li> It is now much more watered down and does not feel the same as before.</li>
            <li> If you like natural fragrances than this is for you.  </li>
            <li> Especially this  particular scent, I can only describe it as being a very comforting smell.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and essential oils.</li>
            <li> It does not dry you out.</li>
            <li> I am a really big fan of this product as a hand soap, but unfortunately when I use it in the shower it makes my eczema break out, and left a kind of residual feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I love the product and the fragrance, I was very disappointed to receive it without the pump top.  </li>
            <li> It is a little spicy and very emoillent.</li>
            <li> and so the fragrance is much less vivid.</li>
            <li> My little six year old grandson loves to wash his hands IF he has Memere&#x27;s soap to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is too expensive for how quickly the scent disappears.</li>
            <li> but I have to say that it does not seem at all moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling dry</li>
            <li> but I wanted to make it clear that I was not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I was told to repackage it and send it back for replacement but not worth the gas $ to take it to post office.  </li>
            <li> I am very particular about scents, and I am addicted to this one.</li>
            <li> Let me save you the trouble by briefly describing this rancid smelling hand soap.</li>
            <li> Put about an inch in an empty Foam Soap containter, then fill with water up to the line.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Buy the stuff, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having a problem with pesky other wordlys, using this and other products with Frankincense can help.</li>
            <li> PLEASE tape the bottles closed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing another bottle for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> I really am not a fan of patchouli, but there is a play on the scents that works well together!</li>
            <li> I finally founda  soap that has it under control, even with the hard water in this area.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff, and he&#x27;s a guy who typically could care less about what soap smells like.</li>
            <li> I use this soap everyday.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this to someone who enjoys the smell of anything worse than a overused porta potty.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for her usually around Christmas time.  </li>
            <li> Subtly fragrant all day</li>
            <li> Locking people who were alone in the house in their room and then turning on the gas stove, NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> This smells worse than Feces.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too expensive to keep buying.</li>
            <li> it is very thin and watery and had no smell-so needless to say I wont buy the wash again</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed with a ZUM product.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We really love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The soap cleanse my skin without drying it out!</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent, lathers beautifully &amp; soft on the hands :).  Would I recommend it for the price...well, it depends on how much you are willing to spend for an absolutely heavenly hand washing experience!</li>
            <li> My mom gave me a bottle of this for the holidays and I loved it but this version has been cut with water and so the fragrance is much less vivid. Very disappointed.  Especially since I bought 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and had read a review that this was their best smelling scent.  A friend had recommended &amp;#34;Frankincense and Myrrh&amp;#34; soap, though did not say where she had bought it.  I quickly found Zum&#x27;s version on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I loved it so much and am now on my second bottle.  I put mine in a glass refillable bottle that you add water to and it makes a foaming soap (bought the soap dispenser at Bed, Bath and Beyond), for the master bathroom.  I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll see what other products Zum makes in this scent, because I think it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Watery, not too sudsy on a washcloth.  I need to pour out a lot to make a lather.  Smells good,though.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff, and he&#x27;s a guy who typically could care less about what soap smells like.</li>
            <li> I tried this at my sisters&#x27; house and loved it - from the smell and the way it left my skin to using it as a facial cleanser - it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I am a really big fan of this product as a hand soap, but unfortunately when I use it in the shower it makes my eczema break out, and left a kind of residual feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I use it as hand soap in the bathroom and it works just fine. The smell is amazing, and I wish I could use it in the shower! I have gotten several compliments from people who have used it at my home :)</li>
            <li> While I love the product and the fragrance, I was very disappointed to receive it without the pump top.  This really speaks to quality inspection while it is getting packaged not to the product itself but I wanted to make it clear that I was not satisfied.  I was told to repackage it and send it back for replacement but not worth the gas $ to take it to post office.  I will find another pump top in the house to use -</li>
            <li> I rate this product in the stratosphere.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  I used to buy it at Whole Foods Memphis, but they stopped carrying it; I&#x27;m grateful to be able to get it on the AZ marketplace.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Zum and particularly the frankincense and myrrh scents. It&#x27;s deliciously earthy.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to find this in liquid form.  We have been buying it in bars for years. It is a great natural refreshing soap.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having a problem with pesky other wordlys, using this and other products with Frankincense can help. It definately lowered our poltergeist acyivity which was off the charts! Locking people who were alone in the house in their room and then turning on the gas stove, NOT GOOD. But this helped alot.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells, my daughter always remarks that I smell good after I wash my hands. Every time. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Strong scent, not overpowering.  We have care givers and I seek wonderful scents to encourage frequent hand washing.  This scent works for men and women.  Expensive - yes but in this case I think I get what I pay for.  Great for after any chlorine plunge - removes chlorine odor or does for me.</li>
            <li> If you want a clean, fresh, gender-neutral body wash, Zum Frankincense and Myrrh is it. Subtly fragrant all day, it&#x27;s gentle lather kick starts the day. Delicious!</li>
            <li> Before I used Zum, I used Dove for my Eczema as well as a steroid cream. I was on the hunt for something that would help and my step mom ordered me Zum to try. I love it! Especially this  particular scent, I can only describe it as being a very comforting smell. I am very particular about scents, and I am addicted to this one. I have the lotion and the wash, and in only one use I noticed a big difference in my Eczema areas. I finally founda  soap that has it under control, even with the hard water in this area.&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest all Zum products, but this soap is great for all skin types, especially if you have Eczema.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it is easy on your skin. It does not dry you out. Recommend using with the Zum Rub.</li>
            <li> i love zum and regularly use their lotion and bar soap, but this just didn&#x27;t work for me. i used it for a week or so and then bought something different and put this in the closet. too strong of a smell maybe? cant put my finger on why i didn&#x27;t like it since i normally love this scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite soap/lotion/bath lines and Frankincense &amp; Myrrh is their very best scent.  This distributor sent my items well packaged and in a prompt time period.  But if you&#x27;re ever in Kansas City, go to their home store - it&#x27;s too cool!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. The fragrance is wonderful. I&#x27;ve been using this at my bathroom sink for years now.</li>
            <li> Great as a hand soap at the sink. I actually prefer the bar in the shower as it seems to lather better. I have yet to be disappointed with a ZUM product.&lt;br /&gt;As for the packaging, Amazon could do better. The top of the pump bottle was not secure and there was product lost. PLEASE tape the bottles closed!</li>
            <li> I give it 10 stars !!! :-)</li>
            <li> I use this soap everyday. It reminds me of my recent trip to coastal California - woodsy, mysterious and free - like a warm hug. The scent is initially strong (that&#x27;s the woodsy part) but fades to barely noticeable (there&#x27;s the mystery ;) It makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> This soap is life-changing.  The moment it hits your skin you know you are home.  We will never be without this product (and the Lemongrass scent).  It&#x27; s simply perfect! Slather up and enter another world and then twirl on a plane of glass.  You&#x27;ll feel the power!</li>
            <li> I love Indigo Wild Zum Wash and Zum Bar. Frankincense is pleasant but my favorite essence for both the liquid and bar soap is the rosemary mint.</li>
            <li> All about the scent and the gentle cleansing.....fabulous!</li>
            <li> Great soap and a Frankincense and Myrrh is an incredible smell.  My little six year old grandson loves to wash his hands IF he has Memere&#x27;s soap to use.</li>
            <li> I should have done more research before buying this item, that would have been wise. Let me save you the trouble by briefly describing this rancid smelling hand soap. For one thing, this give \\&quot;Eau de toilette\\&quot; a more accurate meaning of toilet water. This smells worse than Feces. I would also describe this as what could only be imagined as the rotting oder of a deceased hippy floating in a pool of patchouli oil. Basically, what I am trying to say is... I would only recommend this to someone who enjoys the smell of anything worse than a overused porta potty.</li>
            <li> My very favorite bath accompaniment--well, there is the glass of Cabernet....</li>
            <li> If you like natural fragrances than this is for you.  The scent hangs on even after drying your hands.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Found this fragrance by chance at a friend&#x27;s home.  My son in law commented on it. I bought one for each man on my Christmas gift as a stocking stuffer.  They all are using it and like it.  Manly.</li>
            <li> Keep making this Zum.Great hand soap.</li>
            <li> ...can&#x27;t use anything else now...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and leaves your skin in great shape.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love the fact that this soap uses natural ingredients -- it smells incredible.  I just purchased my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in my guest bath and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> I first used this at a friend&#x27;s house, who couldn&#x27;t tell me where to get it because she had received it as a gift. I have very sensitive skin...almost all fragrances bother me. This is lovely soap that doesn&#x27;t dry with a nice fragrance that won&#x27;t make you sneeze and isn&#x27;t so strong as to scare dogs and small children.</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much but it&#x27;s just too expensive to keep buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the Zum Body washes. They&#x27;re all good. All natural ingredients and essential oils. The shower smells good all the time from using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this soap has a very long lasting and wonderful sent a little goes a long way recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of this product. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Frankincense &amp; Myrrh is my all-time favorite scent from Zum and this great liquid soap is a wonderful way to indulge yourself. The scent stays with you but it is kind on the hands.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have the bar soap and bath salts.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and it comes through where the bar soaps fall short.  I use it as a body wash because I love the scent, clean and earthy without the reeking like a head-shop.  It is a soap, however, so it&#x27;s dries out my skin. I&#x27;m 40, a man, so my skin isn&#x27;t youthful and supple.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to look for some lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, buy it for the scent.  I&#x27;m going to get the laundry detergent next.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of the Indigo Wild Zum Frankincense and Myrrh spray and thought I would love to use it as a shower gel.  The smell of the hand and body wash is still awesome, but quite frankly, I am disappointed that the scent dissipates so quickly.  It&#x27;s probably much better used as a hand soap than a shower gel, but I still love the spray!  Overall, it is too expensive for how quickly the scent disappears.</li>
            <li> I love the regular hand soap bar-very expensive, but love that kind of soap-purchased the bottle of zum wash-it was 15.00 it is very thin and watery and had no smell-so needless to say I wont buy the wash again I will stick with the bar zum.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Lathers great. What else would you want?</li>
            <li> Dont care for the scent.  The oils do moisturize nicely.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a spa experience with fragrance included this one will disappoint.It is also kind of drying.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  It doesn&#x27;t smell girly he say.  Smells good in the bathroom. It is a little spicy and very emoillent.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Nice lather.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this soap Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Nice strong smelling soap that washes clean.  Seems more like Sandlewood to me.  Used at a friends house and had to have it!</li>
            <li> I first tried the Zum Frankincense hand soap in 2005. Since then the formula has changed. It is now much more watered down and does not feel the same as before. I wish they would return to their original formula (or cleanse the manufacturing facilities to make it feel the same as before). I like the fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t suck, but its not the same as before.</li>
            <li> little pricey but great product</li>
            <li> The soap smells wonderful but the soap leaked in the box and I only got about 3/4 of the product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels good. I like it a lot. Great product and I will buy it again when I run out for sure.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but I have to say that it does not seem at all moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling dry</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It was quite a bit &#x27;thinner&#x27; than I expected, but it smells wonderful and leaves my face feeling really soft.  Will defiantly purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  It makes you feel calm and I get compliments when I wash my hands with it.</li>
            <li> Have always been a fan of this scent, and this body soap gives off a fresh scent long after the shower</li>
            <li> Nothing else to say.  Best soap around.  Love it love it love it love it.  Buy the stuff, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this scent more than life itself.  had the bar soap first, then got the pump.  EASY, PEASY, LOVE It!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. It has a great smell, doesn&#x27;t require a lot to wash, and rinses easily. It is attractive next to the sink too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more olfactory based than the average, and this scent is absolutely unique! The fragrance lasts on your skin for hours - and HOURS! A great value, as compared to other body soaps! Just a delightful, Oriental spice with undertones of jasmine! I use the bar soap, too! Great product!</li>
            <li> I have this soap in my Guest powder room and it has such a lovely scent that I often have guests comment on it.</li>
            <li> The produce blew out in the mail and was returned.</li>
            <li> This item just arrived in the mail.  I&#x27;ve had the chance to use it once, and so far, I am pleased!  The scent is lovely and refreshing (and not very common).  My hands feel fine afterward, and they still smell like Frankincense/Myrrh an hour later.  Love that!  I&#x27;ll be purchasing another bottle for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never find a hand and body wash that smells this good.  I love this stuff.  The scent lingers in the bathroom after you use it too.  Thank you Zum!!</li>
            <li> I use it for shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this product recently at my super market. I love the smell. I really am not a fan of patchouli, but there is a play on the scents that works well together! I feel clean after I wash (I use it as a body wash) where other body washes leave me feeling kind of oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now put ALL Zum frankincense and myrrh products on my wishlist and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this hand soap! It smells so amazing! It&#x27;s very thick, so I dilute it with water &amp; use a foaming dispenser, &amp; it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;ve bought it twice, &amp; will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely good. Like you can feel it working as soon as you put it on your skin. I would more recomend this as a face wash to people with more oily skin.</li>
            <li> helps in healing my body</li>
            <li> My mom loves this body wash and it smells wonderful.  I buy this every year for her usually around Christmas time.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> We love this product.It is a bit pricey, so we dilute.  Put about an inch in an empty Foam Soap containter, then fill with water up to the line. This way you can enjoy Zum Wash longer. We use in the shower, and for hand soap.</li>
            <li> 2nd bottle and counting!!</li>
