            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>I totally love Camay Bath Soap.</li>
            <li>This is the most pleasant-smelling, moisturizing soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I have used Camay for years and years, so I was stunned when it seemed to disappear from most grocery and drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I would love to know just why that happened.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask of soap?  </li>
            <li>You can ask for softer skin and you will get it for sure with Camay.       </li>
            <li>We love this Camay soap and have used it since we were kids.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering more of these</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to get it.</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon has it and at a better price.</li>
            <li>As stated in the discription &amp;#34;Camay Bath 3-Bar pack of 4&amp;#34;, which would have been the best price of several listings for the product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Camay soap for 20 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best cleansing soap - don&#x27;t know why we can&#x27;t find it in a local brick/mortar store.</li>
            <li>many caused my skin to break out</li>
            <li>So glad to have found this product here.</li>
            <li>So glad to find Camay again....</li>
            <li>Have used other beauty bars containing moisturizing creams, but this has always been the best for me because it does not seem to cause blackheads.  </li>
            <li>Does not disintegrate easily.</li>
            <li>I love camay and the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The camay that I always remembered is no longer available.</li>
            <li>I bought this because another reviewer said that these were the original Camay soap and they are.  </li>
            <li>He was so excited when I found it and was able to get it in bulk, as it&#x27;s the only kind of soap he will use.</li>
            <li>In my 20s, I used and loved Camay for its soft, fresh scent and mildness.</li>
            <li>It appeared that I was ordering four packages of three bars (12 total) which would have been a good price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and much prefer bar soap to liquids and body washes.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I had hoped in hard water, but it still smells nice -- nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>, it smells so fresh and clean and it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to get this product--it is hard to find and Amazon makes it so easy.  </li>
            <li>Brings back such good memories, and already after 3 days of using, my face is soft as a rose petal.</li>
            <li>and u really need something that has an conditioning while u clean, and this soap really does</li>
            <li>It has been dificult to find this product in local stores for my wife (her favorite soap).</li>
            <li>After this product was taken out of the supermarkets and touted as a beauty bar sold only online the fragrance was changed and not for the better.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>When they stopped carrying it, I had to try so many different kinds and</li>
            <li>The smell is sour and ammonia-like under the initial floral blast, and the soap itself is incredibly drying--</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Fast service and reliable!</li>
            <li>I love camay and although it may not be  for everyone, it is soft and not harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li>A old fashioned product that&#x27;s tried and true.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t available in our local stores so enjoy getting it shipped regularly to my house.  </li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and holds up very well in the shower.</li>
            <li>so much so that we can&#x27;t even wash our hands with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product although I wish they cost a bit less.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sad that I can&#x27;t find it in stores, but I&#x27;m happy to find it here.</li>
            <li>Its a steal as I was also ordering other stuff  at amazon that gave me free shipping for my order.</li>
            <li>I requested a refund, which was granted w/no problems and completely hassle-free!</li>
            <li>That gentle Camay fragrance takes me back many moons, and it spells one thing so plain -- \\&quot;CLEAN\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>(it didn&#x27;t matter that it was for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Really a shame, that this American icon can no longer be bought in a store.</li>
            <li>We use Irish Spring normally and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this stuff leaves a noticeable chalky film and makes us itch!</li>
            <li>Be aware that this is the USA version 4 oz bar and not the International version which is different.</li>
            <li>THIS Camay, is the real deal and I will be ordering this for years to come and as long as it is offered.</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance that fades away and does not linger like other soaps.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Safeway and other regular grocery stores used to carry it 20+ years ago.</li>
            <li> Does not leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I found I just could not live without Camay, so just received another shipment from Amazon.com.</li>

            <li> It was as expected.  </li>
            <li> Leaves no scum behind.</li>
            <li> This item is not available in local stores and my wife was looking for it since few weeks.  </li>

            <li> Only soap I use and very hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult  to find a product that works for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However I bought a pack of 4 and thought I was getting 4 packs of Camay which are usually sold in 3 packs.</li>
            <li> My grandfather has used this forever and it has become increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> Too bad my local Kroger stores stop selling this.  </li>
            <li> The price is not too awfully bad, although it may seem a ridiculous  sum to pay for something you&#x27;re going to wash down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> Can&amp;#34;t go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> My reorder of the product after 15 years was gravely disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find in a store anymore.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this soap. Always bought it when we lived on east coast.  Cannot find on west coast</li>
            <li> I totally love Camay Bath Soap. I was introduced to it about 5 years ago. Since I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, I ordered a supply on-line. I recently used all that I had, so decided to buy a name-brand of another soap at a local grocery store. I found I just could not live without Camay, so just received another shipment from Amazon.com. This is the most pleasant-smelling, moisturizing soap I have ever used. And I will never be without it again.</li>
            <li> Got the Camay Bath 3-bar package delivered as promised and have used 3 of the 4 already.  The soap&#x27;s fragrance sent me down memory lane to the days when I didn&#x27;t have to pay for my stuff (where did they go?)...anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a similar experience - give them a try.  I&#x27;m pleased with the product although I wish they cost a bit less.</li>
            <li> Where I live we have hard water and u really need something that has an conditioning while u clean, and this soap really does, it smells so fresh and clean and it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Can&amp;#34;t go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> I have used Camay soap for years.  It is impossible to find in a store anymore.  Thank you Amazon, for having it online.  I bought two cases!</li>
            <li> It has been dificult to find this product in local stores for my wife (her favorite soap). Thanks to Amazon.com, I hope I will never run out again.</li>
            <li> Misleading ad. It implies that 12 bars are included.  I received 4 bars only. Rip off beware.</li>
            <li> This IS the Camay soap of by-gone days. I had ordered the &amp;#34;International&amp;#34; Camay and it didn&#x27;t smell, feel or lather  like the soap I have used for years. I requested a refund, which was granted w/no problems and completely hassle-free! I&#x27;ve made notes so that I do not ever re-order that knock-off soap ever again. THIS Camay, is the real deal and I will be ordering this for years to come and as long as it is offered. Very happy w/this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love being able to get this product--it is hard to find and Amazon makes it so easy.  I love the soap and it makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Great Service.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap. Love the scent. Does not leave my skin feeling dry. Isn&#x27;t available in our local stores so enjoy getting it shipped regularly to my house.  The discount for the subscription deliveries and free shipping are too good to pass up!  I don&#x27;t have to think about it or have soap on my grocery list.</li>
            <li> This item is not available in local stores and my wife was looking for it since few weeks.  Got 4 packs of 3 bar at good price.  Its a steal as I was also ordering other stuff  at amazon that gave me free shipping for my order.</li>
            <li> I have used Camay for years and years, so I was stunned when it seemed to disappear from most grocery and drug stores.  I would love to know just why that happened.  Anyway, not to worry, my dear -- all of a sudden there is Camay at Amazon.com! Hooray, hooray!    That gentle Camay fragrance takes me back many moons, and it spells one thing so plain -- \\&quot;CLEAN\\&quot;.  What more can you ask of soap?  Well,  I&#x27;ll tell you.  You can ask for softer skin and you will get it for sure with Camay.       The price is not too awfully bad, although it may seem a ridiculous  sum to pay for something you&#x27;re going to wash down the drain.  But believe me, it is worth every last (s)cent for what it leaves behind.     Sue Sharpless</li>
            <li> My husband like to use only camay soap.  Amazon is the only place that I can find it anymore and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.  It was as expected.  Worth the price.  Has a nice smell and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> We love this Camay soap and have used it since we were kids.  Be aware that this is the USA version 4 oz bar and not the International version which is different.</li>
            <li> I bought this because another reviewer said that these were the original Camay soap and they are.  I am ordering more of these so I will get them and not the other (maybe international) Camay.</li>
            <li> I am not happy. I love camay and the product arrived quickly. However I bought a pack of 4 and thought I was getting 4 packs of Camay which are usually sold in 3 packs. So I thought I was getting 12 bars for $18 not 4 bars for $18. I feel ripped off, but I suppose I should have clarified.</li>
            <li> The camay that I always remembered is no longer available. After this product was taken out of the supermarkets and touted as a beauty bar sold only online the fragrance was changed and not for the better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for year and can&#x27;t find it in my local supermarket anymore.  So glad to be able to get it.</li>
            <li> Grew up with this soap.  Too bad my local Kroger stores stop selling this.  Glad Amazon has it and at a better price.</li>
            <li> All the products I have purchased met my expectations</li>
            <li> I grew up using Camay and always loved the way it made my skin/face feel.  Have used other beauty bars containing moisturizing creams, but this has always been the best for me because it does not seem to cause blackheads.  Was so happy to find it online and for a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I wanted. however the advertising was misleading.  It appeared that I was ordering four packages of three bars (12 total) which would have been a good price. As stated in the discription &amp;#34;Camay Bath 3-Bar pack of 4&amp;#34;, which would have been the best price of several listings for the product. However it turned out to be only four bars ( one triple package plus a single bar and thereby a the highest price per bar of all the listing</li>
            <li> I have been using Camay soap for 20 years and love it.  It is the best soap I have found to take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleansing soap - don&#x27;t know why we can&#x27;t find it in a local brick/mortar store. It&#x27;s nice to be able to get it via ebay.</li>
            <li> Only soap I use and very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to know that Amazon still carries this soap. Safeway and other regular grocery stores used to carry it 20+ years ago. When they stopped carrying it, I had to try so many different kinds and many caused my skin to break out (it didn&#x27;t matter that it was for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;). Now that I found it, my skin is happy as before!</li>
            <li> Have been using Camay for years- glad I can still order it!</li>
            <li> Leaves no scum behind. Classic fragrance that fades away and does not linger like other soaps. Cleans well and holds up very well in the shower. Does not disintegrate easily. Yes I recommend it.</li>
            <li> In my 20s, I used and loved Camay for its soft, fresh scent and mildness. My reorder of the product after 15 years was gravely disappointing. The smell is sour and ammonia-like under the initial floral blast, and the soap itself is incredibly drying-- so much so that we can&#x27;t even wash our hands with it. We use Irish Spring normally and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this stuff leaves a noticeable chalky film and makes us itch! Terrible.</li>
            <li> Great product - Love it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the fourth time I have purchased this from Amazon. Each time I have receive 12 soap bars in total, this time I received a total of 4 bars. Amazon - Rip Off.</li>
            <li> Camay has always been my bath soap preference. Can only find on line. It makes my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I used to use Camay all the time and then it disappeared!  Nothing comes or came close to it.  I love the smell and much prefer bar soap to liquids and body washes.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Camay soap -- it&#x27;s been around for ages.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I had hoped in hard water, but it still smells nice -- nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> Husband loves Camay - he is happy he found it again  - as mentioned you cannot find it in stores</li>
            <li> Brings back such good memories, and already after 3 days of using, my face is soft as a rose petal. Really a shame, that this American icon can no longer be bought in a store. Thank goodness, it can still be bought on-line...</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this product here. My grandfather has used this forever and it has become increasingly hard to find. He was so excited when I found it and was able to get it in bulk, as it&#x27;s the only kind of soap he will use. Made an 87 year old very very happy!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, good price.  Good experience.</li>
            <li> I love camay and although it may not be  for everyone, it is soft and not harsh on the skin.  It&#x27;s difficult  to find a product that works for sensitive skin and this is great for me and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> So glad to find Camay again....used it when I was younger.</li>
            <li> A old fashioned product that&#x27;s tried and true. This soap is the best! I&#x27;m sad that I can&#x27;t find it in stores, but I&#x27;m happy to find it here. Fast service and reliable!</li>
