            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest. I bought these with the intention of returning them. I didn&#x27;t believe that they would be authentic. The price is just too low. I had a sample from my dermatologist and I did a side-by-side comparison. The package is identical, of course. The cream itself is also identical; color, scent, texture, and the resulting feel when applied. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs moisture and tightening around their eyes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate, in fact I think it feels very soothing when my eyes are tired. I have used this cream for over a year now, and I&#x27;m thrilled to find it at such an affordable price. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great for travel but as always have a pair of scissors handy as a lot will be thrown away in the tube.</li>
            <li> I ordered TNS Night Eye Repair and I received TNS Eye Repair (not NIGHT).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 30 days and I don&#x27;t see any results at all.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The small trial size tubes last over a week. Perfect for travel</li>
            <li> Used this product prior and the tubes are a convenient travel size.  Product originally recommended by office staff of dermatologist</li>
            <li> Cream goes on easy but does not soak in completely - leaves residue. No real change to firmness or reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li> Wanted to like it, but I think it&#x27;s causing some irritation/itching. Could be pollen since it&#x27;s that time of year but for now I&#x27;ve stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if you are supposed to use this for like an entire year or what but it did not do a single thing for dark circles, wrinkles, nothing.</li>
            <li> I found that there was a noticeable difference in texture and fine lines.  Product is a good eye cream for reducing crepiness.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at my derm&#x27;s office.  Buying the smaller sample sizes is not only less expensive than the large jar, but you are not dealing with the product deteriorating from oxygen exposure, and bacteria like you would with the jar.  Great value, and it definitely helps with the under eye area!  I have tried a lot of creams, as the only part of my face that is wrinkled, is my lower lids.  This definitely seems to firm and brighten.</li>
            <li> It caused an allergy, stopped using after first try.</li>
            <li> This product has kept the skin around my eyes looking young.  I&#x27;ve used TNS for over 4 years and would not switch products.  I bought these samples over 1 year ago and I&#x27;m still using them twice a day, every day!  Talk about a bargain.  It only takes a very small pea size amount to cover both eyes.</li>
            <li> They came in a little box perfectly packed. Brand new.  I love this eye cream.  My eyes looks very hydrated, but no greasy.  I used it together with her sister the up lifting serum. My lines are less visible now. I will Definitively recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Like this for traveling. Good results and I have terrible dark circles. Wish I had started using this product earlier.</li>
            <li> I like the SkinMedica products, including this one, but I did find that the sample tubes are a bit cumbersome. The packaging is poor as there is a lot of tube and not much product and it can be difficult to squeeze out just the right amount. As long as there&#x27;s a decent amount of product in the container, you generally get too much. I use a smaller travel-sized container to save the extra for the next time since you can&#x27;t put it back in the tube. Also, I found that it&#x27;s impossible to get all the product out of the tubes, so I snip off each and and cut the tubes open to get at the remainder of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TNS Eye Repair does seem to work well. I am prone to milia under my eyes and while this doesn&#x27;t treat the milia, it doesn&#x27;t make it worse like many eye creams do. Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy and does seem to absorb well.  I have been using this with a Clarisonic Opal to massage it in to the crow&#x27;s feet area. I say &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet area&amp;#34; because I literally don&#x27;t have any. Mine weren&#x27;t bad before starting the SkinMedica products, but at 50, I literally have completely smooth skin around my eyes, so I do like this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice eye cream for my sensitive skin at night. It is slightly thicker for night time use, but no so thick that I can use it in the am when on vacation and traveling with only this eye cream. It soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue under my eyes or feel tacky.&lt;br /&gt;The travel tubes are great and when my jar gets low and I have an open travel tube, I just empty it into the jar so that it doesn&#x27;t get old!</li>
            <li> It really has help to soften my wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now. I can see alittle result, but not totally improved. Will continue using it to see if it actually helps!!!</li>
            <li> Be patient because I did not see results for a few weeks and and now the results are quite visible. The first few weeks I used both morning and night but now it seems that my eye wrinkles have softened substantially so I just use this product at night.  My aesthetician recommended it as that is the only eye cream she will use. I can see why.</li>
            <li> Great price for an expensive product.  I prefer these smaller tubes for sanitary purposes and travel.....thesoapmaker.net</li>
