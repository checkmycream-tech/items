            <li>them in my hair and two more broke.</li>
            <li>THESE RED ROSE HAIR PINS ARE SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL.  </li>
            <li>Super Elegant!</li>
            <li>They are bright and shiny and look really pretty as part of an updo.</li>
            <li>PERFECT FOR LONG HAIR.  </li>
            <li>It was the perfect adornment in my daughter&#x27;s hair for her Military ball. :)</li>
            <li>I have struggled many times with other pins but these are truly the best ones I have ever used!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to add an extra bling-bling to your hairstyle for a special occasion like prom, wedding or any sort of party/celebration, these are perfect.</li>
            <li>The ends are fairly square, like the metal was cut straight across and there was no filing or plastic dipped on the tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they look like special jewels all ordained in your hair!</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and easy to pin into hair without snagging.</li>
            <li>Putting them in and out of my hair has been easy, and my hair hasn&#x27;t got caught on them.  </li>
            <li>This item was beautiful, low priced, and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>so if you have shorter hair or fine hair they will not work for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received a free product from Rbenxia for review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that might serve as decorations, and these hair pins really fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get an up-close detailed picture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do store these pins in a secure area</li>
            <li>Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;I received the &amp;#34;RED&amp;#34; set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are lovely little bright bits of color!</li>
            <li>The wires are quite easy to snap off of the decorative heads, and I was able to hot glue them to my anniversary card (see customer image).  </li>
            <li>These things look truly beautiful in the sun -- looked super with a red sun dress!</li>
            <li>Perfect for a dance or party or when you just want something a little special done with your hair.</li>
            <li>These pins are perfect for a wedding, prom or just a little sparkle in your day.&lt;br /&gt;I am blown away at the color, the detail and the workmanship!</li>
            <li>The pretty flowers and crystals sit perpendicular on top of the hair pin.  </li>
            <li>The red of the flowers are a pleasant bright red.</li>
            <li>The hairpins are pretty but some of the tops come off easily</li>
            <li>pin is slightly opened already, this helped me to be able to easily place them in my hair on my own.</li>
            <li>These were very pretty and well worth the cheap price I paid.</li>
            <li>The crystals catch the light while the satin finish on the red rose</li>
            <li>but they play dress up daily and this makes for doing hair much more stylish as they say.</li>
            <li>They are available in a nice variety of colors (10 different kinds!).</li>
            <li>I am sure my daughter will love the Christmas present</li>
            <li>These are very pretty</li>
            <li>very pretty...</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Super pretty!</li>
            <li>These are so pretty!</li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I really love the yellow flowers and will be purchasing some of the other colors as well since I am so happy with the quality of my red rose pins.</li>
            <li>It snapped right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And to get the full face of the flower and crystals, you have to stick them straight in.  </li>
            <li>Pretty and delicate :) love them!</li>
            <li>The red roses are made of very detailed metal.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>They are really pretty and decorative when it comes to putting them into a finished hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>While the pins are in place I do not feel any pain, they hold my hair exactly how I want them to just by sliding a pin into the desired area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are soldered, not glued, to the pins, so these pins are more durable than some similar ones.  </li>
            <li>The decorative pieces seem pretty stable for costume jewelry.</li>
            <li>These hair pins are pretty.  </li>
            <li>I bought these hairpins for my friend who is going to get married.</li>
            <li>Some of the stones were off-center and one of the flowers fell off during the shipping process, which shows that they are pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>They do look pretty</li>
            <li>They are pretty, but the soldering could be improved along with the packaging too.</li>
            <li>I want to have focus go directly on my hair when I walk into a room I add in these red rose flower pins to my hair style.</li>
            <li>The length of the pin is about 6 cm (pretty long) and there is a bit of wave in the midsection of it that allows the pin to stay in place better.</li>
            <li>Super classy!</li>
            <li>They would be great, I think, for a teenage girl going to prom or some other dance, or for a wedding if it fits your motif.  </li>
            <li>They are beautiful but if you don&#x27;t have very thick hair they won&#x27;t really work for your hair.</li>
            <li>and I have had many, many compliments on them, especially when I wear them with other clips.</li>
            <li>With such fine details to each and every flower.</li>
            <li>They really are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to have a very substantial up-do for these to stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;There is so much sparkle and shine</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li>really well.</li>
            <li>There are 20 pieces and they come in a small plastic tube with a lid, which I think is pretty nice for storing them.</li>
            <li>The pin is almost white silver color that contrasts nicely with the red color of the pins I got.</li>
            <li>so the heads do not break off, I take very good care of these pretty and delicate pins so that nothing happens to them, so I can hand them down to my child on her first dance.</li>
            <li>These little rose crystals were an asset to my attire for my 50th high school class reunion in November of 2014.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend these for when you are dressing up for a special occasion</li>
            <li>Starting with the Swarovski Crystals around the flower are full of sparkle.</li>
            <li>give a look that can be funky-trendy to classic vintage.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>If you have long hair, or you like to add on pieces to create a bun-type style or wear a French twist, you will find that these Rbenxia Red Rose Swarovski Crystal Hair Pins will make your do a real attention-getter!</li>
            <li>review is for the red version, which is a nice dark valentine red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Downside:  The ends are not rounded, and while I had no problems putting them in myself, when my adult son decided I needed a few more, he poked my scalp something fierce.  </li>
            <li>The pins make a lovely statement, especially against dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look cheesy at all, just the prettiest little roses with the perfect amount of sparkle and color combination.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try coating one with clear nail polish to see if that helps.</li>
            <li>I like that you get enough to really make a difference when doing your hair.  </li>
            <li>if they can withstand the wear and tear from a 6 and 8 year old they pass the test to me.</li>
            <li>so far none of the crystals have fallen out</li>
            <li>very cute&lt;br /&gt;BEAUTIFUL red color</li>
            <li>First package was fine; second had 3 broken clips.</li>
            <li>They are much shinier and more expensive looking in person.</li>
            <li>When doing an up-do, these little pins not only lend a special sparkle, they also help keep your hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for inexpensive ways to decorate the greeting cards I make and sell to benefit our local library, and you might be surprised at how pricey the tchotchkes that are made specifically for cards can be.  </li>
            <li>They are not closed, like bobby pins, but the ends are open.  </li>
            <li>Ends are VERY pointy and sharp!</li>
            <li>They have little sqiggly bends in the pins though, and that seems to really help them grip my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The center is a metallic rosebud, surrounded by clear crystals.</li>

            <li> These things look truly beautiful in the sun -- looked super with a red sun dress!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a dance or party or when you just want something a little special done with your hair.</li>
            <li> These pins are perfect for a wedding, prom or just a little sparkle in your day.&lt;br /&gt;I am blown away at the color, the detail and the workmanship!</li>
            <li> The pretty flowers and crystals sit perpendicular on top of the hair pin.  </li>
            <li> The red of the flowers are a pleasant bright red.</li>
            <li> The hairpins are pretty but some of the tops come off easily</li>
            <li> pin is slightly opened already, this helped me to be able to easily place them in my hair on my own.</li>
            <li> These were very pretty and well worth the cheap price I paid.</li>
            <li> The crystals catch the light while the satin finish on the red rose</li>
            <li> but they play dress up daily and this makes for doing hair much more stylish as they say.</li>
            <li> They are available in a nice variety of colors (10 different kinds!).</li>
            <li> I am sure my daughter will love the Christmas present</li>
            <li> These are very pretty</li>
            <li> very pretty...</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Super pretty!</li>
            <li> These are so pretty!</li>
            <li> No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really love the yellow flowers and will be purchasing some of the other colors as well since I am so happy with the quality of my red rose pins.</li>
            <li> It snapped right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And to get the full face of the flower and crystals, you have to stick them straight in.  </li>
            <li> Pretty and delicate :) love them!</li>
            <li> The red roses are made of very detailed metal.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> They are really pretty and decorative when it comes to putting them into a finished hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> While the pins are in place I do not feel any pain, they hold my hair exactly how I want them to just by sliding a pin into the desired area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are soldered, not glued, to the pins, so these pins are more durable than some similar ones.  </li>
            <li> The decorative pieces seem pretty stable for costume jewelry.</li>
            <li> These hair pins are pretty.  </li>
            <li> I bought these hairpins for my friend who is going to get married.</li>
            <li> Some of the stones were off-center and one of the flowers fell off during the shipping process, which shows that they are pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> They do look pretty</li>
            <li> They are pretty, but the soldering could be improved along with the packaging too.</li>
            <li> I want to have focus go directly on my hair when I walk into a room I add in these red rose flower pins to my hair style.</li>
            <li> The length of the pin is about 6 cm (pretty long) and there is a bit of wave in the midsection of it that allows the pin to stay in place better.</li>
            <li> Super classy!</li>
            <li> They would be great, I think, for a teenage girl going to prom or some other dance, or for a wedding if it fits your motif.  </li>
            <li> They are beautiful but if you don&#x27;t have very thick hair they won&#x27;t really work for your hair.</li>
            <li> and I have had many, many compliments on them, especially when I wear them with other clips.</li>
            <li> With such fine details to each and every flower.</li>
            <li> They really are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to have a very substantial up-do for these to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;There is so much sparkle and shine</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li> really well.</li>
            <li> There are 20 pieces and they come in a small plastic tube with a lid, which I think is pretty nice for storing them.</li>
            <li> The pin is almost white silver color that contrasts nicely with the red color of the pins I got.</li>
            <li> so the heads do not break off, I take very good care of these pretty and delicate pins so that nothing happens to them, so I can hand them down to my child on her first dance.</li>
            <li> These little rose crystals were an asset to my attire for my 50th high school class reunion in November of 2014.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend these for when you are dressing up for a special occasion</li>
            <li> Starting with the Swarovski Crystals around the flower are full of sparkle.</li>
            <li> give a look that can be funky-trendy to classic vintage.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, or you like to add on pieces to create a bun-type style or wear a French twist, you will find that these Rbenxia Red Rose Swarovski Crystal Hair Pins will make your do a real attention-getter!</li>
            <li> review is for the red version, which is a nice dark valentine red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside:  The ends are not rounded, and while I had no problems putting them in myself, when my adult son decided I needed a few more, he poked my scalp something fierce.  </li>
            <li> The pins make a lovely statement, especially against dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look cheesy at all, just the prettiest little roses with the perfect amount of sparkle and color combination.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try coating one with clear nail polish to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> I like that you get enough to really make a difference when doing your hair.  </li>
            <li> if they can withstand the wear and tear from a 6 and 8 year old they pass the test to me.</li>
            <li> so far none of the crystals have fallen out</li>
            <li> very cute&lt;br /&gt;BEAUTIFUL red color</li>
            <li> First package was fine; second had 3 broken clips.</li>
            <li> They are much shinier and more expensive looking in person.</li>
            <li> When doing an up-do, these little pins not only lend a special sparkle, they also help keep your hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for inexpensive ways to decorate the greeting cards I make and sell to benefit our local library, and you might be surprised at how pricey the tchotchkes that are made specifically for cards can be.  </li>
            <li> They are not closed, like bobby pins, but the ends are open.  </li>
            <li> Ends are VERY pointy and sharp!</li>
            <li> They have little sqiggly bends in the pins though, and that seems to really help them grip my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The center is a metallic rosebud, surrounded by clear crystals.</li>
            <li> If you put hairspray on, it might dull the crystals a bit, so think about adding them at the very end of your hair</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> Also it should be noted that the pins are around 2 inches long and NOT flexible</li>
            <li> The pins themselves are a silver color, and the decorations are tiny little red metal roses, with small clear rhinestones around them.  </li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> put up a very messy bun- with nothing holding it in place, just the ends of my hair tucked, and the put several pieces in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The roses were all at the bottom of the back broken off the pin.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s one of the products that I use in my hair or what, but after a few uses the colour on the roses fades quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The hair pin is approximately 2.5 inches long.</li>
            <li> At least half of them came with the flower popped off.</li>
            <li> My messy bun has held all morning!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I took one hank of hair, twisted and then wrapped it around like a pin curl, and stuck a single pin in.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t flexible so its hard to place how I had planned.</li>
            <li> The flowers are approximately a 1/2&amp;#34; across.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately 2 of mine were broken in shipment but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> 8 of the 20 hairpins came broken!</li>
            <li> :(((((((</li>

            <li> I loved them! I purchased them to go with the Red Floral Vine 3-Piece Necklace, Bracelet and Earrings Jewelry Set and they matched perfectly. I used them to accent an updo and they worked great! They are sturdy and easy to pin into hair without snagging.</li>
            <li> When doing an up-do, these little pins not only lend a special sparkle, they also help keep your hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the red version, which is a nice dark valentine red.&lt;br /&gt;The center is a metallic rosebud, surrounded by clear crystals. The crystals catch the light while the satin finish on the red rose give a look that can be funky-trendy to classic vintage.&lt;br /&gt;And you don&#x27;t have to limit yourself to an up-do.&lt;br /&gt;I took one hank of hair, twisted and then wrapped it around like a pin curl, and stuck a single pin in. It&#x27;s stayed up like that all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

            <li> These are cute and hold my hair up well, but I already had a rose break off of a pin. Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s one of the products that I use in my hair or what, but after a few uses the colour on the roses fades quite a bit. I&#x27;m going to try coating one with clear nail polish to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> These are lovely little bright bits of color! Great price! I&#x27;m wearing them in my hair for my wedding and they just bring the bling!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked nice, my hair dresses likes them.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely beautiful!! Rose and rhinestone hair pins, perfect for any occasion or add one or two to jazz up a simple up do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pins are sturdy, not flimsy so they can definitely hold a style. I love the design of these pins. They really are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a sample to try in exchange for a honest review.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous hair pieces.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Ends are VERY pointy and sharp!</li>
            <li> These are darling, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  You need to have a very substantial up-do for these to stay in place.  And to get the full face of the flower and crystals, you have to stick them straight in.  The pretty flowers and crystals sit perpendicular on top of the hair pin.  All of them are arranged the same; none are set on the side of the pin.  And, no, they do not bend--neither the pin, nor the solder point on the ornamentation.  I tried to bend the flower so that I could slip the hairpin in sideways and still see it.  It snapped right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free product from Rbenxia for review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for inexpensive ways to decorate the greeting cards I make and sell to benefit our local library, and you might be surprised at how pricey the tchotchkes that are made specifically for cards can be.  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that might serve as decorations, and these hair pins really fit the bill.  The wires are quite easy to snap off of the decorative heads, and I was able to hot glue them to my anniversary card (see customer image).  It&#x27;s an A2 (5.5&amp;#34; x 4.25&amp;#34;) card, so you can judge for yourself how small the decorative roses are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Product supplied by manufacturer for testing and review purposes***</li>
            <li> These were very nice looking and will go great with the dress I ordered them for.</li>
            <li> These hair pins are fragile. The roses keep falling off</li>
            <li> Lovely hair accessories! All in perfect condition and present! The red of the flowers are a pleasant bright red.</li>
            <li> Pretty and delicate :) love them! Great deal!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! The pictures do not do these hairpins justice! These are stunning!! With such fine details to each and every flower. Starting with the Swarovski Crystals around the flower are full of sparkle. The red roses are made of very detailed metal. Absolutely beautiful flowers! I have fine hair and I&#x27;m still able to twist my hair and use these hairpins to keep my hair in a bun. The hair pin is approximately 2.5 inches long. The flowers are approximately a 1/2&amp;#34; across. These pins are perfect for a wedding, prom or just a little sparkle in your day.&lt;br /&gt;I am blown away at the color, the detail and the workmanship! Absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;There is so much sparkle and shine I couldn&#x27;t even get an up-close detailed picture.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. I did not receive cash payment to write this review.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, so pretty and shining! Fast shipping and well packed. Very happy with the purchase! Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my wedding day!</li>
            <li> The hairpins are pretty but some of the tops come off easily</li>
            <li> This is a really cute decorative set of hair pins.  They are not what I consider bobby pins in that they do not hold hair up that well.  They are really pretty and decorative when it comes to putting them into a finished hairstyle.  I like that you get enough to really make a difference when doing your hair.  The pins make a lovely statement, especially against dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this product for test and review purposes.</li>
            <li> These were very pretty and well worth the cheap price I paid.</li>
            <li> Absolutely BEAUTIFUL! A big compliment to any up-do hairstyle! The perfect up-do hair accessory for a wedding, prom, dance, reunion, any social event, or fancy dinner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want to have focus go directly on my hair when I walk into a room I add in these red rose flower pins to my hair style. The eyes are attracted to these shiny, brightly colored roses and the pins stay in place even I am moving around a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each pin is slightly opened already, this helped me to be able to easily place them in my hair on my own. I have struggled many times with other pins but these are truly the best ones I have ever used! While the pins are in place I do not feel any pain, they hold my hair exactly how I want them to just by sliding a pin into the desired area. I do store these pins in a secure area so the heads do not break off, I take very good care of these pretty and delicate pins so that nothing happens to them, so I can hand them down to my child on her first dance. I really love the yellow flowers and will be purchasing some of the other colors as well since I am so happy with the quality of my red rose pins. I highly recommend these hair pins - truly more beautiful in person! Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> THESE RED ROSE HAIR PINS ARE SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL.  PERFECT FOR LONG HAIR.  YOU CAN USE THEM FOR ANY UP-DO HAIR STYLE OR BUN TYPE.  YOU WILL BRIGHTEN UP YOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS. LOVE THE PRODUCT AND SELLER.</li>
            <li> My wife and girls love these. No prom for anyone in this house anytime soon but they play dress up daily and this makes for doing hair much more stylish as they say. They seem to be nicely made, if they can withstand the wear and tear from a 6 and 8 year old they pass the test to me. Color is great and so far none of the crystals have fallen out so we are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive these from Rbenxia at a discounted rate in exchange for my review</li>
            <li> Super pretty! Super classy! Super Elegant! And you get  so many and they look like special jewels all ordained in your hair! It&#x27;s amazing every woman hair will look lovely in these jewels!</li>
            <li> This item was beautiful, low priced, and arrived quickly! It was the perfect adornment in my daughter&#x27;s hair for her Military ball. :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see these in my daughter&#x27;s hair prom night. They are absolutely gorgeous! They don&#x27;t look cheesy at all, just the prettiest little roses with the perfect amount of sparkle and color combination.</li>
            <li> These are so pretty! There are 20 pieces and they come in a small plastic tube with a lid, which I think is pretty nice for storing them. The pin is almost white silver color that contrasts nicely with the red color of the pins I got. The length of the pin is about 6 cm (pretty long) and there is a bit of wave in the midsection of it that allows the pin to stay in place better. The rose width is about 1 cm and the crystal is gorgeous - so shiny and eye-catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for decorating your hair when you wear a bun or some sort of fancy up-do hairstyle. They are available in a nice variety of colors (10 different kinds!). If you&#x27;re looking to add an extra bling-bling to your hairstyle for a special occasion like prom, wedding or any sort of party/celebration, these are perfect. The price is amazing for the set of 10 hair pins and the quality of them is definitely impressive. They look fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Free sample of the product was provided in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> These are a great way to dress up your hair. Perfect for a dance or party or when you just want something a little special done with your hair. They are bright and shiny and look really pretty as part of an updo. Sample received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty and I have had many, many compliments on them, especially when I wear them with other clips.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;I received the &amp;#34;RED&amp;#34; set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are soldered, not glued, to the pins, so these pins are more durable than some similar ones.  The pins themselves are a silver color, and the decorations are tiny little red metal roses, with small clear rhinestones around them.  Each tip is smaller than a dime - the tips are about the size of my &#x27;pinkie&#x27; fingernail.  They are a great size, so they look classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put up a very messy bun- with nothing holding it in place, just the ends of my hair tucked, and the put several pieces in my hair.  My messy bun has held all morning!  Putting them in and out of my hair has been easy, and my hair hasn&#x27;t got caught on them.  They are not closed, like bobby pins, but the ends are open.  They have little sqiggly bends in the pins though, and that seems to really help them grip my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside:  The ends are not rounded, and while I had no problems putting them in myself, when my adult son decided I needed a few more, he poked my scalp something fierce.  The ends are fairly square, like the metal was cut straight across and there was no filing or plastic dipped on the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a great value and are well made, and this is a generous supply.  7 have been holding my bun in place.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, or you like to add on pieces to create a bun-type style or wear a French twist, you will find that these Rbenxia Red Rose Swarovski Crystal Hair Pins will make your do a real attention-getter! These things look truly beautiful in the sun -- looked super with a red sun dress! I like the way they are constructed. The decorative pieces seem pretty stable for costume jewelry. Sample provided for review, and these are very nice at an amazing price for 20 decorated hair pins.</li>
            <li> These hair pins are pretty.  They would be great, I think, for a teenage girl going to prom or some other dance, or for a wedding if it fits your motif.  I tried them out, and they are sturdy enough.  If you put hairspray on, it might dull the crystals a bit, so think about adding them at the very end of your hair styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review, which this is.</li>
            <li> Beautiful addition to hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Got them out of the package. Four was broke.&lt;br /&gt;Used them in my hair and two more broke.</li>
            <li> The pictures don&#x27;t do these hair pins justice. They are much shinier and more expensive looking in person. Extremely happy with these!</li>
            <li> I bought these hairpins for my friend who is going to get married. They are even prettier than the picture, very shiny and beautiful. I think these will look great on her. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am sure my daughter will love the Christmas present</li>
            <li> Some of the stones were off-center and one of the flowers fell off during the shipping process, which shows that they are pretty flimsy. They do look pretty and I think it&#x27;s a good price for the number that you get, plus you can&#x27;t expect great quality.</li>
            <li> These are just beautiful.</li>
            <li> ~Very nice hair pins~Easy to use and good Quality~Well shipped~Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, great price</li>
            <li> Perfect and perfect price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for competition. Stayed in my hair well.</li>
            <li> 8 of the 20 hairpins came broken! The roses were all at the bottom of the back broken off the pin. :(((((((</li>
            <li> very pretty...I purchased these to go with my red dress I wore to a Christmas party. I have really long hair and they held my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; really well. Definitely recommend these for when you are dressing up for a special occasion</li>
            <li> I plan on using these in my hair on my wedding day. They are gorgeous in person and hopefully they go well in my hair</li>
            <li> At least half of them came with the flower popped off. They are pretty, but the soldering could be improved along with the packaging too.</li>
            <li> Dream catcher acceptable!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful but if you don&#x27;t have very thick hair they won&#x27;t really work for your hair. They aren&#x27;t flexible so its hard to place how I had planned.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Will look great in a updo. Unfortunately 2 of mine were broken in shipment but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Also it should be noted that the pins are around 2 inches long and NOT flexible so if you have shorter hair or fine hair they will not work for you.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 packages of 20 pins. First package was fine; second had 3 broken clips. Not packed with anything to buffer them.</li>
            <li> These came in very quickly and are very elegant looking.</li>
            <li> very cute&lt;br /&gt;BEAUTIFUL red color</li>
            <li> It was 10pcs not 20pcs</li>
            <li> These little rose crystals were an asset to my attire for my 50th high school class reunion in November of 2014. I put them in my hair. They were quite noticeable. I wore them to  the ball and I got a number of compliments. I was very pleased...  Mrs. J. M.</li>
            <li> Looks great on my fiance....</li>
