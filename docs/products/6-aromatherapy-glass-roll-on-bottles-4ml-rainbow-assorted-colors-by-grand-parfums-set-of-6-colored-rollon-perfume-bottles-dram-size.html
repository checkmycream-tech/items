            <li>I am new in essential oils and wanted these small roll ons for my desire to make &amp;#34;my potions&amp;#34;.... they are wonderful in color and size, very happy with this purchase, i have yet to make anything but the appearance of the vials is perfect..</li>
            <li>All the bottles worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>The service was great fast and very inexpensive!!</li>
            <li>Perfect Portable or Give Away Small Size Roll Top Bottle for Aromatherapy etc,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These little bottles are awesome!  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottles, ball fittings for top and lids packaged each in tidy appropriate packaging individually for each group.  </li>
            <li>Love love love these for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>You could apply it directly to clean feet.</li>
            <li>I like to make up to-go rollers for my essential oils and these little cuties are a perfect size for carrying in my purse.</li>
            <li>Have to work the oil out at first to get it in to the roller ball.</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>Pretty Colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received</li>
            <li>as described, pretty colors, appear useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These small colored glass roll on bottles are just perfect for giving combination essential oil samples in !</li>
            <li>The bottles were delivered in reasonable time and easy enough to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>The caps fit a bit crooked and make a funny sound when I screw them on, like the threading on the cap and bottle isn&#x27;t quite lined up properly.  </li>
            <li>Product came just as expected, fast shipping, easy.</li>
            <li>Even though these arrived late because of weather, I love them and are filling them with my favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a whole new pack</li>
            <li>The colors are weird too - too bright and looking like they were dipped in paint than that the glass itself is really that color.  </li>
            <li>No trouble at all with leakage!</li>
            <li>Work great, Some rollers were hard to push on but with a little force they went.</li>
            <li>No problems getting them capped, and so far no leaks.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and I use them for my essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>Live the different colors..</li>
            <li>My ONLY complaint (well more of a wish) is that they made them with metal roller balls as I prefer the metal rollers to the plastic ones.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions of how to snap the insert in hard when it didn&#x27;t seem to want to fit.</li>
            <li>Even more, when I received my package, 2 of my bottles were broken so I immediately contacted the company</li>
            <li>I roll it on my hand a few times and it dispenses the right amount for me to then rub on my feet.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the colors and the size but the plastic roller balls sometimes &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;.  I bought a set of bottles that had metal roller balls and they work much better.</li>
            <li> not what I was hopng for</li>
            <li> I have used one of the roll-one. I followed the directions of how to snap the insert in hard when it didn&#x27;t seem to want to fit. I put On-Guard essential oil in it and it works perfectly. I roll it on my hand a few times and it dispenses the right amount for me to then rub on my feet. You could apply it directly to clean feet. It doesn&#x27;t appear to leak. As another reviewer mentioned, the tops are a lighter color than the glass.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the products. The service was great fast and very inexpensive!!</li>
            <li> Love love love these for my essential oils. They are the perfect size to carry around in my pocket or purse when I&#x27;m out and about so I always have my oils when I need them! No trouble at all with leakage!</li>
            <li> Love the multi-colors!</li>
            <li> Love these roller bottles.. Have to work the oil out at first to get it in to the roller ball. Live the different colors..</li>
            <li> Purchase came on time and was very satisfied with order.</li>
            <li> Very affordable, rollers work great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised.  No issues.</li>
            <li> Very cheap; all the tops broke after one use.</li>
            <li> Just what I thought they would be. Kinda expensive though</li>
            <li> i am a return customer. This time there was only 1 pippett and no foam for the roller ball tops. Still a nice price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Product came just as expected, fast shipping, easy.</li>
            <li> LOVE these roller bottles! The colors are great for my kiddos and they love them as much as I do! Even more, when I received my package, 2 of my bottles were broken so I immediately contacted the company and they sent me a whole new pack asap! Thanks again for being awesome! 😜</li>
            <li> I am new in essential oils and wanted these small roll ons for my desire to make &amp;#34;my potions&amp;#34;.... they are wonderful in color and size, very happy with this purchase, i have yet to make anything but the appearance of the vials is perfect..</li>
            <li> The bottles I received were not as pictured. Also, my blue bottle was heavily warped, making it ugly and so it would not stand upright. Three of them also leak! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> love them, great for travel or kids</li>
            <li> Bottles are nice.. BUT roller ball doesn&#x27;t move AT all, and lids do not match colors and do NOT fit. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellentroduct, they do not leak. I use them for my perfume when I travel and in my purse for touch ups.</li>
            <li> Lids don&#x27;t screw on level</li>
            <li> These are just odd.  Two different sizes of bottles, with the white one being a bit shorter and wider than the others.  The caps fit a bit crooked and make a funny sound when I screw them on, like the threading on the cap and bottle isn&#x27;t quite lined up properly.  The colors are weird too - too bright and looking like they were dipped in paint than that the glass itself is really that color.  I went to use one bottle this morning and roller ball just fell out and rolled across the counter and into the sink - nearly went down the drain.</li>
            <li> These are the cutest little roller bottles. I like to make up to-go rollers for my essential oils and these little cuties are a perfect size for carrying in my purse. No problems getting them capped, and so far no leaks.</li>
            <li> Perfect Portable or Give Away Small Size Roll Top Bottle for Aromatherapy etc,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Pretty Colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received as described, pretty colors, appear useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottles, ball fittings for top and lids packaged each in tidy appropriate packaging individually for each group.  All items then packaged in one box with safe shipping packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not used yet, don&#x27;t anticipate any issues.  Will update if any issues.</li>
            <li> Just received my bottles and I am already in love. They are adorable and look so cute! I can not wait to start adding my own blends to them and carry them around with me! Quick shipment and arrived with great instructions!  UPDATE! 5.27.15 Love, love, love, these adorable roll on bottles. I have two sets so that I can color coordinate my roll ons! They are the perfect size for travel! My ONLY complaint (well more of a wish) is that they made them with metal roller balls as I prefer the metal rollers to the plastic ones. But other than that I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> These little bottles are awesome!  I put my essential oils in them.</li>
            <li> All the bottles worked pretty good. The blue one sounded like the lid was crunching glass EVERYTIME you opened or closed the lid!!! Finally just threw it away. Wasted money</li>
            <li> These bottles are awesome.  The colors are vibrant and I use them for my essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> Work great, Some rollers were hard to push on but with a little force they went.</li>
            <li> The bottles were delivered in reasonable time and easy enough to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;Took one star off because there was only one transfer pipette in the package, and only 3 of the bottles had the matching color lids.</li>
            <li> These small colored glass roll on bottles are just perfect for giving combination essential oil samples in !</li>
            <li> Work perfect for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Even though these arrived late because of weather, I love them and are filling them with my favorite essential oils. They also provided helpful hints to help insert the rollers. They also refunded shipping charges, so I am a happy camper!</li>
