            <li>It smells great!</li>

            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I got these before for my wife and now i have to make sure i always get it for her</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re set, otherwise it&#x27;s really overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The price was great for such a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>This smelled exactly like the one I purchased from Macy&#x27;s, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless paid full value .</li>
            <li>It strikes just the right balance between light floral and deeper undertones.</li>

            <li>It has a bit more Vanilla in the scent than we&#x27;d like, but I could see it working well for other women.  </li>
            <li>The only flaw is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t know if it is the original smell and other stuff</li>
            <li>It was not what I expected I believe it was a knock off because the sent was so light you could barely smell it</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find the bottle was much bigger than I expected, especially considering I had seen smaller bottles for $10-20 more on other websites.</li>
            <li>The product of Flora by Gucci from this seller does not have the same smell of the original one that I have bought and known for long time.</li>
            <li>The box is damaged.&lt;br /&gt;it makes the Spray looks like an old one.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is a great perfume, too sad that Amazon does not carry the product, although it is falsely written that it is in stock.</li>
            <li> I have been shopping for this perfume for months. Wouldn&#x27;t pay the price everywhere was too expensive because it was a perfume.The price was great for such a lovely scent. Thanks</li>
            <li> Amazon doesn&#x27;t have this product (Flora By Gucci Eau-de-parfume Spray, 2.5-Ounce), even though it was showing as in stock. I had to cancel my first ordered after two weeks of waiting. Amazon customer service advised me to cancel and re-order it. So, I placed my second order. 16 days later ... I received nothing... DON&#x27;T ORDER this item from Amazon, if you&#x27;d like to save your time and nerves.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, my husband also loved it.  I received it in 2 days after I placed the order.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> Many times people are skeptical to purchase perfume off of the internet because of the possiblity of receiving a fake scent.  This smelled exactly like the one I purchased from Macy&#x27;s, and I absolutely love it.  I also get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It strikes just the right balance between light floral and deeper undertones. It&#x27;s the only perfume I wear now.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It smells great! The only flaw is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked. I would prefer to only put it on once and smell it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I got these before for my wife and now i have to make sure i always get it for her</li>
            <li> Shipping was very prompt. I was pleased to find the bottle was much bigger than I expected, especially considering I had seen smaller bottles for $10-20 more on other websites. Smells of flowers, smoked wood and leather, which to me is delicious</li>
            <li> Although it is EDP, the length of the scent is shorter than I assumed. But the smell is no doubt wonderful.</li>
            <li> Worst item I have ever received from amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Awful protection!! The box is damaged.&lt;br /&gt;it makes the Spray looks like an old one.&lt;br /&gt;Originally I bought this fragrance as a gift to my friend, now I can only use it as an air freshener!!!&lt;br /&gt;Worst experiment in Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> The Packaging was a total disaster... I bought it as a gift and i wrote a note, but i came with no note on it. When she was opening the package I was kind of embarrassed. I am a guy and i don&#x27;t know if it is the original smell and other stuff but.... Do not buy it as a gift!</li>
            <li> It has a bit more Vanilla in the scent than we&#x27;d like, but I could see it working well for other women.  Depends on what you like.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! The scent lasts a long time and you only need a couple sprays - literally one or two! I&#x27;m used to spraying my other perfumes many, many times but just a couple sprays of this perfume and you&#x27;re set, otherwise it&#x27;s really overwhelming.</li>
            <li> nice and the only my wife likes</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume thinking what a great deal, NOT! It smelled so weird that I can&#x27;t explain it but all I know is I have lived Gucci Flora ever since its release and this is NOT it.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter and she was very pleased. I like the low prices. Cheaper than in the mall</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected I believe it was a knock off because the sent was so light you could barely smell it and I smelled the way its supposed to smell at a perfume store i got ripped off dont order from this supplier</li>
            <li> Was planning to give this as a present, but the product I received was marked &#x27;Tester&#x27;, &#x27;Not for sale&#x27;.  Surprised to experience that &#x27;testers&#x27; find their way to the commercial circuit.  Nevertheless paid full value .</li>
            <li> Una fragancia con un olor esquisito y que perdura en la piel. El producto llego en perfectas condiciones y sin contratiempos.</li>
            <li> The product of Flora by Gucci from this seller does not have the same smell of the original one that I have bought and known for long time. It does not stay in clothes for long time even if it is perfume product</li>
            <li> Love this perfume hard to tell if it last all day tho. Will purchase again from Amazon due to price and speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> its fake perfume, i spray on me and last for 1 hr. Awful smell like alcohol. The real one i had before last all day compared to this fake perfume, Buyer beware.</li>
