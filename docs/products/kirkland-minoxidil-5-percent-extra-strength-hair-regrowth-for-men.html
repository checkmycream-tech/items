            <li>and it still looks great with the fuller hair.  </li>
            <li>and i am happy to say about to increased hair density which i didnt see during Lipogaine usage also.</li>
            <li>I am a happy customer.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to see</li>
            <li>I used the foam before, which was great.  </li>

            <li>best value, doesn&#x27;t leave oily easy to apply.</li>

            <li>thank you for good item.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>As I imagined it, good product.  </li>
            <li>As described and good deal</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>Product works good for me...</li>
            <li>but the hair were receding at a good rate.</li>
            <li>4 months is a good time to show some results.</li>
            <li>good product at a good pric</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, a good diet helps alot too.</li>
            <li>its a good sign...</li>
            <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s a good first-step to controlling hair loss on a budget.</li>
            <li>The good news is i have used it for four years and still need to use it.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking that it&#x27;d do me some good.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the result turns to be good.</li>
            <li>It is a good start product for people who want to try some minoxidil product.</li>
            <li>decided to try again but used a good conditioner along with it.  </li>
            <li>Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>It has Good Price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not looking too good</li>
            <li>minoxidil is good.  </li>
            <li>Worked out good.  </li>
            <li>Good luck guys - hope it works for you also.</li>
            <li>Good luck hope it works for you too.</li>
            <li>like this one would be a good bet.</li>
            <li>I take both the biotin and Minoxidil for good measure, and I’ve been seeing encouraging results so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a good day</li>
            <li>and i have kept my hair and it looks good and</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>good feel</li>
            <li>Good product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product is a good deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price IMO.</li>
            <li>Why pay the premium for Rogaine, when this is just as good?  </li>
            <li>Some are good others seem like your just buying alcohol.</li>
            <li>Good price,slow shipping</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a go based on seemingly good ratings.</li>
            <li>Good product and service.</li>
            <li>This is as good as the branded minoxidil.</li>
            <li>This is a good for the price.</li>
            <li>This works good, but... once you stop using it you will lose the gains.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a good product for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with a good scalp cleansing shampoo this product does what it promises.</li>
            <li>Good price and it works</li>
            <li>have had good luck with this method using the Kroger minoxidil.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I will give this 2 stars, since the price is so good, but for some reason, it&#x27;s just not working, in fact, the loss seems to be accelerating.</li>
            <li>When it comes to hairloss educate yourself and good luck</li>
            <li>When it comes to hairloss educate yourself and good luck</li>
            <li>so that is good.</li>
            <li>good delivery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where it got those good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good price....fast ship</li>
            <li>I used rogaine before and had good results.</li>
            <li>Reasonably good quality product.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>JUST I WISH IT WOULD BE GOOD~~~</li>
            <li>The price is good if it works for you, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I use to have that good nappy hair</li>
            <li>I saw some results with Rogain but the Kirkland product soon produced a good amount of growth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kirkland Minoxidil for over 20 years with good results.</li>
            <li>Good price for the six months supply.</li>
            <li>The product is just fair.</li>
            <li>Good packaging.</li>
            <li>I do not know how people could deal with this or give it a good review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Good product for a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what it says it is, and is a good price.</li>

            <li>the results of been good.</li>
            <li>delivered on time and in good condition  </li>
            <li>My Dr. assured me the house brand is as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel greasy, otherwise a good value.</li>
            <li>That was the good</li>
            <li>However its still good usage.</li>
            <li>good product, and</li>

            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Maybe this time I&#x27;ll quit for good.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Great fast service - perfect product received.</li>
            <li>While no one can argue that the price point for this item is exceptional, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up compared to the brand name Rogaine Foam.  </li>
            <li>Best part of the product is it dries quickly without leaving a residue.  </li>
            <li>Great product, It really works excellent.</li>
            <li>very light and non greasy, great potency.  </li>
            <li>Great product, still using it since more than a year.</li>
            <li>I believe I am still &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; regardless of  bald spot, which many actors in hollywood proudly display.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad I can get it here for a greatly reduced price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased, and will continue with it indefinitely.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased by my results and even my barber noticed.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel good about keep using it honestly.</li>
            <li>now i get more hair really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent seller , very fast shipping , Item as described , Thanks! ♥</li>
            <li>Satisfied!</li>
            <li>but I am sure it never dries once one applies it into their scalp!</li>
            <li>I am sure if I stopped, the recession would continue, but I am so damn vain!</li>
            <li>It ended up more on my temples and cheeks than it did on the spots I was trying to treat!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Husband has been using Rogaine for many years, successfully.  </li>
            <li>You get MUCH more!  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I can prevent more loss of that hair while using this!</li>
            <li>It does work!Thank you, it is better than our expectations!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give Minoxidil all the credit on that, but it sure helps; maybe it can help you too!</li>
            <li>this stuff works, better than rogaine!</li>
            <li>It works, as my hairdresser knows for sure!</li>
            <li>...but a lot more convenient!</li>
            <li>dreams will come true every day you use this incredible product to&lt;br /&gt;grow</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Excellent  100 % positive</li>
            <li>A great product for a cheap price</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after seeing a post from one of the people who used this and achieved amazing results.</li>
            <li>B00B5OM58U Hair Growth Essentials + FREE Maximum Strength Biotin Tablets]]) are a great combination for increased growth as well as strength and shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you now that this is effective against hair loss</li>
            <li>cant stop kind of rule</li>
            <li>but it seems to be effective</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this product has stalled any additional hair loss.</li>
            <li>I make sure I eat good proteins to build my scalp and hair strength.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re catching</li>
            <li>The nice thing about it is that the cat stays away from the her and stops bothering her all the time to play -</li>
            <li>It was a nice attempt to save money but didn&#x27;t work out dermatologically.  </li>
            <li>Hair kind of reached a max growth point after about 6 months or so.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it will be effective eventually or not.</li>
            <li>This product worked as intended, effectively and with no side effects.  </li>
            <li>I bought this kind of on a whim.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just kind of a vanity thing.  </li>
            <li>seems to work effectively.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li>is so effective that I am growing hairs all over my chest, legs, and</li>
            <li>To be honest since using this instead of rogaine foam</li>
            <li>The result is surprising because is even says on the bottle that it works better on the crown than at the hairline, nonetheless it still managed help regrow my hairline.  </li>
            <li>For best results you need to start using it before you lose too much hair.</li>
            <li>Once you get your thin/bald spot covered up, most people can go to once a day with good results.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and excellent product</li>
            <li>Handy containers.  </li>
            <li>if it is as effective, but the dandruff went away within a week.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 months now and it seems to be equally effective.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s not as effective.</li>
            <li>nice and work for me i satred to see the resoult</li>
            <li>and it grow hair for u nice one guys</li>
            <li>I also think the lack of stress and warm weather also had something to with it</li>
            <li>My own opinion is that if you are already skin bald, save your money.</li>
            <li>One more thing, I started by applying twice a day until I saw good hair growth</li>
            <li>It would  have been nice if the Company had supplied a return slip in the box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Some things to note: I&#x27;m 21 and had quite a nice patch going on.</li>
            <li>You cannot return this product because it is considered as a hazardous material.</li>
            <li>/&gt;•Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation</li>
            <li>Excellent value, and very prompt service.  </li>
            <li>The product has high quality, fast results and excellent price!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything of best !!!!</li>
            <li>Arrived in very good condition, and it was exactly the product advertised.</li>
            <li>I have been using Rite Aids 5% for many years and have felt very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I have to keep using it in order not to start losing hair again, but I&#x27;m super happy to have it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year now with good results , easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommendable.</li>
            <li>Item arrived in several days, good condition, no complaints, especially happy with price!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I found the product very easy to use.</li>
            <li>also, FINE PRODUCT WHICH I HAVE USED FOR A NUMBER OD YEARS WITH GOOD RESULTS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great success with it.</li>
            <li>Based on many testimonials and tests the foam is easier to use, but not as effective, and definitively has to be used twice a day.</li>
            <li>and honestly I think it’s even  better than the name brand stuff.</li>
            <li>im glad he is an honest person,</li>
            <li>As far as pricing, this Amazon offer is excellent.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s effective - more hair growth.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very happy with his results thus far.</li>
            <li>I looked around some more and found out about Nizoral a dandruff shampoo which has an amazing ability to also block dht at the follicles.</li>
            <li>I started using Rogaine liquid then used the foam which I liked more</li>
            <li>I have used minoxidil for around 10-11 months now and its worked nicely for the most part.  </li>
            <li>They do say that the combination of the two is the most effective treatment extant</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it is all about catching the problem before it becomes too severe for this to work.  </li>
            <li>A product from NuNutrients has been the most effective for me in-terms of seeing hair regrowth, but I’ve also used Rogaine as well as the Kirkland brand and seen results, just a lot slower.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well, and isn&#x27;t a significant added expense.</li>
            <li>Great and with very reasonable price</li>
            <li>Even my hair stylist noticed (although she noticed it on the top right side which is the side I tilt my head to, lol).</li>
            <li>as good as the original and a much better price</li>
            <li>They generally tell women to start with 2.5 %,but a Dr recommended using the %5 for best results and it works.  </li>
            <li>it is very cheap~</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and really effective.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to decide whether to try this product or not and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s snowing on top of my head when I brush my hand across my hair.  </li>
            <li>Cheapest minoxidil available!</li>
            <li>I felt like i lost more hair than gained.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a light tingle, this is a scratch your head til you bleed kind of itch.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>LOST MORE THAN</li>
            <li>I am extremely confident I would have a lot more hair if I did not use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheapest I have been able to find minoxidil.  </li>
            <li>not 100% sure if this will work for me</li>
            <li>say for a guy that is crowning on top.</li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s the deal with this stuff, it works for most men.</li>
            <li>The biggest problems most people complain about is flaking scalp or shedding of hair.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll know for sure.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>this is just great, it doesnt ich all that much and</li>
            <li>Well, I tried this product more than once and for me it has proven to do what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>Ok so here&#x27;s the lowdown.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>and I see hair sprouting more and more.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my meds or just my genes</li>
            <li>Nothing works better than Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and buying it in a multi-month quantity makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This makes him a lot happier and more confident about himself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be wiser to go to the gym more often.</li>
            <li>Was pleased with product and will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>Kirkland Minoxidil seems to be okay...</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I was also growing some on my scalp, but they just weren&#x27;t as visible as the others.</li>
            <li>After that it continued, but could be ignored for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you get the unscented version.</li>
            <li>I like this much better than the foam.  </li>
            <li>and therefore I tend to get more treatments out of the bottle than I did with the foam.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident that the hairs will become fuller and darker as time goes on.</li>
            <li>and i already feel like my hair is thicker and growing better.</li>
            <li>Have used this product more as a hair gel since all it seems to do is make my hair grow faster, not thicker.</li>
            <li>and say i dont miss my hair more...</li>
            <li>It has not gotten much better but it has stopped the hair from falling out.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t lost any more hair as off Dec 2013.</li>
            <li>Many of them recommended rogaine to regrow the over-tweezed hair.&lt;br /&gt;Welp</li>
            <li>After abandoning this product and losing more hair, I returned and I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li>Make sure to try the solution out before the foam.  </li>
            <li>The solutions inactive ingredients cause flaking but also allow the minoxidil to absorb better.  </li>
            <li>If I used it twice a day I&#x27;m sure the results would be even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Though hair is receding, some hair is better than no hair at all.</li>
            <li>Because when it turns &amp;#34;Major&amp;#34;, this product may not be able to help you.</li>
            <li>Why pay so much more for the name brand when this works just as well?</li>
            <li>5% is better than 2%.</li>
            <li>After my 24th birthday passed this May, and many more hairs graced the floor of my shower</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Minoxidil for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using Minoxidil for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other interesting fact</li>
            <li>I bought this liquid Minoxidil about 18 months ago and it was OK.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to internalize all the material and not just the case studies or television chemicals.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this works or not like many others.  </li>
            <li>mostly use it once a day and sometimes twice if I remember and that seems to be enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are thousands more</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vertex of my hairline (where I’ve been seeing the most change) is the area that I’m</li>
            <li>the most concerned about,</li>
            <li>and I have more hair than on the Top period of using minoxidil.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for 5 years and a have a bit more hair up front than before.  </li>
            <li>The foam is a better vehicle but is messier.</li>
            <li>I run 5K most days.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my BF as he thought his hair was falling out, okay</li>
            <li>Unless the product never ends up working, of course &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>to look for better pricing on drugs.</li>
            <li>Why dont you make it in spray canister for a more even and more convenient application?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost more hair than I had at the beginning.</li>
            <li>I need to keep applying and massaging more in order to continue increase.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t use it after reading more about the product.</li>
            <li>I did some more research and decided to give Kirkland Minoxidil a chance.</li>
            <li>Works as well or better than Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>It is more like a 3 - 4 month supply however the top of my head is fully grown</li>
            <li>I lost much  more hair than before.</li>
            <li>more time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works for me, when i stopped applying it is saw more shedding.</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>I hope this isn&#x27;t a problem for most people</li>
            <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t take it any more.</li>
            <li>Used for years, best buy on the net.</li>
            <li>I suspect it has more to do with my stressful career.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair getting thicker (as in more strands) on the top</li>
            <li>Maybe more hopeful science will find a better solution.</li>
            <li>It works great, I&#x27;ll use for 6 months and then see if this is real or not.</li>
            <li>Better than even the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li>I wish the Rock had used this stuff, he would have came back looking awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Minoxidil does indeed work, and some will benefit more than others.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look thicker and had many comments from friends as to that affect.</li>
            <li>My hair has been falling out since I was 18, now I am 50 and have most of it</li>
            <li>I noticed the change after about one month and it is getting better and better.</li>
            <li>-kinda think it&#x27;s working, but can&#x27;t say for sure, give it a year.  </li>
            <li>it stopped my hair loss and also started growing more hair.</li>
            <li>Rogaine for example is better.</li>
            <li>I will not buy ot again unless i am really broke and can&#x27;t afford rogaine.also Experienced dandruff since using this</li>
            <li>This product has an excellent reputation, but it takes time to see if it will work on an individual.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I should note that I am a woman whose hair loss is more generalized than it is in men.</li>
            <li>some thinning on top and bit of a receding hairline</li>
            <li>keeping fit and looking good are things I consider important.</li>
            <li>so I combed my hair over to cover it but also realized that if I had hairloss this would make it more noticeable.</li>
            <li>The product says you won&#x27;t see results for about 4 to 6 months, so maybe I still have more hair to regain.</li>
            <li>Also, it may just have worked out this way, but I started seeing the gains after I started making sure that I rubbed the solution into my scalp</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best thing I&#x27;ve tried for treating hair loss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may work for you, but it sure didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>Love it...have been using for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>Product is ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been somewhat inconsistent and I do notice a LOT more hairs falling out when I stop using it.</li>
            <li>so I would imagine the DHT insensitivity in my hair follicles is more aggressive than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>within 1 week I could see more hair started to fall when I</li>
            <li>Feel itchy on my skull and start loosing more hairs.</li>
            <li>I noted Costco switched to foam application which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>ok, nessun problema, prodotto ottimo, consigliato.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months and already see substantially more growth in my beard.</li>
            <li>Canada is better than  Israel&#x27;s.so</li>
            <li>but I believe you can still use it to atleast stop losing more of ur hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure all minoxidil either works or it doesn&#x27;t, it depends on the person.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s delivered to your door excellent products inc the same u would buy in the store</li>
            <li>Why would I want to stand out more when trying to thicken my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the Rogaine foam, it worked much better.</li>
            <li>The foam also smelled better, and it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp like this stuff.</li>
            <li>ive been using it for many years</li>
            <li>Maybe, I cannot say for sure.</li>
            <li>price is more affordable than the name brand competitors.</li>
            <li>I do know that the 5% solution netted better results for me than the 2% solution so if you&#x27;re going to get in, go ALL in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure results can and do vary and like most men I&#x27;m too vain to mention it to most friends</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give Minoxidil all the credit on that, but it sure helps; maybe it can help you too!ur hair rather than your scalp.  </li>
            <li>sure you apply the solution</li>
            <li>If you are starting to have hair loss or your hair is thinning out or damaged Minoxidil is the best treatment for years.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to find the liquid Minoxidil at Costco.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>It was about two years ago that my barber had told me I was thinning out at the top.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already pleased.</li>
            <li>this stuff must not be stopped or you will lose all regrown hair and additionally more.</li>
            <li>and he has bought more.</li>
            <li>What more can you say?</li>
            <li>The foam gets more in the surrounding hair than on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Reduced balding at top of head within two months.  </li>
            <li>I think foam would stay in place better as the idea is to treat an area of scalp.</li>
            <li>However if I stop using it for more than 5 days or so, then I will noticeably begin to lose more hair than when i was on the product.  </li>
            <li>I love my Robert Zur shoes and the mixodil is something I cannot find here in that quantity.</li>
            <li>omn the top of things .....</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product for an incredibly low price.</li>
            <li>I want to use it more</li>
            <li>But doing that won&#x27;t allow me to use the stuff twice a day and have sexy hair .</li>
            <li>Like most of us, I just figured this was my genetic lot in life</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the most disciplined guy in the world and sticking to any twice-a-day regimine isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve ever managed to do before.  </li>
            <li>and I have more confidence.</li>
            <li>Been using this stuff many years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products like hair max laser comb, homeopathy, Lipogaine, Procerin etc.</li>
            <li>I have been able to find anywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these greasy Minoxidil formulations for years and this brand is actually much better than some of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the savings.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me you probably will use more than 1ml each use and will go through more of this.</li>
            <li>and I also got a bit of a confidence boost from just using it because I felt like things were on their way to getting better.</li>
            <li>You need to wait for 4 months and more, but I don&#x27;t like my hairs after applying minoxidil.</li>
            <li>the price is ok too</li>
            <li>I have been using products with Minoxidil 5% for many years.  </li>
            <li>my mousse works better than this.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Best price anywhere ts 5% minoxidil same as rogaine at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li>This is why you’ll see so many 1 star reviews for Rogaine or this Kirkland Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>Fast service, great product</li>
            <li>I have been using Monoxodil for many years and ound that it helps with re-growing my hair.  </li>
            <li>And I think it&#x27;s waaaaay better than the name brand spray on stuff which smells way too toxic for me.</li>
            <li>It has worked better than I even hoped.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it and use if for the front and top of my hair.</li>
            <li>The result is better when you use it with dermaroller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>So i now have about 30% more hair than when i started.  </li>
            <li>I accept my hair loss but would like it to happen a bit more graceful.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect to either recieve or be able to maintain hair longer than 3 inches.  </li>
            <li>* Use Hair dryer after showering and massage well into scalp for 5 minutes to optimize absorption and stimulate circulation for better hair growth.</li>
            <li>It took almost six months before I could look at the top on my head and say,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping in a couple more months it&#x27;ll be fully regrown, or almost so.</li>
            <li>In any case, I am pleased and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Most reviews will have people state that they \\&quot;tried it but didn&#x27;t see any relief\\</li>
            <li>If it showed any meaningful effectiveness, I prolly never would have quit to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Best of all is the price and relative ease of shipping the product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>order came exactly as they said it would....100% satisfaction !!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>works as effective as the original Rogaine 5% foam.</li>
            <li>I will continue to update the review in the coming months, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>A great product.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product and with very reasonable pricing from amazon</li>
            <li>I ordered more of the product during the fifth month when I noticed that I could no longer see my scalp as easily on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I have been using now for over the month and my scalp is doing pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t scratch all your hair out then you have pretty good self control.</li>
            <li>all these things considered, I am willing to continue this product and give it a fair chance, because its not an inconvenience or embarrassment to my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works pretty good on my frontal receding hairline.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good hair now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this even if my hair loss will resume if I stop use, because as long as Kirkland don&#x27;t jack their prices</li>
            <li>Very happy, it is part of my life long routine now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to measure out the \\&quot;dosage\\&quot; and very easy to get it to the right places.  </li>
            <li>Okay, no problem, very good product, recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Already prompted several times always ok!&lt;br /&gt;Tutto</li>
            <li>Golden Years!!  </li>
            <li>5 more months to go to have a more accurate assessment</li>
            <li>if you keep your hair short its a good product at a good price</li>
            <li>Word to the wise, if you want to get this make sure that you&#x27;re ready to commit to it.</li>
            <li>you can actually get somethings good at a fair price.</li>
            <li>and my results are great compared to most, my doctor said I started using it at the right time (when I first saw receding/thinning)</li>
            <li>Discontinued and started using Rogaine and that works fine form is better</li>
            <li>The applicator is very easy to use; a full squeeze of the bulb draws up just about the recommend dosage amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 now and still have a very full head of hair even though it has changed from brown to silver.</li>
            <li>I really see my scalp anymore even with bright lights in my bathrooms lit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all cases, the results take time to be able to accurately call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The foam version otherwise available puts more stuff in your hair than on your scalp.</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago, I noticed that the frontal and temple part of hair is becoming thinning.</li>
            <li>laser light, nioxin and herbal remedies are all mostly ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>laser light, nioxin and herbal remedies are all mostly ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I put cheap gel in my hair, which made my thinning stand out more.</li>
            <li>most people are too polite to ask questions that genuinely puzzle them.  </li>
            <li>most people are too polite to ask questions that genuinely puzzle them.  </li>
            <li>why pay more when you get it dirt cheap</li>
            <li>The applicator is great getting directly to the scalp</li>
            <li>I did not have a receding hairline, but it was thinning out on top, but because of Minoxidil, it has filled in quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I am surprised it works as well as it does and am really happy it does.</li>
            <li>good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li>good article and price,  fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It was a good stuff; I didn&#x27;t regrow any hair, but it was very reliable for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Really does work just as good as the name-brand stuff, too.</li>
            <li>This is a good price  and fast service.</li>
            <li>Ya, Right!!</li>
            <li>if you purchase this but remember that covering a bald spot will not make you a better person and probably will not make you any more appealing than you are right now.  </li>
            <li>I originally asked my physician for a hair-loss solution and he told me that most of his patients saw results with minoxidil and believe me,I was reluctant....</li>
            <li>and I now sport a full popadore!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dream come true!  </li>
            <li>My husband says this works just like the original rogaine at a much better price.</li>
            <li>Results come at an extremely glacial pace, so best to take some pictures every month to see results over time.</li>
            <li>Easy application&lt;</li>
            <li>However, it just sorta looks like you had gel in your hair and it brushes out easily with your hand.</li>
            <li>For this price, its easy to keep going.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it produced some very mild regrowth of hair in my temples.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure there all about the same, but this was a great value.</li>
            <li>Thus far (two weeks), I&#x27;m very favorably impressed.  </li>
            <li>strongly recommend using quality launderable pillow and mattress protectors to prevent this problem on things which cannot be easily washed.</li>
            <li>easy to apply with the tube they provide with the package.</li>
            <li>However, the application is an easy one.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend it to anyone whose hair is thinning.</li>
            <li>ive had no itch, and the scent of this isn&#x27;t as strong as rogaine.</li>
            <li>For me, stronger versions of minoxidil are too strong and damage my hair.</li>
            <li>Do not like it, strong and causes itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the genetic factor is so strong like the Hasselback brothers, it&#x27;s just too strong to overcome.</li>
            <li>being said, it is what it claims to be, the price is decent, and the packaging and applicator pipette are good.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product and vendor.  </li>
            <li>I began taking strong medications about 8 to 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>I think the best idea is to just make sure you only comb your hair and touch your scalp when absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also BE AWARE that you cannot return this product because it&#x27;s considered a flammable or hazardous substance.</li>
            <li>you start using it and getting good results, you DO have to keep using it if you want to keep the new growth.</li>
            <li>the product itself is fine  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be fine but try and make it a routine in the morning</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product thus far; my barber has commented on how my hair has gotten fuller on top; I&#x27;m somewhat disheartened that it doesn&#x27;t appear to be getting any fuller on the sides.  </li>
            <li>it works just fine, does the job.</li>
            <li>I was prescribed this product form my dermatologist, and she said it was fine for women to use as well as men.</li>
            <li>using it on the weekends or time frames when you plan on going out and socializing, and I think you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I love my dad and know what I&#x27;d look like at 50 if I hadn&#x27;t been using Minoxidil and am glad I&#x27;ve been using it as I think I look more youthful and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I love my dad and know what I&#x27;d look like at 50 if I hadn&#x27;t been using Minoxidil and am glad I&#x27;ve been using it as I think I look more youthful and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine with no unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li>Precise and easy withdrawal.</li>
            <li>(\\&quot;baby\\&quot; fine) hair, brown tending toward blond.  </li>
            <li>Once it does, however, my hair looks fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>fine product made my day&lt;</li>
            <li>Thanks from the top of my head!</li>
            <li>I feel very lucky to have found a great product that actually helps prevent hair loss, I&#x27;m grateful for to have found Kirkland Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>Most of the positive effect is the cosmetic look and feel of more hair from the Propylene Glycol ingredient.</li>
            <li>when i rub it in my scalp i am also able to mold my hair which is an odd, but good bonus!</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>we noticed a huge deference in his beard area.</li>
            <li>What a huge savings.</li>
            <li>on time delivery and accurate product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to pay a bit more for foam.</li>
            <li>I got free delivery, but this time delivery was from UPS.</li>
            <li>Great price, same product as Rogaine</li>
            <li>cheap too...</li>
            <li>This product is cheap and it has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>it has a light scent though...</li>
            <li>Using the Minoxidil and shaving (lol) is part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>In hindsight, I should have opted for the regular strength 2% solution, but this just seemed like too great of a deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Talking about side effect, I didn&#x27;t experienced issues such as scalp itch, but dandruff indeed exists, hopefully it will disappear after you are using a longer time.</li>
            <li>This was my primary goal anyway.</li>
            <li>I experienced profuse itching to the point that I was up at 1:00am washing my hair and applying topical hydrocortisone to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a cheap, efficient way to regrow their overplucked brows.</li>
            <li>But after 3 months of my diligent routine I am happy with the Minoxidil , especially since the price is so affordable.</li>
            <li>and I have been problem free since.</li>
            <li>The detailed directions state that not all see results and that results can take 2 months to see.  </li>
            <li>Actually works if you stick with it and this is a great value compared to what it costs in stores.</li>
            <li>I used to buy Kirkland Minoxidil at Costco when it was as cheap as it is at this store.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I am too cheap to buy the name brand</li>
            <li>It took a couple of months to get it filled in again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I can imagine this is more effective than the foam version as it is more likely to contact your scalp and get to work.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a very low price.  </li>
            <li>It works great, but the only side effect I have had is graying hair from using the product.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a fantastic difference in the thickness</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from using this product, it&#x27;s great for the money, it actually did work.</li>
            <li>The costs of all this is amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li>The costs of all this is amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li>It is nearly filled in.  </li>
            <li>The crown area has improved but isn&#x27;t quite filled in yet.  </li>
            <li>To be honest Minoxidil is the chemical that really does the job doesnt matter which brand you use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more, but it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>You can google the actual experiment case studies, which is where I read it works great for receding hairlines, so we tried it and</li>
            <li>6 month supply for under $30 is as cheap as I&#x27;ve ever found and it works.</li>
            <li>2% was all that was available then, then switched to 5%.</li>
            <li>had two primary concerns about trying any product for hair loss.  </li>
            <li>GREAT SELLER AND WILL COME BACK AGAIN.</li>
            <li>Great price for rogaine generic  </li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s always available here.</li>
            <li>This truly works well and is a great inexpensive generic version of Rogaine.</li>
            <li>Great deal for a lot of product, however, this product did not work for me as I did not grow back hair.  </li>
            <li>This product also makes your hair oily and will stain pillows and clothes light in color.</li>
            <li>I have to keep writing stuff to make amazon happy with enough words</li>
            <li>but I did notice some distinct change for the better</li>
            <li>Vanity is not as important as sex life.</li>
            <li>issue is that it has to be applied precisely</li>
            <li>so having an improvement in the visual appeal was great for me.</li>
            <li>For me, the dandruff isn&#x27;t so severe that it&#x27;s a deal breaker at all for the amount of regrowth and the immediate stoppage of further loss that I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working good, the delivery took a while.</li>
            <li>Buying this product is not only a good deal but the amount that you get for the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Good price but still waiting for my natural rug to come to sprout from my follicly challenged scalp.</li>
            <li>far it sounds all good</li>
            <li>this stuff really works and makes a noticeable difference even if used once a day when going to sleep, which is the best time of day to apply this specific product.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>You have a good chance of maintaining what you have and the younger the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thankful that my body reacted to the minoxidil and shampoo, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that I wouldn&#x27;t have achieved results like this if I had waited a while longer -- the sooner you start, the better!  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be fine as a solution, as I know Kirkland to be a pretty reputable brand.</li>
            <li>I think it is important to clean your scalp before applying.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great and much more affordable than the name brand product, also with free shipping, it costs less.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, I think this product is good, and it is cheap, too.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, when I get up and before I go to bed.. quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly to anyone who has thinning hair, it has been amazing.</li>
            <li>This is for sure the more economical option, and considering you need to use it for a prolonged period of time that is certainly something to consider.</li>
            <li>I suppose you could take it to speed up hair growth by using it along with Minoxidil, then stop after your bald spot is gone, but it also takes months before you will see any results while having to put up with less than satisfying \\&quot;happy endings\\</li>
            <li>So far, the Kirkland Minoxidil 5% has worked great and I have experienced few issues or side-effects.  </li>
            <li>Looking at some of the clinical trials of Rogaine, this product will not regrow hair, but users will not lose any more hair than they already have with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure you are consistent in your application cycles - and your die pattern.</li>
            <li>The expiration date seems rigged, the number 8 stands out, it looks as if originally it was either a 3 or a 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Even thought I have kept using it for two years now, my hairloss has progressed significantly, and furthermore I have now grown hair in places</li>
            <li>I had a significant amount of hair loss from a side effect of a medication and for years was one of those guys who went around with a hat glued to his head.</li>
            <li>Then they upped the price to two to three times the original.</li>
            <li>Since I started using it 2 years ago, I haven&#x27;t seen significant hair loss, but who knows what it would have looked like had I not been taking it.</li>
            <li>I originally switched from the Rogaine 5% Foam.</li>
            <li>Worth the try!</li>
            <li>I started using things like this about 5 years ago when I first started to notice hair thinning at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>and I trimmed my hair to balance the growth with the original</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years and it does keep my hair from falling out more; however, it does&#x27;t seem to work for me in growing more hair, maybe I should use it twice a day as is recommended, but I am allergic to the propylene glycol in it which makes my scalp red and itchy.</li>
            <li>I experienced no adverse side effects except a very, very minor itchiness of my scalp.</li>
            <li>head and hair feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>I like clean hair, no hair spray or gel, just clean hair . . .</li>
            <li>My hair is clean without any dandruff</li>
            <li>Castor Oil, Brow Serum, and 5% Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;Ive used every item on list and the only most effective one was Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the eye dropper tells you exactly how much to use, but with the foam, you have to make your best guess if you&#x27;re using the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, strong looking hairs where I know for sure</li>
            <li>After 6 months, the hair line has filled in nicely and the \\&quot;chrome dome\\&quot; was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I doubt this will give a bald man a full head of hair, but for light thinning and receding this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>The Kirkland Minoxidil seems to be more effective for hairgrowth and much easier to spread directly on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Way better off getting the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I started using the same product after about 3 months layoff and had good results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy another 6 month supply just to make sure I get as much as I can out of this stuff</li>
            <li>Short dated but good.</li>
            <li>People who say it doesn&#x27;t work, I can guarantee, have not used it for 2 to 4 months to see the true results.  </li>
            <li>And I feel much better even if the results aren&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>Six month supply is more like 2 to 3 month supply if you really want results.</li>
            <li>I observed that I couldn&#x27;t see as much scalp on top as before.  </li>
            <li>Trying to grow a full beard and with the progress</li>
            <li>Not in every case but in my own empirical experience this product speed up my hair loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked around and they really beat out most and the quality is there as I can see it working after 30 days use.  </li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s such a good idea...</li>
            <li>I used it for more than two months and everyone ask me why I loss my hair so fast.</li>
            <li>I used to pay $20 for a 3-month supply of minoxidil at Walmart - for $7 dollars more I get twice as much and don&#x27;t have to leave the house.</li>
            <li>, the whole eat healthy to grow hair is BS.</li>
            <li>Good price for generic alternative.</li>
            <li>Both my brothers are bald but my full head of hair is still on my head.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Naturally if you&#x27;re thrilled with the product...</li>
            <li>MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEND THIS SURVEY 3-6 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE FOR A TRUE ANSWER.</li>
            <li>Going to keep using it for the full six months and will reevaluate then.</li>
            <li>Tried head and shoulders and tried waiting the full 6 months to see if it would improve, but neither made</li>
            <li>I have a 100% full head of hair now.</li>
            <li>A true Amazon value.</li>
            <li>If you bought please ask your money refund or ask seller to send some good brand in same money because the time your spend cannot be paid by any one.</li>
            <li>Price is fair, but wish it were the same price as in Sam&#x27;s ($19.99).</li>
            <li>/&gt;They say it takes around 6 months to see the full benefit, but you notice it around 2 months in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to hear from anyone else who has used this product for more than 2 months, and in the meantime I also plan on updating my rating after that time.</li>
            <li>well, my head is full of hair, no bald spot.</li>
            <li>A bit more confidence- enough to feel free spirited flirty again with the girlies and not begrudgingly envious of hairy man heads.  </li>
            <li>and im sure no one wants to go bald.  </li>
            <li>Application is very straight forward and easy</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I experienced an adverse reaction with my skin turning bright red on areas exposed to the product in addition to some extreme itching.</li>
            <li>I have noticed significant more hair and it is more coarse, so it feels fuller..</li>
            <li>Many say only effective for the top of the head, I&#x27;m currently using it for my receding hair line and works good so far.</li>
            <li>Supposedly Propecia actually works but has many more side effects so you might not be a good candidate for that considering your specific genetics or family history.</li>
            <li>other thing that I&#x27;ve experienced with both the 5% and 2% solution is a feeling like liquid is sliding around just underneath my scalp.</li>
            <li>Experienced flaking and itching like the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>People won&#x27;t love you more because you have a full head of hair and having a bald spot should not cause anyone to love you less.</li>
            <li>The ticket to success with this is to apply twice daily faithfully and use a good quality shampoo (Nioxin 2).</li>
            <li>If this works, I think I will try the foam next time as I have seen great reviews about how it is much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Please don’t give up hope so quickly</li>
            <li>I do notice that my hair covers more of my scalp, but I still need a couple more months to get back to how it used to look.</li>
            <li>In the spring 1999, I started to apply 2% minoxidil in some bald areas in my temples, and it produced some mild regrowth of vellus hair.</li>
            <li>what i do is apply this during night as im just going to sleep and apply rogaine in the morning as it dries up quick</li>
            <li>But what works for some wont work for everybody, just hope you&#x27;re a lucky one like me.</li>
            <li>But then again, you might be lucky and grow some hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a year, and am tremendously satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I been using it now for 1 month and 16 days, and I can tel and people can tell that I have more hair, the white spaces are getting darker, and the amount of hair is 30 to 40 more than what I had before</li>
            <li>Always be aware that because a box says don&#x27;t try it &amp;#34;here&amp;#34;, typically only means that they have gotten the approval after successfully testing it.</li>
            <li>At that time, I had mild receding hairline and some thinning in the  crown.</li>
            <li>I received the product as ordered, quickly.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it seems to be just as good or better quality than any other brand of 5 percent minoxidil, &amp; especially &#x27;cause it&#x27;s cheap:)</li>
            <li>Though how it works exactly is unknown, it seemed to be quite successful for regrowing hair.</li>
            <li>I started using Minoxidil last year when the &amp;#34;baboon&#x27;s butt&amp;#34; on the top of my head became more distinct and noticeable after a haircut.  </li>
            <li>still most would think its not a problem and that it looks good, but its not what it was in my early to mid twenties.</li>
            <li>decided to try this product because of how cheap it is first week noticed how greasy my hair was made feel gross.after a month</li>
            <li>Obviously is a long process and it doesn&#x27;t make miracles, but it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>At the outset, I&#x27;m 52 years old and have always had very fine</li>
            <li>Also, new users should note that the cheaper liquid formuation is much more cumbersome to apply than the foam...which would explain why it is cheaper...</li>
            <li>He has new hair coming in and is really pleased.  </li>
            <li>Getting very satisfactory results at a more reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s mildly sticky, like fresh hairspray.</li>
            <li>He tried being more careful with the product by making sure he washed his hands real well after each use and by making sure to apply it right and use it in plenty of time before bed</li>
            <li>My male friend really happy, the top of his head was shiny, but it disappeared &amp; now covered w/ fine dark hair (will probably thicken with time).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly he has noticed the hair loss has completely ceased and has noticed the beginning fuzz of new regrowth.  </li>
            <li>This generic product fits the bill at a nice price point, delivered quickly to our door.</li>
            <li>I just run a fine tooth comb through the hair and try and get out as much as I can.</li>
            <li>Best price, quick delivery, and as long as you follow the directions that come with it;  it will continue to fill in an area as long as you use it.</li>
            <li>Great Products, worked fine with me, using the same brand for over a year, you will not see any effect unit a year and after that you should start comparing, take a picture today and compere it next year</li>
            <li>i was using Rogaine and it was working amazingly , but the big difference in the price between Rogaine and Kirkland made me switch to Kirkland .</li>
            <li>It is much easier to measure an accurate dose</li>
            <li>I have no idea whether this is really slowing my hair loss, but it&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li>cheap, very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The amazing things they can do in the medical field like cloning animals and organs</li>
            <li>It does appear that this supplier has a source of fresh Kirkland labelled Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would be worth it though, so I continued to use the product.</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks I noticed considerable hair loss on my pillow, more so than before.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it considering that Men&#x27;s Rogaine Foam-Rogaine Hair Regrowth Treatment, 6/2.11 oz.</li>
            <li>I still think for the price and the results, this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still think for the price and the results, this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So exciting.</li>
            <li>The effective agent of this product is the only accepted chemical that found as a coincidence.</li>
            <li>This product will help keep your hair follicles alive until you decide on a more permanent form of hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite brand thus far.</li>
            <li>Massaging should not be necessary, but it is a good way to get it everywhere without it dripping to much.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I noticed hair growth within one month and after two months I can say that the &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; is for the most part completely non existent.  </li>
            <li>6 months worth arrives each time and you just put it in the medicine cabinet and forget about it...</li>
            <li>I also use Toppik, great hair day (around part and front), and tape extensions - total natural look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt this stuff works, but I&#x27;m switching to the foam for the time being since it appears to have made my scalp a bit more sensitive.</li>
            <li>i like to apply this to my back end to keep me warm in the winter</li>
            <li>Good product, but use it carefully.</li>
            <li>It is true that I observed some dandruff during the first weeks of use, but after ca.</li>
            <li>For the price if you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the try.</li>
            <li>Im sure it will clear up but will take time.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far, OK.  </li>
            <li>Although these types of products clearly indicate on the packaging that they are intended to help those with the circle bald patch on the top of the head and not for the receding hairline, he figured he would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Minoxidil isn&#x27;t a sprint, it&#x27;s a marathon and take it from someone who&#x27;s been running that marathon for 20 years, it&#x27;s ultimately worth it.  </li>
            <li>Minoxidil isn&#x27;t a sprint, it&#x27;s a marathon and take it from someone who&#x27;s been running that marathon for 20 years, it&#x27;s ultimately worth it.  </li>
            <li>but the trade off is worth it to me..</li>
            <li>needs time but really effective especially genetic bald . . . .  . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>Now my diet has also changed (no coffee or smoking of any kind) which I believe is an even bigger factor.  </li>
            <li>Issues I found from the Rogaine foam were that when applying, most of the product would grease up your hair and have minimum contact directly on your scalp.</li>
            <li>but amazon.co.uk rarely has a seller for this</li>
            <li>Still averaging about $7.5 a month is worth it.</li>
            <li>My brother told me about this product and while I can&#x27;t say it has worked that well for him, I have had nothing but success.  </li>
            <li>It went in your hair and then magically absorbed.  </li>
            <li>now im stuck with 5 months worth.</li>
            <li>Honestly they are very similar, you might notice some lower quality in Monoxidil by Kirkland in terms of foaming-effect</li>
            <li>If  by the end of the six months I have any success with the product, I plan on returning and bumping the rating to five stars.</li>
            <li>Product definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>but since I had already purchased six months&#x27; worth, I figured I&#x27;d stick with it</li>
            <li>very much worth it</li>
            <li>Think the \\&quot;Ronco\\&quot; guy with the spray stuff that people make fun of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will note that when I started using a minoxidil like many other users, I did notice that some hair did fall out more so</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he was super offended at first.</li>
            <li>It is a waste of precious time and money !!</li>
            <li>A three month supply there costs slightly more than this six month supply did, and it&#x27;s exactly the same product, delivered free in four days.</li>
            <li>and they all work just as good as the other</li>
            <li>My hair in the front looks pretty good, but it in the back, not so much. . .</li>
            <li>This has stimmulated hair growth in my problem areas and I get good benifits from the other vitamins and minerals in my liquid multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t occur right when I put it on, but I&#x27;ll get itch attacks during the day.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>course I started using this product right after</li>
            <li>Right before I turned 21, the thinning drastically accelerated.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start losing my hair right away, but if you stop using this product, it will fall out again.  </li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>Price was right and hair seems to be growing.  </li>
            <li>It was sent to me right on time and what I asked for..</li>
            <li>But I also hop on one foot (the right one) and do two claps and a spin each time.</li>
            <li>Priced right</li>
            <li>use it twice a day--once before I go to bed, and once in the morning, right after showering.</li>
            <li>right before I go to bed</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>Please refer to the right size of dermaroller and guideline before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For several months, every haircut I got revealed more and more new growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As usual, Kirkland offers best price, fastest shipping.</li>
            <li>I started on the original 2% solution back in the early 1990s and was VERY pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>AS Usual, on-time, great product</li>
            <li>I hear that it works all over regardless of how much you apply, hope this is true.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years now and it really has not regrown the hair in the crown area of my head as much as it has been a good hair thickner.</li>
            <li>should note that my hair loss was widespread across my whole scalp, and the warnings about the limitations of this product did not seem to hold true.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really seem to do more than stave off the hair loss, though to be fair my hair loss was due to medication I am taking rather than natural hair loss.</li>
            <li>I generally just apply drops to the top of my head and leave it at that).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy and i&#x27;ll by a same one for the next time</li>
            <li>So far I am completely satisfied after a whole year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>After spending a great deal of time reading medical literature and trying different hair regrowth products, I can confirm that this product does work on the hairline.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in the accompanying literature, the med is for the back of the scalp; but I&#x27;ve had some success at top and front...</li>
            <li>so they last longer on your scalp, and more of the minoxodil gets absorbed.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Equate brand that I used to buy but way less money</li>
            <li>In the summer 2008, I found out that cheap generic forms of Rogaine became available, and I switched to 5%Kirkland minoxidil.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve taken some DHT blocking vitamins as well and thus far my thinning on top is really regrowing hair.</li>
            <li>Will know more in a few more months.</li>
            <li>for effectiveness, I&#x27;ve seen a drastic slowdown in overall hair loss and have seen some tiny hairs regrow since I started using, even at the hairline (which is apparently uncommon).</li>
            <li>Same relatively good results as Rogaine so far</li>
            <li>so far good.... will update later...</li>
            <li>Put after a month and a half everything is looking good...</li>
            <li>and then if you produce the right enzymes which most people do, it grows back some hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Success with this product varies person to person, what is more important with this is to keep your hair follicles alive,  if you allow shedding or balding for several years the follicles will die.</li>
            <li>It is also very, very affordable.</li>
            <li>This product worked for me, the price was very reasonable, and it isn&#x27;t too gunky, I can apply it four times before I need to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and not only has it stopped hair loss but has grown back an incredible amount of new hair...</li>
            <li>I experienced some side effects such as redness, dry, itchy skin, and a rare side effect causing water retention in the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen great improvements with this product but you&#x27;ll have to live with slightly greasy hair.</li>
            <li>about 6 months ago I decided to try the Kirkland brand topical solution because the difference in price was so huge (You can practically get a years supply for 3 months of Rogaine foam!).  </li>
            <li>Works really really really well!</li>
            <li>it was the first place I seen growth.  </li>
            <li>It itched my scalp quite a bit at first</li>
            <li>but in the first month or so it took a lot of will</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it does exactly what it claims, regrows hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair growth really accelerated!</li>
            <li>Just be consistent with it and don&#x27;t expect results overnight or even in a month.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re going to start out on this for the first time, take photographs of your hair from the front, back, sides and top</li>
            <li>You have to use it consistently and not stop for it to work.</li>
            <li>It is greasy though first going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apart from that your hair will fall more initially.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it so my review is based on the first maybe 2 months of using it after 3-4 months of lipogaine so the risk is yours.</li>
            <li>some reason the box says that this product will only work on the top of the head and not in the front.</li>
            <li>Glad I did as it actually works.  </li>
            <li>Tried many other hair lotions without any significant results.</li>
            <li>and I had to stop using it before I used even a quarter of the first bottle.</li>
            <li>First thing to do: Change your shower filter every six months.</li>
            <li>At exactly three months now, I can see ¼&amp;quot; to ½&amp;quot;</li>
            <li>I am sure if I stopped, the recession would continue, but I am so damn vain!ular daily use of Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>The stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say my mental ability to stay laser focused has increased</li>
            <li>Until I get a wife, I think I will keep using it, and then shock her as soon as I drop the Minoxidil after we get married.</li>
            <li>It make my face hot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on it for my first official month.</li>
            <li>This is pretty inexpensive, for me about $4 a month.  </li>
            <li>It seems the earlier you accept minoxidil treatment, the better the effect will be.</li>
            <li>It does make your scalp itch a bit the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is the same as the Rogaine but at a better price.  </li>
            <li>Rogaine does about the same and costs way more.</li>
            <li>Also, I am a female, with thinning all over the top of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>This enables me to avoid appearing as the most senior gorilla in the &amp;#34;band&amp;#34; (presumably the evolutionary reason for male pattern hair</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling this usually over priced product at a great price.</li>
            <li>The goal for me was to identified exactly what the root cause of my hair loss was, in order for me to know what measures I should take to stop my hair loss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ll continue to use these products until more drastic measures are necessary.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;4, never wash hair in hot water.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I had a virus or something.</li>
            <li>Now, some two months after stopping taking it my running is much better, but still not quite back to normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Minoxidil at first</li>
            <li>Today is the first day I&#x27;m trying this product.</li>
            <li>However, the person using it must consistently use it according to directions and must be patient because it does require ample time for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dont know why it worked the first time i tried a box of 3 month supply and reordered and used but</li>
            <li>I also like the dropper used to apply the topical solution a lot more.  </li>
            <li>and I actually like the application of it better.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this because I wasn&#x27;t aware that you have to use it forever or your hair could start thinning out again.</li>
            <li>and it feels more even with the amount of hair on the back of my head.</li>
            <li>fast delivery and is working!</li>
            <li>I first started using it when I was about 25 and started to notice hair loss.</li>
            <li>I think it looks better now than when I was younger with brown hair.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>BUT MOST OF ALL NO HAIR GROWING ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD  .  </li>
            <li>purchased this early January 2015 (because all products these days do vary and it&#x27;s important to know when a reviewer bought theirs).</li>
            <li>my results might have actually been better.  </li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is first rate.</li>
            <li>Delivered product was burning hot from the sun when delivered ...</li>
            <li>Okay let me just say that I am not using this for scalp hair growth, but instead to speed up my facial hair growth on the connector areas.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 6 weeks, and I have to admit that mostly I use it only once per day.  </li>
            <li>I think that minoxidil is great as a sort of prevention, and at least in my case, it didn&#x27;t lose effectiveness over time.</li>
            <li>a higher concentration minoxidil product.</li>
            <li>People were actually noticing more hair on my head.</li>
            <li>I applied it on the top of my scalp front to back.</li>
            <li>but this product didn&#x27;t work there either.&lt;br /&gt;After losing more than 60-70% of my hair (50% if we want to be conservative) and not gaining anything (except some facial hairs)</li>
            <li>When my husband began to notice that the top of his hairline was starting to recede (think Bela Lugosi &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shape) he wanted to do something about it.  </li>
            <li>Turns out that many of us don&#x27;t carry the necessary genetics to convert minox into hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t guess my actual age in fact.  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t guess my actual age in fact.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described, will do business with them again</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t confirm or deny that, but I can attest that this product did nothing for me at all after using it exactly as the instructions dictated for six month.  </li>
            <li>It might take a couple months to see results but more than likely you will end up seeing results.</li>
            <li>Hi I started using minoxidil when I first turned 18</li>
            <li>I actually use more than the 1 ml every use like it says because it doesn&#x27;t cover all the area&#x27;s</li>
            <li>sure enough it works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten such a satisfying deal on minoxidil before.</li>
            <li>The liquid with eye dropper application allows to apply exactly where you want it without getting your hair stiff/sticky when it dries.</li>
            <li>I use this product and the targets generic version, and this brand seems to work a lot better.</li>
            <li>i actually lost more hair when i started using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I remember when it first came out in the stores and it was 100 $ a bottle .</li>
            <li>Used it for 3 months at first.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of if you didn&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>It really works for me!</li>
            <li>Recommended, exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>Thanks Kirkand!</li>
            <li>Many people have had legit results from it, but they&#x27;re consistent in using it twice daily.</li>
            <li>The first PR lion king.</li>
            <li>First of all it stinks.then  </li>
            <li>I try to contact to customer services for return no answer since the first week of march.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s April and no answer.</li>
            <li>and I found Minoxidil 5% being sold under many different labels.</li>
            <li>Still using it - you have to wait up to 6 month until you will receive first results.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this here, especially since it&#x27;s made by Costco and Costco hasn&#x27;t had it in stock for a while.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It works great, but it just to long to actually see the difference...</li>
            <li>when you first start losing it, you&#x27;ll lost a lot of hair for the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>I switched to the equate version after my first order of the Kirkland version.</li>
            <li>My hair grows thicker and faster on the left side of my head (not a side effect:)</li>
            <li>I was advised to switch to the higher percentage.</li>
            <li>- You most definitely need to use this EVERY day TWICE a day for the REST OF YOUR LIFE.</li>
            <li>I first started using Rogaine(liquid then the newer foam)</li>
            <li>in 1998 when I first started noticing hair loss at the age of 20.</li>
            <li>then you start noticing it on the top back part of your head.</li>
            <li>I used the Rogaine on the front receding part when I first started noticing the hair</li>
            <li>This product was first discovered by accident</li>
            <li>and I would love to see actually proof that it works with a noticeable difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all a good product if you have trouble with itching try taking with biotin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any new growth yet, but I&#x27;m very pleased that it hasn&#x27;t itched me at all, as many reviewers have reported.  </li>
            <li>There was some mild itchy foot the first week at night but besides that no negative side affects.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m jumping for joy over this specific product, but it does seem to have a minor positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has given new life to a man who thought his days with a full head of hair were over.</li>
            <li>Young dudes need to get it as sons as possible for better results!</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE PATIENT, it might not seem like its doing anything for a while and it will make you shed more hair, but after you shed the hair it grows back stronger, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working the whole time, then I got my first haircut after 3 months, and it was definitely thicker than when I started.  </li>
            <li>I tried Kirkland Minoxidil 5% at first, because it seems to be the cheapest minoxidil product which also have a generally positive comments.</li>
            <li>Your significant other won&#x27;t really notice the difference, but you sure will.</li>
            <li>My hair-loss is due to stress, so it&#x27;s kind of chronic...</li>
            <li>(Okay, that&#x27;s a bit exaggerated, but it&#x27;s kind of true,</li>
            <li>but I feel that as it gets longer before I get my hair cut the foam will not dry as nicely in my hair and leave it a little crispy (cant think of a better word).  </li>
            <li>Minus one star for not adding some of the following in the instructions- that would make it a GREAT product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>
            <li>product is not messy... clean use...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky, you may have regrowth back on top with peach fuzz near your temples, but DON&#x27;T stop using it or your hair will rapidly fall after a month or so of discontinuation...</li>
            <li>The drowsiness is pretty intense for the first two or three weeks and then comes and goes in spurts after that.</li>
            <li>Quality is as good as the more expensive.</li>
            <li>I used several different good quality shampoos and prescription shampoos for months, but nothing made the itching stop.  </li>
            <li>Good but much more expensive than the one from Sams club</li>
            <li>It gives good result for me and especially for my friend who is in the initial stage of hair fall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for a new invention!!!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell since huge areas are losing hair and other areas are fine.  </li>
            <li>But again this stuff really works and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Got new hair, not very thick or strong, but the bold-spots went away.</li>
            <li>Some customers already shared their experience with this minoxidil that was not too positive.</li>
            <li>and I m already seeing some positive results.</li>
            <li>Hopefully results will be positive.</li>
            <li>This would be considered &amp;#34;minimal baldness&amp;#34; by most standards My hair loss took place over a period of about ten years or so gradually thinning until I could accurately say it was a &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; and not simply &amp;#34;thinning hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast, came as exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I will say lipogaine worked great after the early stages of weird face rash and more hair loss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind shaving and using Vaniqua, as long as I&#x27;m not bald on the top.  </li>
            <li>All my friends have lost most of their hair a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Not only have I experienced hair growth in the area near the back, but also regenerative growth in the frontal area as well.</li>
            <li>it filled in some bare spots.  </li>
            <li>they suck the most money out of ya as long as they can  </li>
            <li>Pretty much identical to rogaine but for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I on the other hand only needed it for the front and though i have seen some results they have not been as great as my friends.</li>
            <li>The hair that remained looked perfectly normal and it was augmented by very light colored short sort of downy hair that grew in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nearly four months and a short haircut later (I usually wear it long), I&#x27;m pleased to say that I&#x27;ve significantly regrown hair on the top of my head in addition to a good deal of hairline.  </li>
            <li>Monitor Your Blood work and make sure DHT doesn&#x27;t get too high which causes male baldness.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily regrow lost hair but rather helps hair from falling out easily.</li>
            <li>A day later...everything seemed back to normal, so I tried it one more time.  </li>
            <li>After 4-5 months, it take more time for me to dry my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li>There was just more hair to dry.</li>
            <li>for the actual product itself; you&#x27;ll begin losing significantly more hair than normal immediately.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderately sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My hair was only about 10% normal on the top of my head when I started.</li>
            <li>Liquid Rogaine works better than the foam, specifically because the foam dries up &amp; once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>After 16 years of minoxidil use, all my scalp is already latently affected by DHT, and if I started to use some less effective stuff, I would lose all my hair at once.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I observe more dry scalp than before over the applied areas.</li>
            <li>Repeat several times until you figure you&#x27;ve gotten a full dosage&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>No dramatic hair loss or gain.</li>
            <li>I think that once you reach a certain age, you just don&#x27;t give a shitake mushroom anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearly the seller has obtained a large shipment of &#x27;seconds&#x27; which they are pawning off on their customers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not at all certain that I was regrowing any hair.  </li>
            <li>cause I hear it has pure concentration of minoxidil.</li>
            <li>but it certainly does not work for me.</li>
            <li>certainly wish this had been emphasized before I bought it for my husband.</li>
            <li>think it helps to certain extent with reduce hair fall and some regrowth of hair</li>
            <li>Buying a new 6 month box today, cant wait to see results again!!</li>
            <li>After 2-3 months of use, I had more hair that I started to notice the strands of gray which had blended into the scalp started to contrast against the new short mat.</li>
            <li>I loose more ??</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really grow new hair as promise hence the 4 stars but still a very happy customer and for a mere $45 bucks a yr</li>
            <li>There is no noticeable smell, no greasiness, and my hair looks fine when short or medium length.  </li>
            <li>Everything is fine, and I will likely order again.</li>
            <li>B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] and my hair loss stopped completely, and it is now growing back VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>The fine print tells you about 15 reasons why someone can&#x27;t use it and only provides one reason you can.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Not only is this more cost effective, I felt the results were better, simply because this is directly applied to the scalp, whereas I was never sure if the foam was ever penetrating my existing hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazing to see little hairs coming in at the hairline.e a day with a cotton swab and wipe the thinning areas which for my are hairline</li>
            <li>Amazing to see little hairs coming in at the hairline.</li>
            <li>the good thing about this product is that it is cheaper than other products, and as I read through its description it has pretty much similar ingredients as Rogain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Saw many fine hairs, but this is a lifelong process and didn&#x27;t see enough results after 6 months to continue.</li>
            <li>The biotin is all natural so that made me a little more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I started taking it with [[ASIN:B00XJ3GPJA Finoxidrin - Powerful Hair Nutrient Supplement]] and my hair loss stopped completely, and the growth really seems to have accelerated quite rapidly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not trying to use too much, drying time is reasonable (on shorter, damp hair, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair&#x27;s ready to groom within an hour of applying this), and I haven&#x27;t noticed the greasy feeling others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>It gives you hope if not mostly false hope that you are trying to stop it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much hair growth, my books pressure went up, I&#x27;m done w it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait until I saw growth and now that I do am ready to give my review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Can you really &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; this?</li>
            <li>and we haven&#x27;t really seen any changes</li>
            <li>I really dislike using the dropper.</li>
            <li>I really prefer the foam Rogaine product, much easier to use and cleaner.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced (unlike Propecia)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>what aging can do is that after you get some age, you don&#x27;t really care too much about how your hair  look.</li>
            <li>People know very well that you are not in your 30s anymore HAHA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Adding the mynoxidrin really seemed to thicken my hair and make it healthier also.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair VERY greasy.</li>
            <li>And even after washing it still stays very greasy.</li>
            <li>I really regret not doing that.</li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive and works just as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li>Something gentle.</li>
            <li>highly reccomended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to all of my friends!</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it really works.</li>
            <li>If it bother you that much, buy the foam.</li>
            <li>as in lightly rubbing my hair back and forth and 10 times over a magazine i counted over 150 hairs..</li>
            <li>thanks for your expire product .</li>
            <li>This is a much cheaper way to use it than buying the name brand.</li>
            <li>hairs growing on my Vertex (nothing in front, as Kirkland readily says).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this for 6 months and see how much growth I can achieve.</li>
            <li>cans (6 Month Supply) costs twice as much for six months.</li>
            <li>Minoxidil works really.</li>
            <li>However the side effect is that it is very itchy</li>
            <li>But to much suprise it worked...</li>
            <li>This year it got to a point where it started getting really noticeable when I would look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I bought a 3 month supply of Kirkland Minoxidil 5% thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try since the price was reasonable compared to Rogaine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and it has really helped.</li>
            <li>But this stuffs much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, It seems like I have twice as much hair as I did before.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this means that I&#x27;m using too much or what, but even when I don&#x27;t experience itching</li>
            <li>/&gt;He has been using it for years (prefers the dropper, not the dabbing sponge) and his hair stylist is amazed he has so much hair at his age.</li>
            <li>once i got off rogaine surely it started thinning out more, but so slow that goin bald would probably take a few more years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;3 months later, and all the spots are filled with hair.</li>
            <li>but im spending much much</li>
            <li>After six months, I noticed my hair was not falling out as fast.</li>
            <li>The addition of Finoxidrin also made my hair look MUCH healthier.</li>
            <li>I overplucked my brows for years and decided I wanted to grow them out again, but wasn&#x27;t having much luck despite taking hair vitamins and hiding my tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a real value.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>It take a couple of months to really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>a favor and go to Costco much cheaper</li>
            <li>very greasy formula.</li>
            <li>not broken bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It thickens them no matter how much you have over plucked if you have no scar tissue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for approximately 6 months and have seen a great improvement.</li>
            <li>I could get some compensation on this, or at least get my money back, but I most likely to win the lottery that get any satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;next</li>
            <li>my much hail.&lt;br /&gt;good goods.&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>I should state that my hair loss is over a patch about 4 inches in diameter across the very crown of my head.  </li>
            <li>Well, I embellish a bit - but not by much.</li>
            <li>And really it fix the problem, my hair loss stop.</li>
            <li>I have male pattern baldness but to a light extent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that you really need to use it for about three months before you expect to see results.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I have headaches if I use too much.</li>
            <li>fast shipping..love it..</li>
            <li>but nothing i could really put my finger on.</li>
            <li>This thing really works.</li>
            <li>so i went with the cheap stuff since i figured its the same hormone.</li>
            <li>th erpoduct arrived on time and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and it REALLY works</li>
            <li>I had to stop using this treatment after 2 months because it made my scalp very itchy.  </li>
            <li>Who really knows, I started using this years ago</li>
            <li>Really helped me a lot</li>
            <li>it might be time to go ahead and accept my fate with a straight razor</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>After a couple of years I stopped using it - don&#x27;t really know why.</li>
            <li>Buy it guys, a whole 6 month supply.</li>
            <li>It might be months before you notice any real difference.</li>
            <li>But much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Using these two products really help to regrow my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;You can find Alpecin here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OSNBX2/ref&#x3D;oh_o00_s00_i00_details</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>VERY DISAPOINTED  ,</li>
            <li>This was very</li>
            <li>Kirkland doesnt seem to be as watery and prone to running all over the place as Equate, but when it dries&lt;br /&gt;I notice alot of flakiness on the scalp, this is really undesirable.</li>
            <li>After I quitted it, I started to shed very rapidly</li>
            <li>The item was shipped fast and product was how it was described.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much weight it bears</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t tell a difference in a before/after sense.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to put too much on and it keeps you from spilling it all over.</li>
            <li>100% recomended thanks</li>
            <li>But my hair is much thicker now.</li>
            <li>The foam, which Rogaine has, is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>This product really works, you just have to be pacient.</li>
            <li>but then as they say who wants fat hair.  </li>
            <li>The liquid is very greasy when applied to your head.</li>
            <li>Once it dries some gently brush or comb your hair.  </li>
            <li>Once it dries some gently brush or comb your hair.  </li>
            <li>this really works for me..</li>
            <li>so I would say to someone start this before you really need it..</li>
            <li>but then it grew straight?</li>
            <li>I Really don&#x27;t like this minoxidil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working, but this item generates scurf and it&#x27;s very embarasing.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I must be the unusual person this product did nothing for?  </li>
            <li>The problem is that I am not sure,if it really helps.</li>
            <li>I think it really works.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>When I got the package, one (or more) of the bottles had leaked and the Kirkland box was wet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder to find the liquid with the dropper instead of the foam, which is more costly and doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li>Much prefer the liquid vs. the foam.</li>
            <li>absolutely unbearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the price and everything is as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Itches too much.</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s an OTC product, however, the price has become extremely reasonable, so I thought I&#x27;d give it</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on those, but the Kirkland one really does do well.  </li>
            <li>now that the price has gotten so reasonable, why not give it a shot?  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this and really likes it.</li>
            <li>This is the product that really works.</li>
            <li>the product went very well</li>
            <li>maybe thats why it didnt really work.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this much hair since I was 15.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this I get to keep my existing hair which is alright with me.</li>
            <li>thanks  amazon</li>
            <li>Also leave the product in for 4 hours before sweating intensely or showering.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any change.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the same product available here.</li>
            <li>and well it has helped to avoid the hair to fall as fast as it was falling.</li>
            <li>Kirkland 5 does not have a seal, but this thing really works.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product from Las Vegas World Brand Famous Center.</li>
            <li>Wish the Government would make sure these claims are true; not sure it really works</li>
            <li>I could legally market tap water and say it &amp;#34;May&amp;#34; make you smarter</li>
            <li>Minoxidil tries to make your body circulate more blood to your scalp where your follicles will grow.  </li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>/&gt;•Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and</li>
            <li>It works and it really  grows hair .the</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced product, sent promptly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>(if you do some research online, you&#x27;ll see that for some guys it takes a whole year).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference with either country of origin.</li>
            <li>I really work it in.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I really care anymore.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Really greasy, no way to apply it then go out, you&#x27;d look like a dang greaser.</li>
            <li>The thing that i dont really like is now to keep the hair I have to use it forever, but I guess it&#x27;s like brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I started feeling really tired/</li>
            <li>The normal pattern of hair loss is the receding part in front which you notice first</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a product that does work covering up the hair loss/balding spot temporarily if it isn&#x27;t too much scalp showing.</li>
            <li>I used various minoxidil products for couple years and this one is by far the most damaging.</li>
            <li>Since then I believe that baldness is accepted for the most part and does carry the same stigma it did before the early 1990s.</li>
            <li>use it to stop loss of hair from the top of my head near the back.</li>
            <li>It measures exactly, where as with the foam it says to use a cap full but that never seems like enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old and am experiencing some thinning in the temple areas as well as the middle of the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Also tried the much more expensive Lipogaine, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>On its own minoxidil cannot restore your hair if you have these patchy spots especially on the side or back of your head.</li>
            <li>and I know it takes at least 2 months to make a fair assessment on whether it works or not.  </li>
            <li>Will do more business with these guys in the near future.</li>
            <li>i was dating an 18 yr old college student!!!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s choice, and if your hair is important to you, this product works better than any other topical product.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that you won&#x27;t notice much at first because it takes time to grow new hair.  </li>
            <li>I follow the recommended usage and it seems to work as good as other similar products in reducing the loss of hair, but not regrowing it...</li>
            <li>however my scalp became super itchy, flakey and apparently this was tearing up my scalp like acid...</li>
            <li>Im sure it will be more dramatic.</li>
            <li>I only bought one bottle of carexidil, which was very easy to use, and when i used it up i switched to this one, hoping it would be something similar.</li>
            <li>I know many other have</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I have notice more hair on the tub than before after application of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>My hair is significantly thinner now, especially on the crown.</li>
            <li>This is the generic formula of the original liquid Rogaine.</li>
            <li>better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>The application can be a little challenging and time consuming as it comes in a liquid dropper form compared to others like shampoos or pills, but there are results to be hand with the product if you&#x27;re willing to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The side effects of this particular product were too much for me though.</li>
            <li>Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Extra Strength Hair Regrowth Treatment is for men who have a general thinning of hair on top of the scalp.  </li>
            <li>but seriously it wasn&#x27;t a good feeling.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, high quality product.</li>
            <li>you really really want the product, just be aware of the side affects, because they really weren&#x27;t worth it for me and it took me too long to realize what they were caused by.  </li>
            <li>used a special shampoo on several visits to get rid of the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, hair grows only about half an inch per month, so I think 3 months is a good waiting period to give yourself before you see results.  </li>
            <li>Everything I would have expected in a competing product that is much more expensive - great job</li>
            <li>As long as this is available, I&#x27;ll continue with it.</li>
            <li>but to be honest i&#x27;ve seen faster results to the front, from the widows peak on the sides and front to just past that part of the hair line.</li>
            <li>My hair loss is in the middle of my scalp and this regrew hair despite claims it only works on the vertex as i apply to my whole scalp on top all the way to the front.</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old with first signs of Androgenic Alopecia.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how fast I would normally be losing hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to be applying because I know they say only use 1 ml, but since I have diffuse thinning all over, I feel like I need to apply it in back as well.</li>
            <li>It should be at least 5% because branded names such as Rogaine has same percentage and alot of people are very happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks, it&#x27;s obviously too early for me to expect any results, but I&#x27;m favorably pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>By beard (full) is finally starting to sprout out from having stuble for 35 years.</li>
            <li>My hair looked better when it was applied compared to this, and it didn&#x27;t drip down my scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much scent free... maybe a slight smell, but I can&#x27;t smell it on myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently started using tretinoin 0.001% gel on my scalp after taking showers and that has surprisingly helped the regrowth process a little bit.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped me a new case, so I appreciated that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of new growth, but the hair that&#x27;s still there appears thicker and darker which is an improvement.</li>
            <li>Oddly, the hair doesn&#x27;t appear identical to that it replaced as it is thinner and more curly.</li>
            <li>Anyway I am going to use less of it and try to apply more evenly.</li>
            <li>then half of the drugstore price:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than rogaine, and the reviews were about the same or better, which why we decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>My main problem is in the front</li>
            <li>Since enough people have told me that the mild bald spot at the top-back of my head has receded, including my barber, I&#x27;ll say it works.</li>
            <li>Used this product with success for 6 months then my scalp starting to get very irritated</li>
            <li>If we come to the main point, I have been using this product for three months and 10 days.</li>
            <li>After three months of use still lost hair at a steady rate.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the hair that is growing back looks more like Barbie hair but curly.</li>
            <li>It took over three months before I felt as though I&#x27;d grown most of the hair I&#x27;d lost during the initial shedding back.</li>
            <li>Better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>if i remember ill update this review again to see if it gets even better, but in 3 months it did more than 5 years on rogaine.</li>
            <li>SDS free shampoos are difficult to find and I currently make my own, which chemically is more similar to soap than shampoo (corn oil, lye, glycerol, ethanol and sugar).</li>
            <li>The foam works well enough like a mousse, but it dissolves quickly so work</li>
            <li>I bought this for a relative and he said it works better than rogaine, he has continued buying it and his bald spot has definitely improved.</li>
            <li>The regrowth has been gradual but it has been steady.</li>
            <li>I have not yet to see results because it has only been 3 weeks, but overall the price of the product is insanely cheap!</li>
            <li>27 year old male, fit</li>
            <li>For now, I expect it to do a decent job regrowing some hair in me receding hairline.</li>
            <li>Of course I didn&#x27;t get all my hair back, say 100%, but interestingly enough I got more hair even on areas of my head where this product is not supposed to work on.</li>
            <li>Decent product</li>
            <li>course, I&#x27;m mainly comparing the oil to the foam.  </li>
            <li>Without it, my mostly straight hairline starts getting real widow peaky.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and my facial hair is growing from zero to a super beard.</li>
            <li>This particular product made my face swell up and burn like fire.  </li>
            <li>The hair growth is steady.  </li>
            <li>It seems to stop further hair loss, and to somewhat fill back the top and towards the front of the head.  </li>
            <li>You have to have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>This is the best Minoxidil I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;I have used PiloGro &amp;TuGain in the past but never satisfied with the result</li>
            <li>there caught up in the shuffle of life but have had steady progress.  </li>
            <li>and my barber says that I have decent regrowth and \\&quot;mirrored it\\&quot; for me to see.</li>
            <li>This has the same active ingredient as high dollar hair growth items do and is definitely worth the cheap price!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for falling and thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its working high time.</li>
            <li>But Kirkland worked high time, it starts with a symptom of increased hair loss after usage for a month or so and then the hair began to grow again...</li>
            <li>If you have that condition I highly recommend going for cortisone shots and use prescription cortisone cream with this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Although it is not recommended for people of my age and there is little data on the effects for older men, I found this product to both stop hair loss and add more thickness to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that if you use it religiously it can really dry out your scalp and make it itchy, hence the use of a good</li>
            <li>After it has dried it is more or less ok though.</li>
            <li>Kirkland seems to carry a very wide variety of products and Minoxidil is one of the products I find to be both economical and useful.</li>
            <li>6 months ago I could see through the hair on the top of my head a little bit.</li>
            <li>I am completely unsatisfied !!</li>
            <li>The equate version is a little thicker and much more oily upon application; I am assuming from the PPG to Alcohol mixture.</li>
            <li>Yes your paying for a name, but sometimes those names hold a little more water then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuing my use of the minoxidil as it seems my hair can retain a little more of its thickness in the front where it has been receding.</li>
            <li>Also I have noticed I get a lil more edgier after and somehow elevates heart rate a little</li>
            <li>Also I have noticed I get a lil more edgier after and somehow elevates heart rate a little</li>
            <li>, the shipping took nearly 2 months although ETA was 6 days with Expedited Shipping!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>As a women with little hair on top of my head</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, because my hairline looks a little better.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the foam, but this is relatively easy to apply, and costs about half as much as the foam version.</li>
            <li>Make sure the liquid goes directly on the scalp and use finger tips (not your nails) to gently rub into the scalp for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have a perfectly lush head of hair now, but it really helped fill in the crown, and even improved the front hairline.</li>
            <li>Used for 2 years and finally decided that all the sticky messiness just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>give it 2 stars only because of the price and the fact that it goes on clear unlike lipogaine which is yellow and stands out more</li>
            <li>I grew hair in spots where I normally was not growing it.</li>
            <li>Then at the end of the day, about an hour before I go to bed, I apply one more round of foam and massage it in.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll give a few more months</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I am starting to think that the rogaine may be worth the money.</li>
            <li>No noticeable hair change (even it seems like normal hair loss has continued) over the 6 months or year since i bought this.  </li>
            <li>have had no negative experience from either of the products.  </li>
            <li>For others, it creates a bloom of peach fuzz that turns into normal hair.  </li>
            <li>it was a completely waste of money, I would get better results from putting piss on my head</li>
            <li>I think that it is always better to combine 5% minoxidil with some DHT-blocker, rather than risking theRussian roulette with 10-15% minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I routinely order Kirkland minoxidil from their internet website, but recently, I was surprised that CostCo changed the manufacturer (for PERRIGO in Israel) and the bottles look differently.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra cost over the liquid stuff.</li>
            <li>Way cheaper than going to the normal grocery or drug store.</li>
            <li>The only solution I found to be completely useful</li>
            <li>Minoxidil has one side affect that is not widely acknowledgedwritten about, it causes hair loss at the end of the first month of use, quite a bit of hair loss.</li>
            <li>and she cut it shorter than normal</li>
            <li>I will be updating this review in a few more months.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>that it began to affect my normal life.  </li>
            <li>Have used the 2% for years, and although I feel it helped me not lose as much hair, due to heredity factors, since switching to this 5% formula, i&#x27;m actually seeing a lot more new growth!</li>
            <li>though im only half way through the 6 months, i ordered another 6 just to stock up since im pretty confident in this stuff</li>
            <li>No issues except for occasionally itching red scalp, which is an easy fix with argon or chamomile oils.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s been so easy I&#x27;m actually finding myself looking forward to the next application.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I brush my hair left and right, while avoid touching my scalp at all, then brush it toward the front, the point from doing that is to spread the product around with my dry hair</li>
            <li>There seems to be many other companies that sell the same products, but I found Kirkland to be very reliable and their products to be of premium quality.</li>
            <li>Drawbacks are you have to user it for life and dandruff can become a problem but nothing that the right shampoo can&#x27;t solve with occasional use.</li>
            <li>I did what I could to keep eating right, keep my stress low, exercise, drink alot of water, vitamins, flax seed oil etc as always helped my training and nourishes</li>
            <li>But it grows right back</li>
            <li>but hey why not if it works the same right.</li>
            <li>In addition to exciting my wife (who&#x27;s likely fantasizing about Connery or Willis), it&#x27;s easier, less work/expense, and I look/feel cool!</li>
            <li>I was able to see some very slight new hair growth after about two months.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, by the end of the day my scalp gets pretty obvious and I decided a few weeks ago that I&#x27;d try to stop losing more before it got too</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but a little too early to tell if it really promotes detectable hair growth.</li>
            <li>but my doctor said you want to live or you want hair?  </li>
            <li>Its stopped my hair from falling out and is showing some new growth.  </li>
            <li>Neither it stopped hair fall nor does it regrow new hair.</li>
            <li>However, I do not see any new growth since around three to four months.</li>
            <li>However, I do not see any new growth since around three to four months.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product before I&#x27;d grown much new hair</li>
            <li>For me it makes my existing hair thicker and fuller, for others it may reactive new follicles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Do not want to live without the Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After stopping for a month I am gradually losing my new hair again but the itching is gone.</li>
            <li>Helps you to grow new hair and keep what you have.</li>
            <li>Um... I know what matters is inside the box, but this is new?</li>
            <li>Got new fade and edge up</li>
            <li>It may take a while before you see new growth.</li>
            <li>and I have see new hair follicles.</li>
            <li>He has seen new growth already.  </li>
            <li>A new hair is immediately begun, though.</li>
            <li>my husband&#x27;s new growth is finer and lighter than the rest.</li>
            <li>and I think the hair loss is lower, but atenci&amp;oacute;n this time I havent seen new grow</li>
            <li>seeing new hair growth already.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve grown some new hair in my vertex area.  </li>
            <li>new hari is growing.  </li>
            <li>I cant tell if it growing new hair</li>
            <li>people double down ,which is good, i do just the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of hard to part your hair and apply directly to the roots</li>
            <li>While I have not yet noticed any significant amount of hair regrowth which is expected since it is too soon to tell, at this point I think the most significant benefit is the price which is less than half the cost of any competeing product.  </li>
            <li>Now Ive been experiencing mild hairloss since I was about 27 years old, first noticed it at the front of my hairline and also had a callic making it look like a slight bald spot on back right of my head</li>
            <li>and it did work good ,but late last year 2012  </li>
            <li>I guess the true results will only become apparent after couple of months.</li>
            <li>the first month, I actually lost hair at a faster rate than normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product way better than the foam formulas that are saturating (pun intended) the market currently, making his preference harder to find.</li>
            <li>I do not like blanket because it is way too big to fit a double bed.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, just do things right the first time!</li>
            <li>, I lost so much of my hair due to so much of itching and dandrufff in the first 3 days of its use.</li>
            <li>Although the new hair right now is still thin, but I think it will become better in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the product very conscious that it was not going to work miracles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised at this product&#x27;s 4 star rating.  </li>
            <li>The package was delivered very fast on the standard delivery option.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a noobie, this is the first hair treatment I buy and the seller did not put enough information.  </li>
            <li>(So far I&#x27;m not eligible to audition for a part in a &amp;#34;planet of the apes&amp;#34; sequel&amp;#34;!)  </li>
            <li>first time I applied it it caused a redness in the area of application that turned to peeling my skin later.  </li>
            <li>I remember this product was first released onto the market at a time when baldness was a really big issue for men.  </li>
            <li>Costco has this same exact products for $47.99 can you beat that?</li>
            <li>hair just went back to how it looked before my first order wish it kept working .</li>
            <li>I like to keep my hair pretty short</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not vain enough to have to be a slave to this chemical, so I ever even finished using the first bottle.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same whether you use this product or Rogaine--they are equivalent.</li>
            <li>For the first six months, I wasn&#x27;t following the instructions strictly, but I want to try it again.</li>
            <li>Im still consistently doing the 1ml eye dropper of minoxidil twice daily.</li>
            <li>Im still consistently doing the 1ml eye dropper of minoxidil twice daily.</li>
            <li>I purchased the one with the higher review, but was sent the lesser one.</li>
            <li>, I used in the front and in the back of the top of my head, only cons I can tell is that it leaves a white dust on you head, and that it runs to your face when you sweat</li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time and couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair this morning.  </li>
            <li>Since Costco no longer sells the liquid only the foam and a much higher mark up .  </li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t make an extra effort to massage it across my scalp (and along my widow&#x27;s peaks even though manufacturers state outright that results there are unlikely), it literally wouldn&#x27;t take more than a minute to get it done;  it seldom takes more than that even with the neurotic massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my scalp did itch at first, but I started using selsun blue and it stopped.</li>
            <li>In the first 2 months I did lose hair and I was going through alopecia at the same time.</li>
            <li>exact same thing as Rogaine, at a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li>I usually burn for sure if I forget.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going down fighting, and this is a huge lift to my ego.</li>
            <li>The eyedropper application is just as easy as the foam, however this solution leaves a wierd dry white residue that looks like you have stuff stuck in your hair.</li>
            <li>Because most minoxidil product is said not very helpful with frontal and temple hair loss, so I didn&#x27;t have too much expectation on it, and it is also the reason why I didn&#x27;t buy the more expensive</li>
            <li>You could clearly see my scalp through my thin hair on top, especially under direct light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using this in conjunction with a set of hair clippers, and keeping the sides and back pretty short and the top slightly shorter than the front.</li>
            <li>As far as hair regrowth, I&#x27;m not sure if either products really work super well, but I seem to not be losing as much hair when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll pretty much have to comb your hair carefully and avoid all contact with the scalp, unless you want to walk around looking like you were in a snow storm.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND getting a rich multi vitamin with 300mcg&#x27;s of Vitamins and other vital minerals for your over all health.</li>
            <li>Such information is vital for the customer so that he can purchase exactly what can work for him.</li>
            <li>At fist I told myself that its worth a thick, full head of hair</li>
            <li>Stays on the top of your head without dripping down to your forehead for just enough time to rub the product into your scalp.</li>
            <li>I would recommend mixing this with a carrier oil such as emu seems to penetrate a bit better and keeps down the inflammation.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it has any positive effect on preventing hair loss because i could not use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Only positive results.</li>
            <li>Seems exactly the same as the store brand and much cheaper than the same store brand.</li>
            <li>Product I received was missing dropper applicators, but more importantly liquid caused unbelievable itch and skin irritation on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Some hair loss is caused by genetics (more than half of all cases), and in this case, you’ll need to try products like this Minoxidil, or go even further and get plugs.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the only difference--why pay more for less?</li>
            <li>I have been using the Kirkland Minoxidil since I found out that it was the same thing as Rogaine, more or less anyway.</li>
            <li>and I definitely have more hair and experience less shedding.</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely thinning and you can see my scalp if you look down directly from the top.</li>
            <li>I used to use this product back in the summer on the front of my hairline and it grew back tremendously.</li>
            <li>The one thing I will say is that for anyone who has only a little bit of hair loss, this 5% solution is pretty intense and probably not the right choice.</li>
            <li>After using about one month, I have noticed that the frontal and my left temple part have a lot of new hair grow again, the effect is slow on right temple part, where the hair loss is most persistent, but still, I can see tiny new hair.</li>
            <li>The liquid towards a yellow, orangey color after a certain time period.</li>
            <li>While it may not regrow hair for all, if most probably will slow down the loss of hair for most At least on the vertex, top, of the head, the only location for which it is advertised to work.</li>
            <li>Huge waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>I am no longer losing my hair, that is clear.</li>
            <li>I am no longer losing my hair, that is clear.</li>
            <li>After 4 months I can see clearly that it works and it works well.</li>
            <li>When I stop using it, I can clearly see my hairs falling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nearly 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I just recently started to notice how much this product was working for me after 6 months.</li>
            <li>Had been told that all my hair would fall out again if I stopped using it, but so far, this has not happened.</li>
            <li>is getting easier  with Amazon, and their business associates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can access low price, and reasonable service.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you are just in your 30s, and you are so conscious about it, like I was...</li>
            <li>My hair was greasy and oily near my scalp from the application.</li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t definitively say it is working for me.</li>
            <li>I only needed to apply on my hairline so the &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; from the product was really noticeable from the</li>
            <li>The price for these is unbeatable, as far as I can see,&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am 22 years old and started using this about a year ago to try to take on genetics.  </li>
            <li>It is MUCH easier to deal with in short hair.  </li>
            <li>the only detractors are the whole \\&quot;will regrow</li>
            <li>so it is too early to tell what effect it will have on hair growth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as far as I&#x27;m concerned it does the job.</li>
            <li>Too early to see results.</li>
            <li>Which happened to me after becoming lazy.</li>
            <li>The one and only hair product that really works.</li>
            <li>Yes, so far?</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 1 month already and so far no changes whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have tried Rogaine and CVS so far</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see back/up there, but it must be filling in back there too.  </li>
            <li>The only way I&#x27;d really know is if I stop using it.</li>
            <li>This has prevent my from going bald as far as I know.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re hair loss early on...</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend you avoid this product, but if not, then it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it if you suffer from hair loss.</li>
            <li>The rash went away with discontinuation of the medication, restarted with re-challenge of the medication, and has not returned since stopping the medication completely and resuming brand name Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>Kirkland minoxidil drops irritated my scalp after about 6 months &amp; developed some scaling with itching.  </li>
            <li>It is the same thing as romaine at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>After using this for about 3 months my wife and I both noticed marked improvement in the thickness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it says you may see improvement as early as two months</li>
            <li>Fast forward 4 months later and my hair has grown all over the place!</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day as this is men&#x27;s rogaine but the results have been so fast.</li>
            <li>The problem is, that I stopped using it for about 6 months early this year.</li>
            <li>He claims it really works and that is hair has grown back and thickened in the area that he is using it.</li>
            <li>This is my second purschase, does the job very well,</li>
            <li>Im still using the product, i have to wait at least three more months to see results</li>
            <li>I use it every morning on my scalp and also use it by spraying 2 pumps on an old toothbrush and going over my brows.  </li>
            <li>SO far no negatives.  </li>
            <li>It has been about three months so far</li>
            <li>If I had known this, I would have not wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 39 year old male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 60-year old woman with a receding hairline.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a direct application approach</li>
            <li>Keeping the old pate with something where nothing would otherwise be.</li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness I havent noticed any difference between the two products and think they both work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took 2 weeks of non use for the itching and swelling to completely go away.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, know that at the least, it&#x27;s probably keeping you from losing even more</li>
            <li>Of course, keep an eye on it and if you start to see too much hair in the shower drain then go back to twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since December 27 and so far it makes my existing hair thicker and fuller</li>
            <li>I have at least 2 times more hair on my head now.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 18 year old son on the recommendation of his dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does leave the hair looking a bit as if you&#x27;d put gel in it, but only if I use too much.</li>
            <li>Im 43 at time of this review, I have what would be the early stages of hairloss</li>
            <li>I will say that it does work with continued use but it can be drying if your skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness, I havent noticed any difference between the two.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a while and nothing has happened so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using that for while , and it really made a big deferent .</li>
            <li>It interfered with daily life too much.</li>
            <li>There is no any cons so far.</li>
            <li>reference, I am in my early twenties, and had a receding hairline of about 3-4 inches.</li>
            <li>No knock on either of them, but I&#x27;m vain and didn&#x27;t want to look old before my time.  </li>
            <li>The early kits had a sprayer, but the problem was it would get on your hair rather than your scalp.  </li>
            <li>that was a one big mistake, started losing hair like there was no tomorrow, so I stopped using either of these products for about 2 years, and my hair loss became very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still too early to tell if it works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking this product for nearly 2 months now.</li>
            <li>but so far, no hair loss.</li>
            <li>As far as i can tell this product does not do anything.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and come from a family of men with receding hairlines.  </li>
            <li>Vanity and old F-rt hair loss made me try this.</li>
            <li>hair loss didn&#x27;t seem to completely stop, but it mate well have slowed.</li>
            <li>I have been using this 5% solution for around 1.5 months so far.</li>
            <li>Well I bought this to avoid being bald so early.</li>
            <li>A bit early to give it a 100%,</li>
            <li>Wait it out, it does grow back and the sparse areas really do fill in.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised</li>
            <li>At first I purchased a 3 months supply from a Big Box retailer that was first made in Canada, the next 3 months supply from the Big Box retailer was made in Israel.</li>
            <li>Liquid last much longer than one month.</li>
            <li>and it brought much of my hair back all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a sensitive matter</li>
            <li>like I was about to pass out so frequently, after a month of use,</li>
            <li>If you have really heavy hair loss this might not do much but is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Yeah I haven&#x27;t really gotten much worse, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any better either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Same as the costco package, but a few dollars more.  </li>
            <li>This product is quickly and easy to use...similar to other package I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>just not enough right under my hairline to &amp;#34;push back the tide&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I use this product because it offers the same results as the more expensive original brands.</li>
            <li>It says not to use for ta widows peak, but that is where i am mostly using it and it already appears to have some small hairs growing out!</li>
            <li>I even started to use a little brush to apply it with, but it didn&#x27;t make a significant difference and takes a lot of time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to wash the scalp firstly, don&#x27;t use a hair conditioner, and let the scalp dry thoroughly for maximum absorption of the medication.</li>
            <li>I only used it for a couple weeks before switching back to the brand name Rogaine, which may be more expensive, but to me the higher price was worth it in this case.</li>
            <li>The add is not clearing it&#x27;s ONLY FOR VERTEX, after I have applied this to thinning hair area on my head,  specially on the vertex, some white staff, similar to dandruff</li>
            <li>Side effects include dry scalp and mild irritation especially with over application.</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>delaying nature is worth putting your body under extreme strain during exercise then have at it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;•Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;•Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li>I was noticeably thin on top, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad if I kept the sides and back short and textured (having a good hair stylist is important!)</li>
            <li>After the second and half month, I decided to shave my head from about 5 inches on top and 3 inches on the sides / back, to a no. 5 with clippers</li>
            <li>I switched back to Kirkland 6 month supply and the hair has returned and holding steady.</li>
            <li>I resisted for a while, but finally gave in to the fact that I was getting older and that I was at a point where I was gaining weight and losing hair.  </li>
            <li>You know thw results not typical thing and all that jazz.</li>
            <li>(this is where the results not typical thing kicks in)</li>
            <li>I have been using an alternating method of Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue daily since the first use because of reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>I no longer lose hair at all as long as I use this product every day, which is why I like the large amount I get in this order.</li>
            <li>When people tell you more and more that you are losing your hair as it progresses though(probably because they are insecure or ignorant which you really have to try hard to not let bother</li>
            <li>If you work where you sweat a lot you may want to consider other options because when sweat on your head then you are basically sweating the product right off and it can&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since generics of Rogaine are proven to the FDA to be the same functional molecule,  this product is the cheapest per unit volume of minoxidil that you can find, so I would highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>Started seeing results and new hairs after 6-8 weeks, after about 4-5 months i saw my full results and continued using up to 12 months, my hairline was brought forward about an inch and a half!!</li>
            <li>This item works very well, as it has provided the intended results, as long as the directions are followed.</li>
            <li>I  followed the instructions to the T. It (and as I hoped) covered up much of my dye resistant grey brittle hair for the day.</li>
            <li>Same problem as normal rogaine: lots of flaking with drying.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I expected from this product.  </li>
            <li>I immediately stopped taking the product, and after 3 days it went back to normal.</li>
            <li>I read review that it is normal and hair will start to grow back after having use it for a while.</li>
            <li>scalp does get itchier than normal now, but you get used to it, and it can be mitigated with shampoos like Selsun Blue.</li>
            <li>I finally made the connection and stopped using it in the evening and my sleep pattern returned to normal after a day or two.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for receding hairline and even before the first bottle is empty</li>
            <li>So far no significant results but since its same contents you find in previously used brand name, I&#x27;m satisfied with price!</li>
            <li>Being a regular user this particular product caused major major inflammation</li>
            <li>I usually keep my hair at a medium length, but I really didn&#x27;t notice how much hair I had regrown until I shaved my head to even out the longer hairs with the shorter new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The crown bald spot when he started was about as big as a large orange and that same spot is now almost at about 85% coverage.</li>
            <li>This product has the right potential, and an amazingly low price, but, and here&#x27;s the big</li>
            <li>It starts with little blond hairs (maybe different colors for others, i have light brown hair) and eventually they color in.</li>
            <li>The products is reasonable price with numbers of items (average high delivery cost).</li>
            <li>I am on my first bottle of this, and had used a single bottle of rogaine prior and am 58 years old.</li>
            <li>product combined with an internal hair regrowth supplant can regrow new hair.</li>
            <li>However, the price is that you have to depend on it in the future, you will lose your new hair if you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it stopped new hair loss, and gave back maybe 75% of what he had lost?</li>
            <li>but its not all that bad.. atleast its cheap and i&#x27;ll have hair :)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was literally the whole crown area that was dry and crusty.</li>
            <li>But if it would dry fast, it probably wouldn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>Made my face really itchy and dry</li>
            <li>The only thing that is very noticeable is the itching and massive amounts of dandruff the Minoxidil creates.  </li>
            <li>I began taking 5 Hour Energy almost daily during the work week, but after about the 10 week mark I didn&#x27;t need the energy boost as much and only took 5 Hour Energy once or twicea week as needed.</li>
            <li>Product works well and the only complaint is that the foam works better than the dropper.</li>
            <li>, at least I don&#x27;t think you should, the second day on the hair has more *volume* for thinning hair</li>
            <li>i can safely say im now considering pony tails, or at least a visit to the barbers, although since my last request for a haircut &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; i have received a restraining order...</li>
            <li>this product really was a waste of money; it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>So, I told her about Minoxidil and will cost less than $30 for a six months worth of supply on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It takes at least three months for actual effect, but it seems like working okay</li>
            <li>My hair is not totally regrown yet, but there is very noticeable extra foliage where there used to be none.</li>
            <li>To make matters worse, you can not even return the unopened box because Amazon refuses to take it back stating that it contains a hazardous material!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little and the tinny hair parts become strong and long.</li>
            <li>If you have short hair after you apply use this to style your hair also in place of a wax for a very natural looking hold.</li>
            <li>I would say that if you are just starting to lose your hair very early on try taking biotin by itself I wish I had.</li>
            <li>This is not due to Kirkland Minoxidil, it will happen with any minoxidil, any brand.</li>
            <li>though I haven&#x27;t seen a major difference it seems to look thicker than before.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found out that this has exactly the same chemical compounds as Rogain and cost only one third.  </li>
            <li>First off: I haven&#x27;t tried other Minoxidil containing brands</li>
            <li>is a major one.</li>
            <li>and I have not seen any major improvements/results.</li>
            <li>Although I have not grown any new hair, it apparently stopped any further receding or baldness.</li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it, it was mildly irritating on my scalp, but that went away quickly.</li>
            <li>and I can safely say that no new hairs are growing and no more are leaving.</li>
            <li>and I can safely say that no new hairs are growing and no more are leaving.</li>
            <li>It has the same major active  ingredient as the more expense brand, but cost far less.</li>
            <li>they took this off the market in many stores &amp; am glad to get the Generic again  the foam is so messy &amp; expensive  Been looking for this for awhile  </li>
            <li>price is less than half of the original product with exact the same ingredients</li>
            <li>I continued using the product for several more weeks all the while being very anxious and nervous and irritated that I may have caused an increase of balding which I did not intend.</li>
            <li>My personal doctor is of the opinion that Rogaine (and Minoxidil which shares its active ingredient) either don&#x27;t produce ANY results or only create fine vellus hairs that will fall out the instant you stop taking it.  </li>
            <li>I am a male of African decent.</li>
            <li>After 3 months of this my hair is definitely getting thicker and is almost back to where it was in High School.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it worked really well, but I can say that it at least worked a little.</li>
            <li>I got a 3 for 1 special on them, if they arent on sale now, wait a few days and check back.</li>
            <li>This may sound like common sense</li>
            <li>It clearly states in the instructions to use several hours before you go to bed to avoid pillow staining.</li>
            <li>(Disclaimer: The instructions clearly state it is ONLY to be used on the head.)</li>
            <li>For some reason I continued to use it for a whole month during which unthinkable itchiness and dandruff were daily routine.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed that it says in the more detailed instructions that the product must be continued to be used or the gains made will disappear.</li>
            <li>If they do, however, jack their prices, I&#x27;ll just buy a different brand as 5% Minoxidil clearly works for me</li>
            <li>They clearly mentioned that this product is made in Canada, but what they have sent to me is made in Israel, you can read several reviews for Minoxidil from this country!!!!.</li>
            <li>and now I barely notice the itching.</li>
            <li>The scalp itch is barely noticeable to me now</li>
            <li>This is the second time purchasing this product and I have been pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>I put the dropper directly on my scalp and zig zag from front to back.  </li>
            <li>So I was not sure at first that it really worked until several months after I stopped using it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old and my hair had thinned a lot in the last 1-2 years.</li>
            <li>Our local Costco no longer carries this item, was surprised to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Now two years into use you can barely tell that my hair was ever thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li>My only negative is that I&#x27;ve grown hair on my face and back that I have to stay on top of.</li>
            <li>Just started using today, I will report back after a couple months and give an update on how its worked so far</li>
            <li>Once again, I didnt mind this too much, because it actually held my hair in place like a styling product would, and only took a minute to brush all the white out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am already seen results :O</li>
            <li>I am a 22 year old male and my hairline has been receding for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li>now and the only thing preventing me from going completely bald is this solution.</li>
            <li>Apparently the effects of minoxidil start to reverse after 45 days, but I would say it&#x27;s closer to 3 weeks and depends on your genetics.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the effectiveness of minoxidil increases with increasing dosage.</li>
            <li>, there are two boxes with nearly the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>and i think has stopped my head from balding and also has put some hair back like probably 30/40 more...good stuff as far as im concerned</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this actually seemed to work a bit.</li>
            <li>My hair actually looked thinner directly after using this, even though I knew it was working.</li>
            <li>I rub it in real well, and, although it makes my hair wet</li>
            <li>As far as results, the level of thinning has remained the same for 25 years.</li>
            <li>I was starting to lose some hair near the crown area of my head.</li>
            <li>old male with crown (not vertex) balding.</li>
            <li>I just went back to using the liquid form a few months ago and do already see a big difference, I&#x27;m balding from the top of the head, not back, and i do see a lot of hair growing back thicker.  </li>
            <li>You will lose hair at about 4 months and your hair will look worse then in about a year you will have regrown that plus more.</li>
            <li>You slowly drip one ml of fluid on your scalp or the Vertex, which is the top back section of your head.</li>
            <li>My hair was thin on top, to where you could see scalp.  </li>
            <li>Flaking will be eliminated but my hair began to thin out even more.</li>
            <li>My scalp has not gotten worse nor has it gotten better.</li>
            <li>The top of my head was extremely thin.</li>
            <li>The volume of hair i think would make it difficult to reach the scalp effectively</li>
            <li>if I stop using these two shampoos if I would have better or worse dandruff.</li>
            <li>Kirklands mixture of minoxidil is a little more runny and less oily compared to that of equate.</li>
            <li>I started with Rogaine extra strength and it took almost 9 months to see new teeny tiny hairs appearing on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Slow and steady with applying the solution is the rule, or use your fingers to assist, however be CERTAIN to wash your hands immediately as you do NOT want this getting in your eyes!  </li>
            <li>Slow and steady with applying the solution is the rule, or use your fingers to assist, however be CERTAIN to wash your hands immediately as you do NOT want this getting in your eyes!  </li>
            <li>It is also much less expensive than the foam and works great.  </li>
            <li>Not a full regrowth, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than a flat, empty splotch!  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the group of small bottles instead of the large size.  </li>
            <li>The box appears to be exactly like the one I got at Costco previously.</li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviews stated, you start noticing an increase in hair loss after about the first 2 weeks to 1 month of use but after 2-3 weeks the extra hair loss stops.</li>
            <li>Sure, a little dandruff and a little itch, but what&#x27;s the alternative?</li>
            <li>However, my results are not typical, because hair growth has to do with genetics, rather than proper use of this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product (which leaves sticky residue in my hair, but seems fairly effective in preventing further hair loss) for 3-4 yr.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuneately in my last two orders most of the &#x27;press down and turn&#x27; safety caps are DEFECTIVE, impossible to open, even with tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see the new growth and it seems to have slowed down the hair loss while growing some new hair.</li>
            <li>late stage baldness, you won&#x27;t see any significant hair</li>
            <li>However, he noted as other reviewers did previously-this stuff makes your scalp very itchy.  </li>
            <li>Not a single hair grow.</li>
            <li>the only bad thing about this is a 6 month supply turns into a 3 month, but its working great for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 22 year old Asian male.</li>
            <li>am not a medical professional, however, I would suspect results could vary depending on individual health-genetic characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and hopefully I get the ability back as I am only 31 years old.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the same results but it may be too early to write a review because it is only been a couple of months</li>
            <li>so i am adamant about giving my hair a second life as such.  </li>
            <li>(It does not dry on the scalp for about 3 hours).&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I was just getting extremely thin on the entire top of my head.</li>
            <li>Got this for my son,23 yo starting to thin on top</li>
            <li>Skip the expensive brand and get your hair back as effectively with Kirkland.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does make my hair kind of greasy/sticky but only where I apply it and to the casual observer</li>
            <li>I switched back to the solution about 3 months ago and have seen major improvements.</li>
            <li>minoxidil definitely reduces hair loss but has no effect on dht, the major culprit...</li>
            <li>First a little background.</li>
            <li>my hair was thin and fine to begin with, but at 39 years old and being a female, when my hair started falling out and my doctor couldn&#x27;t find a physiological reason, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>next experiment will be to see how long these new hairs</li>
            <li>I have been used it for a year and a half, and in the first year, I lose a lot of hair, but, in a couple of month later, my hair star growing again, you just need to give it time, and should work</li>
            <li>(hopefully you won&#x27;t have any major sexual side effects), apply 1 ml minoxidil twice a day (or double the dose once at night) and shower with both biotin shampoo and 1% ketoconazole (nizoral) shampoo every other day leaving it in your hair for at least 5-7 minutes (which is known to have anti-androgenetic effects)...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer noticeably thin on top, and I&#x27;ve regained a good amount of hair along my temples, so I no longer have as bad of an \\&quot;island.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the side effects are real and it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is specifically for balding at the back of the head, not for receding hairline or general thinning hair...</li>
            <li>if you use it in a long term, although you are just using it on your scalp, it will eventually enters your body from capillaries, which would cause some unexpected effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a week, so that&#x27;s something to bare in mind while reading about my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>YOU WILL NOT REGROW A FULL HEAD OF THICK HAIR, BUT IT DEFFINATELY DOES REGROW AND HELP FILL IN AREAS OF THINNING</li>
            <li>My fiance took a picture of the top of my head last night and the change is DRAMATIC.</li>
            <li>and I think it even adds a little more body than my baby-fine hair usually has.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I purchased the product mainly for my extremely sparse eyebrows that have been ravaged by thyroid disease.  </li>
            <li>But nevertheless, I felt that my hair loss was minimal and that it did regenerate new growth.  </li>
            <li>but I believe I found the right substance, I&#x27;ve used rogain in the past and that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>This product really works, and cost much less than Rogaine.</li>
            <li>Name brand was twice as much for half the amount of the product.</li>
            <li>The application itself is a bit of a pain; you have to do it twice daily, and you use the dropper and gently rub it into the thin/balding areas, and if you&#x27;re not careful it will drip (it has an oily texture, so definitely DON&#x27;T apply it less</li>
            <li>You need to be as consistent as possible with this if you miss an application or a day every few weeks</li>
            <li>than it had prior to use but after the first few weeks I saw regrowth to match it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money buying brand name products when generics are composed of exact same formula.</li>
            <li>There is also no new growth in the front near my temples as is stated on the product.</li>
            <li>There is also no new growth in the front near my temples as is stated on the product.</li>
            <li>Still the hairloss continued but seemed to slow down more.</li>
            <li>It only took a week to get the Kirkland product at less than half the price, so if it works anywhere near as well as ProRestora, it is definately worth it.  </li>
            <li>I had fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>The idea is to treat your minor baldness before it turns into a major problem.</li>
            <li>The first couple weeks, as with any Rogaine-type product, you go through \\&quot;hair shock\\&quot;, which temporarily accelerates hair loss (new hairs are supposed to grow in as the weak hair dies off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your hair serves important functions, so take a little extra time everyday to preserve it.</li>
            <li>little depressing that I have to keep using it for the rest of forever, but not nearly as depressing as having a bald spot on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>was a victim of going to the brow salon very frequent, and it wasnt long before I had to pencil my brows in just to shape them.</li>
            <li>I was told in high school that baldness is passed down through the female gene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and it still looks great with the fuller hair.  </li>
            <li> and i am happy to say about to increased hair density which i didnt see during Lipogaine usage also.</li>
            <li> I am a happy customer.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to see</li>
            <li> I used the foam before, which was great.  </li>
            <li> I know its tended for ppl with severe hair loss issues, but this is great for brows.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and i know its a great product</li>

            <li> best value, doesn&#x27;t leave oily easy to apply.</li>

            <li> thank you for good item.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> As I imagined it, good product.  </li>
            <li> As described and good deal</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> Product works good for me...</li>
            <li> but the hair were receding at a good rate.</li>
            <li> 4 months is a good time to show some results.</li>
            <li> good product at a good pric</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, a good diet helps alot too.</li>
            <li> its a good sign...</li>
            <li> But for the price, it&#x27;s a good first-step to controlling hair loss on a budget.</li>
            <li> The good news is i have used it for four years and still need to use it.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it&#x27;d do me some good.</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the result turns to be good.</li>
            <li> It is a good start product for people who want to try some minoxidil product.</li>
            <li> decided to try again but used a good conditioner along with it.  </li>
            <li> Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> It has Good Price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not looking too good</li>
            <li> minoxidil is good.  </li>
            <li> Worked out good.  </li>
            <li> Good luck guys - hope it works for you also.</li>
            <li> Good luck hope it works for you too.</li>
            <li> like this one would be a good bet.</li>
            <li> I take both the biotin and Minoxidil for good measure, and I’ve been seeing encouraging results so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a good day</li>
            <li> and i have kept my hair and it looks good and</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> good feel</li>
            <li> Good product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is a good deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price IMO.</li>
            <li> Why pay the premium for Rogaine, when this is just as good?  </li>
            <li> Some are good others seem like your just buying alcohol.</li>
            <li> Good price,slow shipping</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a go based on seemingly good ratings.</li>
            <li> Good product and service.</li>
            <li> This is as good as the branded minoxidil.</li>
            <li> This is a good for the price.</li>
            <li> This works good, but... once you stop using it you will lose the gains.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a good product for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with a good scalp cleansing shampoo this product does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Good price and it works</li>
            <li> have had good luck with this method using the Kroger minoxidil.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I will give this 2 stars, since the price is so good, but for some reason, it&#x27;s just not working, in fact, the loss seems to be accelerating.</li>
            <li> When it comes to hairloss educate yourself and good luck</li>
            <li> When it comes to hairloss educate yourself and good luck</li>
            <li> so that is good.</li>
            <li> good delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where it got those good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good price....fast ship</li>

            <li> JUST I WISH IT WOULD BE GOOD~~~</li>

            <li> The product is a good value and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> seems to be good stuff</li>
            <li> and I have had some good comments.  </li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Maybe this time I&#x27;ll quit for good.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Great fast service - perfect product received.</li>
            <li> While no one can argue that the price point for this item is exceptional, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up compared to the brand name Rogaine Foam.  </li>
            <li> Best part of the product is it dries quickly without leaving a residue.  </li>
            <li> Great product, It really works excellent.</li>
            <li> very light and non greasy, great potency.  </li>
            <li> Great product, still using it since more than a year.</li>
            <li> I believe I am still &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; regardless of  bald spot, which many actors in hollywood proudly display.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m glad I can get it here for a greatly reduced price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, and will continue with it indefinitely.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased by my results and even my barber noticed.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> but I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel good about keep using it honestly.</li>
            <li> now i get more hair really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller , very fast shipping , Item as described , Thanks! ♥</li>
            <li> Satisfied!</li>
            <li> but I am sure it never dries once one applies it into their scalp!</li>
            <li> I am sure if I stopped, the recession would continue, but I am so damn vain!</li>
            <li> It ended up more on my temples and cheeks than it did on the spots I was trying to treat!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Husband has been using Rogaine for many years, successfully.  </li>
            <li> You get MUCH more!  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I can prevent more loss of that hair while using this!</li>
            <li> It does work!Thank you, it is better than our expectations!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give Minoxidil all the credit on that, but it sure helps; maybe it can help you too!</li>
            <li> this stuff works, better than rogaine!</li>
            <li> It works, as my hairdresser knows for sure!</li>
            <li> ...but a lot more convenient!</li>
            <li> dreams will come true every day you use this incredible product to&lt;br /&gt;grow</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent  100 % positive</li>
            <li> A great product for a cheap price</li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing a post from one of the people who used this and achieved amazing results.</li>
            <li> B00B5OM58U Hair Growth Essentials + FREE Maximum Strength Biotin Tablets]]) are a great combination for increased growth as well as strength and shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing amazing results.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you now that this is effective against hair loss</li>
            <li> cant stop kind of rule</li>
            <li> but it seems to be effective</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this product has stalled any additional hair loss.</li>
            <li> I make sure I eat good proteins to build my scalp and hair strength.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re catching</li>
            <li> The nice thing about it is that the cat stays away from the her and stops bothering her all the time to play -</li>
            <li> It was a nice attempt to save money but didn&#x27;t work out dermatologically.  </li>
            <li> Hair kind of reached a max growth point after about 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it will be effective eventually or not.</li>
            <li> This product worked as intended, effectively and with no side effects.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kind of on a whim.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just kind of a vanity thing.  </li>
            <li> seems to work effectively.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li> is so effective that I am growing hairs all over my chest, legs, and</li>
            <li> To be honest since using this instead of rogaine foam</li>
            <li> The result is surprising because is even says on the bottle that it works better on the crown than at the hairline, nonetheless it still managed help regrow my hairline.  </li>
            <li> For best results you need to start using it before you lose too much hair.</li>
            <li> Once you get your thin/bald spot covered up, most people can go to once a day with good results.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and excellent product</li>
            <li> Handy containers.  </li>
            <li> if it is as effective, but the dandruff went away within a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months now and it seems to be equally effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s not as effective.</li>
            <li> nice and work for me i satred to see the resoult</li>
            <li> and it grow hair for u nice one guys</li>
            <li> I also think the lack of stress and warm weather also had something to with it</li>
            <li> My own opinion is that if you are already skin bald, save your money.</li>
            <li> One more thing, I started by applying twice a day until I saw good hair growth</li>
            <li> It would  have been nice if the Company had supplied a return slip in the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Some things to note: I&#x27;m 21 and had quite a nice patch going on.</li>
            <li> You cannot return this product because it is considered as a hazardous material.</li>
            <li> /&gt;•Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation</li>
            <li> Excellent value, and very prompt service.  </li>
            <li> The product has high quality, fast results and excellent price!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything of best !!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived in very good condition, and it was exactly the product advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rite Aids 5% for many years and have felt very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I have to keep using it in order not to start losing hair again, but I&#x27;m super happy to have it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now with good results , easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommendable.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in several days, good condition, no complaints, especially happy with price!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I found the product very easy to use.</li>
            <li> also, FINE PRODUCT WHICH I HAVE USED FOR A NUMBER OD YEARS WITH GOOD RESULTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great success with it.</li>
            <li> Based on many testimonials and tests the foam is easier to use, but not as effective, and definitively has to be used twice a day.</li>
            <li> and honestly I think it’s even  better than the name brand stuff.</li>
            <li> im glad he is an honest person,</li>
            <li> As far as pricing, this Amazon offer is excellent.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s effective - more hair growth.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very happy with his results thus far.</li>
            <li> I looked around some more and found out about Nizoral a dandruff shampoo which has an amazing ability to also block dht at the follicles.</li>
            <li> I started using Rogaine liquid then used the foam which I liked more</li>
            <li> I have used minoxidil for around 10-11 months now and its worked nicely for the most part.  </li>
            <li> They do say that the combination of the two is the most effective treatment extant</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it is all about catching the problem before it becomes too severe for this to work.  </li>
            <li> A product from NuNutrients has been the most effective for me in-terms of seeing hair regrowth, but I’ve also used Rogaine as well as the Kirkland brand and seen results, just a lot slower.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well, and isn&#x27;t a significant added expense.</li>
            <li> Great and with very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Even my hair stylist noticed (although she noticed it on the top right side which is the side I tilt my head to, lol).</li>
            <li> as good as the original and a much better price</li>
            <li> They generally tell women to start with 2.5 %,but a Dr recommended using the %5 for best results and it works.  </li>
            <li> it is very cheap~</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and really effective.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to decide whether to try this product or not and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s snowing on top of my head when I brush my hand across my hair.  </li>
            <li> Cheapest minoxidil available!</li>
            <li> I felt like i lost more hair than gained.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a light tingle, this is a scratch your head til you bleed kind of itch.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> LOST MORE THAN</li>
            <li> I am extremely confident I would have a lot more hair if I did not use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheapest I have been able to find minoxidil.  </li>
            <li> not 100% sure if this will work for me</li>
            <li> say for a guy that is crowning on top.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the deal with this stuff, it works for most men.</li>
            <li> The biggest problems most people complain about is flaking scalp or shedding of hair.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll know for sure.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> this is just great, it doesnt ich all that much and</li>
            <li> Well, I tried this product more than once and for me it has proven to do what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Ok so here&#x27;s the lowdown.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE</li>
            <li> and I see hair sprouting more and more.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my meds or just my genes</li>
            <li> Nothing works better than Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and buying it in a multi-month quantity makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This makes him a lot happier and more confident about himself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be wiser to go to the gym more often.</li>
            <li> Was pleased with product and will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Kirkland Minoxidil seems to be okay...</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I was also growing some on my scalp, but they just weren&#x27;t as visible as the others.</li>
            <li> After that it continued, but could be ignored for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you get the unscented version.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than the foam.  </li>
            <li> and therefore I tend to get more treatments out of the bottle than I did with the foam.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident that the hairs will become fuller and darker as time goes on.</li>
            <li> and i already feel like my hair is thicker and growing better.</li>
            <li> Have used this product more as a hair gel since all it seems to do is make my hair grow faster, not thicker.</li>
            <li> and say i dont miss my hair more...</li>
            <li> It has not gotten much better but it has stopped the hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t lost any more hair as off Dec 2013.</li>
            <li> Many of them recommended rogaine to regrow the over-tweezed hair.&lt;br /&gt;Welp</li>
            <li> After abandoning this product and losing more hair, I returned and I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> Make sure to try the solution out before the foam.  </li>
            <li> The solutions inactive ingredients cause flaking but also allow the minoxidil to absorb better.  </li>
            <li> If I used it twice a day I&#x27;m sure the results would be even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Though hair is receding, some hair is better than no hair at all.</li>
            <li> Because when it turns &amp;#34;Major&amp;#34;, this product may not be able to help you.</li>
            <li> Why pay so much more for the name brand when this works just as well?</li>
            <li> 5% is better than 2%.</li>
            <li> After my 24th birthday passed this May, and many more hairs graced the floor of my shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Minoxidil for many years.</li>
            <li> I have been using Minoxidil for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other interesting fact</li>
            <li> I bought this liquid Minoxidil about 18 months ago and it was OK.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to internalize all the material and not just the case studies or television chemicals.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this works or not like many others.  </li>
            <li> mostly use it once a day and sometimes twice if I remember and that seems to be enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are thousands more</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vertex of my hairline (where I’ve been seeing the most change) is the area that I’m</li>
            <li> the most concerned about,</li>
            <li> and I have more hair than on the Top period of using minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 5 years and a have a bit more hair up front than before.  </li>
            <li> The foam is a better vehicle but is messier.</li>
            <li> I run 5K most days.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my BF as he thought his hair was falling out, okay</li>
            <li> Unless the product never ends up working, of course &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> to look for better pricing on drugs.</li>
            <li> Why dont you make it in spray canister for a more even and more convenient application?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost more hair than I had at the beginning.</li>
            <li> I need to keep applying and massaging more in order to continue increase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use it after reading more about the product.</li>
            <li> I did some more research and decided to give Kirkland Minoxidil a chance.</li>
            <li> Works as well or better than Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> It is more like a 3 - 4 month supply however the top of my head is fully grown</li>
            <li> I lost much  more hair than before.</li>
            <li> more time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works for me, when i stopped applying it is saw more shedding.</li>
            <li> I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> I hope this isn&#x27;t a problem for most people</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t take it any more.</li>
            <li> Used for years, best buy on the net.</li>
            <li> I suspect it has more to do with my stressful career.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair getting thicker (as in more strands) on the top</li>
            <li> Maybe more hopeful science will find a better solution.</li>
            <li> It works great, I&#x27;ll use for 6 months and then see if this is real or not.</li>
            <li> Better than even the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> I wish the Rock had used this stuff, he would have came back looking awesome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minoxidil does indeed work, and some will benefit more than others.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look thicker and had many comments from friends as to that affect.</li>
            <li> My hair has been falling out since I was 18, now I am 50 and have most of it</li>
            <li> I noticed the change after about one month and it is getting better and better.</li>
            <li> -kinda think it&#x27;s working, but can&#x27;t say for sure, give it a year.  </li>
            <li> it stopped my hair loss and also started growing more hair.</li>
            <li> Rogaine for example is better.</li>
            <li> I will not buy ot again unless i am really broke and can&#x27;t afford rogaine.also Experienced dandruff since using this</li>
            <li> This product has an excellent reputation, but it takes time to see if it will work on an individual.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I should note that I am a woman whose hair loss is more generalized than it is in men.</li>
            <li> some thinning on top and bit of a receding hairline</li>
            <li> keeping fit and looking good are things I consider important.</li>
            <li> so I combed my hair over to cover it but also realized that if I had hairloss this would make it more noticeable.</li>
            <li> The product says you won&#x27;t see results for about 4 to 6 months, so maybe I still have more hair to regain.</li>
            <li> Also, it may just have worked out this way, but I started seeing the gains after I started making sure that I rubbed the solution into my scalp</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best thing I&#x27;ve tried for treating hair loss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may work for you, but it sure didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Love it...have been using for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> Product is ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been somewhat inconsistent and I do notice a LOT more hairs falling out when I stop using it.</li>
            <li> so I would imagine the DHT insensitivity in my hair follicles is more aggressive than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> within 1 week I could see more hair started to fall when I</li>
            <li> Feel itchy on my skull and start loosing more hairs.</li>
            <li> I noted Costco switched to foam application which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> ok, nessun problema, prodotto ottimo, consigliato.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months and already see substantially more growth in my beard.</li>
            <li> Canada is better than  Israel&#x27;s.so</li>
            <li> but I believe you can still use it to atleast stop losing more of ur hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all minoxidil either works or it doesn&#x27;t, it depends on the person.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s delivered to your door excellent products inc the same u would buy in the store</li>
            <li> Why would I want to stand out more when trying to thicken my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the Rogaine foam, it worked much better.</li>
            <li> The foam also smelled better, and it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp like this stuff.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for many years</li>
            <li> Maybe, I cannot say for sure.</li>
            <li> price is more affordable than the name brand competitors.</li>
            <li> I do know that the 5% solution netted better results for me than the 2% solution so if you&#x27;re going to get in, go ALL in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure results can and do vary and like most men I&#x27;m too vain to mention it to most friends</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give Minoxidil all the credit on that, but it sure helps; maybe it can help you too!ur hair rather than your scalp.  </li>
            <li> sure you apply the solution</li>
            <li> If you are starting to have hair loss or your hair is thinning out or damaged Minoxidil is the best treatment for years.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find the liquid Minoxidil at Costco.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> It was about two years ago that my barber had told me I was thinning out at the top.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already pleased.</li>
            <li> this stuff must not be stopped or you will lose all regrown hair and additionally more.</li>
            <li> and he has bought more.</li>
            <li> What more can you say?</li>
            <li> The foam gets more in the surrounding hair than on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Reduced balding at top of head within two months.  </li>
            <li> I think foam would stay in place better as the idea is to treat an area of scalp.</li>
            <li> However if I stop using it for more than 5 days or so, then I will noticeably begin to lose more hair than when i was on the product.  </li>
            <li> I love my Robert Zur shoes and the mixodil is something I cannot find here in that quantity.</li>
            <li> omn the top of things .....</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for an incredibly low price.</li>
            <li> I want to use it more</li>
            <li> But doing that won&#x27;t allow me to use the stuff twice a day and have sexy hair .</li>
            <li> Like most of us, I just figured this was my genetic lot in life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the most disciplined guy in the world and sticking to any twice-a-day regimine isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve ever managed to do before.  </li>
            <li> and I have more confidence.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff many years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products like hair max laser comb, homeopathy, Lipogaine, Procerin etc.</li>
            <li> I have been able to find anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these greasy Minoxidil formulations for years and this brand is actually much better than some of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the savings.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me you probably will use more than 1ml each use and will go through more of this.</li>
            <li> and I also got a bit of a confidence boost from just using it because I felt like things were on their way to getting better.</li>
            <li> You need to wait for 4 months and more, but I don&#x27;t like my hairs after applying minoxidil.</li>
            <li> the price is ok too</li>
            <li> I have been using products with Minoxidil 5% for many years.  </li>
            <li> my mousse works better than this.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Best price anywhere ts 5% minoxidil same as rogaine at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> This is why you’ll see so many 1 star reviews for Rogaine or this Kirkland Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great product</li>
            <li> I have been using Monoxodil for many years and ound that it helps with re-growing my hair.  </li>
            <li> And I think it&#x27;s waaaaay better than the name brand spray on stuff which smells way too toxic for me.</li>
            <li> It has worked better than I even hoped.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it and use if for the front and top of my hair.</li>
            <li> The result is better when you use it with dermaroller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> So i now have about 30% more hair than when i started.  </li>
            <li> I accept my hair loss but would like it to happen a bit more graceful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect to either recieve or be able to maintain hair longer than 3 inches.  </li>
            <li> * Use Hair dryer after showering and massage well into scalp for 5 minutes to optimize absorption and stimulate circulation for better hair growth.</li>
            <li> It took almost six months before I could look at the top on my head and say,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping in a couple more months it&#x27;ll be fully regrown, or almost so.</li>
            <li> In any case, I am pleased and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Most reviews will have people state that they \\&quot;tried it but didn&#x27;t see any relief\\</li>
            <li> If it showed any meaningful effectiveness, I prolly never would have quit to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Best of all is the price and relative ease of shipping the product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> order came exactly as they said it would....100% satisfaction !!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> works as effective as the original Rogaine 5% foam.</li>
            <li> I will continue to update the review in the coming months, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product and with very reasonable pricing from amazon</li>
            <li> I ordered more of the product during the fifth month when I noticed that I could no longer see my scalp as easily on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I have been using now for over the month and my scalp is doing pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t scratch all your hair out then you have pretty good self control.</li>
            <li> all these things considered, I am willing to continue this product and give it a fair chance, because its not an inconvenience or embarrassment to my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on my frontal receding hairline.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good hair now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this even if my hair loss will resume if I stop use, because as long as Kirkland don&#x27;t jack their prices</li>
            <li> Very happy, it is part of my life long routine now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to measure out the \\&quot;dosage\\&quot; and very easy to get it to the right places.  </li>
            <li> Okay, no problem, very good product, recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Already prompted several times always ok!&lt;br /&gt;Tutto</li>
            <li> Golden Years!!  </li>
            <li> 5 more months to go to have a more accurate assessment</li>
            <li> if you keep your hair short its a good product at a good price</li>
            <li> Word to the wise, if you want to get this make sure that you&#x27;re ready to commit to it.</li>
            <li> you can actually get somethings good at a fair price.</li>
            <li> and my results are great compared to most, my doctor said I started using it at the right time (when I first saw receding/thinning)</li>
            <li> Discontinued and started using Rogaine and that works fine form is better</li>
            <li> The applicator is very easy to use; a full squeeze of the bulb draws up just about the recommend dosage amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 now and still have a very full head of hair even though it has changed from brown to silver.</li>
            <li> I really see my scalp anymore even with bright lights in my bathrooms lit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all cases, the results take time to be able to accurately call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foam version otherwise available puts more stuff in your hair than on your scalp.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I noticed that the frontal and temple part of hair is becoming thinning.</li>
            <li> laser light, nioxin and herbal remedies are all mostly ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> laser light, nioxin and herbal remedies are all mostly ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I put cheap gel in my hair, which made my thinning stand out more.</li>
            <li> most people are too polite to ask questions that genuinely puzzle them.  </li>
            <li> most people are too polite to ask questions that genuinely puzzle them.  </li>
            <li> why pay more when you get it dirt cheap</li>
            <li> The applicator is great getting directly to the scalp</li>
            <li> I did not have a receding hairline, but it was thinning out on top, but because of Minoxidil, it has filled in quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I am surprised it works as well as it does and am really happy it does.</li>
            <li> good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li> good article and price,  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It was a good stuff; I didn&#x27;t regrow any hair, but it was very reliable for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Really does work just as good as the name-brand stuff, too.</li>
            <li> This is a good price  and fast service.</li>
            <li> Ya, Right!!</li>
            <li> if you purchase this but remember that covering a bald spot will not make you a better person and probably will not make you any more appealing than you are right now.  </li>
            <li> I originally asked my physician for a hair-loss solution and he told me that most of his patients saw results with minoxidil and believe me,I was reluctant....</li>
            <li> and I now sport a full popadore!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dream come true!  </li>
            <li> My husband says this works just like the original rogaine at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Results come at an extremely glacial pace, so best to take some pictures every month to see results over time.</li>
            <li> Easy application&lt;</li>
            <li> However, it just sorta looks like you had gel in your hair and it brushes out easily with your hand.</li>
            <li> For this price, its easy to keep going.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it produced some very mild regrowth of hair in my temples.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure there all about the same, but this was a great value.</li>
            <li> Thus far (two weeks), I&#x27;m very favorably impressed.  </li>
            <li> strongly recommend using quality launderable pillow and mattress protectors to prevent this problem on things which cannot be easily washed.</li>
            <li> easy to apply with the tube they provide with the package.</li>
            <li> However, the application is an easy one.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend it to anyone whose hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> ive had no itch, and the scent of this isn&#x27;t as strong as rogaine.</li>
            <li> For me, stronger versions of minoxidil are too strong and damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Do not like it, strong and causes itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the genetic factor is so strong like the Hasselback brothers, it&#x27;s just too strong to overcome.</li>
            <li> being said, it is what it claims to be, the price is decent, and the packaging and applicator pipette are good.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product and vendor.  </li>
            <li> I began taking strong medications about 8 to 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I think the best idea is to just make sure you only comb your hair and touch your scalp when absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also BE AWARE that you cannot return this product because it&#x27;s considered a flammable or hazardous substance.</li>
            <li> you start using it and getting good results, you DO have to keep using it if you want to keep the new growth.</li>
            <li> the product itself is fine  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be fine but try and make it a routine in the morning</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product thus far; my barber has commented on how my hair has gotten fuller on top; I&#x27;m somewhat disheartened that it doesn&#x27;t appear to be getting any fuller on the sides.  </li>
            <li> it works just fine, does the job.</li>
            <li> I was prescribed this product form my dermatologist, and she said it was fine for women to use as well as men.</li>
            <li> using it on the weekends or time frames when you plan on going out and socializing, and I think you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I love my dad and know what I&#x27;d look like at 50 if I hadn&#x27;t been using Minoxidil and am glad I&#x27;ve been using it as I think I look more youthful and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I love my dad and know what I&#x27;d look like at 50 if I hadn&#x27;t been using Minoxidil and am glad I&#x27;ve been using it as I think I look more youthful and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine with no unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li> Precise and easy withdrawal.</li>
            <li> (\\&quot;baby\\&quot; fine) hair, brown tending toward blond.  </li>
            <li> Once it does, however, my hair looks fine</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> fine product made my day&lt;</li>
            <li> Thanks from the top of my head!</li>
            <li> I feel very lucky to have found a great product that actually helps prevent hair loss, I&#x27;m grateful for to have found Kirkland Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Most of the positive effect is the cosmetic look and feel of more hair from the Propylene Glycol ingredient.</li>
            <li> when i rub it in my scalp i am also able to mold my hair which is an odd, but good bonus!</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a huge difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> we noticed a huge deference in his beard area.</li>
            <li> What a huge savings.</li>
            <li> on time delivery and accurate product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to pay a bit more for foam.</li>
            <li> I got free delivery, but this time delivery was from UPS.</li>
            <li> Great price, same product as Rogaine</li>
            <li> cheap too...</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and it has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> it has a light scent though...</li>
            <li> Using the Minoxidil and shaving (lol) is part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> In hindsight, I should have opted for the regular strength 2% solution, but this just seemed like too great of a deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Talking about side effect, I didn&#x27;t experienced issues such as scalp itch, but dandruff indeed exists, hopefully it will disappear after you are using a longer time.</li>
            <li> This was my primary goal anyway.</li>
            <li> I experienced profuse itching to the point that I was up at 1:00am washing my hair and applying topical hydrocortisone to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a cheap, efficient way to regrow their overplucked brows.</li>
            <li> But after 3 months of my diligent routine I am happy with the Minoxidil , especially since the price is so affordable.</li>
            <li> and I have been problem free since.</li>
            <li> The detailed directions state that not all see results and that results can take 2 months to see.  </li>
            <li> Actually works if you stick with it and this is a great value compared to what it costs in stores.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Kirkland Minoxidil at Costco when it was as cheap as it is at this store.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am too cheap to buy the name brand</li>
            <li> It took a couple of months to get it filled in again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I can imagine this is more effective than the foam version as it is more likely to contact your scalp and get to work.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very low price.  </li>
            <li> It works great, but the only side effect I have had is graying hair from using the product.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a fantastic difference in the thickness</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from using this product, it&#x27;s great for the money, it actually did work.</li>
            <li> The costs of all this is amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li> The costs of all this is amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li> It is nearly filled in.  </li>
            <li> The crown area has improved but isn&#x27;t quite filled in yet.  </li>
            <li> To be honest Minoxidil is the chemical that really does the job doesnt matter which brand you use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more, but it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> You can google the actual experiment case studies, which is where I read it works great for receding hairlines, so we tried it and</li>
            <li> 6 month supply for under $30 is as cheap as I&#x27;ve ever found and it works.</li>
            <li> 2% was all that was available then, then switched to 5%.</li>
            <li> had two primary concerns about trying any product for hair loss.  </li>
            <li> GREAT SELLER AND WILL COME BACK AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Great price for rogaine generic  </li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s always available here.</li>
            <li> This truly works well and is a great inexpensive generic version of Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Great deal for a lot of product, however, this product did not work for me as I did not grow back hair.  </li>
            <li> This product also makes your hair oily and will stain pillows and clothes light in color.</li>
            <li> I have to keep writing stuff to make amazon happy with enough words</li>
            <li> but I did notice some distinct change for the better</li>
            <li> Vanity is not as important as sex life.</li>
            <li> issue is that it has to be applied precisely</li>
            <li> so having an improvement in the visual appeal was great for me.</li>
            <li> For me, the dandruff isn&#x27;t so severe that it&#x27;s a deal breaker at all for the amount of regrowth and the immediate stoppage of further loss that I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working good, the delivery took a while.</li>
            <li> Buying this product is not only a good deal but the amount that you get for the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Good price but still waiting for my natural rug to come to sprout from my follicly challenged scalp.</li>
            <li> far it sounds all good</li>
            <li> this stuff really works and makes a noticeable difference even if used once a day when going to sleep, which is the best time of day to apply this specific product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> You have a good chance of maintaining what you have and the younger the better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very thankful that my body reacted to the minoxidil and shampoo, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that I wouldn&#x27;t have achieved results like this if I had waited a while longer -- the sooner you start, the better!  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be fine as a solution, as I know Kirkland to be a pretty reputable brand.</li>
            <li> I think it is important to clean your scalp before applying.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great and much more affordable than the name brand product, also with free shipping, it costs less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, I think this product is good, and it is cheap, too.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, when I get up and before I go to bed.. quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly to anyone who has thinning hair, it has been amazing.</li>
            <li> This is for sure the more economical option, and considering you need to use it for a prolonged period of time that is certainly something to consider.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could take it to speed up hair growth by using it along with Minoxidil, then stop after your bald spot is gone, but it also takes months before you will see any results while having to put up with less than satisfying \\&quot;happy endings\\</li>
            <li> So far, the Kirkland Minoxidil 5% has worked great and I have experienced few issues or side-effects.  </li>
            <li> Looking at some of the clinical trials of Rogaine, this product will not regrow hair, but users will not lose any more hair than they already have with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just make sure you are consistent in your application cycles - and your die pattern.</li>
            <li> The expiration date seems rigged, the number 8 stands out, it looks as if originally it was either a 3 or a 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Even thought I have kept using it for two years now, my hairloss has progressed significantly, and furthermore I have now grown hair in places</li>
            <li> I had a significant amount of hair loss from a side effect of a medication and for years was one of those guys who went around with a hat glued to his head.</li>
            <li> Then they upped the price to two to three times the original.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it 2 years ago, I haven&#x27;t seen significant hair loss, but who knows what it would have looked like had I not been taking it.</li>
            <li> I originally switched from the Rogaine 5% Foam.</li>
            <li> Worth the try!</li>
            <li> I started using things like this about 5 years ago when I first started to notice hair thinning at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> and I trimmed my hair to balance the growth with the original</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and it does keep my hair from falling out more; however, it does&#x27;t seem to work for me in growing more hair, maybe I should use it twice a day as is recommended, but I am allergic to the propylene glycol in it which makes my scalp red and itchy.</li>
            <li> I experienced no adverse side effects except a very, very minor itchiness of my scalp.</li>
            <li> head and hair feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> I like clean hair, no hair spray or gel, just clean hair . . .</li>
            <li> My hair is clean without any dandruff</li>
            <li> Castor Oil, Brow Serum, and 5% Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;Ive used every item on list and the only most effective one was Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the eye dropper tells you exactly how much to use, but with the foam, you have to make your best guess if you&#x27;re using the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, strong looking hairs where I know for sure</li>
            <li> After 6 months, the hair line has filled in nicely and the \\&quot;chrome dome\\&quot; was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I doubt this will give a bald man a full head of hair, but for light thinning and receding this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> The Kirkland Minoxidil seems to be more effective for hairgrowth and much easier to spread directly on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Way better off getting the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I started using the same product after about 3 months layoff and had good results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy another 6 month supply just to make sure I get as much as I can out of this stuff</li>
            <li> Short dated but good.</li>
            <li> People who say it doesn&#x27;t work, I can guarantee, have not used it for 2 to 4 months to see the true results.  </li>
            <li> And I feel much better even if the results aren&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> Six month supply is more like 2 to 3 month supply if you really want results.</li>
            <li> I observed that I couldn&#x27;t see as much scalp on top as before.  </li>
            <li> Trying to grow a full beard and with the progress</li>
            <li> Not in every case but in my own empirical experience this product speed up my hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked around and they really beat out most and the quality is there as I can see it working after 30 days use.  </li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s such a good idea...</li>
            <li> I used it for more than two months and everyone ask me why I loss my hair so fast.</li>
            <li> I used to pay $20 for a 3-month supply of minoxidil at Walmart - for $7 dollars more I get twice as much and don&#x27;t have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> , the whole eat healthy to grow hair is BS.</li>
            <li> Good price for generic alternative.</li>
            <li> Both my brothers are bald but my full head of hair is still on my head.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> Naturally if you&#x27;re thrilled with the product...</li>
            <li> MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEND THIS SURVEY 3-6 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE FOR A TRUE ANSWER.</li>
            <li> Going to keep using it for the full six months and will reevaluate then.</li>
            <li> Tried head and shoulders and tried waiting the full 6 months to see if it would improve, but neither made</li>
            <li> I have a 100% full head of hair now.</li>
            <li> A true Amazon value.</li>
            <li> If you bought please ask your money refund or ask seller to send some good brand in same money because the time your spend cannot be paid by any one.</li>
            <li> Price is fair, but wish it were the same price as in Sam&#x27;s ($19.99).</li>
            <li> /&gt;They say it takes around 6 months to see the full benefit, but you notice it around 2 months in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to hear from anyone else who has used this product for more than 2 months, and in the meantime I also plan on updating my rating after that time.</li>
            <li> well, my head is full of hair, no bald spot.</li>
            <li> A bit more confidence- enough to feel free spirited flirty again with the girlies and not begrudgingly envious of hairy man heads.  </li>
            <li> and im sure no one wants to go bald.  </li>
            <li> Application is very straight forward and easy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I experienced an adverse reaction with my skin turning bright red on areas exposed to the product in addition to some extreme itching.</li>
            <li> I have noticed significant more hair and it is more coarse, so it feels fuller..</li>
            <li> Many say only effective for the top of the head, I&#x27;m currently using it for my receding hair line and works good so far.</li>
            <li> Supposedly Propecia actually works but has many more side effects so you might not be a good candidate for that considering your specific genetics or family history.</li>
            <li> other thing that I&#x27;ve experienced with both the 5% and 2% solution is a feeling like liquid is sliding around just underneath my scalp.</li>
            <li> Experienced flaking and itching like the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> People won&#x27;t love you more because you have a full head of hair and having a bald spot should not cause anyone to love you less.</li>
            <li> The ticket to success with this is to apply twice daily faithfully and use a good quality shampoo (Nioxin 2).</li>
            <li> If this works, I think I will try the foam next time as I have seen great reviews about how it is much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Please don’t give up hope so quickly</li>
            <li> I do notice that my hair covers more of my scalp, but I still need a couple more months to get back to how it used to look.</li>
            <li> In the spring 1999, I started to apply 2% minoxidil in some bald areas in my temples, and it produced some mild regrowth of vellus hair.</li>
            <li> what i do is apply this during night as im just going to sleep and apply rogaine in the morning as it dries up quick</li>
            <li> But what works for some wont work for everybody, just hope you&#x27;re a lucky one like me.</li>
            <li> But then again, you might be lucky and grow some hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year, and am tremendously satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I been using it now for 1 month and 16 days, and I can tel and people can tell that I have more hair, the white spaces are getting darker, and the amount of hair is 30 to 40 more than what I had before</li>
            <li> Always be aware that because a box says don&#x27;t try it &amp;#34;here&amp;#34;, typically only means that they have gotten the approval after successfully testing it.</li>
            <li> At that time, I had mild receding hairline and some thinning in the  crown.</li>
            <li> I received the product as ordered, quickly.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it seems to be just as good or better quality than any other brand of 5 percent minoxidil, &amp; especially &#x27;cause it&#x27;s cheap:)</li>
            <li> Though how it works exactly is unknown, it seemed to be quite successful for regrowing hair.</li>
            <li> I started using Minoxidil last year when the &amp;#34;baboon&#x27;s butt&amp;#34; on the top of my head became more distinct and noticeable after a haircut.  </li>
            <li> still most would think its not a problem and that it looks good, but its not what it was in my early to mid twenties.</li>
            <li> decided to try this product because of how cheap it is first week noticed how greasy my hair was made feel gross.after a month</li>
            <li> Obviously is a long process and it doesn&#x27;t make miracles, but it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> At the outset, I&#x27;m 52 years old and have always had very fine</li>
            <li> Also, new users should note that the cheaper liquid formuation is much more cumbersome to apply than the foam...which would explain why it is cheaper...</li>
            <li> He has new hair coming in and is really pleased.  </li>
            <li> Getting very satisfactory results at a more reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s mildly sticky, like fresh hairspray.</li>
            <li> He tried being more careful with the product by making sure he washed his hands real well after each use and by making sure to apply it right and use it in plenty of time before bed</li>
            <li> My male friend really happy, the top of his head was shiny, but it disappeared &amp; now covered w/ fine dark hair (will probably thicken with time).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly he has noticed the hair loss has completely ceased and has noticed the beginning fuzz of new regrowth.  </li>
            <li> This generic product fits the bill at a nice price point, delivered quickly to our door.</li>
            <li> I just run a fine tooth comb through the hair and try and get out as much as I can.</li>
            <li> Best price, quick delivery, and as long as you follow the directions that come with it;  it will continue to fill in an area as long as you use it.</li>
            <li> Great Products, worked fine with me, using the same brand for over a year, you will not see any effect unit a year and after that you should start comparing, take a picture today and compere it next year</li>
            <li> i was using Rogaine and it was working amazingly , but the big difference in the price between Rogaine and Kirkland made me switch to Kirkland .</li>
            <li> It is much easier to measure an accurate dose</li>
            <li> I have no idea whether this is really slowing my hair loss, but it&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li> cheap, very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amazing things they can do in the medical field like cloning animals and organs</li>
            <li> It does appear that this supplier has a source of fresh Kirkland labelled Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would be worth it though, so I continued to use the product.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks I noticed considerable hair loss on my pillow, more so than before.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth it considering that Men&#x27;s Rogaine Foam-Rogaine Hair Regrowth Treatment, 6/2.11 oz.</li>
            <li> I still think for the price and the results, this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still think for the price and the results, this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So exciting.</li>
            <li> The effective agent of this product is the only accepted chemical that found as a coincidence.</li>
            <li> This product will help keep your hair follicles alive until you decide on a more permanent form of hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite brand thus far.</li>
            <li> Massaging should not be necessary, but it is a good way to get it everywhere without it dripping to much.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I noticed hair growth within one month and after two months I can say that the &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; is for the most part completely non existent.  </li>
            <li> 6 months worth arrives each time and you just put it in the medicine cabinet and forget about it...</li>
            <li> I also use Toppik, great hair day (around part and front), and tape extensions - total natural look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt this stuff works, but I&#x27;m switching to the foam for the time being since it appears to have made my scalp a bit more sensitive.</li>
            <li> i like to apply this to my back end to keep me warm in the winter</li>
            <li> Good product, but use it carefully.</li>
            <li> It is true that I observed some dandruff during the first weeks of use, but after ca.</li>
            <li> For the price if you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the try.</li>
            <li> Im sure it will clear up but will take time.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far, OK.  </li>
            <li> Although these types of products clearly indicate on the packaging that they are intended to help those with the circle bald patch on the top of the head and not for the receding hairline, he figured he would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Minoxidil isn&#x27;t a sprint, it&#x27;s a marathon and take it from someone who&#x27;s been running that marathon for 20 years, it&#x27;s ultimately worth it.  </li>
            <li> Minoxidil isn&#x27;t a sprint, it&#x27;s a marathon and take it from someone who&#x27;s been running that marathon for 20 years, it&#x27;s ultimately worth it.  </li>
            <li> but the trade off is worth it to me..</li>
            <li> needs time but really effective especially genetic bald . . . .  . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Now my diet has also changed (no coffee or smoking of any kind) which I believe is an even bigger factor.  </li>
            <li> Issues I found from the Rogaine foam were that when applying, most of the product would grease up your hair and have minimum contact directly on your scalp.</li>
            <li> but amazon.co.uk rarely has a seller for this</li>
            <li> Still averaging about $7.5 a month is worth it.</li>
            <li> My brother told me about this product and while I can&#x27;t say it has worked that well for him, I have had nothing but success.  </li>
            <li> It went in your hair and then magically absorbed.  </li>
            <li> now im stuck with 5 months worth.</li>
            <li> Honestly they are very similar, you might notice some lower quality in Monoxidil by Kirkland in terms of foaming-effect</li>
            <li> If  by the end of the six months I have any success with the product, I plan on returning and bumping the rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> Product definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> but since I had already purchased six months&#x27; worth, I figured I&#x27;d stick with it</li>
            <li> very much worth it</li>
            <li> Think the \\&quot;Ronco\\&quot; guy with the spray stuff that people make fun of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will note that when I started using a minoxidil like many other users, I did notice that some hair did fall out more so</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he was super offended at first.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of precious time and money !!</li>
            <li> A three month supply there costs slightly more than this six month supply did, and it&#x27;s exactly the same product, delivered free in four days.</li>
            <li> and they all work just as good as the other</li>
            <li> My hair in the front looks pretty good, but it in the back, not so much. . .</li>
            <li> This has stimmulated hair growth in my problem areas and I get good benifits from the other vitamins and minerals in my liquid multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t occur right when I put it on, but I&#x27;ll get itch attacks during the day.</li>
            <li> Price was right.</li>
            <li> course I started using this product right after</li>
            <li> Right before I turned 21, the thinning drastically accelerated.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start losing my hair right away, but if you stop using this product, it will fall out again.  </li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> Price was right and hair seems to be growing.  </li>
            <li> It was sent to me right on time and what I asked for..</li>
            <li> But I also hop on one foot (the right one) and do two claps and a spin each time.</li>
            <li> Priced right</li>
            <li> use it twice a day--once before I go to bed, and once in the morning, right after showering.</li>
            <li> right before I go to bed</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> Please refer to the right size of dermaroller and guideline before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For several months, every haircut I got revealed more and more new growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As usual, Kirkland offers best price, fastest shipping.</li>
            <li> I started on the original 2% solution back in the early 1990s and was VERY pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> AS Usual, on-time, great product</li>
            <li> I hear that it works all over regardless of how much you apply, hope this is true.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years now and it really has not regrown the hair in the crown area of my head as much as it has been a good hair thickner.</li>
            <li> should note that my hair loss was widespread across my whole scalp, and the warnings about the limitations of this product did not seem to hold true.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really seem to do more than stave off the hair loss, though to be fair my hair loss was due to medication I am taking rather than natural hair loss.</li>
            <li> I generally just apply drops to the top of my head and leave it at that).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy and i&#x27;ll by a same one for the next time</li>
            <li> So far I am completely satisfied after a whole year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> After spending a great deal of time reading medical literature and trying different hair regrowth products, I can confirm that this product does work on the hairline.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in the accompanying literature, the med is for the back of the scalp; but I&#x27;ve had some success at top and front...</li>
            <li> so they last longer on your scalp, and more of the minoxodil gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Equate brand that I used to buy but way less money</li>
            <li> In the summer 2008, I found out that cheap generic forms of Rogaine became available, and I switched to 5%Kirkland minoxidil.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve taken some DHT blocking vitamins as well and thus far my thinning on top is really regrowing hair.</li>
            <li> Will know more in a few more months.</li>
            <li> for effectiveness, I&#x27;ve seen a drastic slowdown in overall hair loss and have seen some tiny hairs regrow since I started using, even at the hairline (which is apparently uncommon).</li>
            <li> Same relatively good results as Rogaine so far</li>
            <li> so far good.... will update later...</li>
            <li> Put after a month and a half everything is looking good...</li>
            <li> and then if you produce the right enzymes which most people do, it grows back some hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Success with this product varies person to person, what is more important with this is to keep your hair follicles alive,  if you allow shedding or balding for several years the follicles will die.</li>
            <li> It is also very, very affordable.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me, the price was very reasonable, and it isn&#x27;t too gunky, I can apply it four times before I need to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and not only has it stopped hair loss but has grown back an incredible amount of new hair...</li>
            <li> I experienced some side effects such as redness, dry, itchy skin, and a rare side effect causing water retention in the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great improvements with this product but you&#x27;ll have to live with slightly greasy hair.</li>
            <li> about 6 months ago I decided to try the Kirkland brand topical solution because the difference in price was so huge (You can practically get a years supply for 3 months of Rogaine foam!).  </li>
            <li> Works really really really well!</li>
            <li> it was the first place I seen growth.  </li>
            <li> It itched my scalp quite a bit at first</li>
            <li> but in the first month or so it took a lot of will</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it does exactly what it claims, regrows hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair growth really accelerated!</li>
            <li> Just be consistent with it and don&#x27;t expect results overnight or even in a month.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to start out on this for the first time, take photographs of your hair from the front, back, sides and top</li>
            <li> You have to use it consistently and not stop for it to work.</li>
            <li> It is greasy though first going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apart from that your hair will fall more initially.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it so my review is based on the first maybe 2 months of using it after 3-4 months of lipogaine so the risk is yours.</li>
            <li> some reason the box says that this product will only work on the top of the head and not in the front.</li>
            <li> Glad I did as it actually works.  </li>
            <li> Tried many other hair lotions without any significant results.</li>
            <li> and I had to stop using it before I used even a quarter of the first bottle.</li>
            <li> First thing to do: Change your shower filter every six months.</li>
            <li> At exactly three months now, I can see ¼&amp;quot; to ½&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> I am sure if I stopped, the recession would continue, but I am so damn vain!ular daily use of Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> The stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say my mental ability to stay laser focused has increased</li>
            <li> Until I get a wife, I think I will keep using it, and then shock her as soon as I drop the Minoxidil after we get married.</li>
            <li> It make my face hot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on it for my first official month.</li>
            <li> This is pretty inexpensive, for me about $4 a month.  </li>
            <li> It seems the earlier you accept minoxidil treatment, the better the effect will be.</li>
            <li> It does make your scalp itch a bit the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is the same as the Rogaine but at a better price.  </li>
            <li> Rogaine does about the same and costs way more.</li>
            <li> Also, I am a female, with thinning all over the top of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> This enables me to avoid appearing as the most senior gorilla in the &amp;#34;band&amp;#34; (presumably the evolutionary reason for male pattern hair</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling this usually over priced product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The goal for me was to identified exactly what the root cause of my hair loss was, in order for me to know what measures I should take to stop my hair loss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ll continue to use these products until more drastic measures are necessary.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;4, never wash hair in hot water.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I had a virus or something.</li>
            <li> Now, some two months after stopping taking it my running is much better, but still not quite back to normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minoxidil at first</li>
            <li> Today is the first day I&#x27;m trying this product.</li>
            <li> However, the person using it must consistently use it according to directions and must be patient because it does require ample time for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont know why it worked the first time i tried a box of 3 month supply and reordered and used but</li>
            <li> I also like the dropper used to apply the topical solution a lot more.  </li>
            <li> and I actually like the application of it better.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this because I wasn&#x27;t aware that you have to use it forever or your hair could start thinning out again.</li>
            <li> and it feels more even with the amount of hair on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and is working!</li>
            <li> I first started using it when I was about 25 and started to notice hair loss.</li>
            <li> I think it looks better now than when I was younger with brown hair.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> BUT MOST OF ALL NO HAIR GROWING ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD  .  </li>
            <li> purchased this early January 2015 (because all products these days do vary and it&#x27;s important to know when a reviewer bought theirs).</li>
            <li> my results might have actually been better.  </li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is first rate.</li>
            <li> Delivered product was burning hot from the sun when delivered ...</li>
            <li> Okay let me just say that I am not using this for scalp hair growth, but instead to speed up my facial hair growth on the connector areas.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks, and I have to admit that mostly I use it only once per day.  </li>
            <li> I think that minoxidil is great as a sort of prevention, and at least in my case, it didn&#x27;t lose effectiveness over time.</li>
            <li> a higher concentration minoxidil product.</li>
            <li> People were actually noticing more hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I applied it on the top of my scalp front to back.</li>
            <li> but this product didn&#x27;t work there either.&lt;br /&gt;After losing more than 60-70% of my hair (50% if we want to be conservative) and not gaining anything (except some facial hairs)</li>
            <li> When my husband began to notice that the top of his hairline was starting to recede (think Bela Lugosi &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shape) he wanted to do something about it.  </li>
            <li> Turns out that many of us don&#x27;t carry the necessary genetics to convert minox into hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!  </li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t guess my actual age in fact.  </li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t guess my actual age in fact.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described, will do business with them again</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t confirm or deny that, but I can attest that this product did nothing for me at all after using it exactly as the instructions dictated for six month.  </li>
            <li> It might take a couple months to see results but more than likely you will end up seeing results.</li>
            <li> Hi I started using minoxidil when I first turned 18</li>
            <li> I actually use more than the 1 ml every use like it says because it doesn&#x27;t cover all the area&#x27;s</li>
            <li> sure enough it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten such a satisfying deal on minoxidil before.</li>
            <li> The liquid with eye dropper application allows to apply exactly where you want it without getting your hair stiff/sticky when it dries.</li>
            <li> I use this product and the targets generic version, and this brand seems to work a lot better.</li>
            <li> i actually lost more hair when i started using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I remember when it first came out in the stores and it was 100 $ a bottle .</li>
            <li> Used it for 3 months at first.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li> Just something to be aware of if you didn&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> It really works for me!</li>
            <li> Recommended, exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Thanks Kirkand!</li>
            <li> Many people have had legit results from it, but they&#x27;re consistent in using it twice daily.</li>
            <li> The first PR lion king.</li>
            <li> First of all it stinks.then  </li>
            <li> I try to contact to customer services for return no answer since the first week of march.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s April and no answer.</li>
            <li> and I found Minoxidil 5% being sold under many different labels.</li>
            <li> Still using it - you have to wait up to 6 month until you will receive first results.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this here, especially since it&#x27;s made by Costco and Costco hasn&#x27;t had it in stock for a while.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It works great, but it just to long to actually see the difference...</li>
            <li> when you first start losing it, you&#x27;ll lost a lot of hair for the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the equate version after my first order of the Kirkland version.</li>
            <li> My hair grows thicker and faster on the left side of my head (not a side effect:)</li>
            <li> I was advised to switch to the higher percentage.</li>
            <li> - You most definitely need to use this EVERY day TWICE a day for the REST OF YOUR LIFE.</li>
            <li> I first started using Rogaine(liquid then the newer foam)</li>
            <li> in 1998 when I first started noticing hair loss at the age of 20.</li>
            <li> then you start noticing it on the top back part of your head.</li>
            <li> I used the Rogaine on the front receding part when I first started noticing the hair</li>
            <li> This product was first discovered by accident</li>
            <li> and I would love to see actually proof that it works with a noticeable difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all a good product if you have trouble with itching try taking with biotin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any new growth yet, but I&#x27;m very pleased that it hasn&#x27;t itched me at all, as many reviewers have reported.  </li>
            <li> There was some mild itchy foot the first week at night but besides that no negative side affects.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m jumping for joy over this specific product, but it does seem to have a minor positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has given new life to a man who thought his days with a full head of hair were over.</li>
            <li> Young dudes need to get it as sons as possible for better results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE PATIENT, it might not seem like its doing anything for a while and it will make you shed more hair, but after you shed the hair it grows back stronger, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working the whole time, then I got my first haircut after 3 months, and it was definitely thicker than when I started.  </li>
            <li> I tried Kirkland Minoxidil 5% at first, because it seems to be the cheapest minoxidil product which also have a generally positive comments.</li>
            <li> Your significant other won&#x27;t really notice the difference, but you sure will.</li>
            <li> My hair-loss is due to stress, so it&#x27;s kind of chronic...</li>
            <li> (Okay, that&#x27;s a bit exaggerated, but it&#x27;s kind of true,</li>
            <li> but I feel that as it gets longer before I get my hair cut the foam will not dry as nicely in my hair and leave it a little crispy (cant think of a better word).  </li>
            <li> Minus one star for not adding some of the following in the instructions- that would make it a GREAT product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>
            <li> product is not messy... clean use...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky, you may have regrowth back on top with peach fuzz near your temples, but DON&#x27;T stop using it or your hair will rapidly fall after a month or so of discontinuation...</li>
            <li> The drowsiness is pretty intense for the first two or three weeks and then comes and goes in spurts after that.</li>
            <li> Quality is as good as the more expensive.</li>
            <li> I used several different good quality shampoos and prescription shampoos for months, but nothing made the itching stop.  </li>
            <li> Good but much more expensive than the one from Sams club</li>
            <li> It gives good result for me and especially for my friend who is in the initial stage of hair fall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for a new invention!!!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell since huge areas are losing hair and other areas are fine.  </li>
            <li> But again this stuff really works and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Got new hair, not very thick or strong, but the bold-spots went away.</li>
            <li> Some customers already shared their experience with this minoxidil that was not too positive.</li>
            <li> and I m already seeing some positive results.</li>
            <li> Hopefully results will be positive.</li>
            <li> This would be considered &amp;#34;minimal baldness&amp;#34; by most standards My hair loss took place over a period of about ten years or so gradually thinning until I could accurately say it was a &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; and not simply &amp;#34;thinning hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast, came as exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I will say lipogaine worked great after the early stages of weird face rash and more hair loss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind shaving and using Vaniqua, as long as I&#x27;m not bald on the top.  </li>
            <li> All my friends have lost most of their hair a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Not only have I experienced hair growth in the area near the back, but also regenerative growth in the frontal area as well.</li>
            <li> it filled in some bare spots.  </li>
            <li> they suck the most money out of ya as long as they can  </li>
            <li> Pretty much identical to rogaine but for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I on the other hand only needed it for the front and though i have seen some results they have not been as great as my friends.</li>
            <li> The hair that remained looked perfectly normal and it was augmented by very light colored short sort of downy hair that grew in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nearly four months and a short haircut later (I usually wear it long), I&#x27;m pleased to say that I&#x27;ve significantly regrown hair on the top of my head in addition to a good deal of hairline.  </li>
            <li> Monitor Your Blood work and make sure DHT doesn&#x27;t get too high which causes male baldness.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily regrow lost hair but rather helps hair from falling out easily.</li>
            <li> A day later...everything seemed back to normal, so I tried it one more time.  </li>
            <li> After 4-5 months, it take more time for me to dry my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> There was just more hair to dry.</li>
            <li> for the actual product itself; you&#x27;ll begin losing significantly more hair than normal immediately.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderately sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My hair was only about 10% normal on the top of my head when I started.</li>
            <li> Liquid Rogaine works better than the foam, specifically because the foam dries up &amp; once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> After 16 years of minoxidil use, all my scalp is already latently affected by DHT, and if I started to use some less effective stuff, I would lose all my hair at once.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I observe more dry scalp than before over the applied areas.</li>
            <li> Repeat several times until you figure you&#x27;ve gotten a full dosage&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> No dramatic hair loss or gain.</li>
            <li> I think that once you reach a certain age, you just don&#x27;t give a shitake mushroom anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly the seller has obtained a large shipment of &#x27;seconds&#x27; which they are pawning off on their customers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not at all certain that I was regrowing any hair.  </li>
            <li> cause I hear it has pure concentration of minoxidil.</li>
            <li> but it certainly does not work for me.</li>
            <li> certainly wish this had been emphasized before I bought it for my husband.</li>
            <li> think it helps to certain extent with reduce hair fall and some regrowth of hair</li>
            <li> Buying a new 6 month box today, cant wait to see results again!!</li>
            <li> After 2-3 months of use, I had more hair that I started to notice the strands of gray which had blended into the scalp started to contrast against the new short mat.</li>
            <li> I loose more ??</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really grow new hair as promise hence the 4 stars but still a very happy customer and for a mere $45 bucks a yr</li>
            <li> There is no noticeable smell, no greasiness, and my hair looks fine when short or medium length.  </li>
            <li> Everything is fine, and I will likely order again.</li>
            <li> B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] and my hair loss stopped completely, and it is now growing back VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> The fine print tells you about 15 reasons why someone can&#x27;t use it and only provides one reason you can.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not only is this more cost effective, I felt the results were better, simply because this is directly applied to the scalp, whereas I was never sure if the foam was ever penetrating my existing hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazing to see little hairs coming in at the hairline.e a day with a cotton swab and wipe the thinning areas which for my are hairline</li>
            <li> Amazing to see little hairs coming in at the hairline.</li>
            <li> the good thing about this product is that it is cheaper than other products, and as I read through its description it has pretty much similar ingredients as Rogain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Saw many fine hairs, but this is a lifelong process and didn&#x27;t see enough results after 6 months to continue.</li>
            <li> The biotin is all natural so that made me a little more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I started taking it with [[ASIN:B00XJ3GPJA Finoxidrin - Powerful Hair Nutrient Supplement]] and my hair loss stopped completely, and the growth really seems to have accelerated quite rapidly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not trying to use too much, drying time is reasonable (on shorter, damp hair, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair&#x27;s ready to groom within an hour of applying this), and I haven&#x27;t noticed the greasy feeling others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> It gives you hope if not mostly false hope that you are trying to stop it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much hair growth, my books pressure went up, I&#x27;m done w it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I saw growth and now that I do am ready to give my review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Can you really &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; this?</li>
            <li> and we haven&#x27;t really seen any changes</li>
            <li> I really dislike using the dropper.</li>
            <li> I really prefer the foam Rogaine product, much easier to use and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced (unlike Propecia)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> what aging can do is that after you get some age, you don&#x27;t really care too much about how your hair  look.</li>
            <li> People know very well that you are not in your 30s anymore HAHA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Adding the mynoxidrin really seemed to thicken my hair and make it healthier also.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair VERY greasy.</li>
            <li> And even after washing it still stays very greasy.</li>
            <li> I really regret not doing that.</li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive and works just as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> Something gentle.</li>
            <li> highly reccomended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it really works.</li>
            <li> If it bother you that much, buy the foam.</li>
            <li> as in lightly rubbing my hair back and forth and 10 times over a magazine i counted over 150 hairs..</li>
            <li> thanks for your expire product .</li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper way to use it than buying the name brand.</li>
            <li> hairs growing on my Vertex (nothing in front, as Kirkland readily says).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this for 6 months and see how much growth I can achieve.</li>
            <li> cans (6 Month Supply) costs twice as much for six months.</li>
            <li> Minoxidil works really.</li>
            <li> However the side effect is that it is very itchy</li>
            <li> But to much suprise it worked...</li>
            <li> This year it got to a point where it started getting really noticeable when I would look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought a 3 month supply of Kirkland Minoxidil 5% thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try since the price was reasonable compared to Rogaine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and it has really helped.</li>
            <li> But this stuffs much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, It seems like I have twice as much hair as I did before.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this means that I&#x27;m using too much or what, but even when I don&#x27;t experience itching</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has been using it for years (prefers the dropper, not the dabbing sponge) and his hair stylist is amazed he has so much hair at his age.</li>
            <li> once i got off rogaine surely it started thinning out more, but so slow that goin bald would probably take a few more years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3 months later, and all the spots are filled with hair.</li>
            <li> but im spending much much</li>
            <li> After six months, I noticed my hair was not falling out as fast.</li>
            <li> The addition of Finoxidrin also made my hair look MUCH healthier.</li>
            <li> I overplucked my brows for years and decided I wanted to grow them out again, but wasn&#x27;t having much luck despite taking hair vitamins and hiding my tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a real value.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.</li>
            <li> It take a couple of months to really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> a favor and go to Costco much cheaper</li>
            <li> very greasy formula.</li>
            <li> not broken bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It thickens them no matter how much you have over plucked if you have no scar tissue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for approximately 6 months and have seen a great improvement.</li>
            <li> I could get some compensation on this, or at least get my money back, but I most likely to win the lottery that get any satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;next</li>
            <li> my much hail.&lt;br /&gt;good goods.&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li> I should state that my hair loss is over a patch about 4 inches in diameter across the very crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> Well, I embellish a bit - but not by much.</li>
            <li> And really it fix the problem, my hair loss stop.</li>
            <li> I have male pattern baldness but to a light extent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that you really need to use it for about three months before you expect to see results.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> I have headaches if I use too much.</li>
            <li> fast shipping..love it..</li>
            <li> but nothing i could really put my finger on.</li>
            <li> This thing really works.</li>
            <li> so i went with the cheap stuff since i figured its the same hormone.</li>
            <li> th erpoduct arrived on time and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and it REALLY works</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this treatment after 2 months because it made my scalp very itchy.  </li>
            <li> Who really knows, I started using this years ago</li>
            <li> Really helped me a lot</li>
            <li> it might be time to go ahead and accept my fate with a straight razor</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> After a couple of years I stopped using it - don&#x27;t really know why.</li>
            <li> Buy it guys, a whole 6 month supply.</li>
            <li> It might be months before you notice any real difference.</li>
            <li> But much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Using these two products really help to regrow my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;You can find Alpecin here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OSNBX2/ref&#x3D;oh_o00_s00_i00_details</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPOINTED  ,</li>
            <li> This was very</li>
            <li> Kirkland doesnt seem to be as watery and prone to running all over the place as Equate, but when it dries&lt;br /&gt;I notice alot of flakiness on the scalp, this is really undesirable.</li>
            <li> After I quitted it, I started to shed very rapidly</li>
            <li> The item was shipped fast and product was how it was described.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much weight it bears</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t tell a difference in a before/after sense.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to put too much on and it keeps you from spilling it all over.</li>
            <li> 100% recomended thanks</li>
            <li> But my hair is much thicker now.</li>
            <li> The foam, which Rogaine has, is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> This product really works, you just have to be pacient.</li>
            <li> but then as they say who wants fat hair.  </li>
            <li> The liquid is very greasy when applied to your head.</li>
            <li> Once it dries some gently brush or comb your hair.  </li>
            <li> Once it dries some gently brush or comb your hair.  </li>
            <li> this really works for me..</li>
            <li> so I would say to someone start this before you really need it..</li>
            <li> but then it grew straight?</li>
            <li> I Really don&#x27;t like this minoxidil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working, but this item generates scurf and it&#x27;s very embarasing.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I must be the unusual person this product did nothing for?  </li>
            <li> The problem is that I am not sure,if it really helps.</li>
            <li> I think it really works.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> When I got the package, one (or more) of the bottles had leaked and the Kirkland box was wet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find the liquid with the dropper instead of the foam, which is more costly and doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> Much prefer the liquid vs. the foam.</li>
            <li> absolutely unbearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the price and everything is as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Itches too much.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s an OTC product, however, the price has become extremely reasonable, so I thought I&#x27;d give it</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on those, but the Kirkland one really does do well.  </li>
            <li> now that the price has gotten so reasonable, why not give it a shot?  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this and really likes it.</li>
            <li> This is the product that really works.</li>
            <li> the product went very well</li>
            <li> maybe thats why it didnt really work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this much hair since I was 15.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this I get to keep my existing hair which is alright with me.</li>
            <li> thanks  amazon</li>
            <li> Also leave the product in for 4 hours before sweating intensely or showering.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any change.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the same product available here.</li>
            <li> and well it has helped to avoid the hair to fall as fast as it was falling.</li>
            <li> Kirkland 5 does not have a seal, but this thing really works.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from Las Vegas World Brand Famous Center.</li>
            <li> Wish the Government would make sure these claims are true; not sure it really works</li>
            <li> I could legally market tap water and say it &amp;#34;May&amp;#34; make you smarter</li>
            <li> Minoxidil tries to make your body circulate more blood to your scalp where your follicles will grow.  </li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> /&gt;•Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and</li>
            <li> It works and it really  grows hair .the</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced product, sent promptly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> (if you do some research online, you&#x27;ll see that for some guys it takes a whole year).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference with either country of origin.</li>
            <li> I really work it in.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I really care anymore.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Really greasy, no way to apply it then go out, you&#x27;d look like a dang greaser.</li>
            <li> The thing that i dont really like is now to keep the hair I have to use it forever, but I guess it&#x27;s like brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I started feeling really tired/</li>
            <li> The normal pattern of hair loss is the receding part in front which you notice first</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a product that does work covering up the hair loss/balding spot temporarily if it isn&#x27;t too much scalp showing.</li>
            <li> I used various minoxidil products for couple years and this one is by far the most damaging.</li>
            <li> Since then I believe that baldness is accepted for the most part and does carry the same stigma it did before the early 1990s.</li>
            <li> use it to stop loss of hair from the top of my head near the back.</li>
            <li> It measures exactly, where as with the foam it says to use a cap full but that never seems like enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old and am experiencing some thinning in the temple areas as well as the middle of the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Also tried the much more expensive Lipogaine, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> On its own minoxidil cannot restore your hair if you have these patchy spots especially on the side or back of your head.</li>
            <li> and I know it takes at least 2 months to make a fair assessment on whether it works or not.  </li>
            <li> Will do more business with these guys in the near future.</li>
            <li> i was dating an 18 yr old college student!!!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s choice, and if your hair is important to you, this product works better than any other topical product.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that you won&#x27;t notice much at first because it takes time to grow new hair.  </li>
            <li> I follow the recommended usage and it seems to work as good as other similar products in reducing the loss of hair, but not regrowing it...</li>
            <li> however my scalp became super itchy, flakey and apparently this was tearing up my scalp like acid...</li>
            <li> Im sure it will be more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I only bought one bottle of carexidil, which was very easy to use, and when i used it up i switched to this one, hoping it would be something similar.</li>
            <li> I know many other have</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have notice more hair on the tub than before after application of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> My hair is significantly thinner now, especially on the crown.</li>
            <li> This is the generic formula of the original liquid Rogaine.</li>
            <li> better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> The application can be a little challenging and time consuming as it comes in a liquid dropper form compared to others like shampoos or pills, but there are results to be hand with the product if you&#x27;re willing to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The side effects of this particular product were too much for me though.</li>
            <li> Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Extra Strength Hair Regrowth Treatment is for men who have a general thinning of hair on top of the scalp.  </li>
            <li> but seriously it wasn&#x27;t a good feeling.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, high quality product.</li>
            <li> you really really want the product, just be aware of the side affects, because they really weren&#x27;t worth it for me and it took me too long to realize what they were caused by.  </li>
            <li> used a special shampoo on several visits to get rid of the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, hair grows only about half an inch per month, so I think 3 months is a good waiting period to give yourself before you see results.  </li>
            <li> Everything I would have expected in a competing product that is much more expensive - great job</li>
            <li> As long as this is available, I&#x27;ll continue with it.</li>
            <li> but to be honest i&#x27;ve seen faster results to the front, from the widows peak on the sides and front to just past that part of the hair line.</li>
            <li> My hair loss is in the middle of my scalp and this regrew hair despite claims it only works on the vertex as i apply to my whole scalp on top all the way to the front.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old with first signs of Androgenic Alopecia.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how fast I would normally be losing hair.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to be applying because I know they say only use 1 ml, but since I have diffuse thinning all over, I feel like I need to apply it in back as well.</li>
            <li> It should be at least 5% because branded names such as Rogaine has same percentage and alot of people are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks, it&#x27;s obviously too early for me to expect any results, but I&#x27;m favorably pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> By beard (full) is finally starting to sprout out from having stuble for 35 years.</li>
            <li> My hair looked better when it was applied compared to this, and it didn&#x27;t drip down my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much scent free... maybe a slight smell, but I can&#x27;t smell it on myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using tretinoin 0.001% gel on my scalp after taking showers and that has surprisingly helped the regrowth process a little bit.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped me a new case, so I appreciated that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of new growth, but the hair that&#x27;s still there appears thicker and darker which is an improvement.</li>
            <li> Oddly, the hair doesn&#x27;t appear identical to that it replaced as it is thinner and more curly.</li>
            <li> Anyway I am going to use less of it and try to apply more evenly.</li>
            <li> then half of the drugstore price:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than rogaine, and the reviews were about the same or better, which why we decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> My main problem is in the front</li>
            <li> Since enough people have told me that the mild bald spot at the top-back of my head has receded, including my barber, I&#x27;ll say it works.</li>
            <li> Used this product with success for 6 months then my scalp starting to get very irritated</li>
            <li> If we come to the main point, I have been using this product for three months and 10 days.</li>
            <li> After three months of use still lost hair at a steady rate.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the hair that is growing back looks more like Barbie hair but curly.</li>
            <li> It took over three months before I felt as though I&#x27;d grown most of the hair I&#x27;d lost during the initial shedding back.</li>
            <li> Better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> if i remember ill update this review again to see if it gets even better, but in 3 months it did more than 5 years on rogaine.</li>
            <li> SDS free shampoos are difficult to find and I currently make my own, which chemically is more similar to soap than shampoo (corn oil, lye, glycerol, ethanol and sugar).</li>
            <li> The foam works well enough like a mousse, but it dissolves quickly so work</li>
            <li> I bought this for a relative and he said it works better than rogaine, he has continued buying it and his bald spot has definitely improved.</li>
            <li> The regrowth has been gradual but it has been steady.</li>
            <li> I have not yet to see results because it has only been 3 weeks, but overall the price of the product is insanely cheap!</li>
            <li> 27 year old male, fit</li>
            <li> For now, I expect it to do a decent job regrowing some hair in me receding hairline.</li>
            <li> Of course I didn&#x27;t get all my hair back, say 100%, but interestingly enough I got more hair even on areas of my head where this product is not supposed to work on.</li>
            <li> Decent product</li>
            <li> course, I&#x27;m mainly comparing the oil to the foam.  </li>
            <li> Without it, my mostly straight hairline starts getting real widow peaky.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and my facial hair is growing from zero to a super beard.</li>
            <li> This particular product made my face swell up and burn like fire.  </li>
            <li> The hair growth is steady.  </li>
            <li> It seems to stop further hair loss, and to somewhat fill back the top and towards the front of the head.  </li>
            <li> You have to have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> This is the best Minoxidil I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;I have used PiloGro &amp;TuGain in the past but never satisfied with the result</li>
            <li> there caught up in the shuffle of life but have had steady progress.  </li>
            <li> and my barber says that I have decent regrowth and \\&quot;mirrored it\\&quot; for me to see.</li>
            <li> This has the same active ingredient as high dollar hair growth items do and is definitely worth the cheap price!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for falling and thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its working high time.</li>
            <li> But Kirkland worked high time, it starts with a symptom of increased hair loss after usage for a month or so and then the hair began to grow again...</li>
            <li> If you have that condition I highly recommend going for cortisone shots and use prescription cortisone cream with this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although it is not recommended for people of my age and there is little data on the effects for older men, I found this product to both stop hair loss and add more thickness to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that if you use it religiously it can really dry out your scalp and make it itchy, hence the use of a good</li>
            <li> After it has dried it is more or less ok though.</li>
            <li> Kirkland seems to carry a very wide variety of products and Minoxidil is one of the products I find to be both economical and useful.</li>
            <li> 6 months ago I could see through the hair on the top of my head a little bit.</li>
            <li> I am completely unsatisfied !!</li>
            <li> The equate version is a little thicker and much more oily upon application; I am assuming from the PPG to Alcohol mixture.</li>
            <li> Yes your paying for a name, but sometimes those names hold a little more water then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing my use of the minoxidil as it seems my hair can retain a little more of its thickness in the front where it has been receding.</li>
            <li> Also I have noticed I get a lil more edgier after and somehow elevates heart rate a little</li>
            <li> Also I have noticed I get a lil more edgier after and somehow elevates heart rate a little</li>
            <li> , the shipping took nearly 2 months although ETA was 6 days with Expedited Shipping!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> As a women with little hair on top of my head</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, because my hairline looks a little better.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the foam, but this is relatively easy to apply, and costs about half as much as the foam version.</li>
            <li> Make sure the liquid goes directly on the scalp and use finger tips (not your nails) to gently rub into the scalp for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have a perfectly lush head of hair now, but it really helped fill in the crown, and even improved the front hairline.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 years and finally decided that all the sticky messiness just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> give it 2 stars only because of the price and the fact that it goes on clear unlike lipogaine which is yellow and stands out more</li>
            <li> I grew hair in spots where I normally was not growing it.</li>
            <li> Then at the end of the day, about an hour before I go to bed, I apply one more round of foam and massage it in.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll give a few more months</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I am starting to think that the rogaine may be worth the money.</li>
            <li> No noticeable hair change (even it seems like normal hair loss has continued) over the 6 months or year since i bought this.  </li>
            <li> have had no negative experience from either of the products.  </li>
            <li> For others, it creates a bloom of peach fuzz that turns into normal hair.  </li>
            <li> it was a completely waste of money, I would get better results from putting piss on my head</li>
            <li> I think that it is always better to combine 5% minoxidil with some DHT-blocker, rather than risking theRussian roulette with 10-15% minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I routinely order Kirkland minoxidil from their internet website, but recently, I was surprised that CostCo changed the manufacturer (for PERRIGO in Israel) and the bottles look differently.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra cost over the liquid stuff.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than going to the normal grocery or drug store.</li>
            <li> The only solution I found to be completely useful</li>
            <li> Minoxidil has one side affect that is not widely acknowledgedwritten about, it causes hair loss at the end of the first month of use, quite a bit of hair loss.</li>
            <li> and she cut it shorter than normal</li>
            <li> I will be updating this review in a few more months.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> that it began to affect my normal life.  </li>
            <li> Have used the 2% for years, and although I feel it helped me not lose as much hair, due to heredity factors, since switching to this 5% formula, i&#x27;m actually seeing a lot more new growth!</li>
            <li> though im only half way through the 6 months, i ordered another 6 just to stock up since im pretty confident in this stuff</li>
            <li> No issues except for occasionally itching red scalp, which is an easy fix with argon or chamomile oils.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s been so easy I&#x27;m actually finding myself looking forward to the next application.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I brush my hair left and right, while avoid touching my scalp at all, then brush it toward the front, the point from doing that is to spread the product around with my dry hair</li>
            <li> There seems to be many other companies that sell the same products, but I found Kirkland to be very reliable and their products to be of premium quality.</li>
            <li> Drawbacks are you have to user it for life and dandruff can become a problem but nothing that the right shampoo can&#x27;t solve with occasional use.</li>
            <li> I did what I could to keep eating right, keep my stress low, exercise, drink alot of water, vitamins, flax seed oil etc as always helped my training and nourishes</li>
            <li> But it grows right back</li>
            <li> but hey why not if it works the same right.</li>
            <li> In addition to exciting my wife (who&#x27;s likely fantasizing about Connery or Willis), it&#x27;s easier, less work/expense, and I look/feel cool!</li>
            <li> I was able to see some very slight new hair growth after about two months.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, by the end of the day my scalp gets pretty obvious and I decided a few weeks ago that I&#x27;d try to stop losing more before it got too</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but a little too early to tell if it really promotes detectable hair growth.</li>
            <li> but my doctor said you want to live or you want hair?  </li>
            <li> Its stopped my hair from falling out and is showing some new growth.  </li>
            <li> Neither it stopped hair fall nor does it regrow new hair.</li>
            <li> However, I do not see any new growth since around three to four months.</li>
            <li> However, I do not see any new growth since around three to four months.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product before I&#x27;d grown much new hair</li>
            <li> For me it makes my existing hair thicker and fuller, for others it may reactive new follicles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Do not want to live without the Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After stopping for a month I am gradually losing my new hair again but the itching is gone.</li>
            <li> Helps you to grow new hair and keep what you have.</li>
            <li> Um... I know what matters is inside the box, but this is new?</li>
            <li> Got new fade and edge up</li>
            <li> It may take a while before you see new growth.</li>
            <li> and I have see new hair follicles.</li>
            <li> He has seen new growth already.  </li>
            <li> A new hair is immediately begun, though.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s new growth is finer and lighter than the rest.</li>
            <li> and I think the hair loss is lower, but atenci&amp;oacute;n this time I havent seen new grow</li>
            <li> seeing new hair growth already.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve grown some new hair in my vertex area.  </li>
            <li> new hari is growing.  </li>
            <li> I cant tell if it growing new hair</li>
            <li> people double down ,which is good, i do just the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kind of hard to part your hair and apply directly to the roots</li>
            <li> While I have not yet noticed any significant amount of hair regrowth which is expected since it is too soon to tell, at this point I think the most significant benefit is the price which is less than half the cost of any competeing product.  </li>
            <li> Now Ive been experiencing mild hairloss since I was about 27 years old, first noticed it at the front of my hairline and also had a callic making it look like a slight bald spot on back right of my head</li>
            <li> and it did work good ,but late last year 2012  </li>
            <li> I guess the true results will only become apparent after couple of months.</li>
            <li> the first month, I actually lost hair at a faster rate than normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product way better than the foam formulas that are saturating (pun intended) the market currently, making his preference harder to find.</li>
            <li> I do not like blanket because it is way too big to fit a double bed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, just do things right the first time!</li>
            <li> , I lost so much of my hair due to so much of itching and dandrufff in the first 3 days of its use.</li>
            <li> Although the new hair right now is still thin, but I think it will become better in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the product very conscious that it was not going to work miracles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised at this product&#x27;s 4 star rating.  </li>
            <li> The package was delivered very fast on the standard delivery option.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a noobie, this is the first hair treatment I buy and the seller did not put enough information.  </li>
            <li> (So far I&#x27;m not eligible to audition for a part in a &amp;#34;planet of the apes&amp;#34; sequel&amp;#34;!)  </li>
            <li> first time I applied it it caused a redness in the area of application that turned to peeling my skin later.  </li>
            <li> I remember this product was first released onto the market at a time when baldness was a really big issue for men.  </li>
            <li> Costco has this same exact products for $47.99 can you beat that?</li>
            <li> hair just went back to how it looked before my first order wish it kept working .</li>
            <li> I like to keep my hair pretty short</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not vain enough to have to be a slave to this chemical, so I ever even finished using the first bottle.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same whether you use this product or Rogaine--they are equivalent.</li>
            <li> For the first six months, I wasn&#x27;t following the instructions strictly, but I want to try it again.</li>
            <li> Im still consistently doing the 1ml eye dropper of minoxidil twice daily.</li>
            <li> Im still consistently doing the 1ml eye dropper of minoxidil twice daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased the one with the higher review, but was sent the lesser one.</li>
            <li> , I used in the front and in the back of the top of my head, only cons I can tell is that it leaves a white dust on you head, and that it runs to your face when you sweat</li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time and couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair this morning.  </li>
            <li> Since Costco no longer sells the liquid only the foam and a much higher mark up .  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t make an extra effort to massage it across my scalp (and along my widow&#x27;s peaks even though manufacturers state outright that results there are unlikely), it literally wouldn&#x27;t take more than a minute to get it done;  it seldom takes more than that even with the neurotic massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my scalp did itch at first, but I started using selsun blue and it stopped.</li>
            <li> In the first 2 months I did lose hair and I was going through alopecia at the same time.</li>
            <li> exact same thing as Rogaine, at a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> I usually burn for sure if I forget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going down fighting, and this is a huge lift to my ego.</li>
            <li> The eyedropper application is just as easy as the foam, however this solution leaves a wierd dry white residue that looks like you have stuff stuck in your hair.</li>
            <li> Because most minoxidil product is said not very helpful with frontal and temple hair loss, so I didn&#x27;t have too much expectation on it, and it is also the reason why I didn&#x27;t buy the more expensive</li>
            <li> You could clearly see my scalp through my thin hair on top, especially under direct light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using this in conjunction with a set of hair clippers, and keeping the sides and back pretty short and the top slightly shorter than the front.</li>
            <li> As far as hair regrowth, I&#x27;m not sure if either products really work super well, but I seem to not be losing as much hair when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll pretty much have to comb your hair carefully and avoid all contact with the scalp, unless you want to walk around looking like you were in a snow storm.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND getting a rich multi vitamin with 300mcg&#x27;s of Vitamins and other vital minerals for your over all health.</li>
            <li> Such information is vital for the customer so that he can purchase exactly what can work for him.</li>
            <li> At fist I told myself that its worth a thick, full head of hair</li>
            <li> Stays on the top of your head without dripping down to your forehead for just enough time to rub the product into your scalp.</li>
            <li> I would recommend mixing this with a carrier oil such as emu seems to penetrate a bit better and keeps down the inflammation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it has any positive effect on preventing hair loss because i could not use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Only positive results.</li>
            <li> Seems exactly the same as the store brand and much cheaper than the same store brand.</li>
            <li> Product I received was missing dropper applicators, but more importantly liquid caused unbelievable itch and skin irritation on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Some hair loss is caused by genetics (more than half of all cases), and in this case, you’ll need to try products like this Minoxidil, or go even further and get plugs.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the only difference--why pay more for less?</li>
            <li> I have been using the Kirkland Minoxidil since I found out that it was the same thing as Rogaine, more or less anyway.</li>
            <li> and I definitely have more hair and experience less shedding.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely thinning and you can see my scalp if you look down directly from the top.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product back in the summer on the front of my hairline and it grew back tremendously.</li>
            <li> The one thing I will say is that for anyone who has only a little bit of hair loss, this 5% solution is pretty intense and probably not the right choice.</li>
            <li> After using about one month, I have noticed that the frontal and my left temple part have a lot of new hair grow again, the effect is slow on right temple part, where the hair loss is most persistent, but still, I can see tiny new hair.</li>
            <li> The liquid towards a yellow, orangey color after a certain time period.</li>
            <li> While it may not regrow hair for all, if most probably will slow down the loss of hair for most At least on the vertex, top, of the head, the only location for which it is advertised to work.</li>
            <li> Huge waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I am no longer losing my hair, that is clear.</li>
            <li> I am no longer losing my hair, that is clear.</li>
            <li> After 4 months I can see clearly that it works and it works well.</li>
            <li> When I stop using it, I can clearly see my hairs falling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nearly 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I just recently started to notice how much this product was working for me after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Had been told that all my hair would fall out again if I stopped using it, but so far, this has not happened.</li>
            <li> is getting easier  with Amazon, and their business associates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can access low price, and reasonable service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you are just in your 30s, and you are so conscious about it, like I was...</li>
            <li> My hair was greasy and oily near my scalp from the application.</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t definitively say it is working for me.</li>
            <li> I only needed to apply on my hairline so the &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; from the product was really noticeable from the</li>
            <li> The price for these is unbeatable, as far as I can see,&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am 22 years old and started using this about a year ago to try to take on genetics.  </li>
            <li> It is MUCH easier to deal with in short hair.  </li>
            <li> the only detractors are the whole \\&quot;will regrow</li>
            <li> so it is too early to tell what effect it will have on hair growth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as far as I&#x27;m concerned it does the job.</li>
            <li> Too early to see results.</li>
            <li> Which happened to me after becoming lazy.</li>
            <li> The one and only hair product that really works.</li>
            <li> Yes, so far?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 month already and so far no changes whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have tried Rogaine and CVS so far</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see back/up there, but it must be filling in back there too.  </li>
            <li> The only way I&#x27;d really know is if I stop using it.</li>
            <li> This has prevent my from going bald as far as I know.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re hair loss early on...</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend you avoid this product, but if not, then it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it if you suffer from hair loss.</li>
            <li> The rash went away with discontinuation of the medication, restarted with re-challenge of the medication, and has not returned since stopping the medication completely and resuming brand name Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> Kirkland minoxidil drops irritated my scalp after about 6 months &amp; developed some scaling with itching.  </li>
            <li> It is the same thing as romaine at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> After using this for about 3 months my wife and I both noticed marked improvement in the thickness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it says you may see improvement as early as two months</li>
            <li> Fast forward 4 months later and my hair has grown all over the place!</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day as this is men&#x27;s rogaine but the results have been so fast.</li>
            <li> The problem is, that I stopped using it for about 6 months early this year.</li>
            <li> He claims it really works and that is hair has grown back and thickened in the area that he is using it.</li>
            <li> This is my second purschase, does the job very well,</li>
            <li> Im still using the product, i have to wait at least three more months to see results</li>
            <li> I use it every morning on my scalp and also use it by spraying 2 pumps on an old toothbrush and going over my brows.  </li>
            <li> SO far no negatives.  </li>
            <li> It has been about three months so far</li>
            <li> If I had known this, I would have not wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 39 year old male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 60-year old woman with a receding hairline.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a direct application approach</li>
            <li> Keeping the old pate with something where nothing would otherwise be.</li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness I havent noticed any difference between the two products and think they both work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took 2 weeks of non use for the itching and swelling to completely go away.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, know that at the least, it&#x27;s probably keeping you from losing even more</li>
            <li> Of course, keep an eye on it and if you start to see too much hair in the shower drain then go back to twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since December 27 and so far it makes my existing hair thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> I have at least 2 times more hair on my head now.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18 year old son on the recommendation of his dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does leave the hair looking a bit as if you&#x27;d put gel in it, but only if I use too much.</li>
            <li> Im 43 at time of this review, I have what would be the early stages of hairloss</li>
            <li> I will say that it does work with continued use but it can be drying if your skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness, I havent noticed any difference between the two.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and nothing has happened so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using that for while , and it really made a big deferent .</li>
            <li> It interfered with daily life too much.</li>
            <li> There is no any cons so far.</li>
            <li> reference, I am in my early twenties, and had a receding hairline of about 3-4 inches.</li>
            <li> No knock on either of them, but I&#x27;m vain and didn&#x27;t want to look old before my time.  </li>
            <li> The early kits had a sprayer, but the problem was it would get on your hair rather than your scalp.  </li>
            <li> that was a one big mistake, started losing hair like there was no tomorrow, so I stopped using either of these products for about 2 years, and my hair loss became very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still too early to tell if it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for nearly 2 months now.</li>
            <li> but so far, no hair loss.</li>
            <li> As far as i can tell this product does not do anything.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and come from a family of men with receding hairlines.  </li>
            <li> Vanity and old F-rt hair loss made me try this.</li>
            <li> hair loss didn&#x27;t seem to completely stop, but it mate well have slowed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this 5% solution for around 1.5 months so far.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this to avoid being bald so early.</li>
            <li> A bit early to give it a 100%,</li>
            <li> Wait it out, it does grow back and the sparse areas really do fill in.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised</li>
            <li> At first I purchased a 3 months supply from a Big Box retailer that was first made in Canada, the next 3 months supply from the Big Box retailer was made in Israel.</li>
            <li> Liquid last much longer than one month.</li>
            <li> and it brought much of my hair back all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a sensitive matter</li>
            <li> like I was about to pass out so frequently, after a month of use,</li>
            <li> If you have really heavy hair loss this might not do much but is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Yeah I haven&#x27;t really gotten much worse, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any better either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same as the costco package, but a few dollars more.  </li>
            <li> This product is quickly and easy to use...similar to other package I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> just not enough right under my hairline to &amp;#34;push back the tide&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I use this product because it offers the same results as the more expensive original brands.</li>
            <li> It says not to use for ta widows peak, but that is where i am mostly using it and it already appears to have some small hairs growing out!</li>
            <li> I even started to use a little brush to apply it with, but it didn&#x27;t make a significant difference and takes a lot of time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You need to wash the scalp firstly, don&#x27;t use a hair conditioner, and let the scalp dry thoroughly for maximum absorption of the medication.</li>
            <li> I only used it for a couple weeks before switching back to the brand name Rogaine, which may be more expensive, but to me the higher price was worth it in this case.</li>
            <li> The add is not clearing it&#x27;s ONLY FOR VERTEX, after I have applied this to thinning hair area on my head,  specially on the vertex, some white staff, similar to dandruff</li>
            <li> Side effects include dry scalp and mild irritation especially with over application.</li>
            <li> No mess</li>
            <li> delaying nature is worth putting your body under extreme strain during exercise then have at it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;•Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;•Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> I was noticeably thin on top, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad if I kept the sides and back short and textured (having a good hair stylist is important!)</li>
            <li> After the second and half month, I decided to shave my head from about 5 inches on top and 3 inches on the sides / back, to a no. 5 with clippers</li>
            <li> I switched back to Kirkland 6 month supply and the hair has returned and holding steady.</li>
            <li> I resisted for a while, but finally gave in to the fact that I was getting older and that I was at a point where I was gaining weight and losing hair.  </li>
            <li> You know thw results not typical thing and all that jazz.</li>
            <li> (this is where the results not typical thing kicks in)</li>
            <li> I have been using an alternating method of Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue daily since the first use because of reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I no longer lose hair at all as long as I use this product every day, which is why I like the large amount I get in this order.</li>
            <li> When people tell you more and more that you are losing your hair as it progresses though(probably because they are insecure or ignorant which you really have to try hard to not let bother</li>
            <li> If you work where you sweat a lot you may want to consider other options because when sweat on your head then you are basically sweating the product right off and it can&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since generics of Rogaine are proven to the FDA to be the same functional molecule,  this product is the cheapest per unit volume of minoxidil that you can find, so I would highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> Started seeing results and new hairs after 6-8 weeks, after about 4-5 months i saw my full results and continued using up to 12 months, my hairline was brought forward about an inch and a half!!</li>
            <li> This item works very well, as it has provided the intended results, as long as the directions are followed.</li>
            <li> I  followed the instructions to the T. It (and as I hoped) covered up much of my dye resistant grey brittle hair for the day.</li>
            <li> Same problem as normal rogaine: lots of flaking with drying.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I expected from this product.  </li>
            <li> I immediately stopped taking the product, and after 3 days it went back to normal.</li>
            <li> I read review that it is normal and hair will start to grow back after having use it for a while.</li>
            <li> scalp does get itchier than normal now, but you get used to it, and it can be mitigated with shampoos like Selsun Blue.</li>
            <li> I finally made the connection and stopped using it in the evening and my sleep pattern returned to normal after a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for receding hairline and even before the first bottle is empty</li>
            <li> So far no significant results but since its same contents you find in previously used brand name, I&#x27;m satisfied with price!</li>
            <li> Being a regular user this particular product caused major major inflammation</li>
            <li> I usually keep my hair at a medium length, but I really didn&#x27;t notice how much hair I had regrown until I shaved my head to even out the longer hairs with the shorter new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The crown bald spot when he started was about as big as a large orange and that same spot is now almost at about 85% coverage.</li>
            <li> This product has the right potential, and an amazingly low price, but, and here&#x27;s the big</li>
            <li> It starts with little blond hairs (maybe different colors for others, i have light brown hair) and eventually they color in.</li>
            <li> The products is reasonable price with numbers of items (average high delivery cost).</li>
            <li> I am on my first bottle of this, and had used a single bottle of rogaine prior and am 58 years old.</li>
            <li> product combined with an internal hair regrowth supplant can regrow new hair.</li>
            <li> However, the price is that you have to depend on it in the future, you will lose your new hair if you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it stopped new hair loss, and gave back maybe 75% of what he had lost?</li>
            <li> but its not all that bad.. atleast its cheap and i&#x27;ll have hair :)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was literally the whole crown area that was dry and crusty.</li>
            <li> But if it would dry fast, it probably wouldn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Made my face really itchy and dry</li>
            <li> The only thing that is very noticeable is the itching and massive amounts of dandruff the Minoxidil creates.  </li>
            <li> I began taking 5 Hour Energy almost daily during the work week, but after about the 10 week mark I didn&#x27;t need the energy boost as much and only took 5 Hour Energy once or twicea week as needed.</li>
            <li> Product works well and the only complaint is that the foam works better than the dropper.</li>
            <li> , at least I don&#x27;t think you should, the second day on the hair has more *volume* for thinning hair</li>
            <li> i can safely say im now considering pony tails, or at least a visit to the barbers, although since my last request for a haircut &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; i have received a restraining order...</li>
            <li> this product really was a waste of money; it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> So, I told her about Minoxidil and will cost less than $30 for a six months worth of supply on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It takes at least three months for actual effect, but it seems like working okay</li>
            <li> My hair is not totally regrown yet, but there is very noticeable extra foliage where there used to be none.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, you can not even return the unopened box because Amazon refuses to take it back stating that it contains a hazardous material!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little and the tinny hair parts become strong and long.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair after you apply use this to style your hair also in place of a wax for a very natural looking hold.</li>
            <li> I would say that if you are just starting to lose your hair very early on try taking biotin by itself I wish I had.</li>
            <li> This is not due to Kirkland Minoxidil, it will happen with any minoxidil, any brand.</li>
            <li> though I haven&#x27;t seen a major difference it seems to look thicker than before.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found out that this has exactly the same chemical compounds as Rogain and cost only one third.  </li>
            <li> First off: I haven&#x27;t tried other Minoxidil containing brands</li>
            <li> is a major one.</li>
            <li> and I have not seen any major improvements/results.</li>
            <li> Although I have not grown any new hair, it apparently stopped any further receding or baldness.</li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it, it was mildly irritating on my scalp, but that went away quickly.</li>
            <li> and I can safely say that no new hairs are growing and no more are leaving.</li>
            <li> and I can safely say that no new hairs are growing and no more are leaving.</li>
            <li> It has the same major active  ingredient as the more expense brand, but cost far less.</li>
            <li> they took this off the market in many stores &amp; am glad to get the Generic again  the foam is so messy &amp; expensive  Been looking for this for awhile  </li>
            <li> price is less than half of the original product with exact the same ingredients</li>
            <li> I continued using the product for several more weeks all the while being very anxious and nervous and irritated that I may have caused an increase of balding which I did not intend.</li>
            <li> My personal doctor is of the opinion that Rogaine (and Minoxidil which shares its active ingredient) either don&#x27;t produce ANY results or only create fine vellus hairs that will fall out the instant you stop taking it.  </li>
            <li> I am a male of African decent.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of this my hair is definitely getting thicker and is almost back to where it was in High School.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it worked really well, but I can say that it at least worked a little.</li>
            <li> I got a 3 for 1 special on them, if they arent on sale now, wait a few days and check back.</li>
            <li> This may sound like common sense</li>
            <li> It clearly states in the instructions to use several hours before you go to bed to avoid pillow staining.</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer: The instructions clearly state it is ONLY to be used on the head.)</li>
            <li> For some reason I continued to use it for a whole month during which unthinkable itchiness and dandruff were daily routine.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that it says in the more detailed instructions that the product must be continued to be used or the gains made will disappear.</li>
            <li> If they do, however, jack their prices, I&#x27;ll just buy a different brand as 5% Minoxidil clearly works for me</li>
            <li> They clearly mentioned that this product is made in Canada, but what they have sent to me is made in Israel, you can read several reviews for Minoxidil from this country!!!!.</li>
            <li> and now I barely notice the itching.</li>
            <li> The scalp itch is barely noticeable to me now</li>
            <li> This is the second time purchasing this product and I have been pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I put the dropper directly on my scalp and zig zag from front to back.  </li>
            <li> So I was not sure at first that it really worked until several months after I stopped using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old and my hair had thinned a lot in the last 1-2 years.</li>
            <li> Our local Costco no longer carries this item, was surprised to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Now two years into use you can barely tell that my hair was ever thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> My only negative is that I&#x27;ve grown hair on my face and back that I have to stay on top of.</li>
            <li> Just started using today, I will report back after a couple months and give an update on how its worked so far</li>
            <li> Once again, I didnt mind this too much, because it actually held my hair in place like a styling product would, and only took a minute to brush all the white out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am already seen results :O</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old male and my hairline has been receding for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> now and the only thing preventing me from going completely bald is this solution.</li>
            <li> Apparently the effects of minoxidil start to reverse after 45 days, but I would say it&#x27;s closer to 3 weeks and depends on your genetics.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the effectiveness of minoxidil increases with increasing dosage.</li>
            <li> , there are two boxes with nearly the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> and i think has stopped my head from balding and also has put some hair back like probably 30/40 more...good stuff as far as im concerned</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this actually seemed to work a bit.</li>
            <li> My hair actually looked thinner directly after using this, even though I knew it was working.</li>
            <li> I rub it in real well, and, although it makes my hair wet</li>
            <li> As far as results, the level of thinning has remained the same for 25 years.</li>
            <li> I was starting to lose some hair near the crown area of my head.</li>
            <li> old male with crown (not vertex) balding.</li>
            <li> I just went back to using the liquid form a few months ago and do already see a big difference, I&#x27;m balding from the top of the head, not back, and i do see a lot of hair growing back thicker.  </li>
            <li> You will lose hair at about 4 months and your hair will look worse then in about a year you will have regrown that plus more.</li>
            <li> You slowly drip one ml of fluid on your scalp or the Vertex, which is the top back section of your head.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin on top, to where you could see scalp.  </li>
            <li> Flaking will be eliminated but my hair began to thin out even more.</li>
            <li> My scalp has not gotten worse nor has it gotten better.</li>
            <li> The top of my head was extremely thin.</li>
            <li> The volume of hair i think would make it difficult to reach the scalp effectively</li>
            <li> if I stop using these two shampoos if I would have better or worse dandruff.</li>
            <li> Kirklands mixture of minoxidil is a little more runny and less oily compared to that of equate.</li>
            <li> I started with Rogaine extra strength and it took almost 9 months to see new teeny tiny hairs appearing on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Slow and steady with applying the solution is the rule, or use your fingers to assist, however be CERTAIN to wash your hands immediately as you do NOT want this getting in your eyes!  </li>
            <li> Slow and steady with applying the solution is the rule, or use your fingers to assist, however be CERTAIN to wash your hands immediately as you do NOT want this getting in your eyes!  </li>
            <li> It is also much less expensive than the foam and works great.  </li>
            <li> Not a full regrowth, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than a flat, empty splotch!  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the group of small bottles instead of the large size.  </li>
            <li> The box appears to be exactly like the one I got at Costco previously.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews stated, you start noticing an increase in hair loss after about the first 2 weeks to 1 month of use but after 2-3 weeks the extra hair loss stops.</li>
            <li> Sure, a little dandruff and a little itch, but what&#x27;s the alternative?</li>
            <li> However, my results are not typical, because hair growth has to do with genetics, rather than proper use of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product (which leaves sticky residue in my hair, but seems fairly effective in preventing further hair loss) for 3-4 yr.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuneately in my last two orders most of the &#x27;press down and turn&#x27; safety caps are DEFECTIVE, impossible to open, even with tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see the new growth and it seems to have slowed down the hair loss while growing some new hair.</li>
            <li> late stage baldness, you won&#x27;t see any significant hair</li>
            <li> However, he noted as other reviewers did previously-this stuff makes your scalp very itchy.  </li>
            <li> Not a single hair grow.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing about this is a 6 month supply turns into a 3 month, but its working great for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old Asian male.</li>
            <li> am not a medical professional, however, I would suspect results could vary depending on individual health-genetic characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and hopefully I get the ability back as I am only 31 years old.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the same results but it may be too early to write a review because it is only been a couple of months</li>
            <li> so i am adamant about giving my hair a second life as such.  </li>
            <li> (It does not dry on the scalp for about 3 hours).&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I was just getting extremely thin on the entire top of my head.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son,23 yo starting to thin on top</li>
            <li> Skip the expensive brand and get your hair back as effectively with Kirkland.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does make my hair kind of greasy/sticky but only where I apply it and to the casual observer</li>
            <li> I switched back to the solution about 3 months ago and have seen major improvements.</li>
            <li> minoxidil definitely reduces hair loss but has no effect on dht, the major culprit...</li>
            <li> First a little background.</li>
            <li> my hair was thin and fine to begin with, but at 39 years old and being a female, when my hair started falling out and my doctor couldn&#x27;t find a physiological reason, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> next experiment will be to see how long these new hairs</li>
            <li> I have been used it for a year and a half, and in the first year, I lose a lot of hair, but, in a couple of month later, my hair star growing again, you just need to give it time, and should work</li>
            <li> (hopefully you won&#x27;t have any major sexual side effects), apply 1 ml minoxidil twice a day (or double the dose once at night) and shower with both biotin shampoo and 1% ketoconazole (nizoral) shampoo every other day leaving it in your hair for at least 5-7 minutes (which is known to have anti-androgenetic effects)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer noticeably thin on top, and I&#x27;ve regained a good amount of hair along my temples, so I no longer have as bad of an \\&quot;island.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the side effects are real and it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is specifically for balding at the back of the head, not for receding hairline or general thinning hair...</li>
            <li> if you use it in a long term, although you are just using it on your scalp, it will eventually enters your body from capillaries, which would cause some unexpected effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a week, so that&#x27;s something to bare in mind while reading about my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT REGROW A FULL HEAD OF THICK HAIR, BUT IT DEFFINATELY DOES REGROW AND HELP FILL IN AREAS OF THINNING</li>
            <li> My fiance took a picture of the top of my head last night and the change is DRAMATIC.</li>
            <li> and I think it even adds a little more body than my baby-fine hair usually has.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I purchased the product mainly for my extremely sparse eyebrows that have been ravaged by thyroid disease.  </li>
            <li> But nevertheless, I felt that my hair loss was minimal and that it did regenerate new growth.  </li>
            <li> but I believe I found the right substance, I&#x27;ve used rogain in the past and that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> This product really works, and cost much less than Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Name brand was twice as much for half the amount of the product.</li>
            <li> The application itself is a bit of a pain; you have to do it twice daily, and you use the dropper and gently rub it into the thin/balding areas, and if you&#x27;re not careful it will drip (it has an oily texture, so definitely DON&#x27;T apply it less</li>
            <li> You need to be as consistent as possible with this if you miss an application or a day every few weeks</li>
            <li> than it had prior to use but after the first few weeks I saw regrowth to match it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money buying brand name products when generics are composed of exact same formula.</li>
            <li> There is also no new growth in the front near my temples as is stated on the product.</li>
            <li> There is also no new growth in the front near my temples as is stated on the product.</li>
            <li> Still the hairloss continued but seemed to slow down more.</li>
            <li> It only took a week to get the Kirkland product at less than half the price, so if it works anywhere near as well as ProRestora, it is definately worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> The idea is to treat your minor baldness before it turns into a major problem.</li>
            <li> The first couple weeks, as with any Rogaine-type product, you go through \\&quot;hair shock\\&quot;, which temporarily accelerates hair loss (new hairs are supposed to grow in as the weak hair dies off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your hair serves important functions, so take a little extra time everyday to preserve it.</li>
            <li> little depressing that I have to keep using it for the rest of forever, but not nearly as depressing as having a bald spot on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> was a victim of going to the brow salon very frequent, and it wasnt long before I had to pencil my brows in just to shape them.</li>
            <li> I was told in high school that baldness is passed down through the female gene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a good conditioner like Jason Thin to Thick conditioner for fuller hair as well.</li>
            <li> But really, I&#x27;ve lost at least half of my hair and theres a large area of open scalp on the crown where it was barely noticible before and no sign of any regrowth.</li>
            <li> Small little hairs start popping up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Like my father and maternal grandfather I started losing my hair in my late 20s, right around the time</li>
            <li> The huge bald spot in the center of my head has become very small and I figure within another month it will be gone.  </li>
            <li> In the evening I just apply right before going to bed as there is no risk of it running down my face while lying down.</li>
            <li> Not everyone gets the results they want - but for me this product has given me thicker and more hair in the places where it was very thin.  </li>
            <li> it wasnt that bad, it almost has a fresh, clean look to me, but im not gonna lie</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not lush growth but it makes a world of difference to my hairline because my hair is so fine and thin.</li>
            <li> While using Minoxidil didn&#x27;t stop my hair loss dead in its tracks it certainly did arrest it</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time with the other products, because I did and had nothing.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same and people who are paying through the nose for a name brand are wasting their hard earned money.</li>
            <li> This product is less than 1/2 the price of Rogain and it has produced new hair growth that continues to grow.</li>
            <li> I tried watering it down but it just developed crystals!</li>
            <li> I can say that my hair is about the same as it was after 3 months - no better, no worse.</li>
            <li> I can say that my hair is about the same as it was after 3 months - no better, no worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works like the regular Rogaine brand name product or not because I couldn&#x27;t stand the feeling in my hair long enough to wait months to see if it worked.  </li>
            <li> I was only using it once per day so it is lasting twice as long.</li>
            <li> Only worry is possible effects on the heart in the long run -</li>
            <li> (but for how long?) or \\&quot;I use it only once a day\\&quot; (not as directed) or \\&quot;I only use .75ml at a time\\&quot; (again, not directed).</li>
            <li> One note- new hair may be a little different than the existing hair-</li>
            <li> At this early stage when I get my hair cut, the new growth isn&#x27;t making the clippers dull ...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t anything major, but certainly not what I wanted to see.</li>
            <li> no more .... thanks</li>
            <li> Been shedding very rapidly for the past 4 weeks - I get about 5 hair with each flake of dandruff I pull out.</li>
            <li> In addition in the summer when its hot the foam starts dissolving into a liquid in my hand almost immediately which I never liked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly young compared to the average hair-loss patient, though (27 when I began treatment).</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a month and not sure if it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> When I have used it, I was consistent with it for at least a year.  </li>
            <li> Of course I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know whether or not my hair will become fuller, but everything is as promised.</li>
            <li> I think if I&#x27;d continued to use this 5% solution long enough the itching would have eventually become</li>
            <li> eat protein and biotin-rich foods too and take multi/b-vitamins (they&#x27;ll only help in the long run)</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to know if it works.</li>
            <li> Slowing down entropy drastically, although not stopping it completely.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for over 6 months and my hair loss seems to have slowed down if not stopped completely.  </li>
            <li> The solution will go directly on the area that you intend and will not run down your face or give you the greasy hair look.  </li>
            <li> I keep my hair really short, so there&#x27;s no mess, however I have used it before with longer hair, and it&#x27;s a mess.  </li>
            <li> Whether you buy Rogaine or Minoxidil under any other brand name, it is the same stuff, same bottle design, same manufacturer located in Israel.</li>
            <li> This product has brought new hair growth to those trouble spots.</li>
            <li> It stays on my scalp overnight this way but gives me several hours to dry before bedtime</li>
            <li> i use 2ml at a time but let it dry before i do the next.</li>
            <li> The stuff takes literally 4 hours to dry, and after that is can be brushed out of your hair with a comb / your hand.  </li>
            <li> [Kirkland Extra Strength Minoxidil] that was causing the dry crusty scalp.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> only problem is it gets sticky and takes time to dry.</li>
            <li> enough for about 4 months (not 6 months as advertised)oduces dandruff when dry</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, but unfortunately it&#x27;s still too soon leave any real remarks regarding the performance of the product.  </li>
            <li> , the brand name is exponentially more expensive than the Kirkland brand, and the active ingredient is the same.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for 2 months on my brows and they are back to their bushy glory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It caused a quick telogen effluvium in me, it didn&#x27;t regrow any appreciable amount of hair, and what is worse, my hair became dependent on this concentration.</li>
            <li> some of the side effects for me have been: crazy hair growth all over my body, but watever, some scalp irritation but very little (sometimes if i dont shower in like 12 hours it starts to really itch) and as for sexual side effects...</li>
            <li> its your head telling you that the stuff is working - pretty much out with the old (bad hair) and in with the new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2.5 months</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it works or not, but at least it really is odorless, unlike some stinky stuff I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old white male with the usual pattern baldness.  </li>
            <li> I can see small new hairs starting to grow where they was none before.  </li>
            <li> The Kirkland Minoxidil left my hair very greasy for up to a couple hours after each use, which was not pleasant not convenient, especially when using it before bedtime and waking up with a grease stained pillow.  </li>
            <li> Other manufacturers have much more expensive products.</li>
            <li> make sure you use it twice daily without fail!  </li>
            <li> but I am not interested in the daily routine nor the consistency of the actual product.</li>
            <li> It is quite a large supply, but for me at least it lasts about 4.5 months rather than 6.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had a mature hairline and a little thinning.</li>
            <li> Developed little bumps all where it ran on my face n neck...</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Around the fourth week I noticed dry dandruff like chunks falling on my shoulders, as the days went by the dry patches got</li>
            <li> Also if you scratch when its dry you&#x27;ll get white dry flake like stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is basically like the Rogaine foam from all the commercials (Same active ingredients, same strength) except you apply it with an eyedropper</li>
            <li> so anyone can use the same active ingredient, allowing companies like Costco (Kirkland) to sell cheaper versions of the same product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to be objective about the results since it is hard to note such a gradual effect, but I met up with a friend at 1 and 6 months after starting the treatment and was told that my hair looked a lot thicker (and he is not afraid to tell me the truth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first month was slow and tedious, but I was soon able to see little hairs sprouting on my hairline.  </li>
            <li> This does not mean you should stop using it, a lot of people will write negative reviews about this product because it’s not an instant fix.</li>
            <li> No bald spot anymore and at least for me it work very well for frontal hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I also notice that when I wash my hair I don&#x27;t see as much if any hair in my hands so it seems to have stopped the loss of hair at least.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the testing involved to determine whether we are candidates or not has yet to become available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost afraid to stop using it as my hair thinness might regress to the more balding condition of my brother and father.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use them as long as they offer this product.</li>
            <li> I really am not sure how anyone can use this stuff and maintain a normal life.</li>
            <li> Though one thing to note is that the product does eventually dries out, but takes a really long time.</li>
            <li> so be prepared to be in it for the long term, used to cost 30 bucks a month</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll buy this again because it works and its cheaper in the long run than buying this and rogain.</li>
            <li> far as applying the product: I draw up the amount with the provided dropper and apply a few drops to my scalp, rub it in, apply the rest.  </li>
            <li> think if you are a young male who also suffers hair loss, this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> When I use it on continuous bases after a couple of months you see the hair loss stops and you&#x27;re maintaining, maybe minor improvements.</li>
            <li> and it hasnt been that long yet.</li>
            <li> My hubby used it twice a day for about a month and then went to once a day as the morning treatments left his hair kinda wet</li>
            <li> My hair loss was minor and I started using this product at the earliest sign of hair line recession.  </li>
            <li> :  Dermatologists have long said that gray hair could NEVER be reversed.</li>
            <li> Caused severe cardiac problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> have a problem with my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re selling a six month supply for roughly the same price that CVS charges  - for a ONE MONTH supply.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of time and money for us.</li>
            <li> Some days I spent ten minutes trying to comb it all out, but it just keeps coming.</li>
            <li> oh, long bushy hairs around my testicles.</li>
            <li> only comes with one dropper, so be careful you don&#x27;t throw it away when you are done with a bottle.</li>
            <li> It can take as long as 6 months or so to make a difference</li>
            <li> To begin, this product actually did work for me and it did quicker than expected, in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> The box states, results will appear within 6 months, as long as application of &#x27;twice a day&#x27; are followed.</li>
            <li> I have been useing this product fo a long time and have found that it works well</li>
            <li> takes too long to see any results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even possible that some hair has started to grow in, but not much.</li>
            <li> There by making it a must buy for me for as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working just as well, and it helps to stretch out how long between repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> This took a long time to work for me(several months) but it did start to work.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering this product again and sticking with it for a long time.</li>
            <li> (Rogaine says it doesn&#x27;t have this problem, but it&#x27;s been so long since I used the Brand, that I can&#x27;t say either</li>
            <li> /&gt;does not cause any skin trouble so far.</li>
            <li> Sometimes experience minor itching from use, which is an anticipated side-effect.</li>
            <li> Effects - I can attest that for me, the side effects are minimal, dandruff being the only one I suffer from.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper because while it doesn&#x27;t work, you are saving money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I put on the Kirkland today and no burning and far less inactive ingredients!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 yrs now because it was less expensive than Top brand rogaine</li>
            <li> I decided to try this kirkland minoxidil topical solution because it&#x27;s half the price of the rogaine foam and seems to have all the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> compared to Rogaine you get the same product for the same effects at half the price.</li>
            <li> Few other symptons i have been through are like slightly increased facial hair, at times increased heart rate when used in large amounts for a single application....</li>
            <li> I saw a definite reduction in further hair loss almost immediately, very little hair left in the tub.</li>
            <li> it caused an actual chemical burn that was extremely severe and</li>
            <li> A read of the \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; ingredients was alarming-4 different alchohols and a bunch of other chemicals.</li>
            <li> Compare to same material produced by other companies.</li>
            <li> But after the 3rd month of this I noticed extreme shortness of breath when running or walking up hill.</li>
            <li> couple times it has also left a white tint to my hair, and gave it a little bit of hardening, as if I had used hairspray.</li>
            <li> 1st week of usage..waiting to see results..but recommend over other generic brand</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about trying a generic brand and switching from the foam because of some of the other reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time ago, when I started to lose hair - in summer 1996!</li>
            <li> It would be better to go bald than go mad scratching, and to look like snow is falling from your head every time you turn.</li>
            <li> And then, only if you don&#x27;t have the other 15 reasons for not using it.</li>
            <li> other news is that I didn&#x27;t even use it properly sometimes (by accident).</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other products you can try if you find that Minoxidil doesn’t work for you, such as a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Both approaches are equally valid, except some work for some, and other’s work for others.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it very long</li>
            <li> I went from Fester to Elvis in one swoop of the dropper, no lie my hair was thinning in back bad and also thinning in the front and top..</li>
            <li> For one, this product won’t grow your hair back if you are bad, its more of a preventative measure to keep your hair from thinning.</li>
            <li> I dont know why people give bad reviews to this product the only difference is its more oily</li>
            <li> After applying in the morning, I have to use a towel to dry off my hair or else</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t just go on and dry</li>
            <li> I wash my hair in the morning and towel dry.  </li>
            <li> Once dry ( about and hour)</li>
            <li> Do this once in the morning and once in the evening noting that it takes 2-4 hours to dry.</li>
            <li> After 5 months on Rogaine my scalp was dry, sore, and flaking.</li>
            <li> You need to let it dry when using it at night, can stain pillowcases</li>
            <li> And even when I dry, my hair looks as if I used the cheapest hair gel and forget to take a shower for three days.</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry, brittle....</li>
            <li> After my hair finishes soaking, I rinse and dry with a blow dryer once I&#x27;m out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> but it does take a bit longer to dry.  </li>
            <li> it takes a while for this to dry.</li>
            <li> It leaves an oily film and takes hours to dry.</li>
            <li> It takes about an hour to dry, so you have to remember to put it in before you go to bed.</li>
            <li> It remains like that for quite a while, and takes some time to dry, so I recommend using a hair dryer after you apply it.</li>
            <li> , then produces dandruff when dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Itchy dry scalp&lt;br /&gt;Slow</li>
            <li> Some downsides: it takes FOREVER to dry, so</li>
            <li> if you think that&#x27;s going to be a problem, seek alternative measures (if you sort of rub it in with your fingers, it would probably dry faster.</li>
            <li> I use \\&quot;dry scalp\\&quot; shampoo anyways, so that probably helps with this.</li>
            <li> I would blow dry my hair after applying to diffuse the greasy look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same active ingredient, it&#x27;s cheaper, and it is odorless.  </li>
            <li> My hairline began to recede in my late teens, and the hair on the top of my head started to thin soon thereafter.  </li>
            <li> The temple areas haven&#x27;t really been helped I do notice some short thin hairs in the areas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only making an inital review here but will try to update it over the course of the next few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to report in a few months on actual results, but I started taking finasteride (\\&quot;Propecia\\&quot;) at the same time</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in both this Kirkland brand and in the Rogaine brand is the same, which is Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to quantify exactly, but i know that i have less thinning hair than before and have not noticed any worsening.  </li>
            <li> I chose this seller because of their positive feedback from other users and they certainly didn&#x27;t disappointment me.  </li>
            <li> I followed every single thing in there, but nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 3 years, acts like a gel on my hair, I don&#x27;t get bored or tired using it, because I only use it once, and still showing it&#x27;s effects amazingly.</li>
            <li> I pour mine into an old small spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, but takes a long time.</li>
            <li> long as you don&#x27;t get your hair wet</li>
            <li> For ladies I would recommend not using the extra strength and stepping down</li>
            <li> runs all down the back of my neck or my face.</li>
            <li> must use daily - it has slowed down hair loss - I have used now for 4 years</li>
            <li> I see some new hair appearing slowly.</li>
            <li> A short haircut also helps, oddly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A short haircut also helps, oddly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally started to see some small hairs growing back.</li>
            <li> Ears puffed up twice the size they usually are, red itchy bumps all over my scalp and face, and it took antibiotics to finally rid my body of it.</li>
            <li> My father has the same issue as me, and he said at my age he had a lot less hair.</li>
            <li> Double the price for 50% less</li>
            <li> stuff makes my scalp slightly irritated for a couple of hours after each use, but I have enough willpower to resist scratching it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Costs much less than the brand name product and does the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I finally took a shot at minoxidil and within days I had no more hairloss and in 2 weeks found that I have several hair coming in at the hailine.</li>
            <li> No, but it is getting close and is definitely way less noticeable.</li>
            <li> With smaller bottles there is less oxidation or damage from spills.  </li>
            <li> However I use less than the suggested 1 ml quantity as the extra liquid starts to run off.</li>
            <li> It took close to 4 weeks before noticing any serious changes, but since then things have been steadily improving in my hair growth.</li>
            <li> Gives you very very dry skin though.</li>
            <li> After five or six weeks I started noticing new thin hairs on my temples, hands, back, etc.</li>
            <li> I read the comments here and tried everything including scratching as little and gently as possible, using less product, using it only at night, using a moisturizing conditioner but nothing helped.</li>
            <li> I even tried placing a little in the front above my temples where I am receding.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, but after one month of using this product, I have tons of these little short hairs coming in up front.  </li>
            <li> I was only losing a little and in spots.</li>
            <li> thing I didn&#x27;t like is did not state made in the USA - meaning likely China that has little checks and balances on product sales.</li>
            <li> Of course, I wash my hair twice daily (a habit I picked up from using the foam twice a day), so there is little chance for buildup.  </li>
            <li> I started to see that I was losing a little hair on the back of head and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I panicked a little about 6 months ago when I noticed some thinning hair at the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little thinning was starting to happen.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I notice at times is I may get a little drowsy not much but noticable</li>
            <li> Only thing I notice at times is I may get a little drowsy not much but noticable</li>
            <li> I prefer them to any other holding chemical, havent seen any hair grouth in years and it kinda dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Only 5 stars instead of 6, because the 5% topical leaves the hair a bit dull, but this was mentioned in the pamphlet, no surprise to</li>
            <li> Worst of all I&#x27;me 6 applications in (3 days worth) and am having huge flakes of residue and/or skin sloughing off in my hair.</li>
            <li> After 1 month of use, I started to notice a small amount of extra long hair strands in the hair line.</li>
            <li> ( yes I know young and it sucks )</li>
            <li> I hope that this is really and merely the generic version of Rogaine because you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it will forever turn your pillowcases yellow.</li>
            <li> , it goes on and beads up and tries to roll around your head.</li>
            <li> I just got the product yesterday, initially I was a bit unsure about using it constantly during the day time because it made my hair  extra greasy and thin looking.</li>
            <li> I put on in the morning with my hair wet.  </li>
            <li> I then put on so gel and style wet.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a try in hopes of saving a few bucks over the regular Rogaine brand name (foam) product.  </li>
            <li> However, that is absolutely not the case.</li>
            <li> I found I have to carefully comb out my hair</li>
            <li> and it looks like it might be slightly wet.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not ready for the side effects you should not use it because your hair will eventually become dependent upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as I expected it too,  but it does take a while to see growth.</li>
            <li> I apply it and it never really dries.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as expected</li>
            <li> Its a bit harder to get to the areas you want to treat.  </li>
            <li> I have clasic baldness pattern from the crown of my head extending out in a roughly circular design (what some refer to as Yamakle shaped).  </li>
            <li> and it the effects are minimal</li>
            <li> but without side by side studies you really never know if its your nature that keeps hair growing or this stuff.  </li>
            <li> soon as I got out of the shower in the morning I would apply it while my hair is wet..</li>
            <li> Be extremely careful if you choose to use this product.</li>
            <li> Take up only a few drops into the dropper, apply, rub in.</li>
            <li> I started to grow back hair within a few months.</li>
            <li> There may be a few extra hairs, but not the fuzzy caterpillars I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> After months of research i found that you could, in fact, use minoxidil to activate dormant facial follicles, instead of re-animating dead ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> The buyer stated that they changed the look on the box, so be careful when it comes to reviews.</li>
            <li> Careful this one uses some Glycol product that irritates some peoples scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying lipogaine for two years with no real results</li>
            <li> Must be the dried residual of the product, but that is a total guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did have an issue one time where the product came and the box was soaking wet.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s really no difference between the brand name (Rogaine) and the generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some don&#x27;t like the idea of applying twice a day, don&#x27;t like the wet hair look</li>
            <li> Some don&#x27;t like the idea of applying twice a day, don&#x27;t like the wet hair look</li>
            <li> and you can see the obvious results in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so it is not really a con, in fact</li>
            <li> We have a Costco building now, but not ready until Spring 2014.</li>
            <li> so be careful about drips</li>
            <li> If this low cost alternative versus the name brand minoxidil was not available, I&#x27;d probably not buy it.</li>
            <li> I was losing some hair a few years back</li>
            <li> I have only just begun to use the product so an immediate review as to product quality is not available.</li>
            <li> I tried to stop using it on three separate occasions over the last few years and, each time, after 3 or 4 months of not using it, I started to DRAMATICALLY lose my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a slow process but after a couple of months I could definitely see my eyebrows are growing back it somewhat.</li>
            <li> Is it a thick lush head of hair?  </li>
            <li> I actually stopped using ProRestora (which was actually a good product) because of the terrible customer service and the length of time it took (almost 4 months) to get my order.  </li>
            <li> Gone from a small bold spot on the crown to just a thin spot.</li>
            <li> If you have not bought this product and you are having hair fall, then i would certainly not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this product would work on me since I am pass 50, but it started working right away.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about this being difficult to use and stick with, however, my advice right now is to go for it.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve been using the Kirkland Minoxidil combined with generic Propecia, and I believe I&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement.</li>
            <li> This is the same as the name brand for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product because I don&#x27;t think that it is worth it to have bad looking hair over what would be a long process of growing your hair back.</li>
            <li> Due to artificial hand joints I can not lift many boxes when left on sidewalk or in driveway, which has been where I find them for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> but I would be curious, what other people say.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that sometimes I feel the drop run down the back of my head.</li>
            <li> After the first month instead of hair growing back i was losing a crazy amount of hair...</li>
            <li> and I have to use a paper towel to dry it after half an hour.</li>
            <li> Im using this as gel, cause it take like half and hour to dry</li>
            <li> Well to make a long story short, I have learned to wait at least 15 minutes after applying the produt before styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not vain, just uncomfortable losing hair from the crown first.</li>
            <li> It can leave a slightly greasy look, so I blow dry after applying this when my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li> Used this for about half a year (and the Wal-Mart brand three months before that) for an area near my front hairline that was starting to thin out.</li>
            <li> I was missing about an inch and a half of hair on each side, and about an inch deep.</li>
            <li> After a few days back on, shedding is noticeably less.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people have negative things to say about Minoxidil, (or Rogaine) – the truth is topical hair serums/gels have limited scope in terms of who it will work for.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at my local Wallyworld.</li>
            <li> Read and make your decision carefully!</li>
            <li> lost a lot of hair due to taking the gamble that this product would work, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this off brand since the other was no longer on sale.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> When I started my hair was thinning due to Nioxin shampoo (don&#x27;t use unless already bald).</li>
            <li> Money well spent for some head fertilizer!</li>
            <li> Not up to par with other brands.</li>
            <li> After just 1 1/2 months I noticed small hairs starting to grow on my head.</li>
            <li> I truly do not suggest that this product be used on one&#x27;s pet or for any other use than what&#x27;s on the box.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a week in addition to some other stuff</li>
            <li> (id rather have one or the other), i gave it another shot with this</li>
            <li> I have hair thinning due to menopause at my temples and sides of scalp.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the foam for about nine months due to the flaking the solution caused but wish I had never made the switch.  </li>
            <li> During this process I actually lost some hair, not sure is it the liquid itself, scalp irritation, or both that were root cause.</li>
            <li> my brows and edges were thinning out due to thyroid issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blurred vision or other changes in vision&lt;br /&gt;Chest</li>
            <li> on the other hand, after about two months the itching began.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also makes my hair look dark and wet until I wash it, which would be a problem for me if I worked around other people that I wanted to impress; I work in an auto-shop, so I couldnt care less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its an endless battle, and</li>
            <li> No need for any other hair gel.</li>
            <li> I usually apply texture paste and then use the drip applicator to start at the forehead and tilt my head back for it to cover my scalp.</li>
            <li> Child-proof bottle caps are a nuisance and the bottle usually sits only semi-closed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of Minoxidil</li>
            <li> but then the rashes started (which I believe are due to hair trying to grow where its never grown before).  </li>
            <li> but-it made my head extremely flakey and itchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Minor Results after one year of use&lt;br /&gt;+Affordable compared to other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other generics like Members Mark (sold at Sam&#x27;s Club)</li>
            <li> I am strictly rating this product for the price point in comparison with other Minoxidil 5% 6 month supply products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using kirkland minoxidil for about 8 years now and it has kept my existing hair intact with minimal to no loss!  </li>
            <li> and I also use other hair regrowth products to assist it.</li>
            <li> Go check you-tube and see what happens to people due to using it.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is the polish dog and soda for $1.50!</li>
            <li> The other review sya&#x27;s it does not work, I feel its working like Provilus..</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I was skeptical that it would work.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried other applicators before</li>
            <li> The product leaves a sticky coating on hair unlike other products</li>
            <li> We have used this product for many years and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and was so disappointed when&lt;</li>
            <li> In terms of its comparison to other oils?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using the product for the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been that consistent</li>
            <li> However with time it worked so well, that now hes recommends it to other balding men.</li>
            <li> The second month I started to take, there is a small result.</li>
            <li> If you wash your hair every other day then it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> As with other products like this you just need to be give it a little time to dry.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my head a little dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been noticing a general thinning of the hair on the crown of my head for a little over a year and when three small bald spots appeared I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Although it seems, and this is very speculative, that the dandruff is a little worse with the Israeli lot, but then again, I was using for three months by the time I got to that</li>
            <li> The liquid is less than half the price of the foam and once it dries you can wear it out, if you don&#x27;t mind the somewhat strange texture and slightly greasy, wet</li>
            <li> Insert of product states:  &amp;#34;In studies with minoxidil topical solution 5%, hair regrowth has NOT been shown to last longer than 48 weeks of continuous treatment in large clinical trials.&amp;#34;  What a major disappointment and senseless use of this product!!</li>
            <li> I like that the hair remains a bit dry and you&#x27;re not washing your hair everyday</li>
            <li> definitely recommend using this product in conjunction with the PerfectHAIR if your hair is starting to thin.  </li>
            <li> messy and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff works guys, I had a receding hairline and it was scary far back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve limited this to right before bed since I can&#x27;t have this in my hair during the day, but have started skipping it all together because it&#x27;s so unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> form other companies but 25 bucks for half a year</li>
            <li> The price is hard to beat but you seldom get the same product.</li>
            <li> This extreme hair loss lasted for about six to eight weeks for me and was very dramatic for the first four or five weeks before gradually slowing down and virtually stopping altogether.</li>
            <li> The other minor complaint is that once applied it is slow to dry, giving you a wet hair look that isn&#x27;t uniformly wet like you&#x27;ve come out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The other minor complaint is that once applied it is slow to dry, giving you a wet hair look that isn&#x27;t uniformly wet like you&#x27;ve come out of the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Individual results vary, I would say it is not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> The extra strength at least for me was a mistake.  </li>
            <li> They really work, I jusr ordered wrong product b c</li>
            <li> no success....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the side effects.</li>
            <li> You receive 3 bottles and it last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I only want to slow the spread of my &amp;#34;Friar Tuck&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The hair that grew back isn&#x27;t as thick as on the rest of my head</li>
            <li> but I see it coming back slowly.</li>
            <li> Changed to Minoxidil and my hair continues to grow at the same slow rate, but no difference in performance.</li>
            <li> this stuff will ma it down and make it look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair</li>
            <li> Longer hair is matted down while the product dries.  </li>
            <li> Kirkland doesn&#x27;t let you down here.</li>
            <li> When I would try and break it down it ended tearing out my hair</li>
            <li> and I can say that using these products has slowed down the rate of decline.</li>
            <li> it all comes down to it.</li>
            <li> It has slowed down some of the hair loss, and there is some re-growth in the crown section.</li>
            <li> 2 THUMBS DOWN.</li>
            <li> Restarted the Kirkland Minoxidil after one month and started seeing growth again and hair loss slowed down to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> Since this is a liquid, it would roll down my scalp onto my forehead.</li>
            <li> I use twice a day although after about a year or 2 of twice a day use i&#x27;ll probably go down to once a day at bedtime.</li>
            <li> It got down to the point that all I was buying at Costco was their Minoxidil and duct tape.</li>
            <li> and I will probably continue using this for the rest of my life at 27 because it kept me from going down the path of baldness...</li>
            <li> so the liquid doesn&#x27;t just run down my face or neck</li>
            <li> It flows down just like water.</li>
            <li> I found that when my hair dried with it already applied it wasn&#x27;t greasy or anything like other people</li>
            <li> Even when I use less the the 1.0ml on the measured dropper, it drips and runs off my head.  </li>
            <li> for the vortex, im seeing hairs and less bald spots.</li>
            <li> and i have to say less.</li>
            <li> my scalp was much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another 2-year supply, as my previous 2-year supply was just about finished.  </li>
            <li> I bought a 6 months supply, and started noticing that each bottle was disappearing in well less than a month, so I wrote the date on the bottle to find out.  </li>
            <li> It also rejuvinated something else, because I have less gray hair growing than before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bald or balding, but i use this as a preventative measure and it works well because I notice less hairs falling out after towelling off my hair after shower.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night, as it tends to be slightly greasy, and by morning, I can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> My doctor told me to use the 5% because he said anything less would not work.</li>
            <li> I get twice the amount at half the price!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> half the price&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just use the men&#x27;s half as often or at half dosage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, I notice my hair is getting slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> and it cost much less then Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Definetly is not a quick  cure.</li>
            <li> means you&#x27;re getting less for your $$</li>
            <li> This is much less sticky, in fact no stickiness.</li>
            <li> Less hair in the shower drain (I think).</li>
            <li> Party of two at home being using  this proiduct for years buying from Costco and also the previous name.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as name brand, half the price.</li>
            <li> I hear branded Rogaine is less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish that I had the ablitiy to take it to a lab  so as to prove that it is what it claims to be, but I&#x27;m a trusting soul, so I continue to buy it, and it costs 50% less than the Rogaine that you see in the stores</li>
            <li> I now half 3 half containers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a lot of work to maintain this stuff and it added serious complications to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> but less itching on my scalp..</li>
            <li> I tried switching to the foam with maybe less swelling, but itchy as all hell.</li>
            <li> I am patient and I still have five and a half months supply to use.</li>
            <li> This is an UPdate, i cant seem to find the thread to my previous review</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars if not for the slight trade off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foam is much less greasy.</li>
            <li> im seeing little hairs come up and turn dark and stay.</li>
            <li> now I went from having very little thin hair to having a huge fluffy head of thin hair  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a mess.</li>
            <li> But looks like that was not true</li>
            <li> Leaves greasy and sticky mess on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair daily because really it&#x27;s not good to do that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take too long to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and I&#x27;m not thrilled about that (about an hour in my experience).  </li>
            <li> Not true with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> In the front I was really thin, and now it barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> you will feel it running on your scalp particularly if your hair is very thin.</li>
            <li> Applying the solution with the eyedropper can be messy and it does dribble down the side of your head to places where you don&#x27;t want/need it.  </li>
            <li> Less greasy than the foam, and easier to apply to areas that still have hair without making the area oily and limp.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s slow to dry, or expect immediate visible results.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s slow to dry, or expect immediate visible results.  </li>
            <li> It makes my scalp itch a little bit, and if I scratch, I get this stuff on my hands and have to wash it off</li>
            <li> /&gt;After six months, it did little for my hairline in the front.</li>
            <li> So I read a little bit on Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;m not sure if I received advertised Kirkland liquid solution or some other knock off product.</li>
            <li> My hair seems a little fuller than I remember it being.</li>
            <li> For a little while though you will notice something, but not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when i suspend  treatment it falls a little easier.</li>
            <li> I hope by the end of the month I can see a little difference.</li>
            <li> seemed like it might a little</li>
            <li> A little hair dye and problem</li>
            <li> His hair did get noticeably thicker, but with how he reacted to it, it just is not worth it!</li>
            <li> My scalp gets a little itchy, but it&#x27;s nothing that is unbearable</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is due to minoxidil.</li>
            <li> and it does tend to leave a little bit of flakey stuff on your scalp after it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over one year.</li>
            <li> Results are another thing, I have been using this for some time and have seen little to no results.</li>
            <li> (what little I have), it seems to give it body, so I&#x27;ve been using it like a gel.  </li>
            <li> Also, in the beginning it did cause itching and flakes, but after doing a little reading I started to take biotin along with it</li>
            <li> I actually didnt tell anyone that I using anything on my hair until my mom commented on how thick my hair looked!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I really liked the result</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to give this only two stars because of the way it makes my hair sticky and almost never seems to dry out.  </li>
            <li> But my thin spot in the back was reduced by about half.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops to your tank&#x27;s filtration system and your little swimmers will be floating little fur balls in 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Wish If I would have tried some other brand in this past few months might be .</li>
            <li> hair\\&quot; thing that is false (will only prevent loss) and the itch / mess.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using it twice/day I noticed little peach hairs growing where my hair had been lost.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few months &amp; it gave me a little confidence to grow my hair.</li>
            <li> Very slowly baby hairs began to form and eventually grew into proper beard hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pain to use it everyday, who have the time to methodically apply it ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years without missing a day.</li>
            <li> No effect,don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
            <li> Application can be messy.</li>
            <li> Takes a few months to notice anything, and once you stop using it</li>
            <li> guys: washing your hair everyday is not doing you any favors.</li>
            <li> my hair line in the front was starting to thin a lot.</li>
            <li> It maintains its stickiness for a few hours.</li>
            <li> , i am always scratching my head from a few weeks ... if this continues, i wonder if i abandon the product ...</li>
            <li> I was starting to thin out, and I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair was looking.  </li>
            <li> Buying this product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> How can anyone with a mirror in his use or people around him use this oily, messy product?</li>
            <li> Go buy it for a few years.</li>
            <li> I tried nizoral for a few weeks to get rid of the dandruff and it didnt work.</li>
            <li> Once dried off, I apply the suggested amount of  minoxidil foam to my scalp and massage it in.  </li>
            <li> you have ever had heart trouble before</li>
            <li> The itching was only getting worse and was driving me nuts, I wanted to claw my head off.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use anything close the 6 months supply, waste of money.</li>
            <li> hoping that it works in few months of using it</li>
            <li> if your starting to thin start using minoxidil 5%.</li>
            <li> the parts that were starting to thin are now thicker.</li>
            <li> Just take the included dropper and put a few drops of Minoxidil on the problem spot</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect immediate results though, it does take a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a hair dryer or apply hair gel until the mediation has dried on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The left side was worse because I sleep on that side which runs against the pillow.</li>
            <li> I will have to use it everyday to maintain this bit of growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few things about it and it makes me cringe..</li>
            <li> Lastly, you can&#x27;t stop using this or your hair will begin to thin out again..</li>
            <li> , so people on hear complaining about it being oily, or not drying, or saying it doesn&#x27;t style as well as the foam are missing the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took a few pics and in 6 mo to a year</li>
            <li> The reason being: it didn&#x27;t help with any hair growth, whatsoever; it provided my scalp with a rather heavy amount of dandruff; and it caused my scalp to be itchy, at times.  </li>
            <li> It has gotten progressively worse over time and my widow&#x27;s peak is also starting to get wider.</li>
            <li> I would scratch and have blood and dead skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday--</li>
            <li> I started losing it in my 20&#x27;s but even now few people who hear I&#x27;m trying to \\&quot;save it\\&quot; believe I need to.  </li>
            <li> i dont think he used it everyday tho.</li>
            <li> Absolutely waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking it would work as well as Rogaine, it didn&#x27;t-it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> prescription for Minoxidil in the UK is not free, and would have cost me ~£40 a month (about $65).</li>
            <li> I just cut my hair real short and when it gets worse it&#x27;s getting shaved.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle that was heavily discounted, I began applying it to my scalp 2-3 times a day by the passing of 30 days I found hair had returned to those areas</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
            <li> , I also added in a few pill supplements about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The grown hair, not only fell out, but my hairline looked worse.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using it twice a day for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product and i am extremely disappointed that even after 4 months of regularly using it twice a day, it has not even stopped hair fall, yet it promises to re-grow new hair.</li>
            <li> You may also use other B complex vitamins, green tea etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about issues with clumping and other oddities and that does happen if you have relatively thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about issues with clumping and other oddities and that does happen if you have relatively thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any red or irritation, but it would burn and itch -- very uncomfortable, especially when you need to apply is twice</li>
            <li> This generic is prolly no better or worse than the name brand.  </li>
            <li> It is tough to tell if this product works long term.</li>
            <li> I use it once per day rather than twice to minimize any ill effects it might have for a female (the &amp;#34;women&#x27;s&amp;#34; version is half strength--</li>
            <li> your hair looks pretty bad.</li>
            <li> My hair came in as it is; thin shafts of silvery grey.</li>
            <li> Balding at the ripe age of 23, I started using the minoxidil to try to slow down the process.</li>
            <li> ill try again since I still have a few bottles left.</li>
            <li> It does take approximately one hour to dry, but will not leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; after it fully dries.</li>
            <li> This is truly scentless and it makes my scalp feel tingly for a little bit after application, I HOPE this means the follicles are waking up!</li>
            <li> although lately I have been experiencing a little shedding.</li>
            <li> I am a little bummed I will never have thick flowing hair</li>
            <li> After that bottle was done I switched to the Walmart Equate brand and within 2 weeks saw hair loss and very little growth.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product bacause of past experience with it.  </li>
            <li> The equate brand didn&#x27;t do this to me, not sure what the difference is.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not</li>
            <li> The water retention went away and though my skin is dryer than usual, my skin tolerates it well.</li>
            <li> Was really skeptical before starting this product</li>
            <li> so it is possible that this rash would not necessarily be experienced by those with &amp;#34;thicker skin&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> I have been using an eyebrow brush on my eyebrows with it once, usually twice a day</li>
            <li> The weakness of the product is its cap is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> but no more losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this might help if you are thinking of using this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this product is packaged by six small plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> After stopping taking it for a few days I noticed slow improvement.</li>
            <li> A few things I have learned: do not overuse this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past two years.</li>
            <li> Has worked for me well for past 5 years of ordering it.</li>
            <li> i would get a small itches  feeling when i apply it and could feel on my finger and it work.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using the product as directed to eliminate a small bald spot.</li>
            <li> , NOT SURE</li>
            <li> I have, in the past, used the Kroger brand of Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Not sure if minoxidil is going to ruin my heart .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past four years and it does stop the loss of your hair.</li>
            <li> for men too lazy to go to the store you can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 been thinning out for the past two years</li>
            <li> The bottles seem to get a crust over time around the rim, and I&#x27;m not sure if that is supposed to happen or not.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS NOT MAGIC</li>
            <li> I find it increasingly difficult to find this product at my local Sam&#x27;s Club (their brand).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to handle this.  </li>
            <li> it did leave a weird white residue on his head and it became itchy</li>
            <li> I usually apply 0.5ml to the area and rub it around with my fingers.</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use this product as it makes you r hair thin at first ...takes ages to take effect and dropped my blood pressure.</li>
            <li> However, based on the past 3 weeks it has definately improved on decreasing hair loss which is the amount of hair I can see in my hands while shampooing in the shower.  </li>
            <li> No redeeming features.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER I do also notice a small amount of regrowth up front</li>
            <li> I can attest to this because while on vacation on the beach in July I forgot to put the usual sunscreen on my \\&quot;bald</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure that</li>
            <li> My thin hair grew, but not much.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t mean if you miss a few days here and</li>
            <li> It seems no better or worse than other generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really watery, honestly not sure if it works or not, the application process is too messy and annoying.  </li>
            <li> It made my scalp itchy which made the hair loss worse due to the urge to relieve the itching.</li>
            <li> Product is much less expensive than the other brand and has no scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The solution does make hair sticky and oily for a little while, so probably not a good idea to apply just before going out.</li>
            <li> Those are common and there is nothing to worry about usually.</li>
            <li> or at least no more so than I did with the Equate (Wal-Mart) brand I used for 9 months.</li>
            <li> used this product for just first 3 days and got to say I hate this product.</li>
            <li> I think I may have seen minimal results within the first couple of months, but what people don&#x27;t usually mention is the horrible side effects.  </li>
            <li> Be forewarned, however, that it has a lot of alcohol in it, which is what enables it to dry, but that takes all the shine out of your hair and leaves it looking dry and ugly.  </li>
            <li> I am getting the classic doughnut in the back of my head which is my worst</li>
            <li> In the shower I used to have at least a hundred hairs in my hands when I rubbed my head, now I get very few falling out.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money for me :(</li>
            <li> Its extremely annoying to apply this twice a day especially if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> No strange smell (the Rogain foam STINKS</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so hard to get the liquid version.</li>
            <li> The foam is not any easier to apply and also dries to a rock hard crust.</li>
            <li> my hair has retained and i hardly see any when i shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is hard to say yet</li>
            <li> Now, I can hardly tell there&#x27;s any thinning going on at all.</li>
            <li> However is hard to asses what would have been my state of baldness if I wouldn&#x27;t have used it.</li>
            <li> For reviewers complaining about greasiness or the fact that it is hard to apply, know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Hard to find the liquid version of 5% Minoxidil in stores.  </li>
            <li> Or get some testosterone, that will increase facial hair at least!!!</li>
            <li> , my front line also started to thin a little but using the Minoxidil</li>
            <li> I now have some hair there although it is still a little thin</li>
            <li> but it has not worked for me at least.</li>
            <li> At my age (60) and having been losing my hair since my 20&#x27;s, it may be too late for this.</li>
            <li> Costco  hasn&#x27;t had this in stock lately.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so afraid to stop as it may be keeping what hair I have left stuck to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some complained that it made their scalp itch a lot, but it didnt happen for me.</li>
            <li> gave the product to my brother-n-law who suffers from male pattern baldness.  </li>
            <li> I don’t know if that statement is encouraging or not, but at least it means that something is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only cold or tepid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m un my late sixties.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the worst case of hair loss in the world but a moderately receding hairline (I&#x27;m 20 years old).</li>
            <li> started using it regularly in my late 30s while I still had all my hair and it made it fuller.</li>
            <li> Might be too late for them</li>
            <li> I would recommend the product at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> It needs to stay on a minimum of an hour or two before it can be washed out, so it is quite inconvenient for me to use twice daily.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows are where I have seen the least result.  </li>
            <li> must stress that during this time, I haven&#x27;t lost any hair (or at least, I couldn&#x27;t notice any loss in my temples).</li>
            <li> I could give this a negative rating I would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years but haven&#x27;t seen it on the shelves lately.</li>
            <li> But I have not seen any negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyways I stopped using it for that matter &amp; ended up just cutting my hair short again.</li>
            <li> It worked for me but it didn&#x27;t work for a couple of friends but at least they let you know it will not work with everyone.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered 4 days late with Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> In theory, at least, we have nothing to lose but our hair loss and</li>
            <li> Honestly I never used it as per directions.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not uncommon, but is a bit scary and leaves the impression that it does the opposite of growing hair.  </li>
            <li> The treatment itself has just been proven ineffectual; at least for me.</li>
            <li> If I had a thick head of hair</li>
            <li> Hair grows slow, but</li>
            <li> My hair has been slowly thinning since my college days</li>
            <li> I am using it for the front of my scalp where the hair was thinning and the hairline was slowly creeping upwards.</li>
            <li> I slowly squeeze the dropper over about 10 seconds as I rub the dropper tip on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t drip all over as some people complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Took longer than I had hoped but it is slowly working for me.</li>
            <li> Granted the hair is not as thick</li>
            <li> but it seems to help slow the lose.</li>
            <li> It is slow going</li>
            <li> Beware of all the fake reviews for other products.</li>
            <li> I did use it; it was oily and itchy, but after several weeks of use it becomes slightly less annoying.</li>
            <li> But alas, I did not burn my usual bald spot.</li>
            <li> It is something ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Dont bother- seriously</li>
            <li> If you are serious about regrowing your hair, you MUST continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Within a week or so of using it I started to have a terrible time going to sleep at night and would awaken only hours later and remain awake for another 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> Only reason for 4 stars is because it gives me dandruff really bad.</li>
            <li> This product will give you E.D.  not good..</li>
            <li> it everyday without fail</li>
            <li> But then I get bored with it because it appears to do nothing but be a waste of time, so I quit.  </li>
            <li> In other words, it itches like crazy, but if you try to scratch it, you will see the gates of Hell looming before you, as it punishes you for even attempting to try to relieve some pressure off your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a week after I stopped, the rash and burns healed but left behind an ugly scaring.  </li>
            <li> but it does take an awful long time to dry.</li>
            <li> This is my first product review, I prefer not to write them but after horrible experience with this product I figured it might help someone out there..</li>
            <li> After three uses, it was painful to the point that my head stung all day long.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is weird :/</li>
            <li> For some people, the 5% version may be too weak.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that this stuff was a terrible experience from the start.</li>
            <li> IT is very hard to know if this stuff works</li>
            <li> My hair was very dull and lifeless when I started to bald</li>
            <li> This works, but very slowly.  </li>
            <li> The medication states it causes your hair to thin</li>
            <li> When I stop, they get thin again.</li>
            <li> Applying it thinly to the scalp rather than copiously helps to reduce itching.  </li>
            <li> my barber and I noticed that my hair was started to get thin.</li>
            <li> I had pressure behind the eyes and fatigue.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 6 months now.</li>
            <li> I needed to use this after medications caused my hair to thin.</li>
            <li> Gave me the worse headaches...</li>
            <li> After 2.5 years of using this and Rogaine, my thinning hair is still a secret.  </li>
            <li> However, once you stop applying it, you hair starts to thin out again.</li>
            <li> It worked really well for hair regrowth, but gave me terrible dandruff.</li>
            <li> I nothing after 4 months made my hair worse</li>
            <li> but my hunch/worry was that it wound up damaging the remaining hair follicles worse than the help that was arriving.  </li>
            <li> but my hunch/worry was that it wound up damaging the remaining hair follicles worse than the help that was arriving.  </li>
            <li> I went through my days exhausted from lack of sleep.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I am tired of this.</li>
            <li> ATE my poor scalp.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working and is the least expensive Minoxidil</li>
            <li> In 5 years, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> So it was annoying to me to have my hair dissapearing in such a hap-hazard fashion.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for approximately 8 months, and you can no longer see my scalp through my hair at the hairline.</li>
            <li> I found this to be false.</li>
            <li> That said, I hate using any minoxidil product as it takes a long time to dry,etc.</li>
            <li> It is nothing dramatic at all.</li>
            <li> i now do four things and a dramatic hair increase</li>
            <li> As the base is alcohol, rub in a&lt;br /&gt;little moisturizing cream to prevent dry scalp and dandruff.  </li>
            <li> no good ... and 3 to 5 day Prime Shipping?!  </li>
            <li> However the side effect are crazy, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> When you first start using it your head itches like crazy from the alcohol which is horrible for your skin anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disgusted with the results of this product and the stress of getting rid of the dry thick crusty area on the crown.</li>
            <li> the price is crazy expensive but it just might be helping and again it might be an expensive failure.  </li>
            <li> I thought hey I should do something while its not too late and its still not that bad.</li>
            <li> Sorry to give You a 3 star rating....</li>
            <li> Sorry, I wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> I bought this to avoid using expensive Rogaine Foam, which ran out faster than the labels claim, and switched to Minoxidol 5%</li>
            <li> kinda scary to me</li>
            <li> guess ill find out, but onew thing is forsure im not using kirkland anymore!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started getting all self-conscious and insecure about it...</li>
            <li> Rogaine is as useless as tits on a bull.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, and unfortunately it had an adverse effect.  </li>
            <li> so thats what ill be reporting about.</li>
            <li> I used minoxidil for 1 entire year, the side effects are terrible and the Effluvium after stopping it is Devasting!</li>
            <li> I feel the bottles I got were fake.</li>
            <li> it was difficult to tell if it worked.</li>
            <li> His scalp, face, ears, and neck began to itch real badly after 3 months, and his eyes got swollen and his skin was red.</li>
            <li> Will post a follow up if anything goes wrong.</li>
            <li> spray bottle and use that as your applicator rather than the silly eye-dropper.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> this goods use a wrong picture,it&#x27;s made in Israel,not Canada.the goods from  </li>
            <li> It was expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it also drastically disturbed my sleep pattern.  </li>
            <li> I know that this is fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard all the horror stories about bogus hair-loss products and was (and still am) highly skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical</li>
            <li> what am I doing wrong?</li>
            <li> Since taking this product a month ago, I have been unable to sustain an erection.</li>
            <li> Game changer!</li>
            <li> and they made me feel dizzy and caused uncomfortable headaches.</li>
            <li> but i could be wrong and find a technique.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive in name brand...</li>
            <li> For a few days it&#x27;s not too bad, but then one day I will shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> and I forget how useless it is, so I try it again ....and quit again.  </li>
            <li> Once I noticed my hair was falling out at a scary rate, I started using this again.  </li>
            <li> feeling like I was about to faint.  </li>
            <li> THe worst part is, even when you stop using it, the daily feeling of faintness continues for weeks, eventually resulting in fear of leaving home/being in an environment where you can&#x27;t lie</li>
            <li> Downside is that it is not the easiest to apply, as it is very thin and drips everywhere.</li>
            <li> My front hairline is very thin.  </li>
            <li> This is worst Product any1 could use for hair, It will damage your hair rather to protect, It develops extreme level of itching, makes scales on scalp, Highly dangerous, low Quality, worst results....  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was a bad decision because this product is not working at all .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews where raters said the product was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> After four stubborn months of using this 5% solution I&#x27;ve since switched to the 2% because I was getting a very socially awkward amount of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has saved my hair, you are driving me crazy</li>
            <li> I take it once a day with a cotton swab and wipe the thinning areas which for my are hairline (you dont have to get crazy rubbing it in just cover the area concerned crown</li>
            <li> but nothing crazy one would have to experiment.</li>
            <li> (you dont have to get crazy rubbing it in just cover the area concerned crown</li>
            <li> but nothing crazy one would have to experiment.</li>
            <li> 5 month experiment with this product get a disappointing conclusion--this product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This 5% makes my hair look &amp; feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> My head is read and peeling like it has been burned and driving me crazy with the itching.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> I used Kirkland Minoxidil for a couple of weeks and my head began to itch like crazy.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong :(</li>
            <li> Very sad that Kirkland stopped making these and now changed to Foam version as well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad until I went to the barbershop over a month ago</li>
            <li> isnt bad at all.  </li>
            <li> loss is the really bad event for a men to have in his life.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t grow head hair bad.</li>
            <li> I may just have had a bad reaction to it, but even if it is 10% of that for you it will not be something you want to experience.</li>
            <li> considering i didnt want to have this bad looking balding look</li>
            <li> However, it makes your hair look bad.</li>
            <li> The bad news is my heart rate goes up after using.</li>
            <li> The side effects were bad though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have bad dandruff again</li>
            <li> After using Minoxidil for 20 years now I have the hairline my dad had at 30, which isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> And when these attacks occur, dare you even touch one follicle of hair in the area where the Rogaine was applied, the painful scratchy sensation increases a thousand fold.</li>
            <li> Shocked since everyone said I wouldn&#x27;t until 3 months.  </li>
            <li> and I got sick of it.</li>
            <li> Sick of those hair challenged guppies?</li>
            <li> when stop die my hair , : (</li>
            <li> Desperately!</li>
            <li> Too sticky :(</li>
            <li> This is very dangerous stuff.</li>
            <li> comes up on my head surface which is absolutely annoying.</li>
            <li> Yes I know, I&#x27;m an idiot.</li>
            <li> I have been an engineer for over 20 years, and it is extremely doubtful that I would make a mistake here.</li>
            <li> Too annoying.</li>
            <li> This crap works.</li>
            <li> hate that I&#x27;ll have to continue buying and using this product, but it works.  </li>
            <li> I HATED this product.</li>
            <li> I had some very bad hair loss...</li>
            <li> The itching was very bad during the shedding period.</li>

            <li> It leaves your hair greasy and horrible looking.</li>
            <li> I accidently got a scented version of the 2% solution and the odor it gave off was horrible beyond description.</li>
            <li> Bald fish getting boring?</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from that, the substance makes your hair look terrible (For me it did).</li>
            <li> Pathetic.</li>
            <li> The worst part is you cannot stop using it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Everything is great, my dilivery arrived to my destination on the day to be delivered!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much hair growth, my books pressure went up, I&#x27;m done w it.</li>
            <li> You will grow hair every where but once u stop u will lose that hair</li>
            <li> Works really really really well!</li>
            <li> It took me a while to decide whether to try this product or not and am glad I did.  I wanted to wait until I saw growth and now that I do am ready to give my review.&lt;br /&gt;I started thinning about a year ago when the doctor switch my medication.  The medication states it causes your hair to thin but my doctor said you want to live or you want hair?  I said hair, just joking.  It wasn&#x27;t bad until I went to the barbershop over a month ago and he showed me the increasing bald spot in the back of my head. It kept getting bigger so I said I&#x27;ll give Minoxidil a try.&lt;br /&gt;It tells you in the instruction it doesn&#x27;t work for frontal baldness or thinning.  I must say it works great for me, my front line also started to thin a little but using the Minoxidil it was the first place I seen growth.  The huge bald spot in the center of my head has become very small and I figure within another month it will be gone.  I no longer have any hair in my comb.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend before purchasing any hair growth product determine what is causing your hair loss.  Always check with your doctor, it could be medications, foods, environment, etc.  In some cases nothing will bring your hair back.&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair thinning this could be the answer and even though they say it&#x27;s not for frontal use I&#x27;ve had great success with it. I know many other have too.&lt;br /&gt;Updated 2/17/2015:  My hair has grown all the way back.  No bald spot anymore and at least for me it work very well for frontal hair loss.  The only thing that is very noticeable is the itching and massive amounts of dandruff the Minoxidil creates.  I was never one to get dandruff but now it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s snowing on top of my head when I brush my hand across my hair.  But again this stuff really works and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.</li>
            <li> So far no significant results but since its same contents you find in previously used brand name, I&#x27;m satisfied with price!</li>
            <li> This product is working for me.  I&#x27;ve read reviews where raters said the product was a disappointment.  My experience is the opposite.  I&#x27;m VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> Great and with very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Can you really &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; this? It is an excellent price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, reliable and kind</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my husband.  It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than rogaine, and the reviews were about the same or better, which why we decided to try it.  It&#x27;s been nearly 2 weeks and we haven&#x27;t really seen any changes but the box does say it can take up to 3 months.  Hopefully, we will see improvement by then.  I will update in a couple of months with our findings.  Just don&#x27;t expect overnight improvement</li>
            <li> Same problem as normal rogaine: lots of flaking with drying. It&#x27;s worth it to pay a bit more for foam.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I expected from this product.  Scalp does get itchy sometimes.  Have heard complaints of scalp itching and dandruff.  Combine this minoxidil use with a good shampoo like regenpure and it should relieve some of the itch and flaking.  I have been using now for over the month and my scalp is doing pretty good.</li>
            <li> thank you for good item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now. I usually only use it once a day but occasionally use it twice a day.  It itched my scalp quite a bit at first but after a month or so I got over it and now I barely notice the itching. Even with once a day use I notice that my hair is thicker and fuller. 6 months ago I could see through the hair on the top of my head a little bit. My scalp was starting to show through my hair. I started using this product and I have definitely noticed that my hair is fuller now. I really see my scalp anymore even with bright lights in my bathrooms lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are some key things you have to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Be diligent and use it every day (I&#x27;ve only missed 3-4 days in 6 months of use).&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t shower for several hours after application to allow the product to absorb into the scalp. Using it around 6-7pm works best for me. It stays on my scalp overnight this way but gives me several hours to dry before bedtime so I don&#x27;t get it all over my pillows (It does not dry on the scalp for about 3 hours).&lt;br /&gt;3. Make sure the liquid goes directly on the scalp and use finger tips (not your nails) to gently rub into the scalp for a few seconds. This may sound like common sense but I&#x27;ve heard some people rubbing the liquid into their hair like shampoo.  Wash your hands thoroughly after application.&lt;br /&gt;4. Have patience. The scalp itch is barely noticeable to me now but in the first month or so it took a lot of will power not to scratch my head. I wanted to scratch it every couple minutes. It also takes months to see any results. I just recently started to notice how much this product was working for me after 6 months. Some people will use it for 2-4 months and then say \\&quot;this product doesn&#x27;t work for me at all\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li> for 5% Minoxidil. I usually buy this product at my local Wallyworld. A three month supply there costs slightly more than this six month supply did, and it&#x27;s exactly the same product, delivered free in four days.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 years and finally decided that all the sticky messiness just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Had to wash my hair DAILY because it was like putting &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; in my hair and made everything oily/gunky, so after the nighttime application and the morning application and another nighttime application, my hair was a fright wig.  Five months ago I just gave up. Had been told that all my hair would fall out again if I stopped using it, but so far, this has not happened.</li>
            <li> As described, Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is getting easier  with Amazon, and their business associates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can access low price, and reasonable service.</li>
            <li> The product has high quality, fast results and excellent price!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything of best !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will always be customer!&lt;br /&gt;Note 10!</li>
            <li> I really dislike using the dropper. Even when I use less the the 1.0ml on the measured dropper, it drips and runs off my head.  If I had a thick head of hair I wouldn&#x27;t have this problem, then again, I wouldn&#x27;t need this product!  I really prefer the foam Rogaine product, much easier to use and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Cheapest minoxidil available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Minoxidil for over 6 years now. I think that the CVS brand and this is the best i&#x27;ve used. I switched to rogaine foam about a year ago with the 6 month supply and after 6 months of it I felt like i lost more hair than gained. I switched back to Kirkland 6 month supply and the hair has returned and holding steady. None of these will work a miracle and regrow tons of hair, but this seems to maintain the hair I have and it definitely does give you thicker hairs.</li>
            <li> I chose this product bacause of past experience with it.  It is always dependable and does the job it is intended for.  Its stopped my hair from falling out and is showing some new growth.  I chose this seller because of their positive feedback from other users and they certainly didn&#x27;t disappointment me.  I will continue to use them as long as they offer this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it does exactly what it claims, regrows hair. I would strongly recommend it to anyone whose hair is thinning. It has the same major active  ingredient as the more expense brand, but cost far less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a noobie, this is the first hair treatment I buy and the seller did not put enough information.  THIS TREATMENT IS ONLY FOR THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.  My main problem is in the front so it&#x27;s not what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel deceived and thinking about returning it.</li>
            <li> Minoxidil is minoxidil so the product itself is fine  I&#x27;d rather open the mailbox than drive to the store to buy it, especially at an equivalent price..  It actually works for me because I rub in a drop or two of Retin A before applying.</li>
            <li> Been purchasing Kirkland Minoxidil for several years. Seems to help.</li>
            <li> This product does its job, but boy does it set my scalp on fire. I will literally wake up on the middle of the night clawing at my head. This isn&#x27;t a light tingle, this is a scratch your head til you bleed kind of itch. I will say that my hair has grown back quite well, but I cannot continue to use this product. Shame, I&#x27;ve got 5 months of the stuff left. The equate brand didn&#x27;t do this to me, not sure what the difference is.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, came as exactly as described. Recommended</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it. This is also at a great price!</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;- I used it in combination with Propecia, and it reversed my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;- Reasonably priced (unlike Propecia)&lt;br /&gt;- No strange smell (the Rogain foam STINKS, this stuff is odorless)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- It makes my scalp itch a little bit, and if I scratch, I get this stuff on my hands and have to wash it off&lt;br /&gt;- After applying in the morning, I have to use a towel to dry off my hair or else this stuff will ma it down and make it look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;br /&gt;Buy this instead of the Rogaine foam.  It&#x27;s the same active ingredient, it&#x27;s cheaper, and it is odorless.  If you have the money, combine with Propecia for best results.</li>
            <li> Great price and see hair already</li>
            <li> Good product. Satisfied!</li>
            <li> Competitive, price could be lower</li>
            <li> I got free delivery, but this time delivery was from UPS. Nobody is home, so after final attempt, the product gets returned immediately. Why does this company requires signature?&lt;br /&gt;This review is just for delivery issue.&lt;br /&gt;For product review, I just say that it helps build hair volume in the morning .&lt;br /&gt;For late stage baldness, you won&#x27;t see any significant hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;It is pain to use it everyday, who have the time to methodically apply it ?&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are just in your 30s, and you are so conscious about it, like I was...&lt;br /&gt;But what aging can do is that after you get some age, you don&#x27;t really care too much about how your hair  look. People know very well that you are not in your 30s anymore HAHA.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing to hide, and I am not embarrassed, and it was never about the bs talk about lost confidence.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you now that this is effective against hair loss but I am sure it never dries once one applies it into their scalp! It is something ridiculous. It does not dries for hours! You have to use a piece of paper though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOST MORE THAN U$ 20,00!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Read and make your decision carefully! Do your research!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product only works temporarily and increases the rate of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost a lot of hair due to taking the gamble that this product would work, it did not work for me. I am extremely confident I would have a lot more hair if I did not use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did use it; it was oily and itchy, but after several weeks of use it becomes slightly less annoying. I really am not sure how anyone can use this stuff and maintain a normal life. My hair was greasy and oily near my scalp from the application. It doesn&#x27;t just go on and dry, it goes on and beads up and tries to roll around your head. After several weeks of use, my hair loss increased, but I never saw any regrowth. I continued using the product for several more weeks all the while being very anxious and nervous and irritated that I may have caused an increase of balding which I did not intend. I discontinued use of the product and would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Individual results vary, I would say it is not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Great value but in case women are considering buying this, I do NOT recommend this for women.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but takes a long time. I started taking it with Mynoxidrin [[ASIN:B00Q5KMX5O Mynoxidrin - Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Formula Nourishes and Strengthens Thinning Hair and Promotes Hair Growth!]] and my hair growth really accelerated! Adding the mynoxidrin really seemed to thicken my hair and make it healthier also.</li>
            <li> No problems, came as ordered</li>
            <li> i was using Rogaine and it was working amazingly , but the big difference in the price between Rogaine and Kirkland made me switch to Kirkland . Unfortunately it was a bad decision because this product is not working at all .</li>
            <li> A great product for a cheap price</li>
            <li> Leaves hair VERY greasy. And even after washing it still stays very greasy. I was hoping it would be a great cheaper alternative to rogain but I was wrong :(</li>
            <li> As usual, Kirkland offers best price, fastest shipping. Used for several years. Product is very effective.</li>
            <li> Cheapest I have been able to find minoxidil.  I have a friend who works at Johnson &amp; Johnson who gets a great discount on Rogaine.  This product is still cheaper after her discount.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> As promised.  I appreciate offering this product online.  I&#x27;m a Costco member and they don&#x27;t carry the liquid anymore.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s workinh</li>
            <li> Sorry to give You a 3 star rating....but it has not worked for me at least. I may have to try a 10% concentration but I have not found a supplier yet. One thing I have to mention is that Amazon and the Kirkland supplier were excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The order came exactly as they said it would....100% satisfaction !!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a month now. I have &amp;#34;diffuse thinning&amp;#34;, so not 100% sure if this will work for me say for a guy that is crowning on top. So far I can&#x27;t definitively say it is working for me. To be determined.</li>
            <li> I just got the product yesterday, initially I was a bit unsure about using it constantly during the day time because it made my hair  extra greasy and thin looking. I only needed to apply on my hairline so the &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; from the product was really noticeable from the front.&lt;br /&gt; But I have figured out a way to work around this problem, it&#x27;s to apply the product with a cotton pad, what I do now is squeeze 0.5~1 ml on the corner of a cotton pad, separate my hair to show the scalp, then either rub or pat the cotton pad on the scalp while avoiding getting the product on hair like the way people put gel on their hair, the point is only targeting the scalp and the root of the hair. Then I squeeze out the remaining product from the cotton pad on my finger and rub only on the scalp. Finally, I brush my hair left and right, while avoid touching my scalp at all, then brush it toward the front, the point from doing that is to spread the product around with my dry hair so it&#x27;s not as greasy only on one area.&lt;br /&gt;At night, I just rub the product in with my fingers, or repeat the day time routine if I have to see people. Though one thing to note is that the product does eventually dries out, but takes a really long time.</li>
            <li> No results, used it for 7 months, nothing, still shredding lots of hair daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years without missing a day. I&#x27;m in my 20s and started loosing my hair but this product put a stop to my hair loss. I bought the product very conscious that it was not going to work miracles. I just wanted to postpone the hair loss and that&#x27;s what it did .</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working good, the delivery took a while.</li>
            <li> Way better off getting the real thing.  Used both and there is a substantial difference between the two.  Bought this off brand since the other was no longer on sale.</li>
            <li> No effect,don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
            <li> cant expect this to work in 1 day, 1 week, or even 1 month , can take up to a year to start getting results but is one of the only solutons. It does have a once you pop you cant stop kind of rule so be prepared to be in it for the long term, used to cost 30 bucks a month form other companies but 25 bucks for half a year isnt bad at all.  use with dermaroller</li>
            <li> I always used to buy this at the local store but when I saw the price of this I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Definitely lowers the cost of keeping what you have.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the deal with this stuff, it works for most men. That being said you need to apply it 2X a day every day for the rest of your life to keep your hair. Using it for a month or three months you probably will not notice any results. You need to be as consistent as possible with this if you miss an application or a day every few weeks you&#x27;ll be fine but try and make it a routine in the morning and before you go to bed. Although this is only proven to work on the back portion of the scalp (I just have a thinning hair line) I still see results but not everyone will. Give it time and be patient. The biggest problems most people complain about is flaking scalp or shedding of hair. Those are common and there is nothing to worry about usually. Just be consistent with it and don&#x27;t expect results overnight or even in a month. If you work where you sweat a lot you may want to consider other options because when sweat on your head then you are basically sweating the product right off and it can&#x27;t do its job. I have gone with the name brand product and the generic brand and they all work just as good as the other but some people will say otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of a six-month supply of Kirkland minoxidil. At my age (60) and having been losing my hair since my 20&#x27;s, it may be too late for this. Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve been using the Kirkland Minoxidil combined with generic Propecia, and I believe I&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement. Given the low cost of both medications, I have almost nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to start out on this for the first time, take photographs of your hair from the front, back, sides and top so you&#x27;ll know for sure. I really regret not doing that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this on my my frontal lobe almost every night before I go to bed and washing it out in the morning (thus 6 month supply &#x3D; 1 year supply). It doesn&#x27;t necessarily regrow lost hair but rather helps hair from falling out easily. I can definitely see a change and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product once a day for years.  It does help with my post menopausal hair loss. It is very inexpensive and works just as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Okay. Application can be messy.</li>
            <li> I bought this about six month ago ... It has been working well and it didn&#x27;t have any problem. I guess it was a good deal! ... It worked for my hair ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year now; the one meant for women was not working; ... my dermatologist gave me the o.k. to use the men&#x27;s version; warned that it might cause unwanted facial hair, but otherwise no health risks.  (So far I&#x27;m not eligible to audition for a part in a &amp;#34;planet of the apes&amp;#34; sequel&amp;#34;!)  I am very pleased with the product thus far; my barber has commented on how my hair has gotten fuller on top; I&#x27;m somewhat disheartened that it doesn&#x27;t appear to be getting any fuller on the sides.  Other than that, the only drawback is it&#x27;s causing my hair to get a yellowish tint; anybody experience this?? Any suggestions to combat it? Otherwise it&#x27;s a choice of being blond or bald .. I choose blond!</li>
            <li> This is the second time purchasing this product and I have been pleasantly surprised by the results.My hair-loss has stopped and my confidence has increased. I originally asked my physician for a hair-loss solution and he told me that most of his patients saw results with minoxidil and believe me,I was reluctant....but now I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> Great price, same product as Rogaine</li>
            <li> As I imagined it, good product.  Only 5 stars instead of 6, because the 5% topical leaves the hair a bit dull, but this was mentioned in the pamphlet, no surprise to me.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was superfast - only 2 days.  Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> It is what it is. Hopefully you already know what Minoxidil is. While it may not regrow hair for all, if most probably will slow down the loss of hair for most At least on the vertex, top, of the head, the only location for which it is advertised to work. That is my experience. The local Costco quit selling the liquid a while back in favor of the foam. Based on many testimonials and tests the foam is easier to use, but not as effective, and definitively has to be used twice a day. The liquid has a reputation for lasting 24 hours. It does appear that this supplier has a source of fresh Kirkland labelled Minoxidil. The box appears to be exactly like the one I got at Costco previously. As purchased in February 2015, the expiration date embossed on the bottom of the package says 08 2016.</li>
            <li> for those who say its not meant for the front, it still works. im seeing little hairs come up and turn dark and stay. and they keep coming. this is just great, it doesnt ich all that much and when it does people do not scratch at all this is the healing, tap you head with something, . here is a way to save. this is the same thing as rogain foam. i went from 60 dollars in spending bill for hair to 25 dollars for the entire thing. now i have hair growing back constantly. people double down ,which is good, i do just the same. i use 2ml at a time but let it dry before i do the next. i still haven&#x27;t tried this with a triple up of something else, which is what lots of people do for their hair. for the vortex, im seeing hairs and less bald spots. but to be honest i&#x27;ve seen faster results to the front, from the widows peak on the sides and front to just past that part of the hair line. what ever is falling out is being replaced within 2 weeks and i have to say less. i&#x27;ll buy this again because it works and its cheaper in the long run than buying this and rogain. please stop and buy.</li>
            <li> AS Usual, on-time, great product</li>
            <li> Kirkland is the signature brand of Costco, perhaps the best store in the US&lt;br /&gt;(or in the very top).  The price for these is unbeatable, as far as I can see,&lt;br /&gt;so, yes, five stars for this purchase.</li>
            <li> Have used the 2% for years, and although I feel it helped me not lose as much hair, due to heredity factors, since switching to this 5% formula, i&#x27;m actually seeing a lot more new growth!</li>
            <li> Generic version of rogaine.</li>
            <li> As described and good deal</li>
            <li> Since enough people have told me that the mild bald spot at the top-back of my head has receded, including my barber, I&#x27;ll say it works. The only way I can see it is if I have two mirrors. If the area being treated gets irritated or starts to hurt, give the product a rest for a day or two. Use a good conditioner like Jason Thin to Thick conditioner for fuller hair as well. Takes a few months to notice anything, and once you stop using it you&#x27;re bald spot will return inasmuch time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lifetime commitment but still cheaper than a visit to the hair club for men. I think that once you reach a certain age, you just don&#x27;t give a shitake mushroom anymore. My only gripe is that if you use it religiously it can really dry out your scalp and make it itchy, hence the use of a good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And guys: washing your hair everyday is not doing you any favors. You can still shower and not put your hair through the ringer every day. Or just rinse your hair without using shampoo. If you do use a shampoo, use Jason Shampoo and Jason Conditioner as well. Something gentle. Both are sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this product is the best out there.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this miracle potion for the last three months, no itchy scalp or pain or redness...I went from Fester to Elvis in one swoop of the dropper, no lie my hair was thinning in back bad and also thinning in the front and top..I use it twice a day and not only has it stopped hair loss but has grown back an incredible amount of new hair...no visible bald spot in back and I now sport a full popadore! highly reccomended! cheap too...</li>
            <li> Great product! Getting very satisfactory results at a more reasonable price! Highly recommend it to all of my friends! Suggest anyone that has spots where hair is not what it should be get some!</li>
            <li> Male pattern baldness runs in my family so I am 22 years old and started using this about a year ago to try to take on genetics.  I apply 1.0mL twice daily with no exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as applying the product: I draw up the amount with the provided dropper and apply a few drops to my scalp, rub it in, apply the rest.  I keep my hair really short, so there&#x27;s no mess, however I have used it before with longer hair, and it&#x27;s a mess.  Longer hair is matted down while the product dries.  The stuff takes literally 4 hours to dry, and after that is can be brushed out of your hair with a comb / your hand.  It is MUCH easier to deal with in short hair.  Also, it itches like hell.. and every time you scratch your scalp, if you have longer hair you get some on your fingers and you have to wash your hands.. if you don&#x27;t you get that sticky film stuck to your fingers all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: after a year, i have seen no hair loss (my mother&#x27;s father started losing his hair at 22).  Looking at some of the clinical trials of Rogaine, this product will not regrow hair, but users will not lose any more hair than they already have with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since generics of Rogaine are proven to the FDA to be the same functional molecule,  this product is the cheapest per unit volume of minoxidil that you can find, so I would highly recommend it... the only detractors are the whole \\&quot;will regrow hair\\&quot; thing that is false (will only prevent loss) and the itch / mess.</li>
            <li> Miracle product for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years.  You have to use it consistently and not stop for it to work.</li>
            <li> Does not work... will try the foam smh</li>
            <li> Started using twice a day and washing once a day with Regenepure DR Scalp Treatment anti Hair Loss and Dandruff Shampoo topical with Ketoconazole also sold on Amazon.  My hair feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using for a week so it is too early to tell what effect it will have on hair growth.  I wash my hair in the morning and towel dry.  I put on in the morning with my hair wet.  I put the dropper directly on my scalp and zig zag from front to back.  I then massage it in.  I then put on so gel and style wet.  Once dry ( about and hour) I run my fingers through and it looks great, not greasy.  It is greasy though first going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, if after the gym I shower again and repeat.  If I dont shower, I just reapply.  Very easy to use.  Does not have an odor.  Time will tell if it really works.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried this product more than once and for me it has proven to do what it is supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;So, as far as I&#x27;m concerned it does the job.</li>
            <li> Ok so here&#x27;s the lowdown. Its extremely annoying to apply this twice a day especially if you have long hair. If you have short hair after you apply use this to style your hair also in place of a wax for a very natural looking hold. You will lose hair at about 4 months and your hair will look worse then in about a year you will have regrown that plus more. I have been using for 4 years and when i stopped i lost all the regrown hair. Now that i have restarted i went through the initial shedding and regrowth has begun. This isn&#x27;t an instant fix but it does work if you take the time to use it properly. My hair loss is in the middle of my scalp and this regrew hair despite claims it only works on the vertex as i apply to my whole scalp on top all the way to the front. If you have really heavy hair loss this might not do much but is worth a try. Hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> Listen, you are either a minoxidil responder or you aren&#x27;t. This product has no oil in it. The solent is propylene glycol. It clearly states in the instructions to use several hours before you go to bed to avoid pillow staining. If it bother you that much, buy the foam. This product is cheap and it has worked wonders for me. I&#x27;ll def be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try in hopes of saving a few bucks over the regular Rogaine brand name (foam) product.  Unfortunately, I have to give this only two stars because of the way it makes my hair sticky and almost never seems to dry out.  It reminds me of a hair gel that gives you that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look and seems oily.  I even tried putting it on at night and drying it with a blow dryer but I didn&#x27;t like that either.  I don&#x27;t know if it works like the regular Rogaine brand name product or not because I couldn&#x27;t stand the feeling in my hair long enough to wait months to see if it worked.  Sorry, I wanted to like this product but it&#x27;s not for me.  Hope it works for you if you decide to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It is a goodd deal for the price, but the scalp itches a lot.If you can bear the itchiness, then you can go for it. Apart from that your hair will fall more initially. This is not due to Kirkland Minoxidil, it will happen with any minoxidil, any brand.</li>
            <li> Good price and it&#x27;s a liquid. The foam version otherwise available puts more stuff in your hair than on your scalp. Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so hard to get the liquid version.</li>
            <li> I bought this to avoid using expensive Rogaine Foam, which ran out faster than the labels claim, and switched to Minoxidol 5% and I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my receding hair line to see if the product would actually bring some hair back and it HAS!!!! My thinning hair line has come back and I see hair sprouting more and more.&lt;br /&gt;Just got to be patient and wait for the results is the drawback.</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time. Too early to see results. Will post updates.</li>
            <li> I was using lipogaine for about 3 months and was noticing my hair beginning to grow back but i lost my job so i got this stuff to hold me over til i could get back on lipogaine unless of course it worked just as well. After the first month instead of hair growing back i was losing a crazy amount of hair...as in lightly rubbing my hair back and forth and 10 times over a magazine i counted over 150 hairs..kinda scary to me cuz i thought that my hair was finally coming back! Noooooo! I also heard that lipogaine stopped using azelic acid now so i might be screwed!? guess ill find out, but onew thing is forsure im not using kirkland anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 2 stars only because of the price and the fact that it goes on clear unlike lipogaine which is yellow and stands out more but it does take an awful long time to dry. I stopped using it so my review is based on the first maybe 2 months of using it after 3-4 months of lipogaine so the risk is yours. I will say lipogaine worked great after the early stages of weird face rash and more hair loss. The choice is yours!</li>
            <li> Affordable and works to KEEP your existing hair. If you&#x27;re lucky, you may have regrowth back on top with peach fuzz near your temples, but DON&#x27;T stop using it or your hair will rapidly fall after a month or so of discontinuation... Which happened to me after becoming lazy. Now I&#x27;m back, using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not but I got severe itching just like everyone else. I felt drowsy but I didn&#x27;t know that the product can cause that. I&#x27;m stopping using it. I don&#x27;t feel good about keep using it honestly.</li>
            <li> this guy gave me almost expire product . i will never buy form this company . thanks for your expire product .</li>
            <li> The product works well. This is the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> I HATED this product. I bought with the recommendation that it could be used on the front part of your head. However, that is absolutely not the case. After putting the solution in your hair (2x a day) you can&#x27;t do anything! It leaves your hair greasy and horrible looking. I thought that it would be worth it though, so I continued to use the product. After 4 weeks I noticed considerable hair loss on my pillow, more so than before. I immediately stopped taking the product, and after 3 days it went back to normal. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have used the kirkland brand minoxidil off and on for a year. When I started my hair was thinning due to Nioxin shampoo (don&#x27;t use unless already bald). So I was not sure at first that it really worked until several months after I stopped using it my hair line in the front was starting to thin a lot. Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my meds or just my genes so I started using kirkland minoxidil again, and in a month my hair came back in the thinning parts. Now you can&#x27;t tell my hair is thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the box says that this product will only work on the top of the head and not in the front. I found this to be false. Its the only place I had an issue with thinning hair and it came back 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that with a cheaper price (vs. Rogaine) you have to use the solution instead of the foam. Don&#x27;t know why kirkland has not made a foam yet when they make everything from baby formula to alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, it cant hurt what you have already lost.</li>
            <li> I put off using this for years, but finally gave it a shot.  Glad I did as it actually works.  This is a much cheaper way to use it than buying the name brand.</li>
            <li> An excellent product with amazing results. Highly recommended for falling and thinning hair. Tried many other hair lotions without any significant results. Nothing works better than Minoxidil.The one and only hair product that really works.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and buying it in a multi-month quantity makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li> Side effect: some scalp itching</li>
            <li> good article and price,  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Amazon should have indicated at time of purchase that product is NOT applicable for a receding hairline&lt;br /&gt;so the product is in my medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> Probably just me and not the product.  The extra strength at least for me was a mistake.  I should have started out with the 2% strength.  The 5% strength caused my scalp to itch and I had to stop using it before I used even a quarter of the first bottle.</li>
            <li> They really work, I jusr ordered wrong product b c I needed foam one not solution</li>
            <li> Good price, good product!</li>
            <li> Product works good for me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month for the front of my hairline and widow&#x27;s peak.  I can see small new hairs starting to grow where they was none before.  Money well spent for some head fertilizer!</li>
            <li> I was buying Rogaine for a while spending a lot of money every month. Then my dermatologist told me to buy generic and honestly I think it’s even  better than the name brand stuff. I’ve only been using it for 2 months and already seeing my hair getting thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> Less greasy than the foam, and easier to apply to areas that still have hair without making the area oily and limp.</li>
            <li> I had some very bad hair loss...it took some time, but I think I will put my wig away.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year now and my hair was growing back in.  I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Not up to par with other brands. Got scabs on scalp (not too severe).  p</li>
            <li> Great Products, worked fine with me, using the same brand for over a year, you will not see any effect unit a year and after that you should start comparing, take a picture today and compere it next year then you will see the different, used to buy this from Costco($45) no more .... thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high hopes.  I had to quit using it after the second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied it it caused a redness in the area of application that turned to peeling my skin later.  I decided maybe it&#x27;s because my skin isn&#x27;t used to it.  A day later...everything seemed back to normal, so I tried it one more time.  BIG MISTAKE...it caused an actual chemical burn that was extremely severe and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> My son is losing his hair and since trying this product, it seems to be working.  This makes him a lot happier and more confident about himself.</li>
            <li> I am 22 and have been losing hair since the age of 21. There was no such patch but the hair were receding at a good rate. I ordered this product and i am extremely disappointed that even after 4 months of regularly using it twice a day, it has not even stopped hair fall, yet it promises to re-grow new hair. 4 months is a good time to show some results. If you have not bought this product and you are having hair fall, then i would certainly not recommend it. It is totally ineffective product. Neither it stopped hair fall nor does it regrow new hair. It is a waste of precious time and money !! I am completely unsatisfied !!</li>
            <li> when stop die my hair , : (</li>
            <li> I bought this after reviewing others comments. The add is not clearing it&#x27;s ONLY FOR VERTEX, after I have applied this to thinning hair area on my head,  specially on the vertex, some white staff, similar to dandruff comes up on my head surface which is absolutely annoying. On the other hand, I have notice more hair on the tub than before after application of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the good thing about this product is that it is cheaper than other products, and as I read through its description it has pretty much similar ingredients as Rogain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommended it for anyone.</li>
            <li> First thing to do: Change your shower filter every six months. Get rid of chlorine and chemicals that cause hair to fall out faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it work for me? Yes, so far? Will it work for you? I have no idea, but this 6-month supply will give you your answer at a bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my doctor and he said that yes, indeed, Minoxidil (generic Rogaine) will grow back hair on some people. Seeing this bargain price and noting that this item takes time to work, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. It comes in (6) 2 oz. bottles, each with a dropper. You slowly drip one ml of fluid on your scalp or the Vertex, which is the top back section of your head. Do this once in the morning and once in the evening noting that it takes 2-4 hours to dry. What? Yes, it&#x27;s mildly sticky, like fresh hairspray. I use one finger to dab it around my scalp. I even tried placing a little in the front above my temples where I am receding. I found I have to carefully comb out my hair and it looks like it might be slightly wet. It maintains its stickiness for a few hours. I didn&#x27;t care for that part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: At exactly three months now, I can see ¼&amp;quot; to ½&amp;quot; hairs growing on my Vertex (nothing in front, as Kirkland readily says). My hair came in as it is; thin shafts of silvery grey. It is nothing dramatic at all. But there is defintely no hair loss as well. I&#x27;ll continue to use this for 6 months and see how much growth I can achieve. Kirkland does say that if not used, your hair recession will begin again after three months. For the price, it&#x27;s worth it considering that Men&#x27;s Rogaine Foam-Rogaine Hair Regrowth Treatment, 6/2.11 oz. cans (6 Month Supply) costs twice as much for six months. I&#x27;d be wiser to go to the gym more often. Also, someone mentioned that it is poisonous to pets and my cat likes to sneak up on my work chair and lick my hair. I&#x27;d still recommend trying it and reading all the reviews you can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has now been six months of regular daily use of Minoxidil. I suspect I have reached my threshold. I am no longer losing my hair, that is clear. However, I do not see any new growth since around three to four months. The circular pattern that predates the male pattern baldness on my vortex has disappeared and the &#x27;ring-like&#x27; appearance has diffused into the rest of my hair. No doubt this is a big improvement over six months ago. There is also no new growth in the front near my temples as is stated on the product. However, I continued to use up the 6-month supply and made my final decision. I still think for the price and the results, this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has now passed the nine month mark and I can safely say that no new hairs are growing and no more are leaving. I seem to have reached a plateau. If I were to stop now, I would probably start to lose hair within three months, but this item is so relatively inexpensive, I am going to continue with it. A short haircut also helps, oddly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It has now been a year. I can say that my hair is about the same as it was after 3 months - no better, no worse. I am sure if I stopped, the recession would continue, but I am so damn vain!ular daily use of Minoxidil. I suspect I have reached my threshold. I am no longer losing my hair, that is clear. However, I do not see any new growth since around three to four months. The circular pattern that predates the male pattern baldness on my vortex has disappeared and the &#x27;ring-like&#x27; appearance has diffused into the rest of my hair. No doubt this is a big improvement over six months ago. There is also no new growth in the front near my temples as is stated on the product. However, I continued to use up the 6-month supply and made my final decision. I still think for the price and the results, this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has now passed the nine month mark and I can safely say that no new hairs are growing and no more are leaving. I seem to have reached a plateau. If I were to stop now, I would probably start to lose hair within three months, but this item is so relatively inexpensive, I am going to continue with it. A short haircut also helps, oddly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It has now been a year. I can say that my hair is about the same as it was after 3 months - no better, no worse. I am sure if I stopped, the recession would continue, but I am so damn vain!</li>
            <li> turn my scalp itchy and red..  Discontinued and started using Rogaine and that works fine form is better</li>
            <li> I am only 1 month in to this product and have noticed that my crown is accumulating extra hair - I don&#x27;t want to speak too soon but I believe I found the right substance, I&#x27;ve used rogain in the past and that didn&#x27;t help. Just make sure you are consistent in your application cycles - and your die pattern.</li>
            <li> Perfect thank you just what .&lt;br /&gt;I need!</li>
            <li> This product is less than 1/2 the price of Rogain and it has produced new hair growth that continues to grow.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it very long but it seems to be effective</li>
            <li> Was pleased with product and will be a repeat customer. I received my purchase in a timely manner and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Best deal out there - doesn&#x27;t make your hair as stick as foam.  Costco  hasn&#x27;t had this in stock lately.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 month already and so far no changes whatsoever. 5 more months to go to have a more accurate assessment</li>
            <li> Kirkland Minoxidil seems to be okay...I have tried Rogaine and CVS so far and this one seems to be comparable and okay...when the price is taken into account I prefer Kirkland over them...it has a light scent though...</li>
            <li> After 3 months of treatment, my hair is now almost \\&quot;normal\\&quot; , no visible white zones anymore. Minoxidil works really. However the side effect is that it is very itchy , i am always scratching my head from a few weeks ... if this continues, i wonder if i abandon the product ...</li>
            <li> My husband is still losing his hair but he seems to need to keep trying this product.</li>
            <li> I put this on my beard. Yes I know, I&#x27;m an idiot. But to much suprise it worked... I grew hair in spots where I normally was not growing it. Very slowly baby hairs began to form and eventually grew into proper beard hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product (which leaves sticky residue in my hair, but seems fairly effective in preventing further hair loss) for 3-4 yr.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuneately in my last two orders most of the &#x27;press down and turn&#x27; safety caps are DEFECTIVE, impossible to open, even with tools.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly the seller has obtained a large shipment of &#x27;seconds&#x27; which they are pawning off on their customers.</li>
            <li> good product at a good pric</li>
            <li> I initially started on the equate version of minoxidil. The equate version is a little thicker and much more oily upon application; I am assuming from the PPG to Alcohol mixture. Kirklands mixture of minoxidil is a little more runny and less oily compared to that of equate. This product does work for me. I am 25 years old with first signs of Androgenic Alopecia. My hairline receded to almost a NW2 but this product saved it! I use this product in conjunction with some others to manifest my results but I have to say minoxidil especially the Kirkland brand has deemed the work horse in reviving my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it like I was supposed to and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Best price, quick delivery, and as long as you follow the directions that come with it;  it will continue to fill in an area as long as you use it. It may even return some hair color too.</li>
            <li> I follow the recommended usage and it seems to work as good as other similar products in reducing the loss of hair, but not regrowing it...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years. I can honestly say this product has stalled any additional hair loss. Also I&#x27;ve seen some hair regrowth. The ticket to success with this is to apply twice daily faithfully and use a good quality shampoo (Nioxin 2). Oh yeah, a good diet helps alot too. I make sure I eat good proteins to build my scalp and hair strength.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in October 2014 and made a commitment to use it faithfully for 1 year. I was discouraged as a post menopausal woman with my thinning hair in front. I persevered and finally at month 9 I noticed a definite thickness was back and my scalp was much less noticeable. I will definitely continue with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hope that it does what it claims and it does. After just 1 1/2 months I noticed small hairs starting to grow on my head.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, but after one month of using this product, I have tons of these little short hairs coming in up front.  I was starting to thin out, and I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair was looking.  It&#x27;s pattern baldness.  I have it on my crown too.  I can&#x27;t really see back/up there, but it must be filling in back there too.  But in the front, OMG!  I&#x27;m so relieved and happy.  It&#x27;s been a lot of anticipation, determination and wondering, but the proof is there.  It&#x27;s undeniable...  The stuff really works!  It seems like it takes forever.  Hair grows slow, but then eventually...  Tah Dah!</li>
            <li> This product causes my scalp itch to a degree that I never knew was humanly possible. Literally it&#x27;s like the itch demon fairy princess from hell came and was digging into your scalp with an \\&quot;itch-wand\\&quot; that has needles at its ends dabbed with poison. I kid you not. This doesn&#x27;t occur right when I put it on, but I&#x27;ll get itch attacks during the day. And when these attacks occur, dare you even touch one follicle of hair in the area where the Rogaine was applied, the painful scratchy sensation increases a thousand fold. In other words, it itches like crazy, but if you try to scratch it, you will see the gates of Hell looming before you, as it punishes you for even attempting to try to relieve some pressure off your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I keep using it? I don&#x27;t know... I can honestly say my mental ability to stay laser focused has increased n-th fold as I am getting my daily practice during these itch-attacks. My hair in the front looks pretty good, but it in the back, not so much. . . Until I get a wife, I think I will keep using it, and then shock her as soon as I drop the Minoxidil after we get married. She&#x27;ll be stuck to me anyhow. . . .</li>
            <li> I just ordered another 2-year supply, as my previous 2-year supply was just about finished.  \\&quot;Rogaine\\&quot; is simply the trade name for Minoxidil.  And Minoxidil is Minoxidil.  So you can get 2 years of Extra Strength (5%) Minoxidil for about $100 (4 quantities of the 6-month supply), and not have to worry about the expiration dates.  That&#x27;s $50/year.  A great value.</li>
            <li> Kirkland seems to carry a very wide variety of products and Minoxidil is one of the products I find to be both economical and useful. I have been using it for several years now and even at my age (65+) it works quite well. Buying through Amazon is both a pleasant and money saving experience.Although it is not recommended for people of my age and there is little data on the effects for older men, I found this product to both stop hair loss and add more thickness to my thinning hair. I can only say that it works for me. I also recommend the 5% solution for maximum effect. There seems to be many other companies that sell the same products, but I found Kirkland to be very reliable and their products to be of premium quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rubbing this stuff onto my balding noggin&#x27; for about 5 years now. I don&#x27;t see any results but I&#x27;m so afraid to stop as it may be keeping what hair I have left stuck to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Golden Years!!  Ya, Right!!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive...does it work? I dunno. I don&#x27;t know how fast I would normally be losing hair.  The only way I&#x27;d really know is if I stop using it. I&#x27;m not going to stop using it to find out.</li>
            <li> Covergirl&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product which I advised everone to buy. I gave four starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;being reviewed</li>
            <li> This has prevent my from going bald as far as I know. I will recommend it!</li>
            <li> Used this product with success for 6 months then my scalp starting to get very irritated so I have had to stop.  Maybe I can use the 2 percent one after my scalp heals completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update as of 1/10/13.  I started using the same product after about 3 months layoff and had good results.  I have since stopped using for several months now because my hair is doing well and I want to see if I can do without it.  I use it on my eyebrows regularly and it helps them to fill in. When I stop, they get thin again.</li>
            <li> I bought a 6 months supply, and started noticing that each bottle was disappearing in well less than a month, so I wrote the date on the bottle to find out.  It lasted about 3 weeks.  Because the dose is 1mL twice daily and there are 60mL in the bottle, that is 30 days.  So either the bottle does not contain 60mL or the dropper is incorrectly graduated.  This is either fraud or incompenance - take your pick.  Regardless, YOU are getting ripped off if you buy this.  I have been an engineer for over 20 years, and it is extremely doubtful that I would make a mistake here.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to have different preferences and results.  I was reluctant to buy this because the reviews rave over the foam.  I started with foam and then switched to this.  Not only is this more cost effective, I felt the results were better, simply because this is directly applied to the scalp, whereas I was never sure if the foam was ever penetrating my existing hair.  Lastly, the eye dropper tells you exactly how much to use, but with the foam, you have to make your best guess if you&#x27;re using the recommended amount.  I will stick to this.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for products but I HAVE to for this thing. I&#x27;m 24 years old and my hair had thinned a lot in the last 1-2 years. This year it got to a point where it started getting really noticeable when I would look in the mirror. I started getting all self-conscious and insecure about it...I know \\&quot;boo hoo\\&quot; but seriously it wasn&#x27;t a good feeling. I bought a 3 month supply of Kirkland Minoxidil 5% thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try since the price was reasonable compared to Rogaine. Well I&#x27;m almost at the end of my third month and all I can say is that I am amazed at how well this stuff is working. Like some of the other reviews stated, you start noticing an increase in hair loss after about the first 2 weeks to 1 month of use but after 2-3 weeks the extra hair loss stops. When the hair loss starts (although its freaky) its a good sign...its your head telling you that the stuff is working - pretty much out with the old (bad hair) and in with the new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2.5 months my family and I have noticed a huge difference in the thickness of my hair. I actually didnt tell anyone that I using anything on my hair until my mom commented on how thick my hair looked! I then told her I was using this stuff and it&#x27;s helped a lot. You cannot see ANY of my scalp through my hair now!!! So exciting. I&#x27;m going to buy another 6 month supply just to make sure I get as much as I can out of this stuff and then probably stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that if you&#x27;re considering this and you&#x27;re catching you&#x27;re hair loss early on...USE THIS STUFF. Its AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It worked wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None for me. Some complained that it made their scalp itch a lot, but it didnt happen for me. My scalp itched some but nothing Head n&#x27; Shoulders didnt take care of.</li>
            <li> Short dated but good.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my husband and her loves it and so do i. we noticed a huge deference in his beard area. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and it has really helped. Gone from a small bold spot on the crown to just a thin spot. In the front I was really thin, and now it barely noticeable. The instructions say its only for the crown but research has shown. It works on the front for 50% of men.  Note this stuff is FDA approved to treat hair loss. And that means they have proven it work and showed that proffered the the FDA. That means alot. Tue girl who cuts my hair thought I got on the prescription pill. But this stuffs much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a six-month trial period starting last September. The first couple times I used it, it was mildly irritating on my scalp, but that went away quickly. The application itself is a bit of a pain; you have to do it twice daily, and you use the dropper and gently rub it into the thin/balding areas, and if you&#x27;re not careful it will drip (it has an oily texture, so definitely DON&#x27;T apply it less than a couple hours before you go to sleep). The first couple weeks, as with any Rogaine-type product, you go through \\&quot;hair shock\\&quot;, which temporarily accelerates hair loss (new hairs are supposed to grow in as the weak hair dies off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months, it did little for my hairline in the front. But my thin spot in the back was reduced by about half. Is it a miracle worker? No. But for the price, it&#x27;s a good first-step to controlling hair loss on a budget.</li>
            <li> Of the purchases above, the only 1 I didn&#x27;t like was the minoxdil.  I didn&#x27;t know it only works on the crown of your head and couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this kirkland minoxidil topical solution because it&#x27;s half the price of the rogaine foam and seems to have all the same ingredients. The eyedropper application is just as easy as the foam, however this solution leaves a wierd dry white residue that looks like you have stuff stuck in your hair. I ended up just throwing it out and I&#x27;ll go back to the rogaine foam. As far as hair regrowth, I&#x27;m not sure if either products really work super well, but I seem to not be losing as much hair when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> I am a 35+ (not 40 yet) female who was diagnosed with Centrifungal Alopecia in December 2010. My doctor recommended that I use Minoxidil 5% for men.  I have been using it since that time and my hair has about 60% regrowth and counting.  It also rejuvinated something else, because I have less gray hair growing than before.  Although I will never see 100% regrowth because of scar tissue, I continue to use this product faithfully.  I do get the itchy scalp, however, I am African American so I can use moiturizing oils to relieve the itching.  LADIES: DO NOT USE THE FEMALE VERSION OF ROGAINE OR MINOXIDIL, IT WILL NOT WORK!!!  My doctor also gave me a perscription of Vaniqua because, Ladies, you will see an increase in facial hair growth.  I don&#x27;t mind shaving and using Vaniqua, as long as I&#x27;m not bald on the top.  Using the Minoxidil and shaving (lol) is part of my daily routine.  People who say it doesn&#x27;t work, I can guarantee, have not used it for 2 to 4 months to see the true results.  You are instructed to use it 2x daily, not once or twice a week.  Please folks, give it a try and stick to the instructions.  It works.[[ASIN:B002VLZHLI Kirkland  Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men, 6 Month Supply]]</li>
            <li> best value, doesn&#x27;t leave oily easy to apply. I&#x27;m not bald or balding, but i use this as a preventative measure and it works well because I notice less hairs falling out after towelling off my hair after shower.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, It seems like I have twice as much hair as I did before.  My hair was thinning, and I thought that I was going to end up baldish, like my mother.  I was told in high school that baldness is passed down through the female gene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I talked to my dermatologist, and she said to use the 5% strength.  I use the type of [[ASIN:B002VLZHLI Kirkland  Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men, 6 Month Supply bottles with the eyedropper so that I can reach my scalp through my medium length hair.  I put it on at night, as it tends to be slightly greasy, and by morning, I can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Not only did all my hair grow back, but it woke up follicles that I never even knew I had.  It&#x27;s a dream come true!  I hope that I can continue to get this product forever.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work after 6 months 2X daily nothing noticable</li>
            <li> Hi amazon users,&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss is the really bad event for a men to have in his life. The effective agent of this product is the only accepted chemical that found as a coincidence. The discovery of its effect observed while the doctors tried the cure cardiovascular diseases. If we come to the main point, I have been using this product for three months and 10 days. The little and the tinny hair parts become strong and long. Its easy to use and really effective. no harm, no headaches, etc. Do not waste your time with the other products, because I did and had nothing. The only thing you need is the patient.</li>
            <li> I forgot when I bought this. Male pattern baldness, genetics. You can&#x27;t grow head hair bad.</li>
            <li> Buying this product is a waste of money.After three months of use still lost hair at a steady rate. It does not work</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price. Kirkland doesn&#x27;t let you down here. The good news is i have used it for four years and still need to use it.</li>
            <li> This product will definitely grows your hair back. My hair has been slowly thinning since my college days but Minoxidol changed that. After 1 month of use, I started to notice a small amount of extra long hair strands in the hair line. After 2-3 months of use, I had more hair that I started to notice the strands of gray which had blended into the scalp started to contrast against the new short mat. After 4-5 months, it take more time for me to dry my hair after a shower. There was just more hair to dry. After 6 months, the hair line has filled in nicely and the \\&quot;chrome dome\\&quot; was barely noticeable. After 9 month, the hair is back to the college days which allows me to sport a crew cut with no worries.</li>
            <li> The price compared to the name brand is a steal.  I have no complaints.  Of course I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know whether or not my hair will become fuller, but everything is as promised.</li>
            <li> After 5 months on Rogaine my scalp was dry, sore, and flaking. I was using the foam and every application burned. A read of the \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; ingredients was alarming-4 different alchohols and a bunch of other chemicals. I put on the Kirkland today and no burning and far less inactive ingredients! And of course the price...wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Got here in a timely manner and it works great</li>
            <li> I use kirkland at 2008,but three years ago,i stopped,because my wife,we want to have a baby ,now,I am back!</li>
            <li> It make my face hot and I got sick of it.</li>
            <li> The dog&#x27;s hair is starting to grow back. She doesn&#x27;t like the taste though so after a couple of weeks she stopped &#x27;tasting&#x27; it. The only thing is that the hair that is growing back looks more like Barbie hair but curly. The nice thing about it is that the cat stays away from the her and stops bothering her all the time to play - I think it&#x27;s because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After two boxes our dog is a happy puppy again! But I think that it may have messed up her testosterone levels because she now identifies herself with male dogs and no longer squats like she used to. During treatment we started calling her &#x27;Barbie&#x27; but now she only responds to &#x27;BEN&#x27;. I truly do not suggest that this product be used on one&#x27;s pet or for any other use than what&#x27;s on the box.</li>
            <li> Good value. Success with this product varies person to person, what is more important with this is to keep your hair follicles alive,  if you allow shedding or balding for several years the follicles will die. This product will help keep your hair follicles alive until you decide on a more permanent form of hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;This product combined with an internal hair regrowth supplant can regrow new hair. Hair regrowth is only temporary with continued use of this product and a supplement.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it&#x27;d do me some good. I&#x27;d been noticing a general thinning of the hair on the crown of my head for a little over a year and when three small bald spots appeared I decided to give this product a try. In hindsight, I should have opted for the regular strength 2% solution, but this just seemed like too great of a deal. After four stubborn months of using this 5% solution I&#x27;ve since switched to the 2% because I was getting a very socially awkward amount of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product itself; you&#x27;ll begin losing significantly more hair than normal immediately. This extreme hair loss lasted for about six to eight weeks for me and was very dramatic for the first four or five weeks before gradually slowing down and virtually stopping altogether. After five or six weeks I started noticing new thin hairs on my temples, hands, back, etc. I&#x27;m sure I was also growing some on my scalp, but they just weren&#x27;t as visible as the others. It took over three months before I felt as though I&#x27;d grown most of the hair I&#x27;d lost during the initial shedding back. I stopped using this product before I&#x27;d grown much new hair so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it worked really well, but I can say that it at least worked a little. The one thing I will say is that for anyone who has only a little bit of hair loss, this 5% solution is pretty intense and probably not the right choice. If you&#x27;re not ready for the side effects you should not use it because your hair will eventually become dependent upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These side effects include drowsiness, itching, dandruff and of course the initial shedding. I think I&#x27;ve already covered the dandruff and initial shedding. The drowsiness is pretty intense for the first two or three weeks and then comes and goes in spurts after that. I began taking 5 Hour Energy almost daily during the work week, but after about the 10 week mark I didn&#x27;t need the energy boost as much and only took 5 Hour Energy once or twicea week as needed. It became manageable when I planned my day around the drowsy burst. The itching was very bad during the shedding period. After that it continued, but could be ignored for most of the day. I think if I&#x27;d continued to use this 5% solution long enough the itching would have eventually become a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing that I&#x27;ve experienced with both the 5% and 2% solution is a feeling like liquid is sliding around just underneath my scalp. I don&#x27;t know if this means that I&#x27;m using too much or what, but even when I don&#x27;t experience itching I do feel this. All in all, the product did prove to regrow hair. The side effects of this particular product were too much for me though. Also, make sure you get the unscented version. I accidently got a scented version of the 2% solution and the odor it gave off was horrible beyond description. I may just have had a bad reaction to it, but even if it is 10% of that for you it will not be something you want to experience. Better safe than sorry. I have never had any problems with odors on the unscented version of this product.</li>
            <li> Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Extra Strength Hair Regrowth Treatment is for men who have a general thinning of hair on top of the scalp.  I like this much better than the foam.  It is much easier to measure an accurate dose and therefore I tend to get more treatments out of the bottle than I did with the foam.  It is also much less expensive than the foam and works great.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided I needed a change in life. And wasn&#x27;t going to let mother nature hold me back. So I read a little bit on Minoxidil. Though how it works exactly is unknown, it seemed to be quite successful for regrowing hair. I&#x27;ve been on it for my first official month. And I can say that I&#x27;ve already started growing peach fuzz in places where it wasn&#x27;t. Though it takes 3 to 4 months for some, it is already working for me. And I feel much better even if the results aren&#x27;t much. Just knowing it works, is enough for me. I feel confident that the hairs will become fuller and darker as time goes on. I experienced some side effects such as redness, dry, itchy skin, and a rare side effect causing water retention in the face. The water retention went away and though my skin is dryer than usual, my skin tolerates it well. If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend you avoid this product, but if not, then it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it if you suffer from hair loss.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a week in addition to some other stuff and i already feel like my hair is thicker and growing better. It says not to use for ta widows peak, but that is where i am mostly using it and it already appears to have some small hairs growing out! also it says dont use your hands to rub in the stuff but i do and oddly enough it seems to work as a hair gel. when i rub it in my scalp i am also able to mold my hair which is an odd, but good bonus!</li>
            <li> I have been taking Kirkland Minoxidil for over a year.  My hair was thin on top, to where you could see scalp.  This product thickened my hair a bit, and helps me to keep what I have.  I apply it only once a day, after shampooing.  Instructions say to use twice a day.  I think it is important to clean your scalp before applying.  Applying it thinly to the scalp rather than copiously helps to reduce itching.  This is pretty inexpensive, for me about $4 a month.  I say, don&#x27;t think of saving your hair as a vanity thing-- your hair serves important functions, so take a little extra time everyday to preserve it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product more as a hair gel since all it seems to do is make my hair grow faster, not thicker. Our local Costco no longer carries this item, was surprised to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Husband and son are both happy. I&#x27;m happy. Price was right. Product does what it is suposed to do. Got the product promptly.</li>
            <li> my husband  swears by this; it does not grow hair, but prevents further loss.&lt;br /&gt;He has been using it for years (prefers the dropper, not the dabbing sponge) and his hair stylist is amazed he has so much hair at his age.</li>
            <li> I started using Minoxidil last year when the &amp;#34;baboon&#x27;s butt&amp;#34; on the top of my head became more distinct and noticeable after a haircut.  I resisted for a while, but finally gave in to the fact that I was getting older and that I was at a point where I was gaining weight and losing hair.  I could hit the gym and diet to control the weight, but the hair was a completely different story.  So far, the Kirkland Minoxidil 5% has worked great and I have experienced few issues or side-effects.  I did experience some dryness and itching for about 3 weeks after starting the treatment, but nothing after that.  It took about 6 weeks of twice-a-day treatments to see some results, but by my third haircut it was obvious that the fringes and middle of my once growing monk&#x27;s cap.  I am very happy with the quality of the product and the ease of application.  There is no noticeable smell, no greasiness, and my hair looks fine when short or medium length.  I wish this worked on the isthmus and growing forehead, but there are some things that you can&#x27;t fight.  I hope to keep what I have through my 50s, then I&#x27;ll buy a hat if Amazon Prime is still around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy application&lt;br /&gt;- No smell&lt;br /&gt;- Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;- No mess&lt;br /&gt;- Good price&lt;br /&gt;- It works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Only one applicator for 6 bottles, wish there was a second.&lt;br /&gt;- Caused dryness and itchiness for 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;- You need to let it dry when using it at night, can stain pillowcases&lt;br /&gt;- You can find this cheaper when on sale at Walgreens or Target</li>
            <li> Was really skeptical before starting this product but I went ahead and tried it. Started seeing results and new hairs after 6-8 weeks, after about 4-5 months i saw my full results and continued using up to 12 months, my hairline was brought forward about an inch and a half!! I wanted to try shaving my head and see what embracing baldness would be like after those 12 months...it wasnt that bad, it almost has a fresh, clean look to me, but im not gonna lie and say i dont miss my hair more...its been 3 months since i stopped using this and those hairs that grew are now not growing back. Buying a new 6 month box today, cant wait to see results again!!</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t fall out yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Kirkland version to save money over brand name Rogaine.  I have tried both the foam and liquid generic versions.  Compared with the brand name Rogaine, both of these generic preparation caused a rash and crusting that I did not experience with the brand name Rogaine.  The rash went away with discontinuation of the medication, restarted with re-challenge of the medication, and has not returned since stopping the medication completely and resuming brand name Rogaine.  I have mild to moderately sensitive skin so it is possible that this rash would not necessarily be experienced by those with &amp;#34;thicker skin&amp;#34;!  As always, Amazon was very excellent about refunding the costs of these non-returnable  but non-usable item.  I have used the return funds to resume the more expensive brand name Rogaine.  It was a nice attempt to save money but didn&#x27;t work out dermatologically.  Also, new users should note that the cheaper liquid formuation is much more cumbersome to apply than the foam...which would explain why it is cheaper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:  October 2015:  re-challenged myself without evidence of rash, clinically seems to work as well as the brand name.  moving it from one to three stars</li>
            <li> Hair kind of reached a max growth point after about 6 months or so. It has not gotten much better but it has stopped the hair from falling out. I am a little bummed I will never have thick flowing hair but oh well...</li>
            <li> This item works very well, as it has provided the intended results, as long as the directions are followed. This item came on time and the package was not damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old Asian male. About 2 years ago, I noticed that the frontal and temple part of hair is becoming thinning. After endured two years&#x27; hair loss, I decided to try some medical intervention. I tried Kirkland Minoxidil 5% at first, because it seems to be the cheapest minoxidil product which also have a generally positive comments. Because most minoxidil product is said not very helpful with frontal and temple hair loss, so I didn&#x27;t have too much expectation on it, and it is also the reason why I didn&#x27;t buy the more expensive Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the result turns to be good. After using about one month, I have noticed that the frontal and my left temple part have a lot of new hair grow again, the effect is slow on right temple part, where the hair loss is most persistent, but still, I can see tiny new hair. Although the new hair right now is still thin, but I think it will become better in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you are a young male who also suffers hair loss, this product is worth a try. It seems the earlier you accept minoxidil treatment, the better the effect will be. However, the price is that you have to depend on it in the future, you will lose your new hair if you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about side effect, I didn&#x27;t experienced issues such as scalp itch, but dandruff indeed exists, hopefully it will disappear after you are using a longer time. And if you have a low blood pressure, or hypotension, say. I suggest you use it cautiously, anyway, minoxidil used to be a drug that lower blood pressure, if you use it in a long term, although you are just using it on your scalp, it will eventually enters your body from capillaries, which would cause some unexpected effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I think this product is good, and it is cheap, too. It is a good start product for people who want to try some minoxidil product.</li>
            <li> Great product, still using it since more than a year. The best price for a medicated product you&#x27;re not gonna find somewhere else</li>
            <li> Kirkland minoxidil drops irritated my scalp after about 6 months &amp; developed some scaling with itching.  Had to discontinue regardless of some hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  decided to try again but used a good conditioner along with it.  It&#x27;s been 6 months now and no irritation whatsoever.  Family says hair is coming back in...</li>
            <li> Greasy and burns your scalp. Threw it in the trash. Will go back to using Rogain or national pharmacy brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Amazon in Jan 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not regrown any hair that I can see but I haven&#x27;t lost any more hair as off Dec 2013. This was my primary goal anyway. It does make your scalp itch a bit the first couple of weeks. I was only using it once per day so it is lasting twice as long. It seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is the same as the Rogaine but at a better price.  Happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> so i started losing my hair at 23 with the thinning circle in the back... used rogaine foam, and though it stopped hair loss it never grew back. so at 27 i gave up considering the price and figured id just hurry up and go for the bald look since i was spending a lot for delaying the inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so once i got off rogaine surely it started thinning out more, but so slow that goin bald would probably take a few more years. considering i didnt want to have this bad looking balding look (id rather have one or the other), i gave it another shot with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 months later, and all the spots are filled with hair. amazing. not the thickest of hair, and i havent tried growing it out, but with a short haircut it doesn&#x27;t even look like im balding anymore. if i remember ill update this review again to see if it gets even better, but in 3 months it did more than 5 years on rogaine. not only that, but im spending much much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even though im only half way through the 6 months, i ordered another 6 just to stock up since im pretty confident in this stuff now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;though your results may vary, this is my result. ive had no itch, and the scent of this isn&#x27;t as strong as rogaine. also my hairline hasn&#x27;t receded ever... and this product isn&#x27;t intended for that type of baldness. but for the type i was having, works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years and it has worked just as advertised. After six months, I noticed my hair was not falling out as fast. After one year, I noticed my hair was actually getting thicker. Now two years into use you can barely tell that my hair was ever thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I started using this product right after my barber and I noticed that my hair was started to get thin. I wasn&#x27;t already bald and I didn&#x27;t have any bald spots on my head. I was just getting extremely thin on the entire top of my head.</li>
            <li> Rogaine is as useless as tits on a bull.</li>
            <li> Works as I expected it too,  but it does take a while to see growth. About 6 months or so. I started taking it with [[ASIN:B00XJ3GPJA Finoxidrin - Powerful Hair Nutrient Supplement]] and my hair loss stopped completely, and the growth really seems to have accelerated quite rapidly. The addition of Finoxidrin also made my hair look MUCH healthier.</li>
            <li> It works if you use it &amp;Odontoceti stop.</li>
            <li> Product works well and the only complaint is that the foam works better than the dropper. If you are going to use a dropper then this product works great. I have had great experiences with the Kirkland brand</li>
            <li> I have hair thinning due to menopause at my temples and sides of scalp.  I tried this product, and unfortunately it had an adverse effect.  I experienced profuse itching to the point that I was up at 1:00am washing my hair and applying topical hydrocortisone to my scalp.  After further research I learned that the ingredient that can cause itching is absent in the foam form, so I have ordered that and will review after use.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product to my brother-n-law who suffers from male pattern baldness.  If it works for him I will add to my review.</li>
            <li> I think the product has started working in only three weeks.  Good deal for the money. Rogaine does about the same and costs way more.</li>
            <li> I overplucked my brows for years and decided I wanted to grow them out again, but wasn&#x27;t having much luck despite taking hair vitamins and hiding my tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I did a ton of research and found that a lot of ladies went through the same thin-brow phase and were experiencing overpluck remorse. Many of them recommended rogaine to regrow the over-tweezed hair.&lt;br /&gt;Welp, the brand name is exponentially more expensive than the Kirkland brand, and the active ingredient is the same.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for 2 months on my brows and they are back to their bushy glory.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a cheap, efficient way to regrow their overplucked brows.</li>
            <li> Update: After abandoning this product and losing more hair, I returned and I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a year. I&#x27;ve also tried the foam. I can&#x27;t edit the title of this review but I would NOT recommend the foam. The foam is not any easier to apply and also dries to a rock hard crust. You CANNOT wear the foam out. The liquid is less than half the price of the foam and once it dries you can wear it out, if you don&#x27;t mind the somewhat strange texture and slightly greasy, wet look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness, after a year I have not regrown any hair that I can see. However, I have not lost anymore hair either. In fact, I think I lose less hair overall, particularly in the shower. I think this product works to strengthen the hair follicles. I plan on using it well into my 50s (I&#x27;m 43 now) until about the time I stop caring about my looks (if ever).</li>
            <li> I bought it for my brother.  He used for months. Not a single hair grow. It is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This is a real value. It is the same thing as romaine at a much lower price. I will buy this produce again.</li>
            <li> For me it makes my existing hair thicker and fuller, for others it may reactive new follicles. Either way I&#x27;ll keep using it otherwise I&#x27;d have a bald spot by now.</li>
            <li> Make sure to try the solution out before the foam.  The solutions inactive ingredients cause flaking but also allow the minoxidil to absorb better.  I switched to the foam for about nine months due to the flaking the solution caused but wish I had never made the switch.  Flaking will be eliminated but my hair began to thin out even more. I switched back to the solution about 3 months ago and have seen major improvements. I only use it once a day at night and place it in all areas that are thinning. I am now only losing about 25 hairs a day. If I used it twice a day I&#x27;m sure the results would be even better.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me. Did not work but I had all the side effects while using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using an eyebrow brush on my eyebrows with it once, usually twice a day (Disclaimer: The instructions clearly state it is ONLY to be used on the head.) It is a slow process but after a couple of months I could definitely see my eyebrows are growing back it somewhat. I have just received another 6 month supply from Amazon and I am hoping the growth continues. Three day ago I received &amp;#34;Green Touch Perfect Brows&amp;#34;  aIso from Amazon. I  followed the instructions to the T. It (and as I hoped) covered up much of my dye resistant grey brittle hair for the day. I will post my review on Amazon about this product in a couple of months. But after 3 months of my diligent routine I am happy with the Minoxidil , especially since the price is so affordable.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve seen.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years.  I believe the product works.  Though hair is receding, some hair is better than no hair at all.</li>
            <li> Seems to preserve my hair at 56 years of age. I have been using the product for years after noticing thinning</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;Good Product&amp;#34;. This product really does work. It takes time, so people who decide to purchase this product, please do yourself a favor and read the instructions. It take a couple of months to really notice a difference. The idea is to treat your minor baldness before it turns into a major problem. Because when it turns &amp;#34;Major&amp;#34;, this product may not be able to help you.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product. I used carexidil, a Spanish product similar to this one. I only bought one bottle of carexidil, which was very easy to use, and when i used it up i switched to this one, hoping it would be something similar. But it is so not. I can&#x27;t tell you if it has any positive effect on preventing hair loss because i could not use it regularly. Why? How can anyone with a mirror in his use or people around him use this oily, messy product? I apply it and it never really dries. It sticks my hair together in chunks and I have to use a paper towel to dry it after half an hour. And even when I dry, my hair looks as if I used the cheapest hair gel and forget to take a shower for three days. I can only use it an hour before I go to sleep. I figured that it stains the pillow covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I want to prevent hair loss? Because I do care how I look!! Walking around with a greasy hair and messy look is absolutely the opposite of what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help thicken my beard. It really helped fill in a few spots that looked patchy. I figure if it works for facial hair it would work on your head.</li>
            <li> Package received was all smashed up but inside contents were intact. Folks do&lt;br /&gt;yourself a favor and go to Costco much cheaper and you&#x27;ll get it faster.</li>
            <li> After using this for about 3 months my wife and I both noticed marked improvement in the thickness of my hair.  I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> very light and non greasy, great potency.  Been using minox for about 12yrs and this is my favorite brand thus far.</li>
            <li> The expiration date seems rigged, the number 8 stands out, it looks as if originally it was either a 3 or a 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to use: Even thought I have kept using it for two years now, my hairloss has progressed significantly, and furthermore I have now grown hair in places you wouldn&#x27;t want hair growth.</li>
            <li> Product works well! Stays on the top of your head without dripping down to your forehead for just enough time to rub the product into your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite sometime now and I must say i have not noticed any differences.  My scalp has not gotten worse nor has it gotten better.</li>
            <li> Get a lot for your money very happy with this purchase. I do recommend this product because you get what you see.</li>
            <li> Works great at a great price! Why pay so much more for the name brand when this works just as well?</li>
            <li> seems to be working,keeping what i have anyways</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product.  I had pressure behind the eyes and fatigue.  Be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It has Good Price and it is Same as it was advertised. Compare to same material produced by other companies. I&#x27;m happy and i&#x27;ll by a same one for the next time</li>
            <li> Does it work? I don&#x27;t know. Go buy it for a few years.</li>
            <li> Great product.I&#x27;ve used it for several years. I prefer it over the foam version. When I use it on continuous bases after a couple of months you see the hair loss stops and you&#x27;re maintaining, maybe minor improvements. I like that the hair remains a bit dry and you&#x27;re not washing your hair everyday, at least I don&#x27;t think you should, the second day on the hair has more *volume* for thinning hair this is great. Drawbacks are you have to user it for life and dandruff can become a problem but nothing that the right shampoo can&#x27;t solve with occasional use.</li>
            <li> I use this product because it offers the same results as the more expensive original brands. So far I am completely satisfied after a whole year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 6 weeks now. Been shedding very rapidly for the past 4 weeks - I get about 5 hair with each flake of dandruff I pull out. My hair is significantly thinner now, especially on the crown. I tried nizoral for a few weeks to get rid of the dandruff and it didnt work. Now I&#x27;ve been using head and shoulders for a week and it&#x27;s still not letting up. No sign of regrowth whatsoever. I gave it two stars because it says you may see improvement as early as two months and it hasnt been that long yet. But really, I&#x27;ve lost at least half of my hair and theres a large area of open scalp on the crown where it was barely noticible before and no sign of any regrowth. It&#x27;s not looking too good</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 6 months now. I am using it for the front of my scalp where the hair was thinning and the hairline was slowly creeping upwards. I can not see any difference in regards to the hairline (nor has anyone implied that I should), but the hair has gotten thicker. It took about 2-3 months before I could see any difference. It is hard to be objective about the results since it is hard to note such a gradual effect, but I met up with a friend at 1 and 6 months after starting the treatment and was told that my hair looked a lot thicker (and he is not afraid to tell me the truth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning I experienced an increase in dandruff. I changed shampoo to one without SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate) and I have been problem free since. SDS free shampoos are difficult to find and I currently make my own, which chemically is more similar to soap than shampoo (corn oil, lye, glycerol, ethanol and sugar). Try washing your hair with different kinds of soap instead of shampoo if you have problems with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application can be tricky in the beginning, but you get the routine going. In the evening I just apply right before going to bed as there is no risk of it running down my face while lying down. In the morning I massage it into the scalp. Massaging should not be necessary, but it is a good way to get it everywhere without it dripping to much. Then I use some paper to remove the excess liquid from the hair as it otherwise will form a white layer as it dries. Paper consumption has gone up a lot and I am keeping a short hairstyle as that makes application easier. The morning routine takes about 3 minutes once you get it going. I plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> The products is reasonable price with numbers of items (average high delivery cost). The weakness of the product is its cap is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works. Obviously is a long process and it doesn&#x27;t make miracles, but it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> This is my first product review, I prefer not to write them but after horrible experience with this product I figured it might help someone out there.. I used various minoxidil products for couple years and this one is by far the most damaging. Product I received was missing dropper applicators, but more importantly liquid caused unbelievable itch and skin irritation on my scalp. For some reason I continued to use it for a whole month during which unthinkable itchiness and dandruff were daily routine. During this process I actually lost some hair, not sure is it the liquid itself, scalp irritation, or both that were root cause. At this point I&#x27;m not sure if I received advertised Kirkland liquid solution or some other knock off product.</li>
            <li> Tried to help fill in side burns and splotchy facial hair.  no success....if u need more hair, get -a transplant!!! Or get some testosterone, that will increase facial hair at least!!! Monitor Your Blood work and make sure DHT doesn&#x27;t get too high which causes male baldness.</li>
            <li> The shipment came in as promised and the product is as described. It works great and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> product received as described</li>
            <li> it works just fine, does the job. 5% is better than 2%. it has saved my hair, you are driving me crazy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect to grow a big head of hair.  I only want to slow the spread of my &amp;#34;Friar Tuck&amp;#34; patch.  Over the last 8 years, it has actually grown some back (not a lot) but no more losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look like Telly Savalis, your too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I know one man who uses it to anchor his Hairpiece which needs something to weave it too.</li>
            <li> I threw it away!  It made my hair dry, brittle....and I&#x27;m not at all certain that I was regrowing any hair.  Lose/Lose!</li>
            <li> very greasy formula. been using for a month definitely see the baby hairs growing in... but adding something oily to thinning hair just makes it look thinner?</li>
            <li> I am an African American female. I purchased this because the women&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t working for me and my brows and edges were thinning out due to thyroid issues. Fast forward 4 months later and my hair has grown all over the place! I only use it once a day as this is men&#x27;s rogaine but the results have been so fast. I apply to my brows nightly with a qtip and to my hairline nightly with the dropper. My only negative is that I&#x27;ve grown hair on my face and back that I have to stay on top of. There was some mild itchy foot the first week at night but besides that no negative side affects. It&#x27;s a dream in a bottle for me.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and it works for me. Six month supply is more like 2 to 3 month supply if you really want results.</li>
            <li> My hairline began to recede in my late teens, and the hair on the top of my head started to thin soon thereafter.  Right before I turned 21, the thinning drastically accelerated.  I was noticeably thin on top, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad if I kept the sides and back short and textured (having a good hair stylist is important!) Around 23 I tried Lipogaine, but I didn&#x27;t care for the dropper or the oily feeling.  After my 24th birthday passed this May, and many more hairs graced the floor of my shower, I decided to take action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June 2013, I purchased a 6 month supply of Kirkland brand minoxidil foam along with a bottle of PerfectHAIR shampoo (the shampoo was supposed to be only a 30 day supply, but I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle daily for over three months and still have some remaining.)  I use the shampoo each morning in the shower and let it sit for about five minutes.  After my hair finishes soaking, I rinse and dry with a blow dryer once I&#x27;m out of the shower.  Once dried off, I apply the suggested amount of  minoxidil foam to my scalp and massage it in.  I don&#x27;t use any hair products -- the foam is my styling mousse.  Then at the end of the day, about an hour before I go to bed, I apply one more round of foam and massage it in.  The foam works well enough like a mousse, but it dissolves quickly so work fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly four months and a short haircut later (I usually wear it long), I&#x27;m pleased to say that I&#x27;ve significantly regrown hair on the top of my head in addition to a good deal of hairline.  I know this product isn&#x27;t intended to regrow your hairline, let alone guaranteed to regrow any hair at all, but it worked out for me.  I&#x27;m no longer noticeably thin on top, and I&#x27;ve regained a good amount of hair along my temples, so I no longer have as bad of an \\&quot;island.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first month was slow and tedious, but I was soon able to see little hairs sprouting on my hairline.  Around the second month, the hairs were noticeably longer and darkerand I observed that I couldn&#x27;t see as much scalp on top as before.  After the second and half month, I decided to shave my head from about 5 inches on top and 3 inches on the sides / back, to a no. 5 with clippers so I could see my progress.  I am truly amazed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend using this product in conjunction with the PerfectHAIR if your hair is starting to thin.  I&#x27;m very thankful that my body reacted to the minoxidil and shampoo, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that I wouldn&#x27;t have achieved results like this if I had waited a while longer -- the sooner you start, the better!  Keep in mind that you won&#x27;t notice much at first because it takes time to grow new hair.  Also, hair grows only about half an inch per month, so I think 3 months is a good waiting period to give yourself before you see results.  Depending on how you wear your hair, your progress may not be as noticeable.  I usually keep my hair at a medium length, but I really didn&#x27;t notice how much hair I had regrown until I shaved my head to even out the longer hairs with the shorter new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next experiment will be to see how long these new hairs grow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller , very fast shipping , Item as described , Thanks! ♥~♥♥~♥♥~♥</li>
            <li> I believe this works.  My hair seems a little fuller than I remember it being. I&#x27;ve been using it for some months and though I haven&#x27;t seen a major difference it seems to look thicker than before.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this might help if you are thinking of using this product.  I started losing my hair about 3 years ago, all over my scalp. Even in the front.  My doctor told me about Minoxidil. I started using it, and it worked.  The problem is, that I stopped using it for about 6 months early this year. I started &#x60;losing my hair again.  I didn&#x27;t start losing my hair right away, but if you stop using this product, it will fall out again.  I started using it again on the 5th of November.  It has been 6 weeks. I finally started to see some small hairs growing back. Also, I read somehere that the reason it sayes that it only grows hair in one area of the scalp, is because that is where they applied it when they did there studies on it. So, they can&#x27;t say that it grows hair any where else. I do believe that, only because it worked on me. I should never have stopped it. I won&#x27;t do that again.  Just know, that you have to use it all the time, because if you stop, your hair will fall out again.  (I don&#x27;t mean if you miss a few days here and there)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone. Also, I am a female, with thinning all over the top of my scalp.  My doctor told me to use the 5% because he said anything less would not work. He also asked about my medical history before he told me about minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband. He claims it really works and that is hair has grown back and thickened in the area that he is using it. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Just started using today, I will report back after a couple months and give an update on how its worked so far, i just a receding hairline so thats what ill be reporting about. Wish me luck.</li>
            <li> This is my second purschase, does the job very well,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Minoxidil for many years. I don&#x27;t like the new &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; versions of this product, so these drops work if you use it twice a day religiously. However this product tends to leave a yellow stain on my gray-white hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. I have been using Minoxidil for more than 15 years. This product works as it is supposed to and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Im still using the product, i have to wait at least three more months to see results but i received the product as they said.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  I can not get the liquid at Cosco anymore.  Do not want to live without the Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> created redness and  itching neck after use. I would like to get my money back for the potential issues were not addressed when purchasing.</li>
            <li> minoxidil is good.  my hair is growth~~~&lt;br /&gt;this product is packaged by six small plastic bottle. and one spoid.  so, i can get perfect condition boxing. not broken bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product to neighborhood.  he does loss his hair, too.</li>
            <li> He complains, that it flakes</li>
            <li> Have been using this for just over 1.5 months and have not seen any improvements.  I don&#x27;t like applying it as it tends to either run or stick to my hair making it feel and appear greasy.  If this works, I think I will try the foam next time as I have seen great reviews about how it is much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Gave me a skin infection! Ears puffed up twice the size they usually are, red itchy bumps all over my scalp and face, and it took antibiotics to finally rid my body of it.</li>
            <li> This product will give you E.D.  not good..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best!!!! rigth now i get more hair really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent  100 % positive</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that it says in the more detailed instructions that the product must be continued to be used or the gains made will disappear. I do not want to be tied to using the product the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Huge waste of time and money. Go for Rogaine- it actually works. This product doesnt at all. Dont bother- seriously</li>
            <li> We bought the 6 month supply for my husband approx. 4 months ago. The product says it works for the crown balding, but it has worked on my husbands temples as well. My hubby used it twice a day for about a month and then went to once a day as the morning treatments left his hair kinda wet which he didn&#x27;t like, so he uses it after his evening shower. The results have been AMAZING!! His temples are now fully covered as well as his bald spot on his crown being significantly smaller. The crown bald spot when he started was about as big as a large orange and that same spot is now almost at about 85% coverage. This product has given new life to a man who thought his days with a full head of hair were over. I recommend this product highly to anyone who has thinning hair, it has been amazing. He also did not have any of the scalp discomfort that others had, I was very happy about that also!!</li>
            <li> thank you. it is very cheap~</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a result yet so I&#x27;ll give a few more months</li>
            <li> 3rd week and I have seen growth in places where I never had hair. Trying to grow a full beard and with the progress I&#x27;ve seen there&#x27;s no doubt this product works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product before and it worked well, but the last 6 month supply it&#x27;s different. As soon as I started using it, my hair started to fall rapidly and my scalp is itchy.</li>
            <li> It will work if use it properly</li>
            <li> I pour mine into an old small spray bottle.  I use it every morning on my scalp and also use it by spraying 2 pumps on an old toothbrush and going over my brows.  It thickens them no matter how much you have over plucked if you have no scar tissue.</li>
            <li> After spending a great deal of time reading medical literature and trying different hair regrowth products, I can confirm that this product does work on the hairline. Oddly, the hair doesn&#x27;t appear identical to that it replaced as it is thinner and more curly. It also can cause acne in the vicinity.  My hair loss was minor and I started using this product at the earliest sign of hair line recession.  This enables me to avoid appearing as the most senior gorilla in the &amp;#34;band&amp;#34; (presumably the evolutionary reason for male pattern hair loss).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********&lt;br /&gt;Other interesting fact:  Dermatologists have long said that gray hair could NEVER be reversed. As it turns out, cancer drug Gleevec, which costs about $30k/year, has shown to reverse gray hair in some patients.</li>
            <li> I get skin itching and dandruff from this product. I cannot use it. I get the same Itching and dandruff when using foam. I bought this liquid Minoxidil about 18 months ago and it was OK. Did you change the formula?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;H. Schroeder</li>
            <li> Worked out good.  It&#x27;s not a foam but a liquid.  SO far no negatives.  Price was right and hair seems to be growing.  What more can you ask for.  I had been using Rogaine foam before but for the difference in price this seems a no-brainer.  Good luck guys - hope it works for you also.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a relative and he said it works better than rogaine, he has continued buying it and his bald spot has definitely improved.</li>
            <li> Caused severe cardiac problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try a google search on &amp;#34;minoxodil side effects&amp;#34; for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Mayoclinic.com lists the following side effects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blurred vision or other changes in vision&lt;br /&gt;Chest pain&lt;br /&gt;Dizziness&lt;br /&gt;Fainting&lt;br /&gt;Fast or irregular heartbeat&lt;br /&gt;Flushing&lt;br /&gt;Headache&lt;br /&gt;Lightheadedness&lt;br /&gt;Numbness or tingling of hands, feet, or face&lt;br /&gt;Swelling of face, hands, feet, or lower legs&lt;br /&gt;Weight gain (rapid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever had heart trouble before, you gotta be nuts to try this stuff.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a shot for hair thinning. It caused me incredible itchiness. I was constantly scratching my head, causing further hair loss. I&#x27;m going back to the Walgreens generic brand of Minoxidil, which I&#x27;ve used for years and never had this problem.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed for two months. My hair was only about 10% normal on the top of my head when I started. After two months I would say it was back to 90%. So on the one hand this product definitely does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the other hand, after about two months the itching began. I read the comments here and tried everything including scratching as little and gently as possible, using less product, using it only at night, using a moisturizing conditioner but nothing helped. After trying to tolerate it for a month I finally had to stop. The itching was only getting worse and was driving me nuts, I wanted to claw my head off. I am very disappointed because I really liked the result I was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After stopping for a month I am gradually losing my new hair again but the itching is gone. If they could solve the itching problem this would be a great product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as expected</li>
            <li> Im told it works, this was for a friend.</li>
            <li> Works great. Helps you to grow new hair and keep what you have. I needed to use this after medications caused my hair to thin. My hair is now a lot thicker.</li>
            <li> After only a couple days on this stuff, it caused MASSIVE blistering to the application area.  Buyer beware!  Now Im stuck with a 6 month supply of thist!  BLAH!</li>
            <li> I have been using this and Rogaine for over a year now.  The Rogaine foam works the best but this works as well but is just messier.  Its a bit harder to get to the areas you want to treat.  The price can&#x27;t be beat so the trade off of ease of use versus price is acceptable for me.  Don&#x27;t expect to have hair like you&#x27;re 18 again and you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Gave me the worse headaches...</li>
            <li> So far so good!  It takes time to see results.  Does cause dandruff.</li>
            <li> Actually reverses the process. Not in every case but in my own empirical experience this product speed up my hair loss. I was only losing a little and in spots. When applying the solution (product) in about one months time I noticed an exponential decay patter pertaining to hair loss. Be sure to internalize all the material and not just the case studies or television chemicals.</li>
            <li> After a year of buying Rogaine, I was please to find this off brand equivalent.  I get twice the amount at half the price!!&lt;br /&gt;I use 1 dropper dose every night and morning to help offset my thinning hair.  After 2.5 years of using this and Rogaine, my thinning hair is still a secret.  It&#x27;s hard to quantify exactly, but i know that i have less thinning hair than before and have not noticed any worsening.  I&#x27;m going down fighting, and this is a huge lift to my ego.</li>
            <li> 5% minoxidil for $4 per bottle, versus buying the same formula brand name ripoff at four times the price. It works exactly the same and people who are paying through the nose for a name brand are wasting their hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this works or not like many others.  I am losing hair and have for years.  This might have delayed it or maybe not.  I can&#x27;t tell since huge areas are losing hair and other areas are fine.  the price is crazy expensive but it just might be helping and again it might be an expensive failure.  IT is very hard to know if this stuff works but I will use it because i dont want to be a baldie</li>
            <li> My hairs returning and my wallet is staying fat. Thanks for selling this usually over priced product at a great price. Good Karma and great hair…lol</li>
            <li> I was a fool that I believed this product from Amazon is cheaper than Costco price. After a week later, I had been at Costco and checked the price is $17.89. But if you don&#x27;t want to drive to Costco, then this is the best place to buy. I just have 1 week experience with Kirkland Minoxidil, so I don&#x27;t know much about this product.</li>
            <li> I use this with Lipogaine and The Big 3 Shampoo. Be patient! This stuff is slower than a turtle about regrowing but I think it might work for temples.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for approximately 6 months and have seen a great improvement. My friends have noticed and said &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t look so bald anymore&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use it once a day and sometimes twice if I remember and that seems to be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I slowly squeeze the dropper over about 10 seconds as I rub the dropper tip on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t drip all over as some people complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put product in my hair so I don&#x27;t notice any greasiness but when I don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t bother me either. For a little while though you will notice something, but not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked well for me and I&#x27;m very happy, I just ordered more. Good luck hope it works for you too.</li>
            <li> Costco may run out from time to time; this is a bargain and Amazon keeps in stock -- if you do not have a membership this is the only alternative and it works well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Forget pay double the price for to rogain.</li>
            <li> It helps.  It is not a miracle but helps</li>
            <li> You have to be kidding!!!! I tried this product for four weeks. I followed the instructions as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Around the fourth week I noticed dry dandruff like chunks falling on my shoulders, as the days went by the dry patches got worse.&lt;br /&gt;It was literally the whole crown area that was dry and crusty. When I would try and break it down it ended tearing out my hair so I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;I went to a dermatoligist and he said it was the product [Kirkland Extra Strength Minoxidil] that was causing the dry crusty scalp.&lt;br /&gt;He used a special shampoo on several visits to get rid of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disgusted with the results of this product and the stress of getting rid of the dry thick crusty area on the crown. Not to mention what ever hair loss from scratching at the crusty area.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could get some compensation on this, or at least get my money back, but I most likely to win the lottery that get any satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, stay away from this product. If this happened to me I&#x27;m sure there are thousands more</li>
            <li> I thought this would be fine as a solution, as I know Kirkland to be a pretty reputable brand. It wasn&#x27;t: it burned like hell. I noticed it after one use. After three uses, it was painful to the point that my head stung all day long. Can&#x27;t use anything close the 6 months supply, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had tried a bush wig,  it just did not seem to look the part, so after 6 months of this baby i can safely say im now considering pony tails, or at least a visit to the barbers, although since my last request for a haircut &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; i have received a restraining order...</li>
            <li> A lot of people have negative things to say about Minoxidil, (or Rogaine) – the truth is topical hair serums/gels have limited scope in terms of who it will work for. For one, this product won’t grow your hair back if you are bad, its more of a preventative measure to keep your hair from thinning. Second, this product will NOT work overnight. Once you start using this product, you will continue to shed for weeks. This does not mean you should stop using it, a lot of people will write negative reviews about this product because it’s not an instant fix. Please don’t give up hope so quickly, it may work for you it just takes time. Lastly, there’s a difference in the causes of hair loss. Some hair loss is caused by genetics (more than half of all cases), and in this case, you’ll need to try products like this Minoxidil, or go even further and get plugs. However, some cases for hair thinning might have nothing to do with your genes, but rather vitamin deficiencies or an improper diet. In these circumstances, supplementing your diet with [[ASIN:B00S8H9IVY A Biotin formulated for hair regrowth]] like this one would be a good bet. The goal for me was to identified exactly what the root cause of my hair loss was, in order for me to know what measures I should take to stop my hair loss. I take both the biotin and Minoxidil for good measure, and I’ve been seeing encouraging results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vertex of my hairline (where I’ve been seeing the most change) is the area that I’m the most concerned about, and I can say that using these products has slowed down the rate of decline. My father has the same issue as me, and he said at my age he had a lot less hair. I don’t know if that statement is encouraging or not, but at least it means that something is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll continue to use these products until more drastic measures are necessary.</li>
            <li> great product for the price&lt;br /&gt;you get 6 month supply bottles for the price of one.&lt;br /&gt;just hoping that it works in few months of using it</li>
            <li> Insert of product states:  &amp;#34;In studies with minoxidil topical solution 5%, hair regrowth has NOT been shown to last longer than 48 weeks of continuous treatment in large clinical trials.&amp;#34;  What a major disappointment and senseless use of this product!!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY MINOXIDIL!!! This is a truly warn for ALL MEN! I used minoxidil for 1 entire year, the side effects are terrible and the Effluvium after stopping it is Devasting! Stop eating Sugar and Grain and get vitamins like saw palmetto and Biotin. I qui minoxidil 6 months ago and I have more hair than on the Top period of using minoxidil. Thank God the effluvium usually last 3 months and then the hair start regrowing. It takes 6 months to get back to the pre-minoxidil period. Again, NEVER START! Thanks</li>
            <li> I prefer the foam, but this is relatively easy to apply, and costs about half as much as the foam version.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;next time i will buy to minoxidil again&lt;br /&gt;for my much hail.&lt;br /&gt;good goods.&lt;br /&gt;have a good day</li>
            <li> i started using minoxidil 5% about 12 years ago when i started noticing my hair was thinning. I went to a mens club office and instead of hair graphing the specialist suggested using minoxidil.. and let me tell you im glad he is an honest person, cuz its worked for me. i use it all over my scalp twice a day. and i have kept my hair and it looks good and im grateful. if your starting to thin start using minoxidil 5%. some of the side effects for me have been: crazy hair growth all over my body, but watever, some scalp irritation but very little (sometimes if i dont shower in like 12 hours it starts to really itch) and as for sexual side effects...ive had NONE! infact i think this stuff has made me have a stronger sex drive. i was dating an 18 yr old college student!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for two months. Every time I put it on, my hair gets sticky and begins to itch. I was prescribed this product form my dermatologist, and she said it was fine for women to use as well as men. I am washing my hair twice as often to sop the itch. I have no idea if it will be effective eventually or not.</li>
            <li> something is finally working. i used Rogain for twenty years in a losing battle. i now do four things and a dramatic hair increase&lt;br /&gt;1&#x27; still using minoxidle but now this Kirkland.&lt;br /&gt;2, one Biotin pill a day. ten thousand mcg.&lt;br /&gt;3, nizoral shampoo with one percent ketoconazil. leave on thirty minutes, three times a week&lt;br /&gt;4, never wash hair in hot water. Only cold or tepid</li>
            <li> been using it for about a year, hair keeps falling but when i suspend  treatment it falls a little easier.</li>
            <li> product as advertised .... very happy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> No noticeable change in baldness.</li>
            <li> This product worked as intended, effectively and with no side effects.  I have clasic baldness pattern from the crown of my head extending out in a roughly circular design (what some refer to as Yamakle shaped).  I should state that my hair loss is over a patch about 4 inches in diameter across the very crown of my head.  This would be considered &amp;#34;minimal baldness&amp;#34; by most standards My hair loss took place over a period of about ten years or so gradually thinning until I could accurately say it was a &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; and not simply &amp;#34;thinning hair&amp;#34;.  This product came with six bottles and a dropper.  Applying 1 ML twice daily according to the directions this should last six months.  The detailed directions state that not all see results and that results can take 2 months to see.  I noticed hair growth within one month and after two months I can say that the &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; is for the most part completely non existent.  I did not experience any side effects such as flaking, dryness or unwanted hair. I applied this daily using the dripper but massaging the oily substance into the scalp, then washing hands with soap and water.  What else can I say but it worked for me?  I remember this product was first released onto the market at a time when baldness was a really big issue for men.  Since then I believe that baldness is accepted for the most part and does carry the same stigma it did before the early 1990s. That said I would have been perfectly content if this product had not worked for me. I believe I am still &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; regardless of  bald spot, which many actors in hollywood proudly display.  I bought this kind of on a whim.  If it works though and it the effects are minimal I figured why not?  Good luck if you purchase this but remember that covering a bald spot will not make you a better person and probably will not make you any more appealing than you are right now.  It&#x27;s just kind of a vanity thing.  If it does not work then learn to be content with who you are.  People won&#x27;t love you more because you have a full head of hair and having a bald spot should not cause anyone to love you less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s help!&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with my hair for a long time. I tried a lot of pills, shampoos, masks and 0 result.  this picture after 4 months using&lt;br /&gt;trust me!</li>
            <li> Great fast service - perfect product received.</li>
            <li> messy and takes forever to dry. works but the part I wanted it for works but it takes a lot longer to work then I was expecting. the parts that were starting to thin are now thicker.</li>
            <li> Great value. Will give 5th star when I finish using them.</li>
            <li> if you suffer from actual male pattern baldness, go to a dermatologist and get a prescription for finasteride (sooner rather than later)... minoxidil definitely reduces hair loss but has no effect on dht, the major culprit... take fin (hopefully you won&#x27;t have any major sexual side effects), apply 1 ml minoxidil twice a day (or double the dose once at night) and shower with both biotin shampoo and 1% ketoconazole (nizoral) shampoo every other day leaving it in your hair for at least 5-7 minutes (which is known to have anti-androgenetic effects)... eat protein and biotin-rich foods too and take multi/b-vitamins (they&#x27;ll only help in the long run)</li>
            <li> This works, but very slowly.  Have been using it for 5 years and a have a bit more hair up front than before.  It seems to have stopped the hair loss that I was having before.</li>
            <li> Will buy again. Price is very good and product helps keep hair as well as any on market&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it</li>
            <li> Well, I embellish a bit - but not by much. Yes, it does itch but it DOES regrow hair. I had a significant amount of hair loss from a side effect of a medication and for years was one of those guys who went around with a hat glued to his head. The regrowth has been gradual but it has been steady. I&#x27;m delighted to have the need to brush hair out from in front of my eyes again! As far as pricing, this Amazon offer is excellent. They&#x27;re selling a six month supply for roughly the same price that CVS charges  - for a ONE MONTH supply.</li>
            <li> I have RA and need the boxes (packages) delivered to my front door. Due to artificial hand joints I can not lift many boxes when left on sidewalk or in driveway, which has been where I find them for the past few months.  PLEASE print on delivery label: place package next to front door on 2nd floor landing.</li>
            <li> this kirkland works just as well for my husband as the brand name at a fraction of the price...i will reorder in 6 months...talk about convenience with this product...6 months worth arrives each time and you just put it in the medicine cabinet and forget about it...</li>
            <li> I have not yet to see results because it has only been 3 weeks, but overall the price of the product is insanely cheap! Costco has this same exact products for $47.99 can you beat that? And also the packaging was excellent, and was shipped on time. Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have used it and no side effects and it works for me. Value priced as well. I will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> Not everyone gets the results they want - but for me this product has given me thicker and more hair in the places where it was very thin.  I put it on three or four times a week - and that works for me.</li>
            <li> Really watery, honestly not sure if it works or not, the application process is too messy and annoying.  The dropper is just that, you have to put the solution on the spots in droplets, which just run off.  It ended up more on my temples and cheeks than it did on the spots I was trying to treat!</li>
            <li> good&lt;br /&gt;Kirkland Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men, 6 Month Supply&lt;br /&gt;men hair !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no women  good feel</li>
            <li> Hairy palms and patchy regrowth can&#x27;t drown out the awesome power of this magic elixir. Bald fish getting boring? Sick of those hair challenged guppies? Add a few drops to your tank&#x27;s filtration system and your little swimmers will be floating little fur balls in 4 to 6 weeks. (Results may vary).</li>
            <li> Actually works if you stick with it and this is a great value compared to what it costs in stores.</li>
            <li> It does the trick. my only complaint is that sometimes I feel the drop run down the back of my head. The foam is a better vehicle but is messier.</li>
            <li> Tried this for about four months. At the end of the time what I got was accelerated hair loss and the inability to run. I run 5K most days. But after the 3rd month of this I noticed extreme shortness of breath when running or walking up hill. At first I thought I had a virus or something. Then I also noticed palpitations with shortness of breath. I finally figured out that it must be the minoxidil. After stopping taking it for a few days I noticed slow improvement. Now, some two months after stopping taking it my running is much better, but still not quite back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If delaying nature is worth putting your body under extreme strain during exercise then have at it. But the side effects are real and it&#x27;s just not worth it. This is very dangerous stuff. It&#x27;s like fracking your head.</li>
            <li> Minoxidil at first it was use for medication for hypertension. But accidentally they observed that minoxidil can cure also hair loss and it’s a fact. That’s why when I make some color in my hair, it make my hair loss, that why I purchased some minoxidil in order to cure my hair loss because of the damage of some hair color. I choose Kirkland minoxidil cause I hear it has pure concentration of minoxidil. And really it fix the problem, my hair loss stop.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s effective - more hair growth.</li>
            <li> Best Deal on this product is Kirkland.  I&#x27;ve looked around and they really beat out most and the quality is there as I can see it working after 30 days use.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly bald by any means. I have male pattern baldness but to a light extent. I am getting the classic doughnut in the back of my head which is my worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using roagain foam, but its so much more expensive. Double the price for 50% less then what you get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kirkland signature is a great value.....if it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it pretty regularly for the past 2 or 3 years. Yeah I haven&#x27;t really gotten much worse, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any better either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I am starting to think that the rogaine may be worth the money. Yes your paying for a name, but sometimes those names hold a little more water then the no names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten no results from this, and if anything my hair has gotten thinner. When you first start using it your head itches like crazy from the alcohol which is horrible for your skin anyway. If you don&#x27;t scratch all your hair out then you have pretty good self control. I had to use massive amounts of conditioner to help my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it all comes down to it. You cant win over genetics.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Value for money. Grow hair quicker than you think.</li>
            <li> My husband put this stuff on hair for months and didn&#x27;t do anything! It was a complete waste of time and money for us.</li>
            <li> Today is the first day I&#x27;m trying this product. I hope by the end of the month I can see a little difference.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my BF as he thought his hair was falling out, okay it is.... It has slowed down some of the hair loss, and there is some re-growth in the crown section. He won&#x27;t use once it&#x27;s gone he says...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a week, so that&#x27;s something to bare in mind while reading about my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes my scalp slightly irritated for a couple of hours after each use, but I have enough willpower to resist scratching it.&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my hair look dark and wet until I wash it, which would be a problem for me if I worked around other people that I wanted to impress; I work in an auto-shop, so I couldnt care less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple times it has also left a white tint to my hair, and gave it a little bit of hardening, as if I had used hairspray. Once again, I didnt mind this too much, because it actually held my hair in place like a styling product would, and only took a minute to brush all the white out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my biggest problem is the never ending amount of dandruff you will get while using this. Invest in some anti-dandruff shampoo and it might help. It hasnt gotten rid of my flake problem, but it lowered it. You&#x27;ll pretty much have to comb your hair carefully and avoid all contact with the scalp, unless you want to walk around looking like you were in a snow storm. Some days I spent ten minutes trying to comb it all out, but it just keeps coming. Its an endless battle, and I think the best idea is to just make sure you only comb your hair and touch your scalp when absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all these things considered, I am willing to continue this product and give it a fair chance, because its not an inconvenience or embarrassment to my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you work/go to school and are around people that you care about seeing your greasy, white, dandruff infested hair, you might want to stay away. I&#x27;d say give it a week trial run, but considering I gave it a one day trial run, and it took the dandrufff a week to go away, I dunno&#x27; if it&#x27;s such a good idea...Unless you can test it out for free.&lt;br /&gt;Considering you care about thinning hair in the 1st place, my guess is you also care about lookingsilly with dandruff and slimy hair, so...You&#x27;re trading one insecurity for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip using it on the weekends or time frames when you plan on going out and socializing, and I think you&#x27;ll be fine. Unless the product never ends up working, of course &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The instructions say to only use it on the top/back of your head. Well I have been using it on the front hairline area. I&#x27;ve read that you really need to use it for about three months before you expect to see results. I was able to see some very slight new hair growth after about two months. I doubt this will give a bald man a full head of hair, but for light thinning and receding this product is definitely worth a try. There has been a definite noticeable difference. It has been about three months so far and I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Well,  this is Minoxidil for men.  This 6-month supply is half the price&lt;br /&gt;I paid for a three month supply at Walgreens.  You all need to go to&lt;br /&gt;goodrx.com to look for better pricing on drugs.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect. Why dont you make it in spray canister for a more even and more convenient application?</li>
            <li> I bought my 6month supply from a seller called ULUSH about 3 months ago. This product is horrible. I&#x27;ve lost more hair than I had at the beginning. My only problem in the beginning was thinning hair in one area of my head but after using this I&#x27;ve lost a lot of hair. I read online and saw that it might just be the initial shed but it never came back. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I feel the bottles I got were fake.</li>
            <li> There was NO indication that this does not work on frontal baldness until you open the box and the instructions state it will not work on frontal baldness. If I had known this, I would have not wasted my time and money. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 6 months of this stuff and out $25. Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> My son is starting to lose his hair and I know from being in the medical profession that minoxidil is approved by the FDA to clinically grow your hair back. Buying this product is not only a good deal but the amount that you get for the price is outstanding. Start growing your hair back today order this product.</li>
            <li> I need to keep applying and massaging more in order to continue increase. pair it with biotin it will work.</li>
            <li> Havent noticed anything yet... but lets see what happens in a couple months</li>
            <li> No noticeable hair change (even it seems like normal hair loss has continued) over the 6 months or year since i bought this.  My personal doctor is of the opinion that Rogaine (and Minoxidil which shares its active ingredient) either don&#x27;t produce ANY results or only create fine vellus hairs that will fall out the instant you stop taking it.  Supposedly Propecia actually works but has many more side effects so you might not be a good candidate for that considering your specific genetics or family history.</li>
            <li> Very good price for this product! If this works for you, this is the way to buy it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use it after reading more about the product.</li>
            <li> Um... I know what matters is inside the box, but this is new? Is the box suppose to come damaged like this?</li>
            <li> I had been noticing for the last couple of years that my hair was thinning on the crown of my head. I started using another product for three months and didn&#x27;t see any results.  I did some more research and decided to give Kirkland Minoxidil a chance. I found the product very easy to use. Just take the included dropper and put a few drops of Minoxidil on the problem spot twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a six month supply and it looked like it started working around the third month. I ordered more of the product during the fifth month when I noticed that I could no longer see my scalp as easily on the top of my head. I feel very lucky to have found a great product that actually helps prevent hair loss, I&#x27;m grateful for to have found Kirkland Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> seems to work effectively.  but without side by side studies you really never know if its your nature that keeps hair growing or this stuff.  thing I didn&#x27;t like is did not state made in the USA - meaning likely China that has little checks and balances on product sales.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> the shipment arrived promptly and appears to be working.However, it will take about three months to determine results for a proper rating.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Kirkland Minoxidil at Costco when it was as cheap as it is at this store. Then they upped the price to two to three times the original. So I&#x27;m glad I can get it here for a greatly reduced price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to stop loss of hair from the top of my head near the back. No, guys, it doesn&#x27;t grow it anywhere else that I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> It really does work. Don&#x27;t expect immediate results though, it does take a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Great price and prompt shipping. This is my second course of treatment with minoxidil for moderate alopecia. Of course, once a hair root dies it can&#x27;t be revived. As mentioned in the accompanying literature, the med is for the back of the scalp; but I&#x27;ve had some success at top and front...nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to wash the scalp firstly, don&#x27;t use a hair conditioner, and let the scalp dry thoroughly for maximum absorption of the medication. Don&#x27;t use a hair dryer or apply hair gel until the mediation has dried on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have only been using Rogaine for two months now, but I can tell that it is working. A few things I have learned: do not overuse this product! Stick to the 1 ml regardless if you have hair loss all over or not! It&#x27;s not worth the side effects. I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to be applying because I know they say only use 1 ml, but since I have diffuse thinning all over, I feel like I need to apply it in back as well. Anyway I am going to use less of it and try to apply more evenly. I hear that it works all over regardless of how much you apply, hope this is true. I have headaches if I use too much.</li>
            <li> Great s***t!!! Love it! Brought my front hair back! Young dudes need to get it as sons as possible for better results!</li>
            <li> Great product! Very good price. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Good buy!  Good service!  Product works for me.  It just requires consistency.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use. I prefer to use rogaine in the morning and this one at night.</li>
            <li> Works as well or better than Rogaine.  Husband has been using Rogaine for many years, successfully.  Ordered this Kirkland brand and he says it is the same, or even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.  What a huge savings.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine, and I will likely order again.</li>
            <li> Inchy scalp problems. I had to discnontinue. No way could I sufffer the discomfort of scratching hair all day..</li>
            <li> I have NO WAY of knowing if this is chemically the same as Ro Gaine.. It was sent to me right on time and what I asked for.. Hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the reviews and the price. The top of my head was extremely thin. Nothing but scalp. It is more like a 3 - 4 month supply however the top of my head is fully grown in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 39 year old male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got out of the shower in the morning I would apply it while my hair is wet.. About 1 and 1/2 dropper of it. I found that when my hair dried with it already applied it wasn&#x27;t greasy or anything like other people complain of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have before and after pictures and all my friends and family are amazed.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on my frontal receding hairline. I don&#x27;t even use it every day as directed and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> I have not started to try this, but I&#x27;ve used before minoxidil and is very good. This product is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I lost much  more hair than before. I used it for more than two months and everyone ask me why I loss my hair so fast.</li>
            <li> fast shipping..love it.. product is not messy... clean use... 1st week of usage..waiting to see results..but recommend over other generic brand</li>
            <li> It works for me. Have stopped my hair thinning. No need for any other hair gel. I&#x27;m a repeat buyer of this product.</li>
            <li> Didnt use this product as it was not what I wanted. Have no recommendation. Can not comment on its effectiveness</li>
            <li> maybe. i don&#x27;t know. it was difficult to tell if it worked. seemed like it might a little but nothing i could really put my finger on.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am too cheap to buy the name brand stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:  My hair has regrown.  Yay!  I was doing it twice a day as directed but now only at night and my hair seems to be maintaining it&#x27;s level of baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.  when you put this in your hair, it can get flaky or seem like you put product in your hair...but only around your bald spot.  not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I am also on generic propecia and Nioxin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past two years. My friends wonder why they are going bald and I am not.&lt;br /&gt;This is so effective that I am growing hairs all over my chest, legs, and oh, long bushy hairs around my testicles.</li>
            <li> i have only been using this for about a month and already i see the difference, not just me but friends and family have also, but i have also been using biotin along with this product</li>
            <li> Seems to work...&lt;br /&gt;Need more time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Wonderful service by the supplier.</li>
            <li> This product is not for a man&#x27;s receding hairline only for back of head hairloss.  Product says will not work on receding hairline.  This should have been said in the description.  To make matters worse, you can not even return the unopened box because Amazon refuses to take it back stating that it contains a hazardous material!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing really works. Albeit I use twice the dose.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years now and it really has not regrown the hair in the crown area of my head as much as it has been a good hair thickner.</li>
            <li> I am a 60-year old woman with a receding hairline. The left side was worse because I sleep on that side which runs against the pillow. This product has brought new hair growth to those trouble spots. The photo shows short wisps of hair growing in. It&#x27;s not lush growth but it makes a world of difference to my hairline because my hair is so fine and thin. I stopped using it for a couple of months and had a bald patch. It took a couple of months to get it filled in again.&lt;br /&gt;This product is for men but I&#x27;ve not had a problem. It&#x27;s a good price IMO. I will have to use it everyday to maintain this bit of growth. I use it just once a day after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I see i lose hair when i shower all the time. I used rogaine foam for two years and when i shampoo i saw hair in the soap. I decided to try a direct application approach so i went with the cheap stuff since i figured its the same hormone. To be honest since using this instead of rogaine foam my hair has retained and i hardly see any when i shampoo. The problem is finding time to let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me, when i stopped applying it is saw more shedding. When i started again it stopped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it actally owrks.  I mix it with 2% solution.  It is too soon to evlaute what will be several months of daily use. th erpoduct arrived on time and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> Why pay the premium for Rogaine, when this is just as good?  I used Rogaine for years, shelling out hundreds of dollars on the product.  I finally decided to go with this generic version which seems to do the job just as well at only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son,23 yo starting to thin on top and it REALLY works but you have to use it daily,forever</li>
            <li> This is basically like the Rogaine foam from all the commercials (Same active ingredients, same strength) except you apply it with an eyedropper and it is about a quarter of the price.&lt;br /&gt;It only comes with one dropper, so be careful you don&#x27;t throw it away when you are done with a bottle. It can take as long as 6 months or so to make a difference</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this treatment after 2 months because it made my scalp very itchy.  I hope this isn&#x27;t a problem for most people but I just couldn&#x27;t take it any more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and much more affordable than the name brand product, also with free shipping, it costs less.</li>
            <li> It is tough to tell if this product works long term. Since I started using it 2 years ago, I haven&#x27;t seen significant hair loss, but who knows what it would have looked like had I not been taking it. Did not regrow hair. But, may well have kept it in check.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and product</li>
            <li> The price is hard to beat but you seldom get the same product. There is no consistency in the quality. Some are good others seem like your just buying alcohol.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and it does work. However, the person using it must consistently use it according to directions and must be patient because it does require ample time for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a medical professional, however, I would suspect results could vary depending on individual health-genetic characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusively, I am 52 years of age, and there has been a positive-noticable difference.</li>
            <li> Who really knows, I started using this years ago and I still have my hair.  But I also hop on one foot (the right one) and do two claps and a spin each time.</li>
            <li> Same as the name brand at a fraction of the price.  Keeping the old pate with something where nothing would otherwise be.</li>
            <li> compared to Rogaine you get the same product for the same effects at half the price. its an awesome purchase</li>
            <li> I will see if it work after two month.</li>
            <li> Good price,slow shipping</li>
            <li> I am a woman - this stuff brought my hair back, which was gone for almost a decade. Worked wonders! My hair looks great now! I also use Toppik, great hair day (around part and front), and tape extensions - total natural look. Best ever and I&#x27;ve been trying products for 15 yrs. I know my stuff. Only worry is possible effects on the heart in the long run - I&#x27;ve read a few things about it and it makes me cringe.. but it does work!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> dont know why it worked the first time i tried a box of 3 month supply and reordered and used but hair just went back to how it looked before my first order wish it kept working .</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a review for people who are looking at this product versus the foam or Rogaine brand.  I started using minoxidil over a year ago and began with the Rogaine foam. about 6 months ago I decided to try the Kirkland brand topical solution because the difference in price was so huge (You can practically get a years supply for 3 months of Rogaine foam!).  I was a bit nervous about trying a generic brand and switching from the foam because of some of the other reviews I read.  Here is my experience with and comparison of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no negative experience from either of the products.  No itchiness or redness of the scalp or anything like that.  I like to keep my hair pretty short but I feel that as it gets longer before I get my hair cut the foam will not dry as nicely in my hair and leave it a little crispy (cant think of a better word).  Not really a big deal as I just run my fingers through my hair to break it up.  The topical solution doesnt seem to do that but it does take a bit longer to dry.  So at night when I go to bed I will get some residue on my pillow, however, this hasnt caused any issues messing up a pillow case or anything like that.  I also like the dropper used to apply the topical solution a lot more.  It measures exactly, where as with the foam it says to use a cap full but that never seems like enough.  In addition in the summer when its hot the foam starts dissolving into a liquid in my hand almost immediately which I never liked.  As far as effectiveness I havent noticed any difference between the two products and think they both work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end if your debating between foam or topical solution or Rogaine versus Kirklands I would definitely recommend the Kirklands topical solution.  You will save a ton of money and I actually like the application of it better.</li>
            <li> works as effective as the original Rogaine 5% foam. Minoxidil is very effective in crown area, it&#x27;s not that effective/ may not work in receding hairlines in the front area of the head.</li>
            <li> Been using since 10/09.  Slowing down entropy drastically, although not stopping it completely.  Sure, a little dandruff and a little itch, but what&#x27;s the alternative?</li>
            <li> While no one can argue that the price point for this item is exceptional, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up compared to the brand name Rogaine Foam.  The Kirkland Minoxidil left my hair very greasy for up to a couple hours after each use, which was not pleasant not convenient, especially when using it before bedtime and waking up with a grease stained pillow.  I only used it for a couple weeks before switching back to the brand name Rogaine, which may be more expensive, but to me the higher price was worth it in this case.</li>
            <li> Used for years, best buy on the net.</li>
            <li> This was a refill order. I used up 6 month supply and was happy with the results. To keep any results, you have to continue using minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use minoxidil.</li>
            <li> I used to pay $20 for a 3-month supply of minoxidil at Walmart - for $7 dollars more I get twice as much and don&#x27;t have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this because I wasn&#x27;t aware that you have to use it forever or your hair could start thinning out again. I&#x27;m not vain enough to have to be a slave to this chemical, so I ever even finished using the first bottle.</li>
            <li> It works great. Like that it isn&#x27;t the foam.</li>
            <li> Really helped me a lot</li>
            <li> great price..good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going bald...it might be time to go ahead and accept my fate with a straight razor</li>
            <li> 27 year old male, fit/eat healthy/ take mulitivitamins/ low body fat/ take 10k mcg of biotin.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the whole eat healthy to grow hair is BS. I already do all of the above and was still shedding.. I suspect it has more to do with my stressful career. Anyhow, this product worked well for me. I noticed my hair getting thicker (as in more strands) on the top and it feels more even with the amount of hair on the back of my head. Even my hair stylist noticed (although she noticed it on the top right side which is the side I tilt my head to, lol). Very highly recommend this. Lastly, you can&#x27;t stop using this or your hair will begin to thin out again.. trust me, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;You will have to get used to the fact that It&#x27;s liquid.. you will feel it running on your scalp particularly if your hair is very thin. I can imagine this is more effective than the foam version as it is more likely to contact your scalp and get to work. Also NOTE: it takes a while for this to dry. I usually apply texture paste and then use the drip applicator to start at the forehead and tilt my head back for it to cover my scalp. Hope this review helps.. best of luck(fist bump emoji)  OH and one last thing, you will not notice results for about a month, be patient!!!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery and is working!</li>
            <li> Has worked for me well for past 5 years of ordering it.</li>
            <li> great products. Thanks</li>
            <li> Experienced flaking and itching like the other reviewers. I don&#x27;t doubt this stuff works, but I&#x27;m switching to the foam for the time being since it appears to have made my scalp a bit more sensitive.</li>
            <li> Good price for generic alternative. Leaves hair greasy though; I put on both does at same time before bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know if it works well because I couldn&#x27;t stand the greasiness and itchiness and had to stop using it. I tried watering it down but it just developed crystals! I guess you get what you pay for. Also BE AWARE that you cannot return this product because it&#x27;s considered a flammable or hazardous substance.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very low price.  It works great, but the only side effect I have had is graying hair from using the product.  No big deal.  A little hair dye and problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 5% Minoxidal solution for about ten years I&#x27;m un my late sixties. Both my brothers are bald but my full head of hair is still on my head.&lt;br /&gt;Use it everyday without fail and it will work for you.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for about 4years  and it did work good ,but late last year 2012  i feel this product change ,b-4 i would get a small itches  feeling when i apply it and could feel on my finger and it work.  I stop using it cause i truly believe is not the same product  they even change the box .</li>
            <li> Although it seemed to work well, it is very potent! Be extremely careful if you choose to use this product. My fiance had to stop using it after about 6 months of use because he ended up having a reaction to it. His scalp, face, ears, and neck began to itch real badly after 3 months, and his eyes got swollen and his skin was red. It took 2 weeks of non use for the itching and swelling to completely go away. He tried being more careful with the product by making sure he washed his hands real well after each use and by making sure to apply it right and use it in plenty of time before bed so it didn&#x27;t get on the pillow, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help! He had to stop using it all together and he has not used it since. His hair did get noticeably thicker, but with how he reacted to it, it just is not worth it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the worst case of hair loss in the world but a moderately receding hairline (I&#x27;m 20 years old). After 3 months of this my hair is definitely getting thicker and is almost back to where it was in High School.  The result is surprising because is even says on the bottle that it works better on the crown than at the hairline, nonetheless it still managed help regrow my hairline.  And at a 1/4 the price of rogaine it is a must have for someone with hairloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE PATIENT, it might not seem like its doing anything for a while and it will make you shed more hair, but after you shed the hair it grows back stronger, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working the whole time, then I got my first haircut after 3 months, and it was definitely thicker than when I started.  I also used Nizoral shampoo in combination, so I think that contributed to my results.</li>
            <li> Good price but still waiting for my natural rug to come to sprout from my follicly challenged scalp. Maybe more hopeful science will find a better solution.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and still have hair - seems to do what it say it will do -</li>
            <li> this did not help my hair at all!  the walmart brand is great.  would not recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have been using 5% minoxidol for years. This brand works as well as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product and with very reasonable pricing from amazon</li>
            <li> I am using it (for beard growth) for about 3 weeks (I think) and I am already seen results :O It works great, I&#x27;ll use for 6 months and then see if this is real or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a minoxidil based product. I first started using it when I was about 25 and started to notice hair loss. After a couple of years I stopped using it - don&#x27;t really know why. I&#x27;m now approaching 37 and the hair loss has accelerated in the last year. I thought I would give this a go based on seemingly good ratings. Using a drop applicator for this product makes it all the more difficult to work with. It leaves an oily film and takes hours to dry. Worst of all I&#x27;me 6 applications in (3 days worth) and am having huge flakes of residue and/or skin sloughing off in my hair. This stuff is a mess. Maybe it works for someone but it certainly does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Works as it should but it did take some time; maybe about 4-6 months. I started taking it with [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] and my hair loss stopped completely, and it is now growing back VERY quickly. The combo of the two of these is the best hairloss solution I have ever seen. Better than even the prescription stuff. Give them a try!</li>
            <li> My husband says this works just like the original rogaine at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Recommend the best products</li>
            <li> very good company and product too !</li>
            <li> This stuff works guys, I had a receding hairline and it was scary far back. I was embarrassed after leaving the barber shop. Now 1 1/2 months later, I been using this stuff twice a day....Been noticing growth..Got new fade and edge up and it looks Great! My hairline is back, grew, lowered, whatever you want to call it.&lt;br /&gt;See, I was using this stuff before and it worked, I stopped and the hair fell back again..But before this, I was using Minoxidil 15%! They had it on amazon, and now you have to have a subscription to get that stuff, bus huh? But this stuff works slower, but it works. Buy it guys, a whole 6 month supply. I wish the Rock had used this stuff, he would have came back looking awesome. And all that money, you&#x27;d think they would prevent that stuff.</li>
            <li> For those of us who use it daily, year after year, we like the price drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minoxidil does indeed work, and some will benefit more than others. For best results you need to start using it before you lose too much hair. If you&#x27;ve been bald for decades don&#x27;t expect miracles. It may take a while before you see new growth. Be patient with it as it&#x27;s not going to happen overnight. It might be months before you notice any real difference. In the meantime, know that at the least, it&#x27;s probably keeping you from losing even more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it regularly in my late 30s while I still had all my hair and it made it fuller. I&#x27;m 63 now and still have a very full head of hair even though it has changed from brown to silver. I think it looks better now than when I was younger with brown hair. All my friends have lost most of their hair a long time ago. Hey, I tried to tell them way back when. Might be too late for them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you start using it and getting good results, you DO have to keep using it if you want to keep the new growth. Also, my barber tipped me off that you do not have to use it twice a day as they recommend. Once you get your thin/bald spot covered up, most people can go to once a day with good results. Of course, keep an eye on it and if you start to see too much hair in the shower drain then go back to twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, some prostate prescriptions will also make your hair grow, and doctors will give it to you for that reason. But you should know that there is a downside, in that it, uh, how shall we say, dries up the well so to speak, (O.o) for as long as you continue to use it. Once you stop, the well will soon be restored, so it&#x27;s not a permanent drought. I suppose you could take it to speed up hair growth by using it along with Minoxidil, then stop after your bald spot is gone, but it also takes months before you will see any results while having to put up with less than satisfying \\&quot;happy endings\\&quot; on date night. Your significant other won&#x27;t really notice the difference, but you sure will. You will be so thankful that it&#x27;s not permanent. I assume by now you&#x27;ve caught on to what I&#x27;m referring to.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Makes my hair look thicker and had many comments from friends as to that affect. I plan on continueing to use it and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try it out.  My hair has been falling out since I was 18, now I am 50 and have most of it so I figured that maybe this would reverse things.  I am trying for the hairline on the forehead, even though they say it won&#x27;t work some say it has, so why not try it out...</li>
            <li> Very good product. I am using it for nearly ten years. Amazon price well below retail store price.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002VLZHLI Kirkland  Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men, 6 Month Supply]] I have been using this product since December 27 and so far it makes my existing hair thicker and fuller and I have see new hair follicles. I will keep using the product as directed to eliminate a small bald spot.</li>
            <li> Have&#x27;nt used it yet, but it looks legit as the one used from Costco. Will post a follow up if anything goes wrong.</li>
            <li> I find this product to be very effective. Not only have I experienced hair growth in the area near the back, but also regenerative growth in the frontal area as well. Priced right and I find it to be very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and I was almost bald! I have at least 2 times more hair on my head now. I noticed the change after about one month and it is getting better and better.</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t bring back hair once you have last it but will help you keep it. Good product and service.</li>
            <li> Same as you can buy in CostCo.  But much cheaper.  Great value.</li>
            <li> This is as good as the branded minoxidil. This is the second time I have ordered this. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> This works for me, have been using for over a year and had great results</li>
            <li> This is a good for the price. However, it makes your hair look bad. Also makes ur scalp itchy because of the alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the CVS and Walgreen Minoxidil 5%. They are relatively more expensive than this product, but they had the same problems</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this product would work on me since I am pass 50, but it started working right away.  I could see results after only aweek.  Great product.</li>
            <li> used it for about 1 year and there is some hair growth in the crown. I would recommend the product at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> I used to use another brand of minoxidil before using Kirkland. (That was a known brand in another country) It was making my scalp itchy.&lt;br /&gt;After using Kirkland Minoxidil, my scalp stops itching.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using Alpecin Caffeine shampoo. Using these two products really help to regrow my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;You can find Alpecin here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OSNBX2/ref&#x3D;oh_o00_s00_i00_details</li>
            <li> I have no idea whether this is really slowing my hair loss, but it&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  So ... why not?</li>
            <li> I have noticed a fantastic difference in the thickness and I will continue to order it</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the liquid over the foam--not as much gets wasted by sitting on the hair itself.  If you&#x27;re not trying to use too much, drying time is reasonable (on shorter, damp hair, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair&#x27;s ready to groom within an hour of applying this), and I haven&#x27;t noticed the greasy feeling others have mentioned.  Of course, I wash my hair twice daily (a habit I picked up from using the foam twice a day), so there is little chance for buildup.  My scalp gets a little itchy, but it&#x27;s nothing that is unbearable and I haven&#x27;t noticed dandruff flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to whether it works... well, it&#x27;s minoxidil, folks.  Those that don&#x27;t notice improvement with the foam will not see an improvement with the liquid.  For some people, it only halts existing hair loss.  For others, it creates a bloom of peach fuzz that turns into normal hair.  For others, still, it does nothing at all.  In all cases, the results take time to be able to accurately call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to give it six months.  If you shorta-kinda think it&#x27;s working, but can&#x27;t say for sure, give it a year.  If you know beyond debate that it&#x27;s not working, don&#x27;t reorder and think of ways to use the money you&#x27;re saving.  Naturally if you&#x27;re thrilled with the product... you don&#x27;t need me telling you to party on.</li>
            <li> Best product I ever used. it stopped my hair loss and also started growing more hair. I have been using it for almost 3 years, acts like a gel on my hair, I don&#x27;t get bored or tired using it, because I only use it once, and still showing it&#x27;s effects amazingly.</li>
            <li> This works good, but... once you stop using it you will lose the gains.</li>
            <li> I used different brands(french brands and american brands) and I prefer the others over this one. Rogaine for example is better. It takes longer to see results and I did not like the alcohol in kirkland&#x27;s minoxidil. I will not buy ot again unless i am really broke and can&#x27;t afford rogaine.also Experienced dandruff since using this</li>
            <li> Already gave this a great write-up on another order. It won&#x27;t help everyone, but it does help some. Just pour the contents into a 3oz. spray bottle and use that as your applicator rather than the silly eye-dropper.</li>
            <li> Shipped as promised.  Thanks</li>
            <li> So... I&#x27;ve used this for about 5 years, and it totally works. People on here comparing the product to Rogaine foam need to know this is NOT a foam product. This is the generic formula of the original liquid Rogaine. Liquid Rogaine works better than the foam, specifically because the foam dries up &amp; once it&#x27;s dry it DOES NOT WORK. The liquid products are supposed to be a touch \\&quot;oily\\&quot; so they last longer on your scalp, and more of the minoxodil gets absorbed. That&#x27;s specifically how it works, so people on hear complaining about it being oily, or not drying, or saying it doesn&#x27;t style as well as the foam are missing the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day--once before I go to bed, and once in the morning, right after showering. There is irritation sometimes, and if you have scratches on your head--like from brushing too hard--the product will irritate those scratches, and itches will occur. This is exactly the same whether you use this product or Rogaine--they are equivalent. If your head itches, take a day or two away from the product and let your scalp heal. You won&#x27;t lose all your hair in two days, I promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, it&#x27;s all gross. No one choses to use this product, or to go bald. But it&#x27;s choice, and if your hair is important to you, this product works better than any other topical product. And it&#x27;s definitely the same as liquid Rogaine.</li>
            <li> I am a male of African decent. I don&#x27;t think this is a good product for my hair type. It made my scalp itchy which made the hair loss worse due to the urge to relieve the itching. I RECOMMEND getting a rich multi vitamin with 300mcg&#x27;s of Vitamins and other vital minerals for your over all health. This has stimmulated hair growth in my problem areas and I get good benifits from the other vitamins and minerals in my liquid multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li> This product has an excellent reputation, but it takes time to see if it will work on an individual. I will report back after I have used it for several months.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It arrived on time and as described in the product description. I recommend this product to all who pay for Rogaine.</li>
            <li> i like to apply this to my back end to keep me warm in the winter</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price. i have been using this Kirkland minoxidil for over an year now and i can see the visible results and reduce in the hairfall and regrowrth too.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know of ROGAINE but i would recommend this product if you are suffering from hairloss.</li>
            <li> Liquid Minoxidil can&#x27;t be found it my local Costco for over a year. Sad. It was the best product at the best price. Now I buy online.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I hear it does for others.</li>
            <li> All I can say is... this stuff works for me! I am no longer losing hair, and definitely see regrowth. Can&#x27;t beat this price. Thank you Kirkland!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product on the price side. Quality is as good as the more expensive.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> To begin, this product actually did work for me and it did quicker than expected, in about two weeks. It is also very, very affordable. Unfortunately, I experienced an adverse reaction with my skin turning bright red on areas exposed to the product in addition to some extreme itching. My dermatologist believes I might be allergic to some ingredient and suggested using name brand Rogaine and using the foam version. No reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from using this product, it&#x27;s great for the money, it actually did work. However, the itching and discoloration was unbearable to me.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be working - testosterone supplementation has me chasing my tail on this LOL</li>
            <li> It is what it is! advantage from buying on amazon is what? it is price</li>
            <li> Tried it for a year. For the first six months, I wasn&#x27;t following the instructions strictly, but I want to try it again. I followed every single thing in there, but nothing happened. Maybe my hair is weird :/</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with a good scalp cleansing shampoo this product does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Good product, but use it carefully. thanks!</li>
            <li> using as directed... wish me luck</li>
            <li> UPDATE  VERY DISAPOINTED  , ALL THE BOTTLES DID NOT HAVE THE  SEAL ON THEM . ONE LEAKED . BUT MOST OF ALL NO HAIR GROWING ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD  .  2 THUMBS DOWN.</li>
            <li> JUST STARTING USING IT, NOT SURE IF IT WORKS. MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEND THIS SURVEY 3-6 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE FOR A TRUE ANSWER.</li>
            <li> Same as the &amp;#34;R&amp;#34; brand but saves me hundreds of dollars a year.</li>
            <li> yes it works for me, i heard also that if you use propecia the hair will grow twice</li>
            <li> Good price and it works</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18 year old son on the recommendation of his dermatologist. He has seen new growth already.  He&#x27;s very happy with his results thus far.</li>
            <li> i will see the results after i use it for 3 months i guess</li>
            <li> MADE MY HAIR FALL OUT.  THIS DOES NOT WORK AT ALL STAY AWAYYYYYY.  STAY AWAYYYYY</li>
            <li> This has the same active ingredient as high dollar hair growth items do and is definitely worth the cheap price!  This is one case where you get what you pay for! You get MUCH more!  Works great but please be patient for NOTHING works over night!</li>
            <li> I have, in the past, used the Kroger brand of Minoxidil. I find this Kirkland brand to be the same in application. Yes, it does leave the hair looking a bit as if you&#x27;d put gel in it, but only if I use too much. I apply it a few drops at a time rather than dousing the whole dosage at once. Take up only a few drops into the dropper, apply, rub in. Repeat several times until you figure you&#x27;ve gotten a full dosage&#x27;s worth. Wash hands thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had good luck with this method using the Kroger minoxidil. I should note that I am a woman whose hair loss is more generalized than it is in men. I use it once per day rather than twice to minimize any ill effects it might have for a female (the &amp;#34;women&#x27;s&amp;#34; version is half strength--that&#x27;s the only difference--why pay more for less? Just use the men&#x27;s half as often or at half dosage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this early January 2015 (because all products these days do vary and it&#x27;s important to know when a reviewer bought theirs). I will update review after a couple months of using it to report hair growth results.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and I found that after receiving it they do specify it is for use on the crown of the head and not for frontal loss of hair.</li>
            <li> Well, quite satisfactory</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but this stuff works great for me. I started to see that I was losing a little hair on the back of head and decided to give this a try. I started to grow back hair within a few months. It leveled off after a while and I have to keep using it in order not to start losing hair again, but I&#x27;m super happy to have it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rite Aids 5% for many years and have felt very satisfied with the results.  I only used it once a day, so my results might have actually been better.  But nevertheless, I felt that my hair loss was minimal and that it did regenerate new growth.  I am only talking about the vertex area. I did not get the initial loss of hair, which does seem to be the case with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I was maintaining the hair on my vertex for years with the Rite Aid minoxidil, and now that I&#x27;ve switched to Kirkland (both 5%), I&#x27;m losing a lot of hair.  I&#x27;ve been using the Kirkland brand for about 2 months.  The ingredients look the same.  Can&#x27;t figure out why the sudden hair loss, using 2 products that both have 5% minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I typically am extremely satisfied with Kirkland products, it&#x27;s just that this one is a mystery to me.  It&#x27;s just not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to switch back to the Rite Aid brand and see what happens.  In the meantime, I will give this 2 stars, since the price is so good, but for some reason, it&#x27;s just not working, in fact, the loss seems to be accelerating.</li>
            <li> I think it keeps my existing hair. I do not think it adds hair!  I have been using it for over two years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing my use of the minoxidil as it seems my hair can retain a little more of its thickness in the front where it has been receding. I&#x27;ve also been using this in conjunction with a set of hair clippers, and keeping the sides and back pretty short and the top slightly shorter than the front. Hopefully I can prevent more loss of that hair while using this!</li>
            <li> This product works as advertized.  Costs much less than the brand name product and does the same thing.  My hair is comming back.</li>
            <li> I have been using 5% minoxidil for 1.5 months . I notice some white hair growing on the temple areas- I am not sure if this is due to minoxidil. Also, I notice my hair is getting slightly thicker. The bad news is my heart rate goes up after using. Not sure if minoxidil is going to ruin my heart . I would rather go bald than getting a heart attack.</li>
            <li> Dont let hairloss discourage you there are answers to it and this stuff works. For me it seemed to immediately stop my hairs from falling out. First a little background. Im 43 at time of this review, I have what would be the early stages of hairloss some thinning on top and bit of a receding hairline still most would think its not a problem and that it looks good, but its not what it was in my early to mid twenties. Im also into fitness and keeping fit and looking good are things I consider important. Now Ive been experiencing mild hairloss since I was about 27 years old, first noticed it at the front of my hairline and also had a callic making it look like a slight bald spot on back right of my head so I combed my hair over to cover it but also realized that if I had hairloss this would make it more noticeable. I did what I could to keep eating right, keep my stress low, exercise, drink alot of water, vitamins, flax seed oil etc as always helped my training and nourishes the hair.&lt;br /&gt;  So this year I realized nothing was stopping the hair loss. I could accept my fate or fight it before I just give in to it. So after some investigation I started with spironolactone (a dht blocker) applied topically to the scalp. This helped quite a bit and made my scalp stop itching. But I still had hairloss daily. I looked around some more and found out about Nizoral a dandruff shampoo which has an amazing ability to also block dht at the follicles. I started doing this 2-3 times a week after the gym and leave it on for 20-30 min. This is recomended for the shampoo to absorb in. Still the hairloss continued but seemed to slow down more. I finally took a shot at minoxidil and within days I had no more hairloss and in 2 weeks found that I have several hair coming in at the hailine. At this time (3-4 weeks of once daily usage) it is noticeable and showed my wife and shes agrees at the difference. I took a few pics and in 6 mo to a year Im sure it will be more dramatic. I take it once a day with a cotton swab and wipe the thinning areas which for my are hairline (you dont have to get crazy rubbing it in just cover the area concerned crown and I apply some to sides of head by my temples.&lt;br /&gt;So heres the recipe for stopping hairloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DHT blockers &#x3D; (nizoral shampoo 2-3 times a week let it soak it 20-30 min then rinse followed by spirolactone applied in morning or night, doesnt get rinsed out til you shampoo again with the nizoral)&lt;br /&gt;Hair growth stimulant &#x3D; (minoxidil applying 1ml by dropper and rub on areas affected crown and hailine and throughout)&lt;br /&gt;There is alot of info on the net and how these ingredients work.

            <li> There is no doubt it is working,I found virtually no hair after 3 weeks in the bathroom.The side effects were bad though.&lt;br /&gt;I had chest pain, nervousness and depression.I am going to have to find something else.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old male and my hairline has been receding for about 3 years now. I was missing about an inch and a half of hair on each side, and about an inch deep. I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day, once at night and once in the morning for 3 months in combination with some saw palmetto extract pills, and I&#x27;ve seen some good results! Is my hairline fully restored? No, but it is getting close and is definitely way less noticeable. The product says you won&#x27;t see results for about 4 to 6 months, so maybe I still have more hair to regain. I saw noticeable results after two months. It starts with little blond hairs (maybe different colors for others, i have light brown hair) and eventually they color in. I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because it could be the saw palmetto that is what is helping (started both at the same time) and it does tend to leave a little bit of flakey stuff on your scalp after it dries. However, it just sorta looks like you had gel in your hair and it brushes out easily with your hand. It takes about an hour to dry, so you have to remember to put it in before you go to bed. Also, it may just have worked out this way, but I started seeing the gains after I started making sure that I rubbed the solution into my scalp pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much scent free... maybe a slight smell, but I can&#x27;t smell it on myself. If you want to take the same saw palmetto extract that I am using, I got it off the Puritan Pride website.. I got a 3 for 1 special on them, if they arent on sale now, wait a few days and check back. I think it ended up being 30 dollars with shipping for a 5 month supply (4 pills a day). Hope this help and I hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because the results will be prolonged. I am using Minoxidil for my eyebrows. However, hair on my eyebrows is starting to appear and they are not falling. The box states, results will appear within 6 months, as long as application of &#x27;twice a day&#x27; are followed. In addition, the best way to apply the formula is with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now with good results , easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommendable.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and excellent product</li>
            <li> Noticed an alright amount of growth in my hair after 8 months of doing this. For this price, its easy to keep going. Why buy Name Brand?</li>
            <li> I particularly like the group of small bottles instead of the large size.  Child-proof bottle caps are a nuisance and the bottle usually sits only semi-closed.  With smaller bottles there is less oxidation or damage from spills.  The product is first rate.</li>
            <li> On time shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> Took longer than I had hoped but it is slowly working for me. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now. I see some new hair appearing slowly. I am definitely not losing anymore so that is good. This is definitely the best thing I&#x27;ve tried for treating hair loss.</li>
            <li> Great works good.. A+ A+ A+ A A A a aa a a a a a aa aaaa  aaa  a</li>
            <li> One star, why?  If it were just for my experience with this product, I&#x27;d rate it zero stars.  The reason being: it didn&#x27;t help with any hair growth, whatsoever; it provided my scalp with a rather heavy amount of dandruff; and it caused my scalp to be itchy, at times.  I do understand hair growth treatment types don&#x27;t always work for everyone, but in this instance, this did not work for me.  I used this product for 6 months, giving it the benefit of the doubt, in hoping it&#x27;d start working; and it never did.  This was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work for you, but it sure didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Love it...have been using for more than 20 years. No issues except for occasionally itching red scalp, which is an easy fix with argon or chamomile oils. I would recommend mixing this with a carrier oil such as emu seems to penetrate a bit better and keeps down the inflammation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have given it to friends with hairloss. Wish I used it sooner before my forehead got bigger.</li>
            <li> I used it and nothing grow it was a completely waste of money, I would get better results from putting piss on my head</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Equate brand that I used to buy but way less money AND it comes in a 6 month supply versus the 3 from Wal-Mart.  The \\&quot;itch\\&quot; people say they experienced I can say I did not, or at least no more so than I did with the Equate (Wal-Mart) brand I used for 9 months.</li>
            <li> Delivered product was burning hot from the sun when delivered ... storage requirements are 66 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit ... the bottles and liquid must of have been at 85 degrees to 90 degrees which probably renders the solution no good ... and 3 to 5 day Prime Shipping?!  Bunch of BS.</li>
            <li> Handy containers.  Product is ok.</li>
            <li> Okay let me just say that I am not using this for scalp hair growth, but instead to speed up my facial hair growth on the connector areas. I will say that it does work with continued use but it can be drying if your skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair in the crown area and around my face on one side.  But I purchased the product mainly for my extremely sparse eyebrows that have been ravaged by thyroid disease.  I have been using this product for about 6 weeks, and I have to admit that mostly I use it only once per day.  It is quite oily, so I don&#x27;t use it in the morning before work.  It needs to stay on a minimum of an hour or two before it can be washed out, so it is quite inconvenient for me to use twice daily.  However, the area around my face has definitely improved.  It is nearly filled in.  The crown area has improved but isn&#x27;t quite filled in yet.  My eyebrows are where I have seen the least result.  There may be a few extra hairs, but not the fuzzy caterpillars I was hoping for. LOL  Going to keep using it for the full six months and will reevaluate then.</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> Kirkland doesnt seem to be as watery and prone to running all over the place as Equate, but when it dries&lt;br /&gt;I notice alot of flakiness on the scalp, this is really undesirable. I went back the the Equate version for this reason. No scalp irritation as others have described. As far as effectiveness, I havent noticed any difference between the two.</li>
            <li> I WILL LET YOU ALL KNOW HOW THIS WORKS OUT FOR ME. HAVEN&#x27;T GOT A BALD SPOT YET JUST STARTING TO LOSE SOME HAIR SO WE&#x27;LL SEE</li>
            <li> Abou 1/3 the price of Walgreens and seems about the same. Wish I had started sooner. As the base is alcohol, rub in a&lt;br /&gt;little moisturizing cream to prevent dry scalp and dandruff.  Great product and is working for me.</li>
            <li> Balding at the ripe age of 23, I started using the minoxidil to try to slow down the process. My hair is definitely thinning and you can see my scalp if you look down directly from the top. It has gotten progressively worse over time and my widow&#x27;s peak is also starting to get wider. I started using this about 2 months ago on my entire scalp. I do notice that my hair covers more of my scalp, but I still need a couple more months to get back to how it used to look. I will continue to update the review in the coming months, but so far so good! It definitely has stopped my hair from falling out. In the shower I used to have at least a hundred hairs in my hands when I rubbed my head, now I get very few falling out. It&#x27;s really incredible what difference it makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 26 now and the only thing preventing me from going completely bald is this solution. I&#x27;ve been somewhat inconsistent and I do notice a LOT more hairs falling out when I stop using it. Apparently the effects of minoxidil start to reverse after 45 days, but I would say it&#x27;s closer to 3 weeks and depends on your genetics. My uncles from my mom&#x27;s side were all bald by their mid twenties so I would imagine the DHT insensitivity in my hair follicles is more aggressive than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case I don&#x27;t plan on stopping any time soon. I&#x27;m too concerned with the risks of Finasteride to use that, but I know that if I started taking that along with using this solution it would help. I&#x27;ve just recently started using tretinoin 0.001% gel on my scalp after taking showers and that has surprisingly helped the regrowth process a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product is specifically for balding at the back of the head, not for receding hairline or general thinning hair... certainly wish this had been emphasized before I bought it for my husband.</li>
            <li> This product works as well as the name-brand one.  I have had no problems with it and my hair growth is very good.</li>
            <li> I have been useing this product fo a long time and have found that it works well and it cost much less then Rogaine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time ago, when I started to lose hair - in summer 1996! It took several months, until I realized that I was not paranoid, but then I immediately visited a doctor, who recommended me an anti-androgen topical called Alpicort F. It was a good stuff; I didn&#x27;t regrow any hair, but it was very reliable for maintenance. In the spring 1999, I started to apply 2% minoxidil in some bald areas in my temples, and it produced some mild regrowth of vellus hair. Hence I switched to 2% minoxidil. In the summer 2008, I found out that cheap generic forms of Rogaine became available, and I switched to 5%Kirkland minoxidil. To my surprise, it produced some very mild regrowth of hair in my temples. Apparently, the effectiveness of minoxidil increases with increasing dosage. It is true that I observed some dandruff during the first weeks of use, but after ca. 2 months it eventually disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must stress that during this time, I haven&#x27;t lost any hair (or at least, I couldn&#x27;t notice any loss in my temples). And I applied it only once a day. I think that minoxidil is great as a sort of prevention, and at least in my case, it didn&#x27;t lose effectiveness over time. For some people, the 5% version may be too weak. For me, stronger versions of minoxidil are too strong and damage my hair. I think that it is because I am a very good responder to this stuff. In 2011, I was experimenting with 15% minoxidil versions in thinned areas of my temples and it turned out to be a big mistake. It caused a quick telogen effluvium in me, it didn&#x27;t regrow any appreciable amount of hair, and what is worse, my hair became dependent on this concentration. After I quitted it, I started to shed very rapidly and my hair was virtually annihilated everywhere, where I had applied it. It has never regrown again. Since that time I have been trying to get it back (but that&#x27;s another story). I think that it is always better to combine 5% minoxidil with some DHT-blocker, rather than risking theRussian roulette with 10-15% minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I routinely order Kirkland minoxidil from their internet website, but recently, I was surprised that CostCo changed the manufacturer (for PERRIGO in Israel) and the bottles look differently. Some customers already shared their experience with this minoxidil that was not too positive. I have been taking it for one month only, so it&#x27;s not possible to evaluate its effictiveness yet, but I would be curious, what other people say. After 16 years of minoxidil use, all my scalp is already latently affected by DHT, and if I started to use some less effective stuff, I would lose all my hair at once.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped fast and product was how it was described. I would  recommend others to do business again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles.  But it has seemed to stop additional hair loss.  Based on that, I&#x27;ll continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> This is worst Product any1 could use for hair, It will damage your hair rather to protect, It develops extreme level of itching, makes scales on scalp, Highly dangerous, low Quality, worst results....  NEVER EVER USE IT.</li>
            <li> The product worked well on me.&lt;br /&gt;After using it, noticeable change within 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;1st mth. My hair stopped falling when I wash them from 15-20 hair to 1-5 hair.&lt;br /&gt;3-6mths. Visible growth of hair at vertex as well as at the crow where my hair was reseeding.&lt;br /&gt;After the 6 months I stopped using it for about 1 months and within 1 week I could see more hair started to fall when I washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is it gets sticky and takes time to dry. Also if you scratch when its dry you&#x27;ll get white dry flake like stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I think it helps to certain extent with reduce hair fall and some regrowth of hair but it obviously takes time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the product, the shipping took nearly 2 months although ETA was 6 days with Expedited Shipping!! (Overseas)</li>
            <li> has not worked yet. I have been using this for a while and nothing has happened so far. Definetly is not a quick  cure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old and am experiencing some thinning in the temple areas as well as the middle of the top of my head. I bought this not expecting a miracle but I&#x27;m about 2 months in to the program and I&#x27;ve only used it once per day right before I go to bed not the recommended two times per day and I&#x27;ve seen some great results. I don&#x27;t know how much weight it bears but I&#x27;ve taken some DHT blocking vitamins as well and thus far my thinning on top is really regrowing hair. The temple areas haven&#x27;t really been helped I do notice some short thin hairs in the areas so I&#x27;m going to keep applying it in hopes that it will thicken back up. For the price if you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the try. It does make my head itch and I have bad dandruff again -_- but I feel it&#x27;s working. I also notice that when I wash my hair I don&#x27;t see as much if any hair in my hands so it seems to have stopped the loss of hair at least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of Minoxidil and i&#x27;m sure there all about the same, but this was a great value. good delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using minoxidil 15% before amazon sadly stopped selling it, the 15% was waaay better than this, you could feel the concentration with 15% and all my friends noticed a difference in my hair, now with this 5% it keeps my hair from falling, I&#x27;m using only 1m per day at the morning, you can think of it as a styling products it keeps your hair neat as you combed it and save it from falling. with this price tag i have no problem to keep using it for life till i can find a higher concentration minoxidil product.</li>
            <li> After 4 months I can see clearly that it works and it works well. Hair on my head started growing where it hadn&#x27;t grown in over 10 years.. However the side effect are crazy, to say the least.  I&#x27;m growing hair EVERYWHERE!! (this is why it say for men) At fist I told myself that its worth a thick, full head of hair but then the rashes started (which I believe are due to hair trying to grow where its never grown before).  The rashes are NOT on my head.  The rashes are on the back of my neck, the back of my thighs and the back of my arms and it goes from being a rash to a burn and every itchy...  But some of us are hell bent on growing our hair out.  For ladies I would recommend not using the extra strength and stepping down but only if the women&#x27;s version doesn&#x27;t work for you like it didn&#x27;t work for me.  P.S. a week after I stopped, the rash and burns healed but left behind an ugly scaring.  Im sure it will clear up but will take time.  Ultimately WOMEN shouldn&#x27;t use the extra strength.  I will however try regular strength.  THIS PRODUCT WORKS! but read the side effects and stop as soon as you start to see any side effects.</li>
            <li> takes too long to see any results.</li>
            <li> Used it for for 8 months - no difference in hair growth.  It made my scalp itch constantly. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where it got those good reviews. Feel itchy on my skull and start loosing more hairs. I read review that it is normal and hair will start to grow back after having use it for a while. However, my hair never grow back after using it for 5 month. Now my hair is even thinner and I had toasted the left of bottles in trash can.</li>
            <li> Good price....fast ship</li>
            <li> Tried for 2 months, seems to have worked a bit on my crown however and it&#x27;s a big however my scalp became super itchy, flakey and apparently this was tearing up my scalp like acid... I would scratch and have blood and dead skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> the quality is deteriorated.</li>
            <li> I noted Costco switched to foam application which I&#x27;m sure means you&#x27;re getting less for your $$ so I was very happy to get the on line.  I&#x27;ve used it for 5+ years and it works.</li>
            <li> Okay, no problem, very good product, recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Already prompted several times always ok!&lt;br /&gt;Tutto ok, nessun problema, prodotto ottimo, consigliato.</li>
            <li> This product is not a joke . I have been using that for while , and it really made a big deferent . Just use it regularly every day and let it work .</li>
            <li> This stuff actually grew some hair 4 me.  Not a full regrowth, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than a flat, empty splotch!  Give it a shot!  XD</li>
            <li> i think it works.  have a 6 month supply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and I really can&#x27;t tell a difference in a before/after sense. It might work for others but definitely not me. I had fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> You must apply this to your scalp &amp;#34;and wait for it to dry&amp;#34;. It interfered with daily life too much. Couldn&#x27;t touch my scalp for 2-3 hours or put on a hat? Too annoying. Stopped using it almost immediately. I&#x27;ll just go bald, k?</li>
            <li> After I started using this product I had a increase in the amount of hair in the bathroom sink and not on my head. I used rogaine before and had good results. People were actually noticing more hair on my head. I used minoxidil for about a month or two and switched back to rogaine. This product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> it filled in some bare spots.  wife loves it.  i use it twice a day, morning and night, and it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 boxes of this stuff and have yet to see any substantial results. It says on the box that the product my not work for all but a friend of mine tried it and it worked. I will finish up what I have left but I doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I actually use the product for beard growth, not hair regrowth. After months of research i found that you could, in fact, use minoxidil to activate dormant facial follicles, instead of re-animating dead ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of using 2x1ml applications a day i just apply it before i go to bed (so 1x day). The supply will last me a year (hopefully i won&#x27;t need it for that long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months and already see substantially more growth in my beard. not only in thickness but also length and it&#x27;s spread as well.</li>
            <li> Reasonably good quality product. Worth the money. This product works perfectly well as described. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> this goods use a wrong picture,it&#x27;s made in Israel,not Canada.the goods from  Canada is better than  Israel&#x27;s.so I think this shop isn&#x27;t  honesty.</li>
            <li> So far, OK.  Easy to use, but a little too early to tell if it really promotes detectable hair growth.</li>
            <li> Does this product regrow hair.........and the answer is no. But, it does stop the loss of the hair you do have. I&#x27;ve used this product for the past four years and it does stop the loss of your hair. However, once you stop applying it, you hair starts to thin out again.</li>
            <li> The tester works wonders. You don&#x27;t have to put too much on and it keeps you from spilling it all over.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me after 5 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 5 month experiment with this product get a disappointing conclusion--this product did nothing for me.Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase.  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but helps.  It is cheaper than purchasing it at big box stores.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 4.5+ months. I applied it on the top of my scalp front to back. I know the instructions recommended using it on the back but this product didn&#x27;t work there either.&lt;br /&gt;After losing more than 60-70% of my hair (50% if we want to be conservative) and not gaining anything (except some facial hairs) I gave up on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using before November and it has been 4 months now, but things were supposed to have gone back to the way they were before using this thing after like 2-3 months (according to some websites and I think even the manual mentioned this too). But looks like that was not true either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this a negative rating I would. But 1 star is the lowest I can go.</li>
            <li> I just been using this for a week and I m already seeing some positive results. I have to wait and see how the regrowth happens. The dxn says that its not recommended for ppl who are bald in the front of their head but I believe you can still use it to atleast stop losing more of ur hair. To be honest Minoxidil is the chemical that really does the job doesnt matter which brand you use. It should be at least 5% because branded names such as Rogaine has same percentage and alot of people are very happy with it. Since Kirkland product is cheaper thats y i recommend this.</li>
            <li> seems to work and price is great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all minoxidil either works or it doesn&#x27;t, it depends on the person.  This product worked for me, the price was very reasonable, and it isn&#x27;t too gunky, I can apply it four times before I need to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years but haven&#x27;t seen it on the shelves lately. It helped stop my receding hairline.</li>
            <li> 100% recomended thanks</li>
            <li> Returned it.  It may work for others, but I found it greasy, laborious and made me feel self-conscious.  Decided it preferable to &#x27;let go&#x27; and don the bald look rather than vainly cling to the inevitably receding hairline or balding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent the bucks instead on trimmers/razors (see my reviews).  In addition to exciting my wife (who&#x27;s likely fantasizing about Connery or Willis), it&#x27;s easier, less work/expense, and I look/feel cool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now.  Anytime I start to think it might not work, I discontinue and my hair starts to shed within a couple days.  After a few days back on, shedding is noticeably less.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Started using this at Christmas.  Saw growth within 3 weeks.  Shocked since everyone said I wouldn&#x27;t until 3 months.  After that bottle was done I switched to the Walmart Equate brand and within 2 weeks saw hair loss and very little growth.  Restarted the Kirkland Minoxidil after one month and started seeing growth again and hair loss slowed down to almost nothing.  From now on I will only be using the Kirkland brand.</li>
            <li> as good as the original and a much better price</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Works Great.&lt;br /&gt;Makes head and hair feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a minoxidil product which did make a difference to my hair. It was expensive. This product has the right potential, and an amazingly low price, but, and here&#x27;s the big but-it made my head extremely flakey and itchy. It would be better to go bald than go mad scratching, and to look like snow is falling from your head every time you turn. Not only that, but it makes your head look and feel greasy. Shave your head and relax.</li>
            <li> I dont know why people give bad reviews to this product the only difference is its more oily what i do is apply this during night as im just going to sleep and apply rogaine in the morning as it dries up quick and i can groom my hair .</li>
            <li> This product is a cheaper alternative to the name brand Rogain and it actually works!  When my husband began to notice that the top of his hairline was starting to recede (think Bela Lugosi &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shape) he wanted to do something about it.  Although these types of products clearly indicate on the packaging that they are intended to help those with the circle bald patch on the top of the head and not for the receding hairline, he figured he would give it a try.  Surprisingly he has noticed the hair loss has completely ceased and has noticed the beginning fuzz of new regrowth.  However, he noted as other reviewers did previously-this stuff makes your scalp very itchy.  But the itch was not enough to deter him after he realized it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I tried this for 6 months.  It worked really well for hair regrowth, but gave me terrible dandruff. Tried head and shoulders and tried waiting the full 6 months to see if it would improve, but neither made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to GoodSense Minoxidil Topical Aerosol Foam.  It is hard to say yet if it is as effective, but the dandruff went away within a week. I have been using this for about 2 months now and it seems to be equally effective. It also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy like the liquid. Definitely worth the extra cost over the liquid stuff.</li>
            <li> This product really works, and cost much less than Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Same as Rogaine.  Great service</li>
            <li> This is great value for the price being charged. Other manufacturers have much more expensive products. I guess the true results will only become apparent after couple of months.</li>
            <li> UNTIL NOW, I HAVE NO IDEA. JUST I WISH IT WOULD BE GOOD~~~</li>
            <li> I panicked a little about 6 months ago when I noticed some thinning hair at the back of my head. It wasn&#x27;t anything major, but certainly not what I wanted to see. I used this stuff twice a day for 3 months, and once a day for the next 3 months (up to today). My fiance took a picture of the top of my head last night and the change is DRAMATIC. I have a 100% full head of hair now. You&#x27;d never know I was thinning just 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little depressing that I have to keep using it for the rest of forever, but not nearly as depressing as having a bald spot on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female, i know I&#x27;m not suppose to use this.  But I have not seen any negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I think it has help grow back my edges, thus I put this product in the plus column.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products you would hope that would never be needed.  That being the case, Kirkland&#x27;s product is an awesome value.  Everything I would have expected in a competing product that is much more expensive - great job</li>
            <li> Just one word...Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was strictly for MEN only. My girlfriend used it for a while but then I read the instructions closely upon receiving it and it scared me! When I tried to return it I was informed that Amazon can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s considered FLAMMABLE.  Complete waste of money for me :(</li>
            <li> for men too lazy to go to the store you can&#x27;t beat this price and it&#x27;s delivered to your door excellent products inc the same u would buy in the store</li>
            <li> this product really was a waste of money; it did absolutely nothing for my hair. I now have a shaved head.</li>
            <li> this product dies out my scalp making it flakey and also leaves my hair feeling and looking greasy unless i keep my hair really short. if you keep your hair short its a good product at a good price</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple weeks.  Seems exactly the same as the store brand and much cheaper than the same store brand.</li>
            <li> You know thw results not typical thing and all that jazz. All I can say for myself is that this stuff works marvelously. Been using it for close to two months. not only has it helped my crown (this is where the results not typical thing kicks in) it has helped my hairline and I&#x27;ve also been using it on my face (which your not supposed to do &#x27;cause it wont work on hairline or face... or so the box says). I didn&#x27;t even have that thing where after two weeks your hair is supposed to shed off... although lately I have been experiencing a little shedding. But my hair is much thicker now. I also have to mention that I use it with \\&quot;NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg, 120 Vcaps\\&quot;. But what works for some wont work for everybody, just hope you&#x27;re a lucky one like me.</li>
            <li> Same as the costco package, but a few dollars more.  Way cheaper than going to the normal grocery or drug store.</li>
            <li> I thought I was losing it (My hair, that is). My hair was thinning a bit, so I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot. It&#x27;s terrible (Well, it was for me). The price is good if it works for you, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a liquid that you apply to your head. The foam, which Rogaine has, is much easier to use. Since this is a liquid, it would roll down my scalp onto my forehead. I&#x27;d have to stand there in the bathroom and wipe away any that rolled onto my forehead for minutes after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, the stuff burned my scalp. I didn&#x27;t see any red or irritation, but it would burn and itch -- very uncomfortable, especially when you need to apply is twice (Morning and night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, the substance makes your hair look terrible (For me it did). It&#x27;s like I put cheap gel in my hair, which made my thinning stand out more. Why would I want to stand out more when trying to thicken my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, there are two boxes with nearly the same ingredients. I purchased the one with the higher review, but was sent the lesser one. The buyer stated that they changed the look on the box, so be careful when it comes to reviews. I demanded a refund since it seemed they were trying to swindle me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried the Rogaine foam, it worked much better. My hair looked better when it was applied compared to this, and it didn&#x27;t drip down my scalp. The foam also smelled better, and it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp like this stuff. It&#x27;s a bit more, but it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This product really works, you just have to be pacient.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for many years and i think has stopped my head from balding and also has put some hair back like probably 30/40 more...good stuff as far as im concerned</li>
            <li> Careful this one uses some Glycol product that irritates some peoples scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 been thinning out for the past two years I&#x27;m not bald just have a lot of hair falling out I&#x27;ve been trying lipogaine for two years with no real results decided to try this product because of how cheap it is first week noticed how greasy my hair was made feel gross.after a month I nothing after 4 months made my hair worse so I stopped taking it don&#x27;t waste your money on this product hopefully there is something that actually does work!</li>
            <li> Great value and a great buy....but keep in mind it does not work for everyone. If this stuff works for you I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does work!Thank you, it is better than our expectations! When with 2% minoxidil one could just believe, that it works, this 5% just works, you can see it. There is no any cons so far.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping. Will buy from again.</li>
            <li> Oh, Minoxidil how I wanted you to work!! Desperately! After 15 months I finally threw in the towel after I had no results and my hair kept falling out. Turns out that many of us don&#x27;t carry the necessary genetics to convert minox into hair. Unfortunately, the testing involved to determine whether we are candidates or not has yet to become available. So, be forewarned that you may using this product for naught. But then again, you might be lucky and grow some hair. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere.  Whether you buy Rogaine or Minoxidil under any other brand name, it is the same stuff, same bottle design, same manufacturer located in Israel. I have been using for years and it works.</li>
            <li> I have used one form or another of Minoxidil for years now and it does tend to regrow hair on the crown of the head.  Because of increasing age and the medications I have to take I was growing a bald spot.  With Minoxidil I now have some hair there although it is still a little thin but then as they say who wants fat hair.  The form doesn&#x27;t matter.  The concentration is the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over one year. There is really only one thing that matters: does it work? Maybe, I cannot say for sure. I can tell you I don&#x27;t think my bald spot has gotten larger, so perhaps it just keeps the baldness at bay. It&#x27;s even possible that some hair has started to grow in, but not much. I say this in regards to the back of my head, not my hairline as it seems to have zero effect on that. I make this assessment after a year of solid use of this product. For one year (12 months) I have had to order this three times, and I&#x27;m almost used up my third order. It is quite a large supply, but for me at least it lasts about 4.5 months rather than 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is more affordable than the name brand competitors. This is for sure the more economical option, and considering you need to use it for a prolonged period of time that is certainly something to consider. The liquid is very greasy when applied to your head. It remains like that for quite a while, and takes some time to dry, so I recommend using a hair dryer after you apply it. Once it dries up, it almost becomes a dandruff in your hair. The bottles seem to get a crust over time around the rim, and I&#x27;m not sure if that is supposed to happen or not. Must be the dried residual of the product, but that is a total guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an issue one time where the product came and the box was soaking wet. One or multiple items had exploded in the box, so it was not sanitary. Amazon shipped me a new case, so I appreciated that. If you are serious about regrowing your hair, you MUST continue to use this product. Results come at an extremely glacial pace, so best to take some pictures every month to see results over time. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m jumping for joy over this specific product, but it does seem to have a minor positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES&lt;br /&gt;+Minor Results after one year of use&lt;br /&gt;+Affordable compared to other brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES&lt;br /&gt;-Greasy in hair, then produces dandruff when dry&lt;br /&gt;-Only enough for about 4 months (not 6 months as advertised)oduces dandruff when dry&lt;br /&gt;-Only enough for about 4 months (not 6 months as advertised)</li>
            <li> This is causing my friend who I bought it for to regrow some hair so he is happy.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this actually seemed to work a bit. After a few months of using it twice/day I noticed little peach hairs growing where my hair had been lost. Downside is that it is not the easiest to apply, as it is very thin and drips everywhere. Also, after using in the morning (you&#x27;re not supposed to wash your hair after you use this) your hair looks pretty bad. My hair actually looked thinner directly after using this, even though I knew it was working. I stopped using the product because I don&#x27;t think that it is worth it to have bad looking hair over what would be a long process of growing your hair back. Then you have to keep on using it after your hair grows back, and I don&#x27;t know how that would look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am in my early twenties, and had a receding hairline of about 3-4 inches. No bald spot on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Like my father and maternal grandfather I started losing my hair in my late 20s, right around the time Minoxidil came on the market.  No knock on either of them, but I&#x27;m vain and didn&#x27;t want to look old before my time.  I started on the original 2% solution back in the early 1990s and was VERY pleased with the results.  While using Minoxidil didn&#x27;t stop my hair loss dead in its tracks it certainly did arrest it and it works on my specific type of hair loss (on the crown of my head or male pattern baldness).  The hair that remained looked perfectly normal and it was augmented by very light colored short sort of downy hair that grew in.  It kept my scalp from getting the shiny bald look so I chalked it up as a win.  After using Minoxidil for 20 years now I have the hairline my dad had at 30, which isn&#x27;t bad considering I&#x27;m coming up on 50.  Is it a thick lush head of hair?  No, but it&#x27;s not a shiny cue ball either.  I do know that the 5% solution netted better results for me than the 2% solution so if you&#x27;re going to get in, go ALL in.  And as someone who&#x27;s used it for 20 years I can tell you that no, your barber or stylist won&#x27;t know you use it, no one will unless you tell them.  I&#x27;ve never had any side effects either.  I&#x27;m sure results can and do vary and like most men I&#x27;m too vain to mention it to most friends so maybe you have others who are using it as well and don&#x27;t know.  If you&#x27;re looking to start you can&#x27;t beat the deal on this 6 month supply of Minoxidil.  Does it last six months?  Absolutely!  I&#x27;ve used other generics like Members Mark (sold at Sam&#x27;s Club) and there&#x27;s really no difference between the brand name (Rogaine) and the generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it sounds all good right?  Well, there are some things that people undoubtedly will not like.  Applying the solution with the eyedropper can be messy and it does dribble down the side of your head to places where you don&#x27;t want/need it.  The early kits had a sprayer, but the problem was it would get on your hair rather than your scalp.  A dabber type instrument used to be included but my hunch/worry was that it wound up damaging the remaining hair follicles worse than the help that was arriving.  Slow and steady with applying the solution is the rule, or use your fingers to assist, however be CERTAIN to wash your hands immediately as you do NOT want this getting in your eyes!  Trust me on that!  The other minor complaint is that once applied it is slow to dry, giving you a wet hair look that isn&#x27;t uniformly wet like you&#x27;ve come out of the shower. But you know what?  I&#x27;ve never had someone ask me \\&quot;why is your hair still wet?\\&quot;  Trust me...most people are too polite to ask questions that genuinely puzzle them.  I&#x27;ve read about issues with clumping and other oddities and that does happen if you have relatively thick hair.  Once it dries some gently brush or comb your hair.  From time to time I&#x27;ve had residue that remains on my scalp but it washes off when you shower next.  Some users get irritation or burning; if that happens stop using it or see a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, this product isn&#x27;t for everyone.  Some don&#x27;t like the idea of applying twice a day, don&#x27;t like the wet hair look that&#x27;s slow to dry, or expect immediate visible results.  Minoxidil isn&#x27;t a sprint, it&#x27;s a marathon and take it from someone who&#x27;s been running that marathon for 20 years, it&#x27;s ultimately worth it.  I love my dad and know what I&#x27;d look like at 50 if I hadn&#x27;t been using Minoxidil and am glad I&#x27;ve been using it as I think I look more youthful and vibrant.  Most people don&#x27;t guess my actual age in fact.  I can&#x27;t give Minoxidil all the credit on that, but it sure helps; maybe it can help you too!ur hair rather than your scalp.

            <li> I used this product for about 5 years with great results, then tried Rogain Foam, that was a one big mistake, started losing hair like there was no tomorrow, so I stopped using either of these products for about 2 years, and my hair loss became very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;  I just went back to using the liquid form a few months ago and do already see a big difference, I&#x27;m balding from the top of the head, not back, and i do see a lot of hair growing back thicker.  Very sad that Kirkland stopped making these and now changed to Foam version as well.</li>
            <li> this really works for me..even my hairdresser notices.. and my grandson who felt he was getting a receding hairline is using it and he says it it working for him.. you do have a itchy scalp.. but the trade off is worth it to me.. I use it twice a day, when I get up and before I go to bed.. quick and easy.  I have noticed significant more hair and it is more coarse, so it feels fuller.. I did start this before I was balding so I would say to someone start this before you really need it..</li>
            <li> The only solution I found to be completely useful and you can see the obvious results in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Use twice a day like clockwork. You will grow hair. I have been using this for over a year, and am tremendously satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first month, I actually lost hair at a faster rate than normal. The reason is that the way this works is to trick your follicles into entering a &amp;#34;new growth&amp;#34; phase, which causes some follicles to stop what they&#x27;re currently working on. A new hair is immediately begun, though. For several months, every haircut I got revealed more and more new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that my hair loss was widespread across my whole scalp, and the warnings about the limitations of this product did not seem to hold true. I&#x27;m fairly young compared to the average hair-loss patient, though (27 when I began treatment). Now, I can hardly tell there&#x27;s any thinning going on at all. My hairline had receded some by the time I started using Minoxidil, and that has only marginally changed. I have definitely regrown hair at the front of my scalp, just not enough right under my hairline to &amp;#34;push back the tide&amp;#34; so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp does get itchier than normal now, but you get used to it, and it can be mitigated with shampoos like Selsun Blue. It works fairly well, and isn&#x27;t a significant added expense.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to the use effect！</li>
            <li> It works...everywhere. But get a food dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I see big difference in 3-4 weeks usage (twice a day), remember that you&#x27;ll see hair loss starting if you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;make sure you apply the solution drops well into your scalp with your finger tips.</li>
            <li> finapel replace this product and hope to work well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see any difference yet.  I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hair mat or the sticky feel that it leaves on my hair.</li>
            <li> Costco for some reason stop carrying this version. So I had to go back to Amazon to find it! Thanks from the top of my head!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it works or not, but at least it really is odorless, unlike some stinky stuff I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Will know more in a few more months. For now, I expect it to do a decent job regrowing some hair in me receding hairline.</li>
            <li> needs time but really effective especially genetic bald . . . .  . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t show any result after 2 month</li>
            <li> No increase in hair growth</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to know if it works.</li>
            <li> Was for hubby- have used for six months- he sees a definite improvement. He doesn&#x27;t have a perfectly lush head of hair now, but it really helped fill in the crown, and even improved the front hairline. I&#x27;d say it stopped new hair loss, and gave back maybe 75% of what he had lost? One note- new hair may be a little different than the existing hair- my husband&#x27;s new growth is finer and lighter than the rest.</li>
            <li> its a bit greasy but it&#x27;s still too early to tell if it works</li>
            <li> Hmm all I can say is I THINK it worked. I would always cut my hair low to the point you couldnt see the hairline since it was faded. I used this for a few months &amp; it gave me a little confidence to grow my hair. It grew BUT the hair wasnt like the rest. I use to have that good nappy hair but then it grew straight? wierd! Anyways I stopped using it for that matter &amp; ended up just cutting my hair short again. MAAAYBE ill try again since I still have a few bottles left.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value!!!  Bought for a friend who could not believe that I could get it for him at this price.  A true Amazon value.</li>
            <li> A 6-month supply arrived as promised with no damage. I was paying this for a 3-month supply at another store. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than rogaine and works just as well.  What&#x27;s not to like??!  Have been using this for over 6 months and my hair loss seems to have slowed down if not stopped completely.  Now my diet has also changed (no coffee or smoking of any kind) which I believe is an even bigger factor.  But this product deffinetly helps.</li>
            <li> If you are starting to have hair loss or your hair is thinning out or damaged Minoxidil is the best treatment for years. [...]</li>
            <li> Kirkland is a brand associated with Costco Wholesale, one of the best companies in all of North America known exclusively for their quality, passion, and excellent business practices and this product is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 4+ years experience using this product and even when used intermittently this stuff really works and makes a noticeable difference even if used once a day when going to sleep, which is the best time of day to apply this specific product. It does take approximately one hour to dry, but will not leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; after it fully dries. Affordable and Effective! That&#x27;s all you need to remember about this product.</li>
            <li> I been using it now for 1 month and 16 days, and I can tel and people can tell that I have more hair, the white spaces are getting darker, and the amount of hair is 30 to 40 more than what I had before, I used in the front and in the back of the top of my head, only cons I can tell is that it leaves a white dust on you head, and that it runs to your face when you sweat but again, Im using it in a place that is not indicated on the instructions so it is not really a con, in fact Im using this as gel, cause it take like half and hour to dry</li>
            <li> I am strictly rating this product for the price point in comparison with other Minoxidil 5% 6 month supply products I have tried.  Results are another thing, I have been using this for some time and have seen little to no results.</li>
            <li> I used Rogain Foam for 6 months before switching to Kirkland Minoxidil 5%.  I saw some results with Rogain but the Kirkland product soon produced a good amount of growth.  Unfortunately it also drastically disturbed my sleep pattern.  Within a week or so of using it I started to have a terrible time going to sleep at night and would awaken only hours later and remain awake for another 2 hours.  I went through my days exhausted from lack of sleep.  I finally made the connection and stopped using it in the evening and my sleep pattern returned to normal after a day or two.  I&amp;#34;m hoping the once a day application will be enough to maintain the hair growth.  We will see.</li>
            <li> Wow!! Great deal for 6 bottles!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Have not been able to find the liquid Minoxidil at Costco.  They seemed to have switched to solely to the foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for nearly 2 months now. I originally switched from the Rogaine 5% Foam. I will not be going back. The Kirkland Minoxidil seems to be more effective for hairgrowth and much easier to spread directly on your scalp. Issues I found from the Rogaine foam were that when applying, most of the product would grease up your hair and have minimum contact directly on your scalp. That problem is minimized with the dropper application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness, I&#x27;ve seen a drastic slowdown in overall hair loss and have seen some tiny hairs regrow since I started using, even at the hairline (which is apparently uncommon). 9/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I am a woman and I went from the woman&#x27;s 2% minoxidil to the men&#x27;s 4% per my docs recommendation. Works just fine with no unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using kirkland minoxidil for about 8 years now and it has kept my existing hair intact with minimal to no loss!  easy and quick to use.  make sure you use it twice daily without fail!  otherwise it&#x27;s not as effective.</li>
            <li> I Really don&#x27;t like this minoxidil, i switched to [[ASIN:B00CDSSB8K Regenepure Minoxidil 5%]]</li>
            <li> Product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m losing some hair in the front side and even thou this product isn&#x27;t meant to work on that area, it&#x27;s helped me to make regrow. It worked for me but it didn&#x27;t work for a couple of friends but at least they let you know it will not work with everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working, but this item generates scurf and it&#x27;s very embarasing.</li>
            <li> Of course I didn&#x27;t get all my hair back, say 100%, but interestingly enough I got more hair even on areas of my head where this product is not supposed to work on. Worth the try! I had to order it from Amazon since COSTCO only has the foam version wich doesn&#x27;t work a bit on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, and inconvenient. 4 hours before you can wear a hat!?! Just get the foam!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, will do business with them again</li>
            <li> nice and work for me i satred to see the resoult and it grow hair for u nice one guys thanks</li>
            <li> Im using this product for a year now and I think the hair loss is lower, but atenci&amp;oacute;n this time I havent seen new grow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised at this product&#x27;s 4 star rating.  I must be the unusual person this product did nothing for?  I can&#x27;t confirm or deny that, but I can attest that this product did nothing for me at all after using it exactly as the instructions dictated for six month.  I imagine that if there was a baldness panacea out there, we wouldn&#x27;t constantly continue to see men walking around with varying stages of baldness.</li>
            <li> The problem is that I am not sure,if it really helps.I am still loosing a lot of hair.The question is,if I would not use the product.would I loose more ??</li>
            <li> as described but didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kirkland Minoxidil for over 20 years with good results. However is hard to asses what would have been my state of baldness if I wouldn&#x27;t have used it.</li>
            <li> I have been using for many years. When I stop using it, I can clearly see my hairs falling. I think it really works.&lt;br /&gt;And the seller is an excellent seller! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really seem to do more than stave off the hair loss, though to be fair my hair loss was due to medication I am taking rather than natural hair loss.</li>
            <li> Good price for the six months supply. Used this for about half a year (and the Wal-Mart brand three months before that) for an area near my front hairline that was starting to thin out. I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of new growth, but the hair that&#x27;s still there appears thicker and darker which is an improvement. Will keep on using to see if results improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution does make hair sticky and oily for a little while, so probably not a good idea to apply just before going out.</li>
            <li> I am combining these with finasteride 1mg and the combination is working for me. I am even growing hair on my temples. However, my results are not typical, because hair growth has to do with genetics, rather than proper use of this product. I will purchase agin.</li>
            <li> Many say only effective for the top of the head, I&#x27;m currently using it for my receding hair line and works good so far.</li>
            <li> It was about two years ago that my barber had told me I was thinning out at the top.  I did some research and found out that this has exactly the same chemical compounds as Rogain and cost only one third.  I have been using it everyday--once at night before I go to bed and after I shower in the morning--for the last two years.  Over the weekend, I got a hair cut and the same barber who had told me about the hair loss said to me, &amp;#34;your hair is thicker now.  What have you been using?&amp;#34;  So, I told her about Minoxidil and will cost less than $30 for a six months worth of supply on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought I had used this before, so I ordered six.  When I got the package, one (or more) of the bottles had leaked and the Kirkland box was wet.  I decided to keep them anyway.  I used it last night for the first time and couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair this morning.  It was like putting Wesson oil on my head.  Agh!  I&#x27;m trying to return, but Amazon classifies it as a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; (I&#x27;ll agree with that) and won&#x27;t accept it back.  Hmmm....</li>
            <li> I used to use this product back in the summer on the front of my hairline and it grew back tremendously. I also think the lack of stress and warm weather also had something to with it but when I stopped using this product, my hair started falling out and I was back to being almost bald. I tried the off brands but they didn&#x27;t do the trick so I came back to this product and after a couple months, my hair has grown back again. It leaves my head a little dry but I just wash my hair with cooler water and you can&#x27;t notice it at all. The hair that grew back isn&#x27;t as thick as on the rest of my head but nonetheless it&#x27;s still hair. It has helped me a ton with self confidence and I also use other hair regrowth products to assist it. I am very pleased with this product though and I would highly recommend it. It might take a couple months to see results but more than likely you will end up seeing results.</li>
            <li> Hi I started using minoxidil when I first turned 18 ( yes I know young and it sucks ) but my hair was starting to recede at the temples and I had a mature hairline and a little thinning. I thought hey I should do something while its not too late and its still not that bad. and my doctor thought so also. I&#x27;ve been using for only 2-3 months and I&#x27;m already pleased. I ordered another 6 month supply. I use twice a day although after about a year or 2 of twice a day use i&#x27;ll probably go down to once a day at bedtime. I actually use more than the 1 ml every use like it says because it doesn&#x27;t cover all the area&#x27;s so I use 1.5 - 2 ml every use. the only bad thing about this is a 6 month supply turns into a 3 month, but its working great for me so I won&#x27;t stop im getting growth and filling in at the temples and my thinning hair has gotten a bit thicker. I&#x27;m only 2-3 months in and my results are great compared to most, my doctor said I started using it at the right time (when I first saw receding/thinning) this stuff must not be stopped or you will lose all regrown hair and additionally more. so I guess im stuck with this for life.. but its not all that bad.. atleast its cheap and i&#x27;ll have hair :)  SIDENOTE - THIS STUFF IS NOT MAGIC YOU WILL NOT REGROW A FULL HEAD OF THICK HAIR, BUT IT DEFFINATELY DOES REGROW AND HELP FILL IN AREAS OF THINNING/RECEDING.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my receding hair line.  used it but found out I was allergic to it.  Gave remaining to my son who thinks it&#x27;s great and he has bought more.</li>
            <li> Always be aware that because a box says don&#x27;t try it &amp;#34;here&amp;#34;, typically only means that they have gotten the approval after successfully testing it. You can google the actual experiment case studies, which is where I read it works great for receding hairlines, so we tried it and sure enough it works! But you do have to keep it up, but you cant put a price tag on self esteem like this!</li>
            <li> The product is just fair. It was not indicated in the website before purchase that the item is only meant for vertex and not for frontal hair loss. Such information is vital for the customer so that he can purchase exactly what can work for him. Also the expiry date was not shown in the website prior to purchase</li>
            <li> I think it works. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it seems to be keeping my hair in a holding pattern (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not seeing regrowth but I&#x27;m not losing anymore.</li>
            <li> I Have been using it and yes it does work it takes time but I see it coming back slowly.</li>
            <li> Same relatively good results as Rogaine so far and it is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;However I observe more dry scalp than before over the applied areas.</li>
            <li> Always this product guaranteed but it never work. I been trying continuously and regularly twice a day as description but still my hair is dropping. I am tired of this. Never buy this product. If you bought please ask your money refund or ask seller to send some good brand in same money because the time your spend cannot be paid by any one. Wish If I would have tried some other brand in this past few months might be .</li>
            <li> This is the only hair regrowth product Henry will use. He is so taken with it, every time it is time for a reorder, this is the only product he will buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten such a satisfying deal on minoxidil before. Really does work just as good as the name-brand stuff, too. I use the liquid for nighttime applications.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and it works for my type of thinning. I no longer lose hair at all as long as I use this product every day, which is why I like the large amount I get in this order. It&#x27;s getting harder to find the liquid with the dropper instead of the foam, which is more costly and doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> I started using minoxidil as soon my wife and my dermatologist saw hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m 55 and I have lots of hair. What more can you say?</li>
            <li> this stuff works, better than rogaine! Small little hairs start popping up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I started with Rogaine extra strength and it took almost 9 months to see new teeny tiny hairs appearing on my scalp. Changed to Minoxidil and my hair continues to grow at the same slow rate, but no difference in performance. Forget those people poo-pooing generic Rogaine formulas, this is absolutely equal in quality (has same color, viscosity, odor, feeling, of Rogaine). Use the difference in cost and treat yourself to dinner!</li>
            <li> Much prefer the liquid vs. the foam. The foam gets more in the surrounding hair than on the scalp. The liquid with eye dropper application allows to apply exactly where you want it without getting your hair stiff/sticky when it dries. Please keep the liquid in stock!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Costco membership for years and let it lapse. It got down to the point that all I was buying at Costco was their Minoxidil and duct tape. So, I found this and it&#x27;s close to the price Costco charges. I hope it&#x27;s not counterfeit but so far, no hair loss. I&#x27;ve used Minoxidil for 15-years and have never grown any but it stopped my loss. So, if I start to lose any I know that this is fake. But it seems to smell and feel like what I&#x27;m used to buying at Costco.</li>
            <li> I dunno if this works</li>
            <li> so far good.... will update later...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t kwow, six months and the results mmmm&lt;br /&gt;Try whit some vitamins 😒</li>
            <li> Unbelievably good price!</li>
            <li> I use this product and the targets generic version, and this brand seems to work a lot better. 6 month supply for under $30 is as cheap as I&#x27;ve ever found and it works.</li>
            <li> This worked for me although it did irritate my scalp.  It stopped hair loss and actually thickened my hair.  Just wish I could continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It works, as my hairdresser knows for sure!</li>
            <li> Good packaging. Precise and easy withdrawal.</li>
            <li> good delivery and great product</li>
            <li> Reduced balding at top of head within two months.  Best part of the product is it dries quickly without leaving a residue.  Application is very straight forward and easy</li>
            <li> Gross and did nothing. Do not waist your time. I do not know how people could deal with this or give it a good review.</li>
            <li> I think foam would stay in place better as the idea is to treat an area of scalp. As far as i can tell this product does not do anything.</li>
            <li> The fine print tells you about 15 reasons why someone can&#x27;t use it and only provides one reason you can. If you have a bald spot on the back of your head. Period. And then, only if you don&#x27;t have the other 15 reasons for not using it. Pathetic.</li>
            <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I find it increasingly difficult to find this product at my local Sam&#x27;s Club (their brand). We have a Costco building now, but not ready until Spring 2014. This allows me to stay in stock on without having to worry if the local guys will have it. Price is fair, but wish it were the same price as in Sam&#x27;s ($19.99).</li>
            <li> This crap works. My hair is thicker than ever. I used it on the front and back and it works for both.</li>
            <li> Noticed no growth at all.</li>
            <li> i actually lost more hair when i started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the itch is unbearable. absolutely unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if i could...</li>
            <li> Do not like it, strong and causes itchy scalp. Go check you-tube and see what happens to people due to using it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in very good condition, and it was exactly the product advertised.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a month and not sure if it&#x27;s really working. It also does not absorb well so you always have this &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; hair look until you rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Another excellent Costco brand; much better price than brand name.</li>
            <li> I am going on 4 months now and I believe I see some improvement in hair growth. From what I&#x27;ve read you have to wait 6 months or so to see big improvements......so until then the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> ...but a lot more convenient! My DH likes&lt;br /&gt;this product way better than the foam formulas that are saturating (pun intended) the market currently, making his preference harder to find. This generic product fits the bill at a nice price point, delivered quickly to our door. The only thing missing is the polish dog and soda for $1.50!</li>
            <li> I am a female, and, although the product is supposedly for men only, I got my doctor&#x27;s approval to give it a try.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any new growth yet, but I&#x27;m very pleased that it hasn&#x27;t itched me at all, as many reviewers have reported.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day, but only once a day (per my doc&#x27;s suggestion). I rub it in real well, and, although it makes my hair wet (what little I have), it seems to give it body, so I&#x27;ve been using it like a gel.  So far, so good.  I&#x27;m very pleased, and will continue with it indefinitely.  Check back with me 9-10 months from now....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  I really like the price and everything is as advertised.  Been using and it works great.  Please note, that this will cause your head to flake up.  When it dries, you&#x27;ll get flakes.  I&#x27;ve notice the foam won&#x27;t do that to you and there&#x27;s a chemical in all liquid minoxidil that does that.  It works though.</li>
            <li> I am 66 and began using rogaine when it was still a prescription 25 years ago. At that time, I had mild receding hairline and some thinning in the  crown. 2% was all that was available then, then switched to 5%. Kirkland&#x27;s has the best price on line, but I can get 3 months supply of Equate in Wal-Mart for $18.64. As far as results, the level of thinning has remained the same for 25 years. I also use DHS 2% pythrione zinc(double head and shoulders)shampoo 3 times a week, also shown to curtail baldness. My own opinion is that if you are already skin bald, save your money. I think all of the minoxidil based solutions work best if you are just beginning to bald. You have a good chance of maintaining what you have and the younger the better. Sometimes the genetic factor is so strong like the Hasselback brothers, it&#x27;s just too strong to overcome.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered very fast on the standard delivery option.  I have been using this product for over a year now, and its one of those products that does seem to have an effect on my the rate of my hair loss.  However if I stop using it for more than 5 days or so, then I will noticeably begin to lose more hair than when i was on the product.  There by making it a must buy for me for as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> I do not like blanket because it is way too big to fit a double bed.  I love my Robert Zur shoes and the mixodil is something I cannot find here in that quantity.</li>
            <li> Hello and thank you for my product  ,,,  It has been  awhile since i last used it , so  i am gonna have to start all over again  omn the top of things ..... It&#x27;s a great product . I remember when it first came out in the stores and it was 100 $ a bottle . That&#x27;s how they work they suck the most money out of ya as long as they can  A-</li>
            <li> I have been using the Kirkland Minoxidil since I found out that it was the same thing as Rogaine, more or less anyway. I started using Rogaine liquid then used the foam which I liked more but the cost benefit didn&#x27;t work out for me.  I will note that when I started using a minoxidil like many other users, I did notice that some hair did fall out more so than it had prior to use but after the first few weeks I saw regrowth to match it. Also, in the beginning it did cause itching and flakes, but after doing a little reading I started to take biotin along with it and that cleared up. I have used minoxidil for around 10-11 months now and its worked nicely for the most part.  One more thing, I started by applying twice a day until I saw good hair growth then once it thickened up I cut back to once a day. It seems to be working just as well, and it helps to stretch out how long between repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good comparative price&lt;br /&gt;Helped thicken hair&lt;br /&gt;Helped regrow hair&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply once you get the hang of it&lt;br /&gt;Cut back on dosage after time with same results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial increase in hair loss&lt;br /&gt;Itchy dry scalp&lt;br /&gt;Slow to produce results I wanted (about 4 months)&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair a bit sticky&lt;br /&gt;It is liquid so be careful about drips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good product if you have trouble with itching try taking with biotin. I would say that if you are just starting to lose your hair very early on try taking biotin by itself I wish I had.</li>
            <li> Itches too much. Causes dandruff. Leaves greasy and sticky mess on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that all Minoxidil product might have very similar drawbacks. But I am going to try a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> The other review sya&#x27;s it does not work, I feel its working like Provilus.. why pay more when you get it dirt cheap</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it seems to be just as good or better quality than any other brand of 5 percent minoxidil, &amp; especially &#x27;cause it&#x27;s cheap:) That said, I hate using any minoxidil product as it takes a long time to dry,etc. But if it would dry fast, it probably wouldn&#x27;t work well. I would recommend using this if you&#x27;re anyway using a similar product.</li>
            <li> Good product for a good price. Best deal I could find for insurance against hair loss. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for an incredibly low price. Minoxidil has one side affect that is not widely acknowledgedwritten about, it causes hair loss at the end of the first month of use, quite a bit of hair loss. But it grows right back and then if you produce the right enzymes which most people do, it grows back some hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap, very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: oily, quite oily</li>
            <li> This product is a wonder. It was to me, anyway. I was loosing hair by the bunches!...Then I was prescribed this Minoxidil by a dermathologist. Used it for 3 months at first. Every day after shampooing. Got new hair, not very thick or strong, but the bold-spots went away. Now I use it twice a month for maintenance. Won&#x27;t ever stop. My hair-loss is due to stress, so it&#x27;s kind of chronic...No problem....Now! Go for it!</li>
            <li> I am returning Kirkland Minoxidil only be cause the directions specifically say; not to be used by women. When I placed the order ,I realized the Minoxidil said for men, there are some hair growth products say for men that women can use even it may say for men. The Kirkland Minoxidil warns specifically not to be used by women. That is the only reason I an returning this order. It would  have been nice if the Company had supplied a return slip in the box. Otherwise the order was prompt and on time.</li>
            <li> This took a long time to work for me(several months) but it did start to work.  The worst part is you cannot stop using it.  When i did i felt like the hair I gained fell out and then some.  Now I feel like Im stuck taking it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what it says it is, and is a good price. Only reason for 4 stars is because it gives me dandruff really bad.</li>
            <li> Pretty much identical to rogaine but for a fraction of the price.  Also tried the much more expensive Lipogaine, which is nice.  This is much less sticky, in fact no stickiness.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the 2% which did not affect the way I style my hair.  This 5% makes my hair look &amp; feel dirty.  I want to use it more but how can I work it into my schedule?  I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair daily because really it&#x27;s not good to do that.  Shower \\&quot;hell yeah\\&quot; but give the hair a break.  So if I put the stuff on my scalp at night before bed I will have to wash my hair in the morning or look like I never wash it if I wash it every-other-day.  But doing that won&#x27;t allow me to use the stuff twice a day and have sexy hair . . . I&#x27;m tempted to go back to using 2% Minoxidil, but it didn&#x27;t make a hair-growth difference, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying 5%.  But the 5% is so noticeable to-me on my scalp.  And with Minoxidil, you have to use it always . . . I&#x27;m ready for a new invention!!!  I&#x27;m not really sure how to handle this.  I like clean hair, no hair spray or gel, just clean hair . . . So 3 stars says I&#x27;m stuck in the middle . . .</li>
            <li> Since Costco no longer sells the liquid only the foam and a much higher mark up .  this turned out to be an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in several days, good condition, no complaints, especially happy with price!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered 4 days late with Prime shipping. Product does cause severe itching. Waiting to see results.</li>
            <li> Terrible Item, No comparison to Rogaine. Don&#x27;t waste your money, just do things right the first time!</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to Rogaine at a fraction of the cost.  Why pay almost a $100 instead of approximatley $30 for a similar product?</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and come from a family of men with receding hairlines.  This product says it isn&#x27;t supposed to work on the front of your hairline and is intended for the vertex but it is working great on my receding line.  I just hit my 3 month mark and already have seen signifigant regrowth and fuller hair up front.  I just had my haircut and she cut it shorter than normal and it still looks great with the fuller hair.  I will be ordering this product again and sticking with it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Made my face really itchy and dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only making an inital review here but will try to update it over the course of the next few months.  At the outset, I&#x27;m 52 years old and have always had very fine (\\&quot;baby\\&quot; fine) hair, brown tending toward blond.  I started losing it in my 20&#x27;s but even now few people who hear I&#x27;m trying to \\&quot;save it\\&quot; believe I need to.  Nonetheless, by the end of the day my scalp gets pretty obvious and I decided a few weeks ago that I&#x27;d try to stop losing more before it got too obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had two primary concerns about trying any product for hair loss.  First and foremost, I was skeptical that it would work.  Like most of us, I just figured this was my genetic lot in life and I had to learn to accept it.  I&#x27;d heard all the horror stories about bogus hair-loss products and was (and still am) highly skeptical.  Now that it&#x27;s an OTC product, however, the price has become extremely reasonable, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second concern (and the one I wanted to write about today) was that it would be such a pain to apply that I wouldn&#x27;t stick with it.  I&#x27;m not the most disciplined guy in the world and sticking to any twice-a-day regimine isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve ever managed to do before.  Thus far (two weeks), I&#x27;m very favorably impressed.  In fact, it&#x27;s been so easy I&#x27;m actually finding myself looking forward to the next application.  (Okay, that&#x27;s a bit exaggerated, but it&#x27;s kind of true, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried other applicators before so I can&#x27;t comment on those, but the Kirkland one really does do well.  It&#x27;s very easy to measure out the \\&quot;dosage\\&quot; and very easy to get it to the right places.  If I didn&#x27;t make an extra effort to massage it across my scalp (and along my widow&#x27;s peaks even though manufacturers state outright that results there are unlikely), it literally wouldn&#x27;t take more than a minute to get it done;  it seldom takes more than that even with the neurotic massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take too long to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and I&#x27;m not thrilled about that (about an hour in my experience).  Once it does, however, my hair looks fine and I think it even adds a little more body than my baby-fine hair usually has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, it&#x27;s obviously too early for me to expect any results, but I&#x27;m favorably pleased so far.  I&#x27;ll try to report in a few months on actual results, but I started taking finasteride (\\&quot;Propecia\\&quot;) at the same time so my reporting will be skewed.  They do say that the combination of the two is the most effective treatment extant so I guess we&#x27;ll see.  If you&#x27;re worried about this being difficult to use and stick with, however, my advice right now is to go for it.  In theory, at least, we have nothing to lose but our hair loss and now that the price has gotten so reasonable, why not give it a shot?  I am.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes, guys.</li>
            <li> my hair was thin and fine to begin with, but at 39 years old and being a female, when my hair started falling out and my doctor couldn&#x27;t find a physiological reason, I decided to give this a try. 5 months in and my bald spots are going away!! my hair feels thicker and I have more confidence. my scalp did itch at first, but I started using selsun blue and it stopped. I am sooooo happy I can&#x27;t believe it!!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and really likes it.</li>
            <li> ATE my poor scalp. My head is read and peeling like it has been burned and driving me crazy with the itching. And that&#x27;s after just ONE USE. Horrible stuff.</li>
            <li> The applicator is great getting directly to the scalp</li>
            <li> This is the product that really works. My husband got his hair back! Very happy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> used this product for just first 3 days and got to say I hate this product. My hair is clean without any dandruff and I was never itching my head before I used this product, I lost so much of my hair due to so much of itching and dandrufff in the first 3 days of its use. I will regret this mistake for my rest of the life.</li>
            <li> the product went very well and I&#x27;m starting to see results</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff many years and it still works. Won&#x27;t add hair where no follicles exist but will make existing hair thicker.After the initial time to start to grown, I cut back to once each evening.</li>
            <li> The product leaves a sticky coating on hair unlike other products I that have used. Hopefully results will be positive.</li>
            <li> Been on this for a month and I still don&#x27;t look like a wookie.</li>
            <li> Vanity and old F-rt hair loss made me try this. No dramatic hair loss or gain. Less hair in the shower drain (I think). Most of the positive effect is the cosmetic look and feel of more hair from the Propylene Glycol ingredient. If this low cost alternative versus the name brand minoxidil was not available, I&#x27;d probably not buy it. As long as this is available, I&#x27;ll continue with it.</li>
            <li> I use it for a year already, and have no complaints whatsoever. Only positive results. It works.</li>
            <li> seeing new hair growth already.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, high quality product.</li>
            <li> Got it for my bro in Canada where you need a prescription for this 5% version he likes it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 6 months. I have pretty good hair now.</li>
            <li> i dont think he used it everyday tho. maybe thats why it didnt really work. it did leave a weird white residue on his head and it became itchy</li>
            <li> I have been used it for a year and a half, and in the first year, I lose a lot of hair, but, in a couple of month later, my hair star growing again, you just need to give it time, and should work</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me. Absolutely waste of money. It did warn you its not for everyone. Unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking it would work as well as Rogaine, it didn&#x27;t-it&#x27;s a waste of money. It gives you dandruff but nothing else-if anything I&#x27;m starting to lose the hair I had gained with the Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Party of two at home being using  this proiduct for years buying from Costco and also the previous name. we recomended</li>
            <li> This is truly scentless and it makes my scalp feel tingly for a little bit after application, I HOPE this means the follicles are waking up! The applicator is very easy to use; a full squeeze of the bulb draws up just about the recommend dosage amount. Hope this works!</li>
            <li> GREAT SELLER AND WILL COME BACK AGAIN. also, FINE PRODUCT WHICH I HAVE USED FOR A NUMBER OD YEARS WITH GOOD RESULTS. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> First off: I haven&#x27;t tried other Minoxidil containing brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I&#x27;m in the UK but amazon.co.uk rarely has a seller for this so I&#x27;m reviewing here and buying off ebay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prescription for Minoxidil in the UK is not free, and would have cost me ~£40 a month (about $65). So I tried this, which costs me about £5 a month and it actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to note: I&#x27;m 21 and had quite a nice patch going on. You could clearly see my scalp through my thin hair on top, especially under direct light. It took me about 6 weeks of use before the Minoxidil started working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair loss didn&#x27;t seem to completely stop, but it mate well have slowed. For me the hair growth seemed sudden: in the period of 3 weeks, I went from the lowest amount of hair back to where I am now: the amount of hair I had about a year ago, which is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other news is that I didn&#x27;t even use it properly sometimes (by accident). For whatever reason I wouldn&#x27;t get the chance to apply it twice a day, sometimes it was only 1 or even 0 times but I never missed 2 days in a row. This might be why it took time to start working, but the packaging said it could take up to 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make my hair kind of greasy/sticky but only where I apply it and to the casual observer it looks like some generic hair gel or something. It&#x27;s also kind of hard to part your hair and apply directly to the roots so I don&#x27;t bother, and just spot it on all over then rub it in to get it to the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this even if my hair loss will resume if I stop use, because as long as Kirkland don&#x27;t jack their prices I&#x27;ll just keep using it. If they do, however, jack their prices, I&#x27;ll just buy a different brand as 5% Minoxidil clearly works for me so the brand shouldn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way: it&#x27;s poisonous to cats. Just something to be aware of if you didn&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> Its working high time. I&#x27;ve shifted to this brand from Lipogaine based on the reviews and cost factor is a major one. I&#x27;ve prematured hair loss started from around the age of 20, now its 23. I&#x27;ve used many products like hair max laser comb, homeopathy, Lipogaine, Procerin etc. But Kirkland worked high time, it starts with a symptom of increased hair loss after usage for a month or so and then the hair began to grow again... and i am happy to say about to increased hair density which i didnt see during Lipogaine usage also. I used to take procerin medication for saw palmetto(DHT inhibitor) ingredient but i have stopped it as it is not needed with Kirkland anymore. You may also use other B complex vitamins, green tea etc. I understand that usage of a minoxidil solution is a never ending process as it results in hair loss if stopped using but it having a low price tag, it is not a big deal to continue i suppose. Few other symptons i have been through are like slightly increased facial hair, at times increased heart rate when used in large amounts for a single application.... Go for it if you wanna try the same... Good luck</li>
            <li> I received the product as ordered, quickly.  It was packed well to prevent damage.  I am a happy customer.  My only  beef...I don&#x27;t like reviews that demand a specific number of words so this is likely my last one.</li>
            <li> I was starting to lose some hair near the crown area of my head. Within 5-6 weeks after I started applying the solution I had started to see hair regrowth in that area. However I use less than the suggested 1 ml quantity as the extra liquid starts to run off. I usually apply 0.5ml to the area and rub it around with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product it does what it&#x27;s supposed to maintains or promotes hair growth. I have frontal pattern baldness and have used the product for over a year. the results of been good. The price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I just use this things cause I prefer them to any other holding chemical, havent seen any hair grouth in years and it kinda dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It seems to be working and is the least expensive Minoxidil I have been able to find anywhere. It&#x27;s a Costco product and I don&#x27;t have a membership to Costco.</li>
            <li> My hair starting thinning two years ago.After two months of using this product my hair that had been thinning around my forehead came back.</li>
            <li> excellent product at go od price.  will reorder when needed.  delivered on time and in good condition  chancey r</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this much hair since I was 15. It really works for me!</li>
            <li> If you are a rebel and want to use it on your face I&#x27;d recommend skipping a day or two each week to heavily moisturize your skin and beard because the alcohol is very drying.</li>
            <li> Used it for &amp;#62;10 years.</li>
            <li> Decent product but will create flakes like no tomorrow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 yrs now because it was less expensive than Top brand rogaine but hey why not if it works the same right. Thanks to this I get to keep my existing hair which is alright with me. Doesn&#x27;t really grow new hair as promise hence the 4 stars but still a very happy customer and for a mere $45 bucks a yr why not.</li>
            <li> Recommended, exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Just as pictured now let&#x27;s cross our fingers!</li>
            <li> Being a regular user this particular product caused major major inflammation</li>
            <li> For reviewers complaining about greasiness or the fact that it is hard to apply, know what you are getting. I&#x27;ve used these greasy Minoxidil formulations for years and this brand is actually much better than some of the others I&#x27;ve used. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for if it works, that&#x27;s one of those subjective things that you&#x27;ll never get the same answer to. I started using things like this about 5 years ago when I first started to notice hair thinning at the top of my head. In 5 years, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse. So has it worked? IDK, it seems like it stopped it.</li>
            <li> Very good and results perfect</li>
            <li> Great price for rogaine generic  a fraction of the cost od same product...they took this off the market in many stores &amp; am glad to get the Generic again  the foam is so messy &amp; expensive  Been looking for this for awhile  a Costco brand thanks  amazon</li>
            <li> I have been using this 5% solution for around 1.5 months so far. By beard (full) is finally starting to sprout out from having stuble for 35 years. Gives you very very dry skin though. So use a VERY GOOD lotion on your face 3-4 hours after each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it takes around 6 months to see the full benefit, but you notice it around 2 months in.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the savings.  My Dr. assured me the house brand is as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Good i guess. Too scared to use it</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel greasy, otherwise a good value.</li>
            <li> on time delivery and accurate product.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I have ordered this a second time. First of all let me say that this stuff was a terrible experience from the start. In the first 2 months I did lose hair and I was going through alopecia at the same time. If you have that condition I highly recommend going for cortisone shots and use prescription cortisone cream with this product. On its own minoxidil cannot restore your hair if you have these patchy spots especially on the side or back of your head. If you are like me you probably will use more than 1ml each use and will go through more of this. While this product says &amp;#34;6 month supply&amp;#34;, I went through one in about 4 months. Still averaging about $7.5 a month is worth it. I have been seeing a physician who tells me to use this product continuously. You have to be diligent and get through the shedding period but it has been about 5 months and I definitely have more hair and experience less shedding. Dandruff continues to be a problem. My advice to anyone considering this product is stick through it and find a regimine that works for you. Also leave the product in for 4 hours before sweating intensely or showering. It&#x27;s not miracle drug but it does work to some extent and I will probably continue using this for the rest of my life at 27 because it kept me from going down the path of baldness... I will probably follow-up in a year or so if it stops working. I have heard some reports of that but I am going still continue using this product until that happens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and started to lose hair in the front of my scalp about two years ago.  My brother told me about this product and while I can&#x27;t say it has worked that well for him, I have had nothing but success.  I only use it once before I go to bed.  It has definitely stopped hair from falling out and I can&#x27;t imagine I would stop using it at this point.  I was really skeptical and I&#x27;m sure it is all about catching the problem before it becomes too severe for this to work.  I was very pleased by my results and even my barber noticed.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with your service,I am going to order more for a friend. Please, let me know if you have another product for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Georges</li>
            <li> We have used this product for many years and have never been disappointed.  You can&#x27;t beat the price. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use this product as it makes you r hair thin at first ...takes ages to take effect and dropped my blood pressure. It also gave me palpitations</li>
            <li> Honestly I never used it as per directions. I simply didnt like that junk in my hair. I tried it for maybe like a month using it only once per day (during the day while at work) and then rinsing it off at night before bed. Didn&#x27;t really notice any change. Maybe if I used it twice per day it might have worked, but I&#x27;m not spending the rest of my life with gunk on my head. I like hair, but not THAT much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just cut my hair real short and when it gets worse it&#x27;s getting shaved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and was so disappointed when&lt;br /&gt;Costco took it out of my store. Thank God fr Amazon! I was so happy to see&lt;br /&gt;the same product available here. I hope it&#x27;s always available here.</li>
            <li> have been using for years&lt;br /&gt;havent seen any improvement</li>
            <li> I used the foam before, which was great.  It went in your hair and then magically absorbed.  Not true with this stuff.  It&#x27;s basically the same as applying a tablespoon of olive oil to your hair.  I&#x27;ve limited this to right before bed since I can&#x27;t have this in my hair during the day, but have started skipping it all together because it&#x27;s so unpleasant.  I&#x27;ll be switching back to the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I&#x27;m mainly comparing the oil to the foam.  In terms of its comparison to other oils?  I don&#x27;t know.  This is the only one I tried.</li>
            <li> Great product, It really works excellent. My hair is growing up again.</li>
            <li> Women CAN use the 5% strength as well. Kirkland gives you the quality with out the sticker shock price of brand Rogaine. Skip the expensive brand and get your hair back as effectively with Kirkland.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as name brand, half the price.</li>
            <li> I use this on a receding hairline.  It says it&#x27;s not for that, but it works for me.  Without it, my mostly straight hairline starts getting real widow peaky.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this to avoid being bald so early. I&#x27;m 21 and well it has helped to avoid the hair to fall as fast as it was falling. I must admit that I have not used it as directed therefore the hair is not growing again. I&#x27;ll start using it as directed and come back to see if the hair has grown or it&#x27;s still in pause.</li>
            <li> This is the same as the name brand for less than half the price. I have enough for almost a year for 23.00! I am already growing my hair back so ............Thanks Kirkand!</li>
            <li> exact same thing as Rogaine, at a quarter of the price. I am on my first bottle of this, and had used a single bottle of rogaine prior and am 58 years old. I have had the &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; for several years and this seems to be regrowing hair already. A bit early to give it a 100%, but it appears to be working</li>
            <li> I have used as directed for 3 months and saw very good results on thinning area on the scalp. That was the good part.&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned on the pack i started having facial hair out of  no where and stopped it immediatley and now back to thinning and facial hair issue.&lt;br /&gt;Planning to try the 2%.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp itch like crazy. I couldn&#x27;t use it. Also I found out, Minoxidil might get your hair grown but you have to use it constantly. If you stop, your hair will fall off a lot faster than it grows.</li>
            <li> Ive done research on how to grow thicker/fuller eyebrows, and Ive came across a list, Castor Oil, Brow Serum, and 5% Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;Ive used every item on list and the only most effective one was Minoxidil. I know its tended for ppl with severe hair loss issues, but this is great for brows.&lt;br /&gt;I was a victim of going to the brow salon very frequent, and it wasnt long before I had to pencil my brows in just to shape them. Ive used it for about 5 months and I went from brow-less to Megan Fox brows seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS- Last over a year for brows, Been almost 5 months and Im not even done with 1/2 the bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS- The liquid towards a yellow, orangey color after a certain time period. However its still good usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using the product for the past 3 weeks and I know it takes at least 2 months to make a fair assessment on whether it works or not.  However, based on the past 3 weeks it has definately improved on decreasing hair loss which is the amount of hair I can see in my hands while shampooing in the shower.  While I have not yet noticed any significant amount of hair regrowth which is expected since it is too soon to tell, at this point I think the most significant benefit is the price which is less than half the cost of any competeing product.  I actually stopped using ProRestora (which was actually a good product) because of the terrible customer service and the length of time it took (almost 4 months) to get my order.  It only took a week to get the Kirkland product at less than half the price, so if it works anywhere near as well as ProRestora, it is definately worth it.  I&#x27;d really like to hear from anyone else who has used this product for more than 2 months, and in the meantime I also plan on updating my rating after that time.</li>
            <li> I used Kirkland Minoxidil for a couple of weeks and my head began to itch like crazy.  In the beginning I couldn&#x27;t understand what was happening.  I went to several doctors who said I had psoriasis and recommended I use a dandruff shampoo to make it stop.  I used several different good quality shampoos and prescription shampoos for months, but nothing made the itching stop.  Finally, I decided to stop using the Kirkland product and by the next day the itching stopped.  So, if anyone out there is experiencing the same problem stop using this product and see if the itching clears up.</li>
            <li> i have read a lot about this and i know its a great product but it does not work for me</li>
            <li> Word to the wise, if you want to get this make sure that you&#x27;re ready to commit to it. Many people have had legit results from it, but they&#x27;re consistent in using it twice daily. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been that consistent but I have seen some results and I also got a bit of a confidence boost from just using it because I felt like things were on their way to getting better. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This truly works well and is a great inexpensive generic version of Rogaine. They generally tell women to start with 2.5 %,but a Dr recommended using the %5 for best results and it works.  Give it 6 months to start strengthening your finer hair&amp; you WILL see a difference.. I use only around hairline. You also have to be diligent with applying it nightly in the beginning. As it is cosmetic, if you stop using it, it stops working. You receive 3 bottles and it last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> No words. It works. You need to wait for 4 months and more, but I don&#x27;t like my hairs after applying minoxidil. Too sticky :(</li>
            <li> Did not helped me at all after 6 months using it correctly.</li>
            <li> good product, and the price is ok too</li>
            <li> Kirkland 5 does not have a seal, but this thing really works. The first PR lion king.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various liquid Minoxidil solutions (both Rogaine and various generics) since about 1990.  I&#x27;ve used 3 bottles of this package and am on my 4th. Seems like it works as well as any of the others I&#x27;ve tried. It seems no better or worse than other generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all the Minoxidil solutions I&#x27;ve used, it leaves a yellow residue on pillows, sheets, and anyplace else my hair contacts over time. (Rogaine says it doesn&#x27;t have this problem, but it&#x27;s been so long since I used the Brand, that I can&#x27;t say either way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend using quality launderable pillow and mattress protectors to prevent this problem on things which cannot be easily washed. I use a hand towel that matches my sofa back on my recliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could bring doilies back in style.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and my facial hair is growing from zero to a super beard.</li>
            <li> A bit greasy for my liking. I hear branded Rogaine is less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is what it claims to be, the price is decent, and the packaging and applicator pipette are good.</li>
            <li> Hard to find the liquid version of 5% Minoxidil in stores.  Works good.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, but unfortunately it&#x27;s still too soon leave any real remarks regarding the performance of the product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for only about a week.</li>
            <li> I hope that this is really and merely the generic version of Rogaine because you cannot beat the price. I wish that I had the ablitiy to take it to a lab  so as to prove that it is what it claims to be, but I&#x27;m a trusting soul, so I continue to buy it, and it costs 50% less than the Rogaine that you see in the stores</li>
            <li> No problems with product and/or delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using products with Minoxidil 5% for many years.  This product is quickly and easy to use...similar to other package I have purchased in the past.  As with other products like this you just need to be give it a little time to dry.  In the morning that&#x27;s not a problem.  At night I try to not to use just before I go to bed to prevent getting it on pillow sheet.  Even if it does it is no big deal.</li>
            <li> does anyone have a problem with the container? Mine stops releasing the foam, leaving about 1/2 in the bottle. I now half 3 half containers. my mousse works better than this. what am I doing wrong?</li>
            <li> The product is a good value and arrived on time. Will do more business with these guys in the near future.</li>
            <li> Been using over a year and seems to help. Not losing as before. Keeping my fingers crossed. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great deal for a lot of product, however, this product did not work for me as I did not grow back hair.  This product also makes your hair oily and will stain pillows and clothes light in color.</li>
            <li> I still have hair so it must be working.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from Las Vegas World Brand Famous Center. They clearly mentioned that this product is made in Canada, but what they have sent to me is made in Israel, you can read several reviews for Minoxidil from this country!!!!. I never put reviews for products, but They are big liars!!!! You cannot return this product because it is considered as a hazardous material. it is better to buy these products from a store that you can return it if you find they Lie!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wish the Government would make sure these claims are true; not sure it really works but since I don&#x27;t smoke; I &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; my money on this.  I could legally market tap water and say it &amp;#34;May&amp;#34; make you smarter</li>
            <li> It takes at least three months for actual effect, but it seems like working okay so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does not cause any skin trouble so far.</li>
            <li> First of all it stinks.then  runs all down the back of my neck or my face.Developed little bumps all where it ran on my face n neck...now im stuck with 5 months worth.I wouldn&#x27;t even try to resell this product....</li>
            <li> Good product. Exactly what I wanted!  Exactly as advertised!  I have to keep writing stuff to make amazon happy with enough words</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than estimated delivery and I&#x27;ve grown some new hair in my vertex area.  My bald spot(vertex) is beginning to decrease in size, but no growth in my frontal hair line.  I like this product and hopefully they&#x27;ll come up with a formula to help regrow hair in the frontal and temple regions.  I strongly recommend this product and vendor.  2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years.  Although I have not grown any new hair, it apparently stopped any further receding or baldness. I&#x27;m almost afraid to stop using it as my hair thinness might regress to the more balding condition of my brother and father. As an added benefit, its the same ingredient as Rogaine but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price!  Name brand was twice as much for half the amount of the product. My hair has definitely made a rebound using this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product Is great I have been issuing it for almost a year now great results! And I continue to use and hope to find it here again</li>
            <li> If you want constant itching, burning of scalp with flaking and dandruff, this is the product for you.  No redeeming features.</li>
            <li> Seems like a quality product</li>
            <li> Color be impressed.  I noticed a little thinning was starting to happen.  I already knew, based on my family, this would happen one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product in Feb 2013.  It is now April 2013 and I can no longer notice the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate that I&#x27;ll have to continue buying and using this product, but it works.  I&#x27;ve noticed no side effects.  5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star to my families genetics.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle worker but I did notice some distinct change for the better, thats all I asked.</li>
            <li> I decided to not fight my programming on this. It&#x27;s just a lot of work to maintain this stuff and it added serious complications to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> The product was open when I received. I try to contact to customer services for return no answer since the first week of march.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s April and no answer.</li>
            <li> Have used the product for several years.&lt;br /&gt;Still thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;But hope it prolongs the shelf life of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can not compare the product effect -&lt;br /&gt;since I can not see the result without using?</li>
            <li> I love it.  My hair has stoped falling and new hari is growing.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he was super offended at first. However with time it worked so well, that now hes recommends it to other balding men. Only complaint is that it will forever turn your pillowcases yellow.</li>
            <li> For me this product works. I began taking strong medications about 8 to 10 years ago. One day I made an appointment to have my hair braided. The hair dresser kept telling me that my hair was coming out by the handful. I searched the local markets and I found Minoxidil 5% being sold under many different labels. I bought a bottle that was heavily discounted, I began applying it to my scalp 2-3 times a day by the passing of 30 days I found hair had returned to those areas and I trimmed my hair to balance the growth with the original</li>
            <li> Still using it - you have to wait up to 6 month until you will receive first results.</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere ts 5% minoxidil same as rogaine at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> Works on the crown quite well, but not the front. Just as it says.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my grandson.  He has new hair coming in and is really pleased.  This is working for him.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in both this Kirkland brand and in the Rogaine brand is the same, which is Minoxidil. For those of you who don’t know, this recently came off-patent so anyone can use the same active ingredient, allowing companies like Costco (Kirkland) to sell cheaper versions of the same product. That said, you should really only use this product if you already know [[ASIN:B0000Y8H3S this product, Rogaine]] is going to work for you. There seems to be two types of people who have baldness –those who Minoxidil works for, and those who it does not. This is why you’ll see so many 1 star reviews for Rogaine or this Kirkland Minoxidil. Honestly they are very similar, you might notice some lower quality in Monoxidil by Kirkland in terms of foaming-effect but they have the same ingredient and I’ve found the work equally as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other products you can try if you find that Minoxidil doesn’t work for you, such as a [[ASIN:B00KYXSF00 Biochanin-A product like this one]]. It affects the hair in a different way than Minoxidil. Minoxidil tries to make your body circulate more blood to your scalp where your follicles will grow.  A Biochanin A product works at inhibiting the chemicals our body produces that lead to hair loss. Both approaches are equally valid, except some work for some, and other’s work for others. If you’re like me, you’ve probably tried both. I can say that the Biochanin A product from NuNutrients has been the most effective for me in-terms of seeing hair regrowth, but I’ve also used Rogaine as well as the Kirkland brand and seen results, just a lot slower.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great product</li>
            <li> Since taking this product a month ago, I have been unable to sustain an erection. I have promptly stopped taking it and hopefully I get the ability back as I am only 31 years old. DO NOT TAKE! Vanity is not as important as sex life.</li>
            <li> must use daily - it has slowed down hair loss - I have used now for 4 years</li>
            <li> I like the kirkland minoxidil</li>
            <li> As a women with little hair on top of my head this is t he only product that works.  The cheapest price anywhere. Just can&#x27;t be it,&lt;br /&gt;less then half of the drugstore price:)</li>
            <li> I have been using Rogaine brand but after trying this one i feel i get the same effect but less itching on my scalp..Totally recommended.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this here, especially since it&#x27;s made by Costco and Costco hasn&#x27;t had it in stock for a while. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Want your head to turn white and flakey??? use this product</li>
            <li> It works great, but it just to long to actually see the difference... Put after a month and a half everything is looking good... I would recommend it to anyone who needs one... Thanks...</li>
            <li> I have been using Monoxodil for many years and ound that it helps with re-growing my hair.  You must follow directions and be patient, but it works.  If you stop using it - it stops working.  This is a good price  and fast service.</li>
            <li> seems to be good stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;•Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;•Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;•Don&#x27;t describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).&lt;br /&gt;•Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying this, do yourself a favor and buy the smallest amount possible.  Desperation triggers everyone into wanting this to work and be financially feasible for those of us whom it isn&#x27;t.  This particular product made my face swell up and burn like fire.  I tried to push through it for my vanity but my family couldn&#x27;t take it.  I tried switching to the foam with maybe less swelling, but itchy as all hell.</li>
            <li> The second month I started to take, there is a small result. I recommend everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend everyone.  I recommend everyone.  I recommend everyone.</li>
            <li> As advertised great price good product</li>
            <li> I am a female and have been using 5% solution ofr about 8 months.  The hair growth is steady.  Granted the hair is not as thick but I am very pleased.  I found that using a square applicator such as a cosmetic cotton square is the way to go.  The solution will go directly on the area that you intend and will not run down your face or give you the greasy hair look.  I am giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used  this product from Costco for the last 5 years. It works and it really  grows hair .the price is less than half of the original product with exact the same ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this item a four out of five start rating, for one reason. I just started using the product so...At this early stage when I get my hair cut, the new growth isn&#x27;t making the clippers dull ...YET  I am patient and I still have five and a half months supply to use. That&#x27;s the only reason for 4 and not 5 stars. Received before the stated delivery date. Product was as described. If  by the end of the six months I have any success with the product, I plan on returning and bumping the rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> Saw many fine hairs, but this is a lifelong process and didn&#x27;t see enough results after 6 months to continue.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It has worked wonders for hair regrowth. Sometimes experience minor itching from use, which is an anticipated side-effect.</li>
            <li> Best for price and performance. I also use their daily vitamins and omega 3 supplements and I NEVER based it on price. I did my research tptally on quality. Surprise you can actually get somethings good at a fair price.</li>
            <li> decided to up the % after 10 years on it....don&#x27;t see why this would not work.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and product</li>
            <li> it scratches my head all the time&lt;br /&gt;Impossible to continue using it</li>
            <li> My hair is growing back and I have had some good comments.  Its best to purchase in this quantity and saves me lots.  I was buying singles but found this deal</li>
            <li> The best for keeping the hair you have. No complaints, no problems, no side effects. And I think it&#x27;s waaaaay better than the name brand spray on stuff which smells way too toxic for me.</li>
            <li> Really works.  I use this one instead of the weaker version they try to pawn off on women and it&#x27;s fine.  Be forewarned, however, that it has a lot of alcohol in it, which is what enables it to dry, but that takes all the shine out of your hair and leaves it looking dry and ugly.  I even started to use a little brush to apply it with, but it didn&#x27;t make a significant difference and takes a lot of time.  If you wash your hair every other day then it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be forewarned thar when you first start losing it, you&#x27;ll lost a lot of hair for the first couple of weeks.  I researched this and it&#x27;s not uncommon, but is a bit scary and leaves the impression that it does the opposite of growing hair.  Wait it out, it does grow back and the sparse areas really do fill in.  It does not work on scar tissue, so if you&#x27;re hoping to grow back hair on a scar, you&#x27;ll be hoping in vain.</li>
            <li> WARNING: you cannot return this product if you buy it.</li>
            <li> well, my head is full of hair, no bald spot. Therefore I give all the credit to this product. I was losing some hair a few years back and once I started using the product, hair loss has slowed significantly.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that it has to be applied precisely so the liquid doesn&#x27;t just run down my face or neck</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
            <li> Horrible. Do Not Buy. The liquid does not stick in your hair. It flows down just like water. And they do not allow a return on this product if you do not like it.</li>
            <li> My endorsement is not actually for this brand. I purchased some Minoxidil at Sams and I have been using it for a couple of months. It has worked better than I even hoped. I did not have a receding hairline, but it was thinning out on top, but because of Minoxidil, it has filled in quite a bit. I would think this stuff is the same as I purchased from Sams, just a different label. I tried to buy it again from Sams but they did not have any.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing a post from one of the people who used this and achieved amazing results. I was hoping for the same results but it may be too early to write a review because it is only been a couple of months and I have not seen any major improvements/results. I will be updating this review in a few more months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the minoxidil for about 3 months now. It took close to 4 weeks before noticing any serious changes, but since then things have been steadily improving in my hair growth. I noticed my hair looking thicker and fuller as well as starting to grow in throughout my bald spots. The application can be a little challenging and time consuming as it comes in a liquid dropper form compared to others like shampoos or pills, but there are results to be hand with the product if you&#x27;re willing to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the minoxidil, I also added in a few pill supplements about 3 weeks ago. Hair growth essentials and biotin ([[ASIN:B00B5OM58U Hair Growth Essentials + FREE Maximum Strength Biotin Tablets]]) are a great combination for increased growth as well as strength and shine. My hair was very dull and lifeless when I started to bald so having an improvement in the visual appeal was great for me. The biotin is all natural so that made me a little more comfortable. Plus, if I&#x27;m on the road or on vacation, it&#x27;s a lot easier to take the pills than travel with the liquid minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Game changer! Wish I started sooner, Be patient, don&#x27;t expect results sooner than 4 months. Brought back 25% of lost hair in 4 months. Side effects include dry scalp and mild irritation especially with over application. Don&#x27;t waste money buying brand name products when generics are composed of exact same formula. Product definitely worth trying. Good luck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old white male with the usual pattern baldness.  It seems to stop further hair loss, and to somewhat fill back the top and towards the front of the head.  You have to have realistic expectations.  Don&#x27;t expect to regain the hair you had 20 years ago.  I&#x27;m happy with the results</li>
            <li> It works. I had a problem with itchy scalp but I think it&#x27;s normal and it wasn&#x27;t chronically itchy except for in the shower. I thought I had folliculitis or something. But it was intrinsic with the need to keep reapplying. I switched to the equate version after my first order of the Kirkland version. I figured it would be the same.. it is not the same. I swear to you my hair started falling out. As if the product was weaker? I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m coming back to this product. It was working beautifully. I regret switching to the equate version. twitter: @drumbumsean</li>
            <li> Great product  Thanks</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced product, sent promptly.</li>
            <li> Working great!  I&#x27;m using it for receding hairline and even before the first bottle is empty I&#x27;m seeing amazing results.  Very happy with the product.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> I am surprised but I think this actually works. I switched back to the foam for a while and I definitely noticed my hair started receding again. I would recommend it and use if for the front and top of my hair.</li>
            <li> Good but much more expensive than the one from Sams club</li>
            <li> Did not work at all garbage.</li>
            <li> I cant tell if it growing new hair but I think it may be keeping what I have from hitting the sink.</li>
            <li> Excellent value, and very prompt service.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recommend this to anyone...</li>
            <li> This is the best Minoxidil I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;I have used PiloGro &amp;TuGain in the past but never satisfied with the result and they made me feel dizzy and caused uncomfortable headaches. I had an assumption that all minoxydil will have this side effect until I try Kirkland Minoxidil 5%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to apply with the tube they provide with the package. It gives good result for me and especially for my friend who is in the initial stage of hair fall. The result is better when you use it with dermaroller. Please refer to the right size of dermaroller and guideline before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and I bought on for my brother as well. If you found my review helpful, please click the yes button below.</li>
            <li> No regrowth but it seems to help slow the lose.</li>
            <li> All OK... very good!!!</li>
            <li> This is an UPdate, i cant seem to find the thread to my previous review posting but in any case will follow up here. I am presently on my 9th month of using Kirkland&#x27;s Minoxidil (5%). I&#x27;m now 38 years of age and began losing my hair noticably at age 27.  From what i gather i have had about a 3% increase in total hair regrowth per month.  It is slow going and i have skipped days here and there caught up in the shuffle of life but have had steady progress.  So i now have about 30% more hair than when i started.  This includes my hairline in front as well. There was hair loss from using this product as part of the process of renewal but is filling in. I don&#x27;t use it on my entire scalp, meaning i am maintaining a receding hairline or widows peak of sorts as i like the way it looks.  My hair grows thicker and faster on the left side of my head (not a side effect:) So it was annoying to me to have my hair dissapearing in such a hap-hazard fashion.  In addition, some life events contributed i think to accelerated hair loss so i am adamant about giving my hair a second life as such.  I accept my hair loss but would like it to happen a bit more graceful.  Kirkland has definitely done its job and im thankfull for that. A bit more confidence- enough to feel free spirited flirty again with the girlies and not begrudgingly envious of hairy man heads.  With the price in comparison to the competition you just cant beat it.  I don&#x27;t expect to either recieve or be able to maintain hair longer than 3 inches.  I have heard this from a hair stylist. The volume of hair i think would make it difficult to reach the scalp effectively but i could be wrong and find a technique. Minus one star for not adding some of the following in the instructions- that would make it a GREAT product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS for Optimal Growth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Use Hair dryer after showering and massage well into scalp for 5 minutes to optimize absorption and stimulate circulation for better hair growth. (that last notquantifiable by my experience -just intuition)&lt;br /&gt;* Improved diet and taking essential vitamins and minerals&lt;br /&gt;* Getting sun and exercise.&lt;br /&gt;* Use Nioxin for a shampoo and invest in a DHA blocker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it- hopefully you will have hair as well!- Cheers</li>
            <li> Product was delivered.  The package was different than the costco brand that was being displayed in their ad.  I hope this is not some bootleg...made in china...counterfeit product.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product at a lower strenght. I was advised to switch to the higher percentage. I am generaly happy with this product except when I need to style my hair, immeditely after applying the product, which leaves a ashy residue on my hair. Well to make a long story short, I have learned to wait at least 15 minutes after applying the produt before styling my hair. Just allow this product to get absorbedto your scalp before using a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It took almost six months before I could look at the top on my head and say, \\&quot;this stuff definitely works.\\&quot; The packaging will tell you it *may* work as soon as two months, but since I had already purchased six months&#x27; worth, I figured I&#x27;d stick with it (if you do some research online, you&#x27;ll see that for some guys it takes a whole year). I am very pleased with the result. My hair is not totally regrown yet, but there is very noticeable extra foliage where there used to be none. I&#x27;m hoping in a couple more months it&#x27;ll be fully regrown, or almost so. In any case, I am pleased and will continue to use it. You figure it&#x27;s about $5 per month... very much worth it IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my point is, if you don&#x27;t see results in two months, don&#x27;t give up just yet. Also I used it AS DIRECTED, once in the morning and once in the evening every day. Some downsides: it takes FOREVER to dry, so if you think that&#x27;s going to be a problem, seek alternative measures (if you sort of rub it in with your fingers, it would probably dry faster. I generally just apply drops to the top of my head and leave it at that). I experienced no adverse side effects except a very, very minor itchiness of my scalp. Nothing to cry over at all. I use \\&quot;dry scalp\\&quot; shampoo anyways, so that probably helps with this. Finally, the label will tell you it&#x27;s for hair loss at the vertex. That is where I am seeing the greatest benefit. HOWEVER I do also notice a small amount of regrowth up front also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways... give it a shot, and good luck!</li>
            <li> Outstanding service, great product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive in name brand... I think it&#x27;s all the same .. So I just buy the generic.. I have been buying this for years and I am happy with it.</li>

            <li> Demographic - White 44yr. old male with crown (not vertex) balding. Using Minoxidil 5% Topical solution (not foam) since 5/23/2014, today is 1/25/2015. Absolutely not vain, just uncomfortable losing hair from the crown first. If I had a frontal receding hairline I would probably approach differently. At first I purchased a 3 months supply from a Big Box retailer that was first made in Canada, the next 3 months supply from the Big Box retailer was made in Israel. This supply is a Cosco brand, and also made in Israel. I didn&#x27;t see much difference with either country of origin. Although it seems, and this is very speculative, that the dandruff is a little worse with the Israeli lot, but then again, I was using for three months by the time I got to that supply.&lt;br /&gt;My experience - I saw a definite reduction in further hair loss almost immediately, very little hair left in the tub. I saw actual regrowth by the three month mark. I can attest to this because while on vacation on the beach in July I forgot to put the usual sunscreen on my \\&quot;bald spot\\&quot; one day and my heart sunk when I realized. I usually burn for sure if I forget. But alas, I did not burn my usual bald spot. Now out 9 months and my barber says that I have decent regrowth and \\&quot;mirrored it\\&quot; for me to see. Sure enough, strong looking hairs where I know for sure there were none! Yippie!!&lt;br /&gt;Side Effects - I can attest that for me, the side effects are minimal, dandruff being the only one I suffer from. I have not had the itching that others have reported, but I do have dandruff now (that I never had before) that seems cyclic. For a few days it&#x27;s not too bad, but then one day I will shed like crazy. I just run a fine tooth comb through the hair and try and get out as much as I can. I have been using an alternating method of Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue daily since the first use because of reviews I&#x27;ve read. So I&#x27;m not sure that if I stop using these two shampoos if I would have better or worse dandruff. At some point I may let the shampoo&#x27;s run out and see how I do. For me, the dandruff isn&#x27;t so severe that it&#x27;s a deal breaker at all for the amount of regrowth and the immediate stoppage of further loss that I&#x27;ve experienced. I accept this trade off. I would give 5 stars if not for the slight trade off.&lt;br /&gt;Usage - You most definitely need to use this EVERY day TWICE a day for the REST OF YOUR LIFE. If you&#x27;re unwilling to commit, then pass. Most reviews will have people state that they \\&quot;tried it but didn&#x27;t see any relief\\&quot; (but for how long?) or \\&quot;I use it only once a day\\&quot; (not as directed) or \\&quot;I only use .75ml at a time\\&quot; (again, not directed). You need to apply following the directions and you need to be diligent. You can have the occasional miss dose here and there, but don&#x27;t slack, keep on it. I use 1ml TWICE a day, massaged into the hair and scalp at the crown by using a cross pattern. I really work it in. I try not to get my hair \\&quot;re-wet\\&quot; (pool swimming, etc.) until about three hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, your results may vary, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great improvements with this product but you&#x27;ll have to live with slightly greasy hair. After it has dried it is more or less ok though. The foam is much less greasy. Beware of all the fake reviews for other products. Minoxidil is the only stuff that has been proven to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this generic minoxidil on and off over the years.  When I have used it, I was consistent with it for at least a year.  But then I get bored with it because it appears to do nothing but be a waste of time, so I quit.  Then another while goes by and I forget how useless it is, so I try it again ....and quit again.  Maybe this time I&#x27;ll quit for good.  Don&#x27;t think I really care anymore.  If it showed any meaningful effectiveness, I prolly never would have quit to begin with.  If you&#x27;re going to do it, get the 6 month supply and stick to it.  This generic is prolly no better or worse than the name brand.  The treatment itself has just been proven ineffectual; at least for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a hardcore Lipogaine user, but I thought I would give this generic version a try. I would say it works as well as Lipogaine, but has a greasier application. I did experience hair regrowth after about 2 months of use. I would blow dry my hair after applying to diffuse the greasy look. If you&#x27;re cost conscience this stuff is for you, if not, try Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a year hoping that the results would be different. Product is much less expensive than the other brand and has no scent. I&#x27;ve stopped losing hair but haven&#x27;t seen any regrowth. I apply the recommended amount about 7 am and 8 pm. I have also seen that this causes flakes making it look like you have dandruff.</li>
            <li> Good price. Need to be patient. Might take 3 months to see any difference. Foam type not itchy, but runs out faster. Liquid last much longer than one month. Once hair comes out, may use once/day. Mine hasnot fallen out yet with just once/day use. My male friend really happy, the top of his head was shiny, but it disappeared &amp; now covered w/ fine dark hair (will probably thicken with time).</li>
            <li> I have only just begun to use the product so an immediate review as to product quality is not available. However, the application is an easy one. Just one ml morning and evening. It does not smell. It is non greasy. Best of all is the price and relative ease of shipping the product. I expect the product to work.</li>
            <li> It absolutely worked for me.  It takes about 3-4 months before you stop losing your hair and start growing it back faster. I use about 1.5 ml every morning and every night before bed and it brought much of my hair back all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stop using it, you WILL lose the hair it prevented from falling out.  I tried to stop using it on three separate occasions over the last few years and, each time, after 3 or 4 months of not using it, I started to DRAMATICALLY lose my hair.  Once I noticed my hair was falling out at a scary rate, I started using this again.  After about 4 months, my hair stopped falling out and started to fill back in again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  It seems that my local Costco is only carrying the foam rather than the liquid.</li>
            <li> Well we all know were taking a chance and dealing with percentages when trying these products i have been using it for two months and gave two months of it to my friend. He has had excellent result his hair is growing in the crown as well as in the front. I on the other hand only needed it for the front and though i have seen some results they have not been as great as my friends. So i give it 4 stars only because i want my hair to grow darn it not my friends. LOL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and it does keep my hair from falling out more; however, it does&#x27;t seem to work for me in growing more hair, maybe I should use it twice a day as is recommended, but I am allergic to the propylene glycol in it which makes my scalp red and itchy.</li>
            <li> Really greasy, no way to apply it then go out, you&#x27;d look like a dang greaser. I&#x27;m no Ponyboy, plus my hair still feel out. Might  not have if I kept using this but oh well now I&#x27;m Hollywood legend Paul Giamatti!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now I went from having very little thin hair to having a huge fluffy head of thin hair  point is this product works it&#x27;s oily but it works just use it before bed u see te results in the AM</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try.  I watched youtube videos and did some reading on Minoxidil.  I am surprised it works as well as it does and am really happy it does. This is a sensitive matter and im sure no one wants to go bald.  The thing that i dont really like is now to keep the hair I have to use it forever, but I guess it&#x27;s like brushing your teeth. You just do it as part of your daily routine! So yes, I will order this product again!</li>
            <li> For me, it has my hair regrowing.</li>
            <li> fine product made my day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your dreams will come true every day you use this incredible product to&lt;br /&gt;grow your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never write a review ever again</li>
            <li> Great deal, cheaper than name brand and works just as well. I use this every morning after washing hair. It can leave a slightly greasy look, so I blow dry after applying this when my hair is still damp. It eliminates the greasy/wet look and fluffs up my hair. Have been using for approximately 8 months, and you can no longer see my scalp through my hair at the hairline. I can see the new growth and it seems to have slowed down the hair loss while growing some new hair. Very happy, it is part of my life long routine now.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff to see what it might be like but I am not interested in the daily routine nor the consistency of the actual product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 ish gal.  My front hairline is very thin.  My dermatologist said I could use the 5% Minoxidil in front and I did for months.  My thin hair grew, but not much.  I stopped using the product because I got scalp scaling.  The grown hair, not only fell out, but my hairline looked worse.  So, I started using the Minoxidil again.  My hair started to grow again.  Now I have scalp itch, but no scaling.  I will continue to use it, because my hairline looks a little better.  The directions say, twice a day.  I use it once a day, maybe 3-4 times a week.  That seems to work.  3 stars because it&#x27;s constant work and it&#x27;s just ok.  I recommend using it twice a day for a few months.  Once the hair starts to grow, no need to use it twice/day.</li>
            <li> I think I may have seen minimal results within the first couple of months, but what people don&#x27;t usually mention is the horrible side effects.  I started feeling really tired/like I was about to pass out so frequently, after a month of use, that it began to affect my normal life.  I had to leave the stage during a performance I was in.  I had to get up and leave in the middle of a haircut because I was sweating profusely, seeing spots, and, feeling like I was about to faint.  THe worst part is, even when you stop using it, the daily feeling of faintness continues for weeks, eventually resulting in fear of leaving home/being in an environment where you can&#x27;t lie down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really really want the product, just be aware of the side affects, because they really weren&#x27;t worth it for me and it took me too long to realize what they were caused by.  Now I have 4.5 bottles of this stuff for no reason...</li>
            <li> I first started using Rogaine(liquid then the newer foam) in 1998 when I first started noticing hair loss at the age of 20. I am now 35 and the progression has continued. It gives you hope if not mostly false hope that you are trying to stop it or it is working. When people tell you more and more that you are losing your hair as it progresses though(probably because they are insecure or ignorant which you really have to try hard to not let bother you)you know it isn&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the Kirkland brand about 2 years ago and it&#x27;s great it&#x27;s cheaper because while it doesn&#x27;t work, you are saving money in the long run. The normal pattern of hair loss is the receding part in front which you notice first then you start noticing it on the top back part of your head. I used the Rogaine on the front receding part when I first started noticing the hair loss(I know the product says it is not intended for this but it&#x27;s such a self-esteem killer you want to try something that will hopefully stop it)then on the back of my head together. The hair loss progressed and I have used this religiously twice a day morning and night since I started to notice it. This product was first discovered by accident and I would love to see actually proof that it works with a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;There is a product that does work covering up the hair loss/balding spot temporarily if it isn&#x27;t too much scalp showing. I don&#x27;t want to name the product like I&#x27;m advertising it but you can find it on Amazon as well in the hair loss section. You sprinkle it on the thinning spots and it will make it look fuller(as long as you don&#x27;t get your hair wet or it starts raining then you get colored streaks on your face) Think the \\&quot;Ronco\\&quot; guy with the spray stuff that people make fun of.&lt;br /&gt;If the Minoxidil has actually helped you and stopped your hair loss and reversed it......please show me before and after results that are not hair plugs. Until then, save your money as I will by not supportingthe companies that market these products. The amazing things they can do in the medical field like cloning animals and organs but we can&#x27;t reverse hair loss and grow hair on someone&#x27;s head??</li>
