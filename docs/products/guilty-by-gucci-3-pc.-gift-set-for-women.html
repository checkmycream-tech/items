            <li> I received this wonderful fragrance 2 days early. Which was an awesome surprise! The box was elegant as were the items inside. I remember smelling this on one of those papers in Vogue or Marie Claire and thinking it was a softer scent, like Versace Crystal. If I spray it directly on my clothes or skin it is overpowering and tends to give me a headache. So what I do is spray it once into the air infront of me but about 8 inches above my head, then I stand underneath the mist. I get to smell lovely all day and not smell like a brothel. Love this product. Bought Gucci Guilty for my husband as well. His is the best I have smelled for a mans fragrance. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Everyone who smells it on me loves it, great.</li>
            <li> The smell is young, funny, especial for use at any hour of the day. I recommend it for everyone who want&#x27;s to feel happy and confident.</li>
