            <li>Great bold colors.</li>
            <li>so I would have more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t put a top coat on, it chips within a day.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I will buy more for gifts</li>
            <li>nice color, goes on evenly and smooth.</li>
            <li>Must use a top coat.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more of these 6 packs of polish.</li>
            <li>I wanted most.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I do like them, glad I bought.&lt;br /&gt;Update Aug 24th...</li>
            <li>She seems pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>Nail polishes were a gift and the colors were great for as much as the nail colors change for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Also the one favorite color out of all six</li>
            <li>Quickly shipped and beautiful vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I received my order &amp; tried the polish, I loved it so much</li>
            <li>These colors are gorgeous and very metallic.</li>
            <li>I was using a bottom coat and they still manage to stained it, but as I said really good colors, it looks gorgeous when they dry up and are exposed to sunlight</li>
            <li>Like the colors and putting it on was easy.</li>
            <li>My favorite polish dries quick</li>
            <li>thick-could barely smooth it on</li>
            <li>It did not spread across my nail bed smoothly.</li>
            <li>Super strong</li>
            <li>cute colors... very fast shipping</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty metallic and cute.</li>
            <li>They are pretty small, but they were perfect for my project and they come in so many fun colors!</li>
            <li>They were new, so I assume it had to be some kind of manufacturer problem.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on Konad special polish</li>
            <li>This polish was surprisingly true color ,they are electric but not qawdy...</li>
            <li>and that was awesome, the nail polish is pretty thick but oddly enough has actually a pleasant sent to it.</li>
            <li>Colors were on point; very pretty.</li>
            <li>The bottles are nice and small so it&#x27;s easy for her to handle; the price can&#x27;t be beat; comes off easily with nail polish remover; and the wear lasts about 4-6 days.</li>
            <li>extremely chip resistant my nails looked fresh polished for days!!!!</li>
            <li>; I think it&#x27;s worth the $4.</li>
            <li>They go on thick, in a good way, and stay on well even without top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, she loves all the fun colors.</li>
            <li>I tried to mask the scent by putting a clear top coat over it...</li>
            <li>My daughter loved them so much I placed a second order for another set, Thanks!</li>
            <li>The colors were pretty and shimmery and shiny...but also VERY VERY STINKY!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t chip right away for me with two coats..</li>
            <li>Smells good (oddly) and the colors are so pretty!</li>
            <li>the colors are very cute and bright, the only problem I have is that the bottles are quite small.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pretty and goes on very well.</li>
            <li>My first purchase of this type of metallic polish was the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I just had to have more, so I came back &amp; ordered the Klean Color \\&quot;Retro City\\&quot; Metallic Nail Lacquer Mini Collection</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad this was the 2nd set I ordered, so I knew what they should be like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will definitely order another set of this polish, as I love all the colors that were in this collection....</li>
            <li>:) Would definitely buy these colors again!</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>Got here fast!</li>
            <li>Pretty.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>She has been consistently wearing these polishes</li>
            <li>I will probably order more from this company in the future</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, small bottles, doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth and chips fairly easily.</li>
            <li>I did not pay attention to size of them, had no idea little MINI bottles (my fault did not read) but was happy to see smaller for my daughter to use.</li>
            <li>the paint was very sticky &amp; tacky like.</li>
            <li>and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Seller was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush..</li>
            <li>Very glittery.</li>
            <li>I had too much coffee and was shaking.</li>
            <li>Fast Forward</li>
            <li>I personally buy the gift sets so I can test colors before I buy a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>their nice and small for her to handle too.</li>
            <li>These are highly pigmented, and may stain your stamper, but look lovely over black.</li>
            <li>B004NYWR7S KLEANCOLOR Techno High - Metallic Nail Lacquer Mini Collection (NPC592)]].&lt;br</li>
            <li>But overall it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>The polish went on quick and pretty thick for a first coat.</li>
            <li>I am a nail professional and would highly recommend these colors for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered these I expected full size bottles</li>
            <li>The Polish seemed old.</li>
            <li>I may end up giving them to my young neice.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my 10 year old niece</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not too surprised.</li>
            <li>I did my nails as i normally do and this polish started chipping the very same day!</li>
            <li>Very vibrant colors - last a long time.</li>
            <li>I ordered  this for a young cousin who is such a diva in the making.</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous and really shiny but they have this lingering smell after you apply it,  it takes around 2 hours for the smell to go away, they dry up quickly, but they only last around one day before they start chipping off ( more like peeling off) and sadly they also leave your nail stained :(</li>
            <li>Only complaint is chips easy.</li>
            <li>My daughter picked green for me to try first</li>
            <li>super hard to get off nails.  </li>

            <li> My daughter picked green for me to try first</li>
            <li> super hard to get off nails.  </li>
            <li> flat and long..made putting the polish on faster.  </li>
            <li> At first I was irritated by the fact that they are small bottles, but then I put it on and it blew my mind!</li>
            <li> My niece has mentioned that she notices they start to chip about at 4 day mark, but this is a very active 10 year old</li>
            <li> The nail polish doesn&#x27;t dry, it stays tacky</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the polish in the 2nd set I received was too thick &amp; would goop up when being applied &amp; not dry.</li>
            <li> Great for base color, or stamping !</li>
            <li> Small size bottles are prefect either as a gift, or for personal use.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because the colors are i love.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it, the green nail polish dyed mine and my little sisters nails yellow, and  guess what my prom is in two weeks, and I don&#x27;t know how to get it off.</li>
            <li> I purchased these polishes to use for stamping over dark colors.</li>
            <li> it slightly helped.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, the bottles are not a full sized polish.</li>
            <li> green and sapphire</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the colors i absolutely love, but unfortunately the quality is horrible!</li>
            <li> these stain pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed because they claim it to be chip-resistant, but they seem to chip MUCH faster than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift, the colors are indeed fantastic however the polish did stain their nails so a base coat is required underneath to avoided seriously discolored nails (green).</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with nail polish staying on and this polish stayed on forms few days without chipping.</li>
            <li> They are small</li>
            <li> They are small bottles</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgous goes on thick .</li>
            <li> it is thick like someone used it before they packaged it.</li>
            <li> They are small, but I knew that buying them!</li>
            <li> Sorry its a bit messy..</li>
            <li> After using the green, my nails underneath looked terrible and yellow.</li>
            <li> But the product is poor quality.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already badly chipped and the nails that were painted green are now a green-ish/yellow-ish color UNDER the nail polish.</li>
            <li> A waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> Oh..and the box was a bit dirty on arrival..</li>

            <li> The Polish seemed old. It did not spread across my nail bed smoothly. I would pull out the brush &amp; the paint was very sticky &amp; tacky like. Passing this along to my nieces.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves them</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, the bottles are not a full sized polish. At first I was irritated by the fact that they are small bottles, but then I put it on and it blew my mind! One coat and it was a gorgeous, shiny polish. I love it! Super strong and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this type of metallic polish was the [[ASIN:B004NYWR7S KLEANCOLOR Techno High - Metallic Nail Lacquer Mini Collection (NPC592)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received my order &amp; tried the polish, I loved it so much I just had to have more, so I came back &amp; ordered the Klean Color \\&quot;Retro City\\&quot; Metallic Nail Lacquer Mini Collection so I would have more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the polish in the 2nd set I received was too thick &amp; would goop up when being applied &amp; not dry. I tried using a polish thinner, but that didn&#x27;t work too well with this polish, so I just ended up throwing them out. They were new, so I assume it had to be some kind of manufacturer problem.  I&#x27;m just glad this was the 2nd set I ordered, so I knew what they should be like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order another set of this polish, as I love all the colors that were in this collection....PLUS, this polish is Awesome &amp; looks Beautiful!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving this polish a 5 star rating, as I think the set I received was just a fluke &amp; the colors in this set are great!!</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous and really shiny but they have this lingering smell after you apply it,  it takes around 2 hours for the smell to go away, they dry up quickly, but they only last around one day before they start chipping off ( more like peeling off) and sadly they also leave your nail stained :( I was using a bottom coat and they still manage to stained it, but as I said really good colors, it looks gorgeous when they dry up and are exposed to sunlight; I think it&#x27;s worth the $4.</li>
            <li> Smells good (oddly) and the colors are so pretty! However, if you don&#x27;t put a top coat on, it chips within a day.</li>
            <li> some I tried was sticky but, the colors were beautiful.....</li>
            <li> super hard to get off nails.  have to soak them just to loosen the polish</li>
            <li> Seller was fast. But the product is poor quality. The nail polish doesn&#x27;t dry, it stays tacky</li>
            <li> This polish was surprisingly true color ,they are electric but not qawdy...extremely chip resistant my nails looked fresh polished for days!!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgous goes on thick . I&#x27;ve gotten I lot of complments on it . Love it I will buy more for gifts</li>
            <li> Great for base color, or stamping !</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, small bottles, doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth and chips fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! Small size bottles are prefect either as a gift, or for personal use. I personally buy the gift sets so I can test colors before I buy a full size bottle. These colors are gorgeous and very metallic. Also...I can use these for nail polish stamping so I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on Konad special polish</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors!!!</li>
            <li> Great polish colors. They are small, but I knew that buying them! :) Would definitely buy these colors again! Awesome!</li>
            <li> Good quality cute colors</li>
            <li> nice color, goes on evenly and smooth. Only complaint is chips easy. Must use a top coat. Re command it. Pretty color.</li>
            <li> When I ordered these I expected full size bottles but they are all MINI bottles! The colors are pretty metallic and cute. They go on thick, in a good way, and stay on well even without top coat.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a mix of Metallics and don&#x27;t need a lot this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use to put a couple in each of my girlfriends manicure Christmas presents.  They are pretty small, but they were perfect for my project and they come in so many fun colors!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter I did not pay attention to size of them, had no idea little MINI bottles (my fault did not read) but was happy to see smaller for my daughter to use.</li>
            <li> Product arrived about 4 days after I ordered them and that was awesome, the nail polish is pretty thick but oddly enough has actually a pleasant sent to it. Will be ordering more of these 6 packs of polish.</li>
            <li> cute colors... very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great colors and value for money</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my 14 yo niece!</li>
            <li> My favorite polish dries quick and I&#x27;d good for nail art stamping.</li>
            <li> the colors are very cute and bright, the only problem I have is that the bottles are quite small. I may end up giving them to my young neice.</li>
            <li> Great colors love klean color polish</li>
            <li> Colors were on point; very pretty. I ordered  this for a young cousin who is such a diva in the making. She was happy so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great colors and easy to use.  My daughter loves them.  She is collecting a bunch of colors and enjoys the sparkles</li>
            <li> Got here fast! They are small yes..like someone else said in another review somewhere the bottle part is about the size of a quarter. I like the colors...green and sapphire I wanted most. I really like the brush..flat and long..made putting the polish on faster.  The polish went on quick and pretty thick for a first coat. Very glittery. Pretty. I do not know about the staining yet since I just received today...i read the reviews that it stains...we shall see. Still bought, cant beat the price. Adding photos of the colors..but just to show the colors and its only one coat. Sorry its a bit messy..I had too much coffee and was shaking. lol Oh..and the box was a bit dirty on arrival..doesn&#x27;t matter to me,  just saying. :)  I do like them, glad I bought.&lt;br /&gt;Update Aug 24th...these stain pretty bad. After using the green, my nails underneath looked terrible and yellow. Took a star off for that reason. Like the colors and putting it on was easy. It didn&#x27;t chip right away for me with two coats..if only it didn&#x27;t stain. I can&#x27;t recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent to mine...at all.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it, the green nail polish dyed mine and my little sisters nails yellow, and  guess what my prom is in two weeks, and I don&#x27;t know how to get it off.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my niece, she loves all the fun colors. She seems pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased these polishes to use for stamping over dark colors. I am a nail professional and would highly recommend these colors for that purpose.  I&#x27;ve not used them as regular polish, so I can&#x27;t offer any advice or review for that.  These are highly pigmented, and may stain your stamper, but look lovely over black.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped and beautiful vibrant colors. My daughter loved them so much I placed a second order for another set, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nail polishes were a gift and the colors were great for as much as the nail colors change for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Very cute nail polish! the colors are very pretty and goes on very well. my daughter loves them. their nice and small for her to handle too.</li>
            <li> a nail polish has been used.  it is thick like someone used it before they packaged it.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift, the colors are indeed fantastic however the polish did stain their nails so a base coat is required underneath to avoided seriously discolored nails (green).</li>
            <li> I like the colors and they arrived on time. I am slightly disappointed because they claim it to be chip-resistant, but they seem to chip MUCH faster than other brands I&#x27;ve used. But overall it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for the mason jar pedicure favors I hade made up for my bridal shower.  All the girls loved them!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my 10 year old niece and she absolutely loves it! She has been consistently wearing these polishes and I&#x27;ve noticed that the color payoff is wonderful. The bottles are nice and small so it&#x27;s easy for her to handle; the price can&#x27;t be beat; comes off easily with nail polish remover; and the wear lasts about 4-6 days. My niece has mentioned that she notices they start to chip about at 4 day mark, but this is a very active 10 year old so I&#x27;m not too surprised. Awesome buy, high recommended!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but my only problem is that the clear box the polish comes in was really dirty and it felt like there was dirt all over the package.</li>
            <li> I recently got these off of Zulily for $7. They are small bottles but I didn&#x27;t mind because there were plenty of colors. My daughter picked green for me to try first and I picked the purple to try as well. The colors were pretty and shimmery and shiny...but also VERY VERY STINKY! I tried to mask the scent by putting a clear top coat over it...it slightly helped.  Fast Forward 18 Hours and it&#x27;s already badly chipped and the nails that were painted green are now a green-ish/yellow-ish color UNDER the nail polish. I love yellow-green stained nails! (Sarcasm)  A waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> Great bold colors. I have a hard time with nail polish staying on and this polish stayed on forms few days without chipping. I will probably order more from this company in the future</li>
            <li> My niece is going to love this on Christmas!  I love the colors!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the colors i absolutely love, but unfortunately the quality is horrible! I did my nails as i normally do and this polish started chipping the very same day! I was so disappointed because the colors are i love. Also the one favorite color out of all six it was gooey and cant be used.</li>
