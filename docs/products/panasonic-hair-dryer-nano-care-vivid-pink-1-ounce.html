            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried my friend&#x27;s T3, and I found it to be slow drying and too hot.</li>
            <li> 10mins to dry my long hair !</li>
            <li> Even though the price is expensive but I really recommend this product to others !</li>
            <li> Especially my long hair !!</li>
            <li> I also like the alternating hot &amp; cold function.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hot and cold rotating feature keeps you from sweating when you get your hair dried.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> So far there is nothing wrong with it!</li>
            <li> I just want to know why I bought it just once it is broken, and a lot of smoke coming out, this is a gift to a friend of China, and now it is broken, how to solve please reply or send an e-mail as soon as possible give me.</li>
            <li> After used my friend&#x27;s Panasonic Nano hair dryer, I knew I was wrong.</li>

            <li> It is very nice ! Motor sounds are not cheep dryer at all. It is very powerful. Especially my long hair !!&lt;br /&gt; I am so satisfied with this item.&lt;br /&gt;But only I don&#x27;t think I need that it call Skin (make moisture to your face ) dial. I don&#x27;t think it working noticed in the US, because Japan are more humidity country but not in the US.</li>
            <li> Before I ever used this product I thought all hair dryers are the same because they simply just blow air. After used my friend&#x27;s Panasonic Nano hair dryer, I knew I was wrong. This is so much better than the cheap dryer I bought at supermarket. My hair wasn&#x27;t at all frizzy with this new hair dryer. I&#x27;m in love with this product</li>
            <li> Very good for the hair and face.</li>

I also like the alternating hot &amp; cold function.&lt;br /&gt;There was a strong smell when I first turned on my dryer, but it went away after airing it out. The lingering smell is probably the ion that it releases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this dryer because it dries my hair in not time, and it leaves my hair shiny, not frizzy. The handle folds, so it makes it easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;It is powerful, and relatively quiet compared to how powerful it it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried my friend&#x27;s T3, and I found it to be slow drying and too hot.</li>

            <li> The vivid pink color is pretty nice,  and it&#x27;s also a fast dryer. My hair without any damage of dyeing and perm, so I didn&#x27;t find some obvious changes after using it.
