            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>i LOVE this thing!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I think it was a great value and also has free shipping.</li>
            <li>Great quality tool, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap while using it.</li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>Its truly amazing and all yout blackheads will be erased.</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t know how to use it -- or if it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice version of what she got but way cheaper.</li>
            <li>It works effectively, effectively with blackheads on the nose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience using this kind of tool</li>
            <li>Now, I have found that this tool is quite effective at removing troubling blemishes.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>so let me be honest.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I would recommend using your fingers, The metal feels like its jamming through your skin.</li>
            <li>The result is, if the zit is ready to pop, this will work great!  </li>
            <li>For the price, this product is good and will handle most blackheads, though not all.</li>
            <li>it comes in a handy plastic sleave</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great price!!!</li>
            <li>To be completely honest I think I&#x27;ve got 1 whitehead with this tool.</li>
            <li>Everyone needs to have this tool handy.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I would probably need to warm it up</li>
            <li>anyone who has used it can offer suggestions on how to use it effectively I would appreciate it - otherwise</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if it had come with instructions</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it and seems almost indestructible.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it came with instructions</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this at a really good price from this seller here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift, she liked it I guess.</li>
            <li>Has a nice no-slip grip.  </li>
            <li>The seller kindly refunded my money no questions asked.</li>
            <li>Works excellent and is very durable.</li>
            <li>I will be honest and say that I&#x27;ve never used a product like this.  </li>
            <li>That could be because of my lack of experience with this kind of tool, though.</li>
            <li>it is nice.</li>
            <li>It is made out of stainless steel and works great!</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the quality of this tool, being that it is stainless steel and looks to be well designed.</li>
            <li>on product&#x27;s part, the product is nice and do what it is meant to do...</li>
            <li>I think the trick is to soften the skin with a towel soaked in warm water.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy-duty tool</li>
            <li>Professional feel, great quality, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Like many people hope for are some sort of instructions on how to use it, and which side to use for what kind of pimples/blackheads.</li>
            <li>probably I need to warm up my face even more.</li>
            <li>Faster and more effective.</li>
            <li>This product is super amazing!</li>
            <li>i STRONGLY recommend this product !</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good  product but still you have to work to get your pores clean</li>
            <li>works best after working out or warm shower when pores are open.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and the quality is very sturdy!</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy, and the loops are very secure.</li>
            <li>good product, quick delivery, fits in my mail box.  </li>
            <li>and now i Have to wait to get a response from seller so i can return this and receive what i asked for, so i will not rate the product until im actually able to use what i ordered, but it is a nice weight and seems easy to use</li>
            <li>Works great and is super cheap.</li>
            <li>The loops, while metal, are kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>I always feel like I am doing more damage to my skin with all the tugging.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so satisfied. :)</li>
            <li>I wish it had more of a curve on it for easier blackhead extraction but even with that said I still give it 5 stars, what it lacks in ease it more than makes up for in quality.  </li>
            <li>So much more hygienic than using your fingers and with no pain.</li>
            <li>so I cannot say for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I hope this would be more hygienic than finger tips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have found the more unruly your blemish is the better the tool works.</li>
            <li>I think with practice it will be better, just have to figure it out more.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>works, ok, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Saved me from going to my dermatologist and it works better than those pore strips.</li>
            <li>but I think I have it figured out for the most part</li>
            <li>Was shipped fast works great</li>
            <li>You get better results that way.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>But my creative son started putting the loop around and sort of pressing/pulling.  </li>
            <li>Push gently many times and change position.</li>
            <li>This works  so much better than using your fingers to pop them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s allowed me to get some of the ones I&#x27;ve never been able to before.</li>
            <li>I bet it works on some people, but haven&#x27;t been able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried on many.</li>
            <li>However, I still have not been able to make it work when I need to.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>great price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Hurts more than I thought it would but it works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I purchased from Utopia Care and received it in 2 days with free shipping!)</li>
            <li>Great and fast delivery</li>
            <li>This tool is okay</li>
            <li>He is one satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>JK.  :-)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work</li>
            <li>My nose has never looked better after using this product.</li>
            <li>eyehole&amp;#34; design that worked better.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly...worth the price, got most of my blackheads and whiteheads out.</li>
            <li>Wish it came with some instructions though as I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to use it..</li>
            <li>Instead of using your fingers to pop a pimple, these extractors safely remove them and keep bacteria from spreading, something that happens when you use your fingers to pop a pimple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Very durable build and great size for traveling.</li>
            <li>It hurts more than it works..</li>
            <li>I have yet to farm my boyfriend&#x27;s back, but I&#x27;m sure it will be perfect for the job!</li>
            <li>My skin eruptions are no longer like a teenagers, and I just would not be able to benefit from the device.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that many blackhead or pimples.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Great quality, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>You will love this to get rid off your blackhead.</li>
            <li>Great quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Over all good product and worth the money if you needsomething life this</li>
            <li>I can get tons more just by doing it wit my fingers.</li>

            <li>of the better blackhead removers ive</li>
            <li>Item was ok.  </li>
            <li>Each of us have one and love.</li>
            <li>Would be more helpful if it came with instructions?!?&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipment.</li>
            <li>However make sure</li>
            <li>Great price fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>so I use this tool almost every day and have slain many pimples already.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it will help you to maintain it better.</li>
            <li>This is an okay product.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting it to work a lot better.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>Nay have worked better with a steamer.</li>
            <li>barely okay</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because my husband, who has a greater tolerance for pain, sat still while I pressed this way and</li>
            <li>I love this blemish remover</li>
            <li>Simply the best one out there..recommend!</li>
            <li>defiantly better than by hand.</li>
            <li>its a very useful tool and comes in handy when needed.</li>
            <li>The flat side works best on my blackheads.</li>
            <li>This is not your best option for big pimples, but it&#x27;s great for those tiny a-hole pimples and blackheads for sure!</li>
            <li>Working great without any permanent marks or the pain that would normally come from using fingernails.</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I use the short end all the time to remove blackheads, and it&#x27;s generally successful!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok to use, does not make it as easy as I thought,</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and keeps from getting even more bacteria on your face, which you can get when using your fingernails.</li>
            <li>The tool was easy to use and alleviated the redness once you extract the pimple.</li>
            <li>my skin more easily and leaves some debris in my pores.</li>
            <li>It is better than using fingers or a bobby pin since the blackhead remover does not break the skin as easily.</li>
            <li>It was good quality and would be good for big blackheads.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product and good seller.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use  and clean.</li>
            <li>The best way to use this tool is to wash your face with warm water first to open up your pores.</li>
            <li>so i ordered it through Amazon, it came right when they said it will, and so far i have loved it!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this one for home facials/extraction!&lt;br /&gt;Probably best if you gently clean &amp; steam your face before using this tool.</li>
            <li>the product i recieved was made with  high quality stainless steel works great !</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it twice, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m quite happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Its much more precise and hygienic.</li>
            <li>wish I could find the one I had as it seemed to roll more smoothly over my skin and dramatically removed pore grime.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as it is stainless steel and works great without pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, effective, fast and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find this particularly useful or effective.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good communication.</li>
            <li>It is nice, useful and looking just like on web picture.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great and super fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, and feels comfortable in your grip.</li>
            <li>Oh and the flat side takes off blackheads very good as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>I removed another star because I ordered TWO, one came in perfect condition, the other one had an end that wiggled.</li>
            <li>and then just use the loop side and press against your face and it comes out super easy!</li>
            <li>Easy to use also.</li>
            <li>Suprisingly, once I picked up this thingy, things became sort of easy --- just pushing one end against your blackhead area.</li>
            <li>Helps me clean my pores thoroughly, more than what I could ever do with my fingers.</li>
            <li>This is easy to hold onto even with lotion on your hands.</li>
            <li>pleased overall, great price too.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>I will say there isn&#x27;t any instructions, but you can easily find out how to use the tool/tools on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Makes getting ingrown hairs and popping pimples easy.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, just add a bit of water to make paste.  </li>
            <li>With this product you easily just poke your pimple with a needle( all it takes is one poke</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li>It does not come with directions but those were easily found on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Tool is durable and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>These line of products are rare to find in your local pharmacy, but once you find them you will be very happy to use them.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to peel some skin off when extracting.</li>
            <li>two ends were strong and not flimsy like the rest out there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to open your pores with warm water before you try to use it.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t take a long time (as it used to do) to get it out , then i cleaned the area with sterile, very good tool.</li>
            <li>I like to lance the pimples first, but do that at your own discretion..</li>
            <li>First product of this kind that I have tried</li>
            <li>I was very excited when this arrived and used it right away!</li>
            <li>but it is really fun to watch how easily this gets rid of zits!</li>
            <li>The shipping was also pretty quick, which was surprising since they offer it for free.</li>
            <li>Best product on the market to remove those unwanted black heads.</li>
            <li>Fine well made product.</li>
            <li>The grooved handle makes it easy and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Just as described and quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Super at lifting oil, better yet it is all-natural, too.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Also, the zit has to be ready to come so that could have been one of the reasons that it didn&#x27;t get as many as I would&#x27;ve wished!</li>
            <li>It works, easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Be sure to use alcohol to clean the extractor so it stays clean.</li>
            <li>Simple tool that works great.</li>
            <li>It is very durable and sturdy and comes in its own slip-in closable  carrier (convenient for travel).</li>
            <li>Cheap, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>It appears to be made sturdily and does not appear cheap.</li>
            <li>it does what it should and is easy to keep clean with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Works great, especially around my nostrils.</li>
            <li>and it was available to ship to my location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to be a high-quality product for the price, but I haven&#x27;t personally had a lot of great results.  </li>
            <li>Works great for blackheads especially around the nose area.</li>
            <li>Worth the price :)</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as the one the dermatologist uses.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to remove your blackheads if used properly.</li>
            <li>It has a good feel in the hand as far as control goes.  </li>
            <li>This little tool has been amazing, doesn&#x27;t leave marks and is very effective.</li>
            <li>though so not quite sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li>Makes it super easy</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great value for the money and quick shipping, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean and it really works</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was after for cheap!</li>
            <li>Either way it was worth the money!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to, love it.</li>
            <li>user friendly, totally worth every penny plus some!</li>
            <li>, this one is small and fits into my lil make up pouch perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is also my first tool and probably I can learn more in using this -</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase !</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>However, the white head loop is super super great.</li>
            <li>keep it clean with alcohol between use.</li>
            <li>Prompt and clean.</li>
            <li>A clean plastic case is included.</li>
            <li>Definitely positive feedback :)</li>
            <li>I did remove most of my blackheads with pure tea-tree oil and this hemmed with the rest</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so I don&#x27;t know if there is a special way to work it.</li>
            <li>but this tool took it right out!  </li>
            <li>We received the remover and went to work right away!</li>
            <li>excellent tool for getting at those hard to extract nuisances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Great quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Better than expected.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at first, but I kept trying it different ways.</li>
            <li>I have many small blackheads on my nose and this product worked great for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more luck with getting rid of whiteheads than with blackheads, but I haven&#x27;t had myself a \\&quot;spa\\&quot; day to really try it out.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>facial use was good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool, nifty tool.</li>
            <li>I have a face with full of blackhead, and this one help me a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful and doesn&#x27;t leave marks.</li>
            <li>only good thing.....</li>
            <li>Good to use after shower when pores are open.</li>
            <li>A gentle tool that is a favorite for extraction.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I am enjoying the use of my comodone extractor.</li>
            <li>Good product overall!</li>
            <li>I got it and im doing minor extractions by myself at the house, always staming the area very well before using it, better than using your own fingers :)</li>
            <li>this is a fine tool if your blackheads are very very large.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping and the actual tool is really good quality.</li>
            <li>Applying a mask before extraction is also a good way to loosen up the plugs even more with less pressure.</li>
            <li>The remover is pretty strong to work.</li>
            <li>It has a rounded side and a flat side, with good grip.</li>
            <li>It also arrived fairly quick</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and seems well-made.</li>
            <li>It does the job quickly and without any pain.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t just magically pop out of the skin, and a decent amount of pressure and some pain is still required.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It definitely was not the most comfortable experience for me to bust those blackheads!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend Blemish Remover.</li>
            <li>I was simply looking for best price with most favorable reviews and am suprised at how well this little thing works.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped this very fast as well!</li>
            <li>Overall a nice tool to have when dealing with problem skin and keeps the area clean and sanitized without hurting the area</li>
            <li>advice, use hot to warm water on your face to open up the pores to easy extraction.</li>
            <li>I  really enjoyed my new thing.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Received fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Steam your face before using it so that it will easily remove all the dirt in your face without too much pain.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not frustrating because the pimple come out so easily.</li>
            <li>Steam your face before using it so that it will easily remove all the dirt in your face without too much pain.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my adolescent brother and his face looks very clear now with most blackheads gone.</li>
            <li>but this  tool is very strong and well made and the loops on both sides are polished so there are no sharp edges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Great little tool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a little more effective around my sternum.</li>
            <li>It works great, was shipped quickly, carefully wrapped, and is certainly priced right ($4.99 shipping included).  </li>
            <li>Really hurts if you use it on your nose, but is fantastic for hard-to-reach spots and clearing out pores.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t useful at all.  </li>
            <li>If you have a zit that doesn&#x27;t have a clear Whitehead or blackhead, then this won&#x27;t work and you&#x27;ll hurt yourself more than anything.</li>
            <li>If you remember back to your teens when you were told not to squeeze zits and blackheads, this tool could have been a handy solution.</li>
            <li>A tool like this would have come in handy back then.</li>
            <li>Works well on freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li>It just gives me horseshoe shaped marks on my face that people laugh at.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected but works great!</li>
            <li>Usually I only wash my face with warm water</li>
            <li>will return...not useful, does not work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I expected good product for the price</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Even though this product worked well, it broke quickly even with gentle use!</li>
            <li>This specific brand was highly rated and also fairly priced, so I decided to buy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was sent right away.</li>
            <li>And I did it quite right.</li>
            <li>so you can always find it and shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li>I tried using this right after a shower, since that steams your face and makes it easier to extract anything within your pores.</li>
            <li>The day i got it , i have to try it right away</li>
            <li>if you use it in the right way, it won&#x27;t hurt you.</li>
            <li>But does the job, if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li>Your zit/blackhead has to be in the right &amp;#34;state&amp;#34; in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>Having the right tool makes any effort easier, and this is one of those things you don&#x27;t think of needing until you need it.  </li>
            <li>I steam my face, get all up in there and ready to clean some pores -- put the wand thing over a clogged pore -- push -- and</li>
            <li>if you use it after a  hot bath, when the face is well moist and the pores are open, works nicely</li>
            <li>Fast and clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use but needs more pressure then expected.</li>
            <li>Apparently these are used at dermatologists offices quite often to safely remove whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I need to find a better way to store it to keep it clean between uses, but it looks like I&#x27;ll keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>works good push down and blackheads come out.</li>
            <li>Good grip, but the ends are very sharp.</li>
            <li>it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>One really nice things about this tool is that it doesn&#x27;t really leave a lasting mark on your face if you apply some sort of mask after you disinfect your areas</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve actually had more success using witch hazel</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>much better than any other cheap one bought from a store</li>
            <li>Not so good at getting the little gunk out of pores or &#x27;comedomes&#x27; though.</li>
            <li>I love it and wild highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used blackhead strips and after washing my face to open my pores this tool works pretty well possibly better than strips and is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE, ESPECIALLY FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I want</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended for any1 who needs this !!</li>
            <li>Item and delivery were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and it works.</li>
            <li>My first order didn&#x27;t come in so another</li>
            <li>It dose the job very well!</li>
            <li>As an avid DIYer, I did it myself with the Utopia product.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first but after using it the first time it was a lot easier to remove &amp; extract blemishes than using my fingernails.</li>
            <li>be sure to only use it if you know you can pop it.</li>
            <li>The tool is of good material , it was challenge to use it at first , but a few YouTube videos on how</li>
            <li>I tried it maybe 5 or 6 times, even after a hot</li>
            <li>ExActly what I wanted...and what I needed for school...</li>
            <li>Works better if the skin was recently warmed and softened under a hot towel.</li>
            <li>It also helps if the area has had a hot rag over it to loosen it up.</li>
            <li>You should attach something hot to blackhead area before to take out blackhead.</li>
            <li>It will most likely fulfill your needs.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>It does help to steam your face in the shower first.</li>
            <li>Thought it was kinda funny</li>
            <li>Steam your face first...</li>
            <li>This product seems to work pretty well as advertised.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t be too sure about since this does takes learning a method to work properly.</li>
            <li>love it and very addictive..</li>
            <li>Very unsatissfied!</li>
            <li>My nose was nearly blackhead FREE and NOT RED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Soaked face first in hot water than did my face.</li>
            <li>I have seen better results online with similar products.</li>
            <li>Needle first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>It does the job pretty well, this is the first one ive ever used tho</li>
            <li>I find out that if you put on a hot towel or if you steam your face first then it will be easier.</li>
            <li>First week had some redness but also removed the most.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought the blackhead extractor because I had been watching first impressions of thwm on youtube</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars, because it was consistent with the description.  </li>
            <li>I recommend using it after a hot shower to loosen up pores.</li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>you know how to use it first before purchasing,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to sanitize the tool with hot water or rubbing alcohol after every use.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any more zits coming back!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for..</li>
            <li>Good quality not cheaply made</li>
            <li>It certainly arrived quickly, was reasonably priced, &amp; was well protected by its packaging.  </li>
            <li>The item is in good quality, comes with a small porch, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I know there is a certain way to use this tool, but I am trying to be safe and not damage my skin, so I can&#x27;t really say that it really removes blackheads completely.</li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right, but even so, I don&#x27;t like a product that requires so much research to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li>Good grip / Stiff tips</li>
            <li>Having the dual ends is beneficial, although I mostly use the rounded tip instead of the flat one.</li>
            <li>The flatter end is kind of sharp and scrapped my skin.</li>
            <li>Always wash your face with warm water and soap, if not any other face cleaning product before using it.</li>
            <li>As expected,  fast shipping,  thanks !!!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my face like when I use my fingers to remove acne, and its super easy to clean with a little alcohol and a napkin.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to use to pop all the white heads when they showed up.</li>
            <li>It fills my heart with just enough joy to not really care.</li>
            <li>that well, it does leave a pretty large indent in my face.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Shipped really fast- exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>At that point the dead skin is gone and your pores are more accessible.</li>
            <li>Easily extracts blackheads and whiteheads, which ultimately shortens the amount of time they stay on your face.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin so this tool works much better immediately after a shower.</li>
            <li>Solid product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as squeezing with your fingers or fingernails, but leaves less of a mark.</li>
            <li>This tool does remove blackheads, but as a word of caution you should consult YouTube for videos on how to use the tool properly, otherwise it is easy to leave a scar.</li>
            <li>strong and durable to fight deep acne too</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a certain technique to it</li>
            <li>Price was an important factor, since I don&#x27;t want to wind up spending more than I have to on something that may or may not last long</li>
            <li>invest in a better product doesn&#x27;t leave scarring but is better for big pores with black and whiteheads.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly amazing little gadget.</li>
            <li>Just an amazingly effective little gadget.</li>
            <li>works great, it pops the tough pimpled under the skin.</li>
            <li>If I could go back, I&#x27;d spend a little more money and get something that is of a better quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>It is made very well</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, and well made.</li>
            <li>really work  </li>
            <li>This item was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times already and it has really helped me with some of my blemishes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfy with my purches thank you for your help</li>
            <li>You will notice if the pimple isn&#x27;t quite ready to pop, this device will leave a temporary mark on your face.</li>
            <li>bought the pimple extractor to remove blackhead and the product works really well.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed with this.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>But the listing of Stainless Steel is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is going to sound gross.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very promptly and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Very we&#x27;ll made.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t hold out much faith that this stubborn blackhead would be removed, but it was.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really worked for me</li>
            <li>If one has learned all ready how to use one of these, it will probably work.</li>
            <li>product works really well.  </li>
            <li>The dual sides are really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well in removing pimples and blackheads with out too much pain or strain.</li>
            <li>This is made of stainless steel, so it&#x27;s sturdy and seems durable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast...</li>
            <li>really like how &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; this tool is.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to really extract</li>
            <li>It works just as well as it states just have to gently use it</li>
            <li>So I really recommend this product if any of you have a problem with popping pimples.</li>
            <li>Really recommend using it after shower.</li>
            <li>Does its job very well if you are using it correctly.</li>
            <li>Cleans pores very well</li>
            <li>However, I still have whiteheads from time to time; I don&#x27;t really have blackheads</li>
            <li>For the money this is very well made.</li>
            <li>I believe it is surgical grade stainless steel.</li>
            <li>tool seems very goodd quality and very resistant assembly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary,it is a very goood purchase for the money.</li>
            <li>Always be gentle with your face.</li>
            <li>Be gentle but efficient.</li>
            <li>This product if used properly is gentle and works.</li>
            <li>Works well and got here fast.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>HaHa</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>Very durable and built well.  </li>
            <li>It really works to remove blackheads without causing bruising.</li>
            <li>fast ship.</li>
            <li>Received it very quickly...works well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Not as effective on smaller whiteheads, but does work on larger ones.</li>
            <li>Just using the flat end as scraper works fine, you don&#x27;t have put the zit or whatever in the loop to pop it.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin, and wanted something to remove blackhead because when I do it on my own</li>
            <li>I would have never expected that to happen so quickly, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but so far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s an alright product, gets an OK amount of blackheads and pimples out, but use it carefully!</li>
            <li>There are other brands of comedone/blackhead extractors that work much better.</li>
            <li>This post is for those that are not dumb in life.</li>
            <li>As i&#x27;ve used similar product in the past I knew that this type of product would be great and it has been.  </li>
            <li>Do yourselves a favor and YouTube or ask a person like a dermatologist or person who does facials to learn how to exactly clean your face, open your pores, then use the remover.</li>
            <li>so be careful and keep clean!</li>
            <li>I had tried a nice one that worked great, but was a little expensive at $15.</li>
            <li>The tool does take a good amount of pressure but it is less likely to break skin than if you were to use your hands.</li>
            <li>I recommend leaving a small warm towel on the face to loosen up the pores/skin before extracting.</li>
            <li>and I recommend anyone who uses it for the first time to read up on how the professional aestheticians use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The very stubborn, deep blackheads will require steaming to open the pores and to make the skin a bit softer for it to work its magic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little longer than I thought (about an inch short of pen length), but it&#x27;s still good for the job.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is that I wish the other side was more useful.</li>
            <li>but you can definitly get out most of your nose black heads.</li>
            <li>Easily lifts out the acne from the pores with minimal pain and scarring.</li>
            <li>Overall, the products is good but sometimes a bit harsh for my face.</li>
            <li>The remover tool arrived exactly as described and is the same blemish tool from another brand I purchased at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid product that I use often, most of the time after showers when your pores are open (I find this helps a lot).</li>
            <li>Product works decent.</li>
            <li>This product came quickly (received it in only one day after I ordered it!)</li>
            <li>My main goal when I bought this was to remove this one stubborn blackhead</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know how such a thing could remove blackheads, but first time I used it, I was so surprised!!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality tool.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>II had high hopes for this tool</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for the stubborn spots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality, like a surgical instrument.  </li>
            <li>thank you i highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this and waited months to get it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The smooth, curved edges are fairly gentle on the skin and don&#x27;t rough it up like my fingernails did, so it solves that problem!</li>
            <li>If you are shopping around for a Blackhead Remover, you might want to spend a little more for quality.</li>
            <li>this little thing is magical.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer if the tool was a little more sturdy</li>
            <li>Then I put it to use &amp; didn&#x27;t get the easy results I&#x27;ve seen it have when other&#x27;s use it.</li>
            <li>Very well-made, professional instrument.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to be useless because of all the great reviews, but</li>
            <li>If it is real stainless steel then this tool should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is better than just using your fingers, especially when you have long nails.</li>
            <li>Thought more round at the tips like at a dermatologist office tool.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is normal, but I also chemically peel my face sometimes, although, I don&#x27;t use the blackhead remover before or after my chemical peels.</li>
            <li>but this was just too big to be useful.</li>
            <li>i was starting to develop a tiny cyst like zit on my forehead and after a warm bath (to open up the pores n soften the skin)</li>
            <li>But this tool helps take the place of the normal &amp;#34;picking and squeezing&amp;#34; with your fingers or anything else you can find to extract them.</li>
            <li>The metal doesn&#x27;t bend with pressure applied in normal application.</li>
            <li>I tried it without steaming my face which is not something that I would normally do anyway.</li>
            <li>The whiteheads shifted with pressure from the sewing needle because it wasn&#x27;t sufficiently sharp and fine.</li>
            <li>I say nearly, because my previous extractor seemed to perform a tad bit better --- which is the reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of</li>
            <li>nice buy... recommended if you need to remove black or white heads...</li>
            <li>It does typically leave the area a little red obviously, so it&#x27;s ideal to use this tool at night rather than in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t live your life without one of these.</li>
            <li>I live this tool</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>This small tool is very important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much but cleanly gets the acne out.</li>
            <li>This was much nicer than I was expecting, solid stainless steel.</li>
            <li>This and the round, spoon-like tool with a whole in the bottom to fit over the blemish were the methods of choice.</li>
            <li>seriously, it would have been nice to have some type of directions with it...</li>
            <li>Very professional tool.</li>
            <li>The holes are  little bigger then expected,  but it works great</li>
            <li>but I also have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>it worked the first time my wife used it on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the one my dermatologist is using in removing my blackheads, whiteheads (facial cleaning).</li>
            <li>absolutly love it best tool to get rid of those nasty white heads and doesnt scar like my fingers</li>
            <li>This is exactly the one my dermatologist is using in removing my blackheads, whiteheads (facial cleaning).</li>
            <li>This is true for the T zone but didn&#x27;t hold true for the fatty areas of the face, like the cheeks, or for deep seated blackheads.</li>
            <li>(my nose stays red for about 24 hours after a good black head squeezing with my nails....) but not with the utopia!!!</li>
            <li>By following a certain regimen and going all natural, I have really started to clear my face up.</li>
            <li>I tried it on myself first and found it somewhat painful, even using it after showering, but works great.  </li>
            <li>This little tool seems to do its job just fine.</li>
            <li>that, mashing his skin pretty hard before I finally did get most of 2 blackheads out that had been there for a while.</li>
            <li>My son tried just pressing and had limited success.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the double loop round tool - I have used it and it is easy to use and works!</li>
            <li>Just a wire with an opening large enough to let out the blackhead.</li>
            <li>It did not work for me however, and only scarred certain areas of my face.</li>
            <li>If it has a hard top, it works sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Works great and comes with case to hold it in so it doesn&#x27;t get dirty.</li>
            <li>Helping keep my skin clear from blackheads.</li>
            <li>You can also clearly see through the slots...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my order got turned around in the mail, but because it is such a great tool I wanted to give it a review.</li>
            <li>Not as professional as I thought it&#x27;d be.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be amazed how much dirt is in your pores, for me it only works well on my nose.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The problem with the videos I watched was that a professional was recommended for the task.</li>
            <li>really professional help me with all my needs and</li>
            <li>Nearly painless.  </li>
            <li>It gets those tricky blackheads near the nose and chin as well.</li>
            <li>item was completely as pictured and described.  </li>
            <li>extracts the um....  gross  stuff  without scaring up your face as much as doing it with your fingers..  </li>
            <li>seems like it work very well for pimples and/or larger blackheads</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 15 year old son.</li>
            <li>It really does help with popping those pimples, but by no means is the ultimate solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it thus far to get whiteheads out and it seems to work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it hurts; definitely not worse then actually using your fingers to pop a pimple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this MONTHS and still use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I was always bugging my husband to let me remove his blackheads on his face and he wouldnt let me come near him because he said i hurt him.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>I bought this tool because of my 12 year old- who got blackheads in his ear.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t go all fast and expect your face to cooperate without the proper sterile and prepping.</li>
            <li>Now I just need to see if it lasts more than a few months before the wire loop, almost mysteriously, seems to just fall apart!</li>
            <li>Shipping a quite slow, so if you need it for immediate use better to buy it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li>The product itself is a good item, but useless for the purpose it is sold for.</li>
            <li>Very durable and compact and is great for small blackheads in those hard to reach areas!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s so small and easy to use</li>
            <li>Something about not having dirty greasy hands touching my face makes it worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>It makes getting black heads and visible white heads out easily.</li>
            <li>I have send it back to you..waiting for a new one!</li>
            <li>I just got the Blackhead Remover, and it works just fine for removing blackheads and small pimples.</li>
            <li>However it does a fine job for picking out small pimples.</li>
            <li>The wire end that is mainly used wiggles back and forth, making me feel unsafe using this one as it seems like it may break</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest in that I don&#x27;t find much use for the long flat end, but the short, angled end usually works for me</li>
            <li>Just a quick blackhead removal without the mess.</li>
            <li>The long flat loop side is pretty useless in my experience, but the other side of the tool works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>not strong enough and the heads bent easily.</li>
            <li>It takes too much digging to actually get the black head out when the seki edge remover pulled them out within the first try.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this product to arrive (multiple black heads)</li>
            <li>This product works for blackheads that are not deep in the skin and are fairly new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple idea, but it&#x27;s really the only type of tool that works.</li>
            <li>small loop size is good for medium thickness of the skin, a little big for skin around eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the fault of the extractor since there is no other way to get blackheads and whiteheads out.</li>
            <li>I was not able to extract any whiteheads because I could not properly lance them even though I was using a new, sharp and very fine sewing needle.</li>
            <li>easy to use and not sure how i hadnt had one in my life before!</li>
            <li>The flat end is much practical for usage as opposed to the rounder end, it&#x27;s too bulky to actually &#x27;squeeze&#x27; anything out.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I expected this product to easily extract my black heads without scarring.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and feels like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>These things are really quite rough on your face..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; got it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to apply too much pressure or it will mark your face.</li>
            <li>Worth the few dollars it costs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard especially if you get facial treatments to know how to relax the pores.</li>
            <li>At no surprise, it is pure stainless steel --- I can leave my worries behind regarding rust and any other attributes that come with lesser quality cheap metals.</li>
            <li>but once you get it down it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s the best method because it won&#x27;t live you a nasty scar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, well-made product that is much more inexpensive than the competition, and does a fine job for a relatively simple (but oh so painful) task.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty typical tool used ot extract blackheads and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>This tool works much better than your big fingers especially for hard to reach areas like next to your nose.  </li>
            <li>smaller end got a fair number of blackheads especially in hard to reach places like the sides of the nose.</li>
            <li>The other end didn&#x27;t really work either, too rounded</li>
            <li>Positive thing though is that I know people that can and have taught me how to mess with this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the bigger end for bigger harder pimples to pop.</li>
            <li>My reason for only four stars is the packaging - the plastic holder is too flimsy for long-term storage (and likely not the most hygienic) and the tool had broken through one end during shipping.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong as the other reviews seem to be good.</li>
            <li>But clears up black heads, and no need to fiddle around with strips that always seem to miss certain places.</li>
            <li>All you do is place the whitehead inside the circular area and gently press down on your skin.</li>
            <li>it does get all the blackheads I never imagined f getting, but you have to press super hard.</li>
            <li>This works well for whiteheads but not extraordinarily well for blackheads unless they&#x27;re really ripe for the popping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I guess I didn&#x27;t dry it completely before I put it back into it&#x27;s plastic</li>
            <li>I cannot figure out how to use the small end, so I am using the large flat end so far.</li>
            <li>Based on few reviews that I read before placing the order, I thought it needs really large pressure for it to work.</li>
            <li>This tool didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin, there is a tool with a little circle, and an &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>After looking at other reviews, we put a hot wet washcloth on the area for a short time and then used the tool, the blackhead came out no problem.  </li>
            <li>My physiotherapy doctor told me before not to use my fingers to squeeze black heads because they get infected, and it is true, every time I squeeze them they get infected if the black head doesn&#x27;t come out!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels tough and is nice and heavy.</li>

            <li> Great quality tool, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap while using it.</li>
            <li> Amazing...</li>
            <li> Its truly amazing and all yout blackheads will be erased.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t know how to use it -- or if it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice version of what she got but way cheaper.</li>

            <li> Now, I have found that this tool is quite effective at removing troubling blemishes.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> so let me be honest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I would recommend using your fingers, The metal feels like its jamming through your skin.</li>
            <li> The result is, if the zit is ready to pop, this will work great!  </li>
            <li> For the price, this product is good and will handle most blackheads, though not all.</li>
            <li> it comes in a handy plastic sleave</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great price!!!</li>
            <li> To be completely honest I think I&#x27;ve got 1 whitehead with this tool.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to have this tool handy.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I would probably need to warm it up</li>
            <li> anyone who has used it can offer suggestions on how to use it effectively I would appreciate it - otherwise</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if it had come with instructions</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it and seems almost indestructible.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it came with instructions</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this at a really good price from this seller here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift, she liked it I guess.</li>
            <li> Has a nice no-slip grip.  </li>
            <li> The seller kindly refunded my money no questions asked.</li>
            <li> Works excellent and is very durable.</li>
            <li> I will be honest and say that I&#x27;ve never used a product like this.  </li>
            <li> That could be because of my lack of experience with this kind of tool, though.</li>
            <li> it is nice.</li>
            <li> It is made out of stainless steel and works great!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality of this tool, being that it is stainless steel and looks to be well designed.</li>
            <li> on product&#x27;s part, the product is nice and do what it is meant to do...</li>
            <li> I think the trick is to soften the skin with a towel soaked in warm water.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy-duty tool</li>
            <li> Professional feel, great quality, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Like many people hope for are some sort of instructions on how to use it, and which side to use for what kind of pimples/blackheads.</li>
            <li> probably I need to warm up my face even more.</li>
            <li> Faster and more effective.</li>
            <li> This product is super amazing!</li>
            <li> i STRONGLY recommend this product !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good  product but still you have to work to get your pores clean</li>
            <li> works best after working out or warm shower when pores are open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and the quality is very sturdy!</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy, and the loops are very secure.</li>
            <li> good product, quick delivery, fits in my mail box.  </li>
            <li> and now i Have to wait to get a response from seller so i can return this and receive what i asked for, so i will not rate the product until im actually able to use what i ordered, but it is a nice weight and seems easy to use</li>
            <li> Works great and is super cheap.</li>
            <li> The loops, while metal, are kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> I always feel like I am doing more damage to my skin with all the tugging.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so satisfied. :)</li>
            <li> I wish it had more of a curve on it for easier blackhead extraction but even with that said I still give it 5 stars, what it lacks in ease it more than makes up for in quality.  </li>
            <li> So much more hygienic than using your fingers and with no pain.</li>
            <li> so I cannot say for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I hope this would be more hygienic than finger tips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have found the more unruly your blemish is the better the tool works.</li>
            <li> I think with practice it will be better, just have to figure it out more.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> works, ok, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Saved me from going to my dermatologist and it works better than those pore strips.</li>
            <li> but I think I have it figured out for the most part</li>
            <li> Was shipped fast works great</li>
            <li> You get better results that way.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> But my creative son started putting the loop around and sort of pressing/pulling.  </li>
            <li> Push gently many times and change position.</li>
            <li> This works  so much better than using your fingers to pop them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s allowed me to get some of the ones I&#x27;ve never been able to before.</li>
            <li> I bet it works on some people, but haven&#x27;t been able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried on many.</li>
            <li> However, I still have not been able to make it work when I need to.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> great price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Hurts more than I thought it would but it works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I purchased from Utopia Care and received it in 2 days with free shipping!)</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This tool is okay</li>
            <li> He is one satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> JK.  :-)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work</li>
            <li> My nose has never looked better after using this product.</li>
            <li> eyehole&amp;#34; design that worked better.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly...worth the price, got most of my blackheads and whiteheads out.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with some instructions though as I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to use it..</li>
            <li> Instead of using your fingers to pop a pimple, these extractors safely remove them and keep bacteria from spreading, something that happens when you use your fingers to pop a pimple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Very durable build and great size for traveling.</li>
            <li> It hurts more than it works..</li>
            <li> I have yet to farm my boyfriend&#x27;s back, but I&#x27;m sure it will be perfect for the job!</li>
            <li> My skin eruptions are no longer like a teenagers, and I just would not be able to benefit from the device.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that many blackhead or pimples.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> You will love this to get rid off your blackhead.</li>
            <li> Great quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Over all good product and worth the money if you needsomething life this</li>
            <li> I can get tons more just by doing it wit my fingers.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Utopia Care for this great product.</li>
            <li> Works well better than extracting it with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> It works great and really takes out the black/whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many of these before and this one is definitely the best value.</li>
            <li> Really glad to have this to help eliminate stubborn blackheads on my face without spreading germs with my fingers.</li>
            <li> of the better blackhead removers ive</li>
            <li> Item was ok.  </li>
            <li> Each of us have one and love.</li>
            <li> Would be more helpful if it came with instructions?!?&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipment.</li>
            <li> However make sure</li>
            <li> Great price fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.</li>
            <li> so I use this tool almost every day and have slain many pimples already.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it will help you to maintain it better.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting it to work a lot better.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> Nay have worked better with a steamer.</li>
            <li> barely okay</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because my husband, who has a greater tolerance for pain, sat still while I pressed this way and</li>
            <li> I love this blemish remover</li>
            <li> Simply the best one out there..recommend!</li>
            <li> defiantly better than by hand.</li>
            <li> its a very useful tool and comes in handy when needed.</li>
            <li> The flat side works best on my blackheads.</li>
            <li> This is not your best option for big pimples, but it&#x27;s great for those tiny a-hole pimples and blackheads for sure!</li>
            <li> Working great without any permanent marks or the pain that would normally come from using fingernails.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I use the short end all the time to remove blackheads, and it&#x27;s generally successful!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok to use, does not make it as easy as I thought,</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and keeps from getting even more bacteria on your face, which you can get when using your fingernails.</li>
            <li> The tool was easy to use and alleviated the redness once you extract the pimple.</li>
            <li> my skin more easily and leaves some debris in my pores.</li>
            <li> It is better than using fingers or a bobby pin since the blackhead remover does not break the skin as easily.</li>
            <li> It was good quality and would be good for big blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Overall good product and good seller.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use  and clean.</li>
            <li> The best way to use this tool is to wash your face with warm water first to open up your pores.</li>
            <li> so i ordered it through Amazon, it came right when they said it will, and so far i have loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this one for home facials/extraction!&lt;br /&gt;Probably best if you gently clean &amp; steam your face before using this tool.</li>
            <li> the product i recieved was made with  high quality stainless steel works great !</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it twice, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I&#x27;m quite happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Its much more precise and hygienic.</li>
            <li> wish I could find the one I had as it seemed to roll more smoothly over my skin and dramatically removed pore grime.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as it is stainless steel and works great without pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, effective, fast and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find this particularly useful or effective.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good communication.</li>
            <li> It is nice, useful and looking just like on web picture.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great and super fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, and feels comfortable in your grip.</li>
            <li> Oh and the flat side takes off blackheads very good as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I removed another star because I ordered TWO, one came in perfect condition, the other one had an end that wiggled.</li>
            <li> and then just use the loop side and press against your face and it comes out super easy!</li>
            <li> Easy to use also.</li>
            <li> Suprisingly, once I picked up this thingy, things became sort of easy --- just pushing one end against your blackhead area.</li>
            <li> Helps me clean my pores thoroughly, more than what I could ever do with my fingers.</li>
            <li> This is easy to hold onto even with lotion on your hands.</li>
            <li> pleased overall, great price too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> I will say there isn&#x27;t any instructions, but you can easily find out how to use the tool/tools on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Makes getting ingrown hairs and popping pimples easy.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, just add a bit of water to make paste.  </li>
            <li> With this product you easily just poke your pimple with a needle( all it takes is one poke</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li> It does not come with directions but those were easily found on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Tool is durable and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> These line of products are rare to find in your local pharmacy, but once you find them you will be very happy to use them.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to peel some skin off when extracting.</li>
            <li> two ends were strong and not flimsy like the rest out there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to open your pores with warm water before you try to use it.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take a long time (as it used to do) to get it out , then i cleaned the area with sterile, very good tool.</li>
            <li> I like to lance the pimples first, but do that at your own discretion..</li>
            <li> First product of this kind that I have tried</li>
            <li> I was very excited when this arrived and used it right away!</li>
            <li> but it is really fun to watch how easily this gets rid of zits!</li>
            <li> The shipping was also pretty quick, which was surprising since they offer it for free.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market to remove those unwanted black heads.</li>
            <li> Fine well made product.</li>
            <li> The grooved handle makes it easy and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Just as described and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Super at lifting oil, better yet it is all-natural, too.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Also, the zit has to be ready to come so that could have been one of the reasons that it didn&#x27;t get as many as I would&#x27;ve wished!</li>
            <li> It works, easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Be sure to use alcohol to clean the extractor so it stays clean.</li>
            <li> Simple tool that works great.</li>
            <li> It is very durable and sturdy and comes in its own slip-in closable  carrier (convenient for travel).</li>
            <li> Cheap, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> It appears to be made sturdily and does not appear cheap.</li>
            <li> it does what it should and is easy to keep clean with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially around my nostrils.</li>
            <li> and it was available to ship to my location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to be a high-quality product for the price, but I haven&#x27;t personally had a lot of great results.  </li>
            <li> Works great for blackheads especially around the nose area.</li>
            <li> Worth the price :)</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as the one the dermatologist uses.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to remove your blackheads if used properly.</li>
            <li> It has a good feel in the hand as far as control goes.  </li>
            <li> This little tool has been amazing, doesn&#x27;t leave marks and is very effective.</li>
            <li> though so not quite sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li> Makes it super easy</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean and it really works</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was after for cheap!</li>
            <li> Either way it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to, love it.</li>
            <li> user friendly, totally worth every penny plus some!</li>
            <li> , this one is small and fits into my lil make up pouch perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is also my first tool and probably I can learn more in using this -</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase !</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> However, the white head loop is super super great.</li>
            <li> keep it clean with alcohol between use.</li>
            <li> Prompt and clean.</li>
            <li> A clean plastic case is included.</li>
            <li> Definitely positive feedback :)</li>
            <li> I did remove most of my blackheads with pure tea-tree oil and this hemmed with the rest</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so I don&#x27;t know if there is a special way to work it.</li>
            <li> but this tool took it right out!  </li>
            <li> We received the remover and went to work right away!</li>
            <li> excellent tool for getting at those hard to extract nuisances.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Better than expected.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at first, but I kept trying it different ways.</li>
            <li> I have many small blackheads on my nose and this product worked great for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more luck with getting rid of whiteheads than with blackheads, but I haven&#x27;t had myself a \\&quot;spa\\&quot; day to really try it out.</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> facial use was good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool, nifty tool.</li>
            <li> I have a face with full of blackhead, and this one help me a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful and doesn&#x27;t leave marks.</li>
            <li> only good thing.....</li>
            <li> Good to use after shower when pores are open.</li>
            <li> A gentle tool that is a favorite for extraction.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I am enjoying the use of my comodone extractor.</li>
            <li> Good product overall!</li>
            <li> I got it and im doing minor extractions by myself at the house, always staming the area very well before using it, better than using your own fingers :)</li>
            <li> this is a fine tool if your blackheads are very very large.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping and the actual tool is really good quality.</li>
            <li> Applying a mask before extraction is also a good way to loosen up the plugs even more with less pressure.</li>
            <li> The remover is pretty strong to work.</li>
            <li> It has a rounded side and a flat side, with good grip.</li>
            <li> It also arrived fairly quick</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and seems well-made.</li>
            <li> It does the job quickly and without any pain.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t just magically pop out of the skin, and a decent amount of pressure and some pain is still required.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It definitely was not the most comfortable experience for me to bust those blackheads!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend Blemish Remover.</li>
            <li> I was simply looking for best price with most favorable reviews and am suprised at how well this little thing works.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped this very fast as well!</li>
            <li> Overall a nice tool to have when dealing with problem skin and keeps the area clean and sanitized without hurting the area</li>
            <li> advice, use hot to warm water on your face to open up the pores to easy extraction.</li>
            <li> I  really enjoyed my new thing.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Received fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Steam your face before using it so that it will easily remove all the dirt in your face without too much pain.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not frustrating because the pimple come out so easily.</li>
            <li> Steam your face before using it so that it will easily remove all the dirt in your face without too much pain.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my adolescent brother and his face looks very clear now with most blackheads gone.</li>
            <li> but this  tool is very strong and well made and the loops on both sides are polished so there are no sharp edges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Great little tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little more effective around my sternum.</li>
            <li> It works great, was shipped quickly, carefully wrapped, and is certainly priced right ($4.99 shipping included).  </li>
            <li> Really hurts if you use it on your nose, but is fantastic for hard-to-reach spots and clearing out pores.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t useful at all.  </li>
            <li> If you have a zit that doesn&#x27;t have a clear Whitehead or blackhead, then this won&#x27;t work and you&#x27;ll hurt yourself more than anything.</li>
            <li> If you remember back to your teens when you were told not to squeeze zits and blackheads, this tool could have been a handy solution.</li>
            <li> A tool like this would have come in handy back then.</li>
            <li> Works well on freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li> It just gives me horseshoe shaped marks on my face that people laugh at.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but works great!</li>
            <li> Usually I only wash my face with warm water</li>
            <li> will return...not useful, does not work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected good product for the price</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Even though this product worked well, it broke quickly even with gentle use!</li>
            <li> This specific brand was highly rated and also fairly priced, so I decided to buy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was sent right away.</li>
            <li> And I did it quite right.</li>
            <li> so you can always find it and shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li> I tried using this right after a shower, since that steams your face and makes it easier to extract anything within your pores.</li>
            <li> The day i got it , i have to try it right away</li>
            <li> if you use it in the right way, it won&#x27;t hurt you.</li>
            <li> But does the job, if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li> Your zit/blackhead has to be in the right &amp;#34;state&amp;#34; in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> Having the right tool makes any effort easier, and this is one of those things you don&#x27;t think of needing until you need it.  </li>
            <li> I steam my face, get all up in there and ready to clean some pores -- put the wand thing over a clogged pore -- push -- and</li>
            <li> if you use it after a  hot bath, when the face is well moist and the pores are open, works nicely</li>
            <li> Fast and clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but needs more pressure then expected.</li>
            <li> Apparently these are used at dermatologists offices quite often to safely remove whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I need to find a better way to store it to keep it clean between uses, but it looks like I&#x27;ll keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> works good push down and blackheads come out.</li>
            <li> Good grip, but the ends are very sharp.</li>
            <li> it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> One really nice things about this tool is that it doesn&#x27;t really leave a lasting mark on your face if you apply some sort of mask after you disinfect your areas</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve actually had more success using witch hazel</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I like this very much.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> much better than any other cheap one bought from a store</li>
            <li> Not so good at getting the little gunk out of pores or &#x27;comedomes&#x27; though.</li>
            <li> I love it and wild highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used blackhead strips and after washing my face to open my pores this tool works pretty well possibly better than strips and is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE, ESPECIALLY FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I want</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended for any1 who needs this !!</li>
            <li> Item and delivery were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and it works.</li>
            <li> My first order didn&#x27;t come in so another</li>
            <li> It dose the job very well!</li>
            <li> As an avid DIYer, I did it myself with the Utopia product.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but after using it the first time it was a lot easier to remove &amp; extract blemishes than using my fingernails.</li>
            <li> be sure to only use it if you know you can pop it.</li>
            <li> The tool is of good material , it was challenge to use it at first , but a few YouTube videos on how</li>
            <li> I tried it maybe 5 or 6 times, even after a hot</li>
            <li> ExActly what I wanted...and what I needed for school...</li>
            <li> Works better if the skin was recently warmed and softened under a hot towel.</li>
            <li> It also helps if the area has had a hot rag over it to loosen it up.</li>
            <li> You should attach something hot to blackhead area before to take out blackhead.</li>
            <li> It will most likely fulfill your needs.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It does help to steam your face in the shower first.</li>
            <li> Thought it was kinda funny</li>
            <li> Steam your face first...</li>
            <li> This product seems to work pretty well as advertised.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be too sure about since this does takes learning a method to work properly.</li>
            <li> love it and very addictive..</li>
            <li> Very unsatissfied!</li>
            <li> My nose was nearly blackhead FREE and NOT RED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Soaked face first in hot water than did my face.</li>
            <li> I have seen better results online with similar products.</li>
            <li> Needle first.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> It does the job pretty well, this is the first one ive ever used tho</li>
            <li> I find out that if you put on a hot towel or if you steam your face first then it will be easier.</li>
            <li> First week had some redness but also removed the most.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought the blackhead extractor because I had been watching first impressions of thwm on youtube</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars, because it was consistent with the description.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using it after a hot shower to loosen up pores.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> you know how to use it first before purchasing,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to sanitize the tool with hot water or rubbing alcohol after every use.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any more zits coming back!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> Good quality not cheaply made</li>
            <li> It certainly arrived quickly, was reasonably priced, &amp; was well protected by its packaging.  </li>
            <li> The item is in good quality, comes with a small porch, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I know there is a certain way to use this tool, but I am trying to be safe and not damage my skin, so I can&#x27;t really say that it really removes blackheads completely.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right, but even so, I don&#x27;t like a product that requires so much research to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li> Good grip / Stiff tips</li>
            <li> Having the dual ends is beneficial, although I mostly use the rounded tip instead of the flat one.</li>
            <li> The flatter end is kind of sharp and scrapped my skin.</li>
            <li> Always wash your face with warm water and soap, if not any other face cleaning product before using it.</li>
            <li> As expected,  fast shipping,  thanks !!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my face like when I use my fingers to remove acne, and its super easy to clean with a little alcohol and a napkin.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use to pop all the white heads when they showed up.</li>
            <li> It fills my heart with just enough joy to not really care.</li>
            <li> that well, it does leave a pretty large indent in my face.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Shipped really fast- exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> At that point the dead skin is gone and your pores are more accessible.</li>
            <li> Easily extracts blackheads and whiteheads, which ultimately shortens the amount of time they stay on your face.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this tool works much better immediately after a shower.</li>
            <li> Solid product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as squeezing with your fingers or fingernails, but leaves less of a mark.</li>
            <li> This tool does remove blackheads, but as a word of caution you should consult YouTube for videos on how to use the tool properly, otherwise it is easy to leave a scar.</li>
            <li> strong and durable to fight deep acne too</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a certain technique to it</li>
            <li> Price was an important factor, since I don&#x27;t want to wind up spending more than I have to on something that may or may not last long</li>
            <li> invest in a better product doesn&#x27;t leave scarring but is better for big pores with black and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly amazing little gadget.</li>
            <li> Just an amazingly effective little gadget.</li>
            <li> works great, it pops the tough pimpled under the skin.</li>
            <li> If I could go back, I&#x27;d spend a little more money and get something that is of a better quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> It is made very well</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, and well made.</li>
            <li> really work  </li>
            <li> This item was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times already and it has really helped me with some of my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfy with my purches thank you for your help</li>
            <li> You will notice if the pimple isn&#x27;t quite ready to pop, this device will leave a temporary mark on your face.</li>
            <li> bought the pimple extractor to remove blackhead and the product works really well.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed with this.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> But the listing of Stainless Steel is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is going to sound gross.  </li>
            <li> It arrived very promptly and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very we&#x27;ll made.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hold out much faith that this stubborn blackhead would be removed, but it was.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really worked for me</li>
            <li> If one has learned all ready how to use one of these, it will probably work.</li>
            <li> product works really well.  </li>
            <li> The dual sides are really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well in removing pimples and blackheads with out too much pain or strain.</li>
            <li> This is made of stainless steel, so it&#x27;s sturdy and seems durable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast...</li>
            <li> really like how &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; this tool is.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really extract</li>
            <li> It works just as well as it states just have to gently use it</li>
            <li> So I really recommend this product if any of you have a problem with popping pimples.</li>
            <li> Really recommend using it after shower.</li>
            <li> Does its job very well if you are using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Cleans pores very well</li>
            <li> However, I still have whiteheads from time to time; I don&#x27;t really have blackheads</li>
            <li> For the money this is very well made.</li>
            <li> I believe it is surgical grade stainless steel.</li>
            <li> tool seems very goodd quality and very resistant assembly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary,it is a very goood purchase for the money.</li>

            <li> This product if used properly is gentle and works.</li>
            <li> Works well and got here fast.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> HaHa</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> Very durable and built well.  </li>
            <li> It really works to remove blackheads without causing bruising.</li>
            <li> fast ship.</li>
            <li> Received it very quickly...works well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Not as effective on smaller whiteheads, but does work on larger ones.</li>
            <li> Just using the flat end as scraper works fine, you don&#x27;t have put the zit or whatever in the loop to pop it.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin, and wanted something to remove blackhead because when I do it on my own</li>
            <li> I would have never expected that to happen so quickly, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but so far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s an alright product, gets an OK amount of blackheads and pimples out, but use it carefully!</li>
            <li> There are other brands of comedone/blackhead extractors that work much better.</li>
            <li> This post is for those that are not dumb in life.</li>
            <li> As i&#x27;ve used similar product in the past I knew that this type of product would be great and it has been.  </li>
            <li> Do yourselves a favor and YouTube or ask a person like a dermatologist or person who does facials to learn how to exactly clean your face, open your pores, then use the remover.</li>
            <li> so be careful and keep clean!</li>
            <li> I had tried a nice one that worked great, but was a little expensive at $15.</li>
            <li> The tool does take a good amount of pressure but it is less likely to break skin than if you were to use your hands.</li>
            <li> I recommend leaving a small warm towel on the face to loosen up the pores/skin before extracting.</li>
            <li> and I recommend anyone who uses it for the first time to read up on how the professional aestheticians use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The very stubborn, deep blackheads will require steaming to open the pores and to make the skin a bit softer for it to work its magic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little longer than I thought (about an inch short of pen length), but it&#x27;s still good for the job.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that I wish the other side was more useful.</li>
            <li> but you can definitly get out most of your nose black heads.</li>
            <li> Easily lifts out the acne from the pores with minimal pain and scarring.</li>
            <li> Overall, the products is good but sometimes a bit harsh for my face.</li>
            <li> The remover tool arrived exactly as described and is the same blemish tool from another brand I purchased at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid product that I use often, most of the time after showers when your pores are open (I find this helps a lot).</li>
            <li> Product works decent.</li>
            <li> This product came quickly (received it in only one day after I ordered it!)</li>
            <li> My main goal when I bought this was to remove this one stubborn blackhead</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know how such a thing could remove blackheads, but first time I used it, I was so surprised!!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a high quality tool.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> II had high hopes for this tool</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for the stubborn spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality, like a surgical instrument.  </li>
            <li> thank you i highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this and waited months to get it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The smooth, curved edges are fairly gentle on the skin and don&#x27;t rough it up like my fingernails did, so it solves that problem!</li>
            <li> If you are shopping around for a Blackhead Remover, you might want to spend a little more for quality.</li>
            <li> this little thing is magical.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer if the tool was a little more sturdy</li>
            <li> Then I put it to use &amp; didn&#x27;t get the easy results I&#x27;ve seen it have when other&#x27;s use it.</li>
            <li> Very well-made, professional instrument.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be useless because of all the great reviews, but</li>
            <li> If it is real stainless steel then this tool should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is better than just using your fingers, especially when you have long nails.</li>
            <li> Thought more round at the tips like at a dermatologist office tool.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is normal, but I also chemically peel my face sometimes, although, I don&#x27;t use the blackhead remover before or after my chemical peels.</li>
            <li> but this was just too big to be useful.</li>
            <li> i was starting to develop a tiny cyst like zit on my forehead and after a warm bath (to open up the pores n soften the skin)</li>
            <li> But this tool helps take the place of the normal &amp;#34;picking and squeezing&amp;#34; with your fingers or anything else you can find to extract them.</li>
            <li> The metal doesn&#x27;t bend with pressure applied in normal application.</li>
            <li> I tried it without steaming my face which is not something that I would normally do anyway.</li>
            <li> The whiteheads shifted with pressure from the sewing needle because it wasn&#x27;t sufficiently sharp and fine.</li>
            <li> I say nearly, because my previous extractor seemed to perform a tad bit better --- which is the reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of</li>
            <li> nice buy... recommended if you need to remove black or white heads...</li>
            <li> It does typically leave the area a little red obviously, so it&#x27;s ideal to use this tool at night rather than in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t live your life without one of these.</li>
            <li> I live this tool</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> This small tool is very important.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much but cleanly gets the acne out.</li>
            <li> This was much nicer than I was expecting, solid stainless steel.</li>
            <li> This and the round, spoon-like tool with a whole in the bottom to fit over the blemish were the methods of choice.</li>
            <li> seriously, it would have been nice to have some type of directions with it...</li>
            <li> Very professional tool.</li>
            <li> The holes are  little bigger then expected,  but it works great</li>
            <li> but I also have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> it worked the first time my wife used it on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the one my dermatologist is using in removing my blackheads, whiteheads (facial cleaning).</li>
            <li> absolutly love it best tool to get rid of those nasty white heads and doesnt scar like my fingers</li>
            <li> This is exactly the one my dermatologist is using in removing my blackheads, whiteheads (facial cleaning).</li>
            <li> This is true for the T zone but didn&#x27;t hold true for the fatty areas of the face, like the cheeks, or for deep seated blackheads.</li>
            <li> (my nose stays red for about 24 hours after a good black head squeezing with my nails....) but not with the utopia!!!</li>
            <li> By following a certain regimen and going all natural, I have really started to clear my face up.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself first and found it somewhat painful, even using it after showering, but works great.  </li>
            <li> This little tool seems to do its job just fine.</li>
            <li> that, mashing his skin pretty hard before I finally did get most of 2 blackheads out that had been there for a while.</li>
            <li> My son tried just pressing and had limited success.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the double loop round tool - I have used it and it is easy to use and works!</li>
            <li> Just a wire with an opening large enough to let out the blackhead.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me however, and only scarred certain areas of my face.</li>
            <li> If it has a hard top, it works sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Works great and comes with case to hold it in so it doesn&#x27;t get dirty.</li>
            <li> Helping keep my skin clear from blackheads.</li>
            <li> You can also clearly see through the slots...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my order got turned around in the mail, but because it is such a great tool I wanted to give it a review.</li>
            <li> Not as professional as I thought it&#x27;d be.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be amazed how much dirt is in your pores, for me it only works well on my nose.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The problem with the videos I watched was that a professional was recommended for the task.</li>
            <li> really professional help me with all my needs and</li>
            <li> Nearly painless.  </li>
            <li> It gets those tricky blackheads near the nose and chin as well.</li>
            <li> item was completely as pictured and described.  </li>
            <li> extracts the um....  gross  stuff  without scaring up your face as much as doing it with your fingers..  </li>
            <li> seems like it work very well for pimples and/or larger blackheads</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son.</li>
            <li> It really does help with popping those pimples, but by no means is the ultimate solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it thus far to get whiteheads out and it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it hurts; definitely not worse then actually using your fingers to pop a pimple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this MONTHS and still use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I was always bugging my husband to let me remove his blackheads on his face and he wouldnt let me come near him because he said i hurt him.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool because of my 12 year old- who got blackheads in his ear.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t go all fast and expect your face to cooperate without the proper sterile and prepping.</li>
            <li> Now I just need to see if it lasts more than a few months before the wire loop, almost mysteriously, seems to just fall apart!</li>
            <li> Shipping a quite slow, so if you need it for immediate use better to buy it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a good item, but useless for the purpose it is sold for.</li>
            <li> Very durable and compact and is great for small blackheads in those hard to reach areas!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s so small and easy to use</li>
            <li> Something about not having dirty greasy hands touching my face makes it worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> It makes getting black heads and visible white heads out easily.</li>
            <li> I have send it back to you..waiting for a new one!</li>
            <li> I just got the Blackhead Remover, and it works just fine for removing blackheads and small pimples.</li>
            <li> However it does a fine job for picking out small pimples.</li>
            <li> The wire end that is mainly used wiggles back and forth, making me feel unsafe using this one as it seems like it may break</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest in that I don&#x27;t find much use for the long flat end, but the short, angled end usually works for me</li>
            <li> Just a quick blackhead removal without the mess.</li>
            <li> The long flat loop side is pretty useless in my experience, but the other side of the tool works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> not strong enough and the heads bent easily.</li>
            <li> It takes too much digging to actually get the black head out when the seki edge remover pulled them out within the first try.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product to arrive (multiple black heads)</li>
            <li> This product works for blackheads that are not deep in the skin and are fairly new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple idea, but it&#x27;s really the only type of tool that works.</li>
            <li> small loop size is good for medium thickness of the skin, a little big for skin around eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the fault of the extractor since there is no other way to get blackheads and whiteheads out.</li>
            <li> I was not able to extract any whiteheads because I could not properly lance them even though I was using a new, sharp and very fine sewing needle.</li>
            <li> easy to use and not sure how i hadnt had one in my life before!</li>
            <li> The flat end is much practical for usage as opposed to the rounder end, it&#x27;s too bulky to actually &#x27;squeeze&#x27; anything out.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I expected this product to easily extract my black heads without scarring.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and feels like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> These things are really quite rough on your face..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; got it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to apply too much pressure or it will mark your face.</li>
            <li> Worth the few dollars it costs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard especially if you get facial treatments to know how to relax the pores.</li>
            <li> At no surprise, it is pure stainless steel --- I can leave my worries behind regarding rust and any other attributes that come with lesser quality cheap metals.</li>
            <li> but once you get it down it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s the best method because it won&#x27;t live you a nasty scar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, well-made product that is much more inexpensive than the competition, and does a fine job for a relatively simple (but oh so painful) task.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty typical tool used ot extract blackheads and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> This tool works much better than your big fingers especially for hard to reach areas like next to your nose.  </li>
            <li> smaller end got a fair number of blackheads especially in hard to reach places like the sides of the nose.</li>
            <li> The other end didn&#x27;t really work either, too rounded</li>
            <li> Positive thing though is that I know people that can and have taught me how to mess with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the bigger end for bigger harder pimples to pop.</li>
            <li> My reason for only four stars is the packaging - the plastic holder is too flimsy for long-term storage (and likely not the most hygienic) and the tool had broken through one end during shipping.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong as the other reviews seem to be good.</li>
            <li> But clears up black heads, and no need to fiddle around with strips that always seem to miss certain places.</li>
            <li> All you do is place the whitehead inside the circular area and gently press down on your skin.</li>
            <li> it does get all the blackheads I never imagined f getting, but you have to press super hard.</li>
            <li> This works well for whiteheads but not extraordinarily well for blackheads unless they&#x27;re really ripe for the popping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I guess I didn&#x27;t dry it completely before I put it back into it&#x27;s plastic</li>
            <li> I cannot figure out how to use the small end, so I am using the large flat end so far.</li>
            <li> Based on few reviews that I read before placing the order, I thought it needs really large pressure for it to work.</li>
            <li> This tool didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin, there is a tool with a little circle, and an &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After looking at other reviews, we put a hot wet washcloth on the area for a short time and then used the tool, the blackhead came out no problem.  </li>
            <li> My physiotherapy doctor told me before not to use my fingers to squeeze black heads because they get infected, and it is true, every time I squeeze them they get infected if the black head doesn&#x27;t come out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels tough and is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> Which is really too bad because I was very excited about this product.</li>
            <li> Worth the few bucks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with these things not holding up well, &amp; while it&#x27;s only been a limited amount of time I&#x27;ve had this particular product, so far it appears to be doing  well.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase the only thing I would say bad is that it does not come with any instructions and it has two different ends</li>
            <li> You do have to push pretty hard to get the &#x27;gunk&#x27; out</li>
            <li> You have to press hard enough for it to really hurt to accomplish anything on smaller blackheads, which she has a lot of.</li>
            <li> but it does not work very well for small blemishes and/or sebaceous filaments.</li>
            <li> I recently had a bunch of clogged pores from leaving makeup on too long.</li>
            <li> maybe im not steaming my face long enough.</li>
            <li> The price helped a lot, and it will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> The product feels like it is sturdy and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> but my husband had a blackhead on the back of his neck that had been staring at me for too long.</li>
            <li> Using this thing leaves very small marks and my skin recovers very fast.</li>
            <li> They are well made and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Works on those harder to reach blackheads on my upper back.  </li>
            <li> And Im not sure if it is this one in particular, or if it is blackhead removers in general.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Maybe it is a problem of my skin, it is very sensitive, or I don&#x27;t know how to use properly, but no way it doesn&#x27;t get red at least for a day or two.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with white heads and some black heads(didn&#x27;t work on all black heads for me).</li>
            <li> It is almost 5\\&quot; total length with a three quarter inch large flat end and a half inch small hooked end.</li>
            <li> Oh well, at least it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> Loops are a lot bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Have used it just a few times (thinner end only)on stubborn whiteheads and has held up so far.</li>
            <li> As long as you understand how to use this tool and what it does, it works just well.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say...works well for getting rid of those occasional blackheads and whiteheads...</li>
            <li> And I was looking for this one a long time ago</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as productive as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> And I was looking for this one a long time ago</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this tool for so long.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t entirely without pain as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I went this long without one.</li>
            <li> A year ago, my teen daughter, who uses blackhead scrubber products on her face, told me that I had a lot of black and white heads --</li>
            <li> Can use it frequently, b/c no strong odors.  </li>
            <li> The thing pushes down hard on your skin and makes deep impressions without really popping the pimple.</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple other aesthetician tools from a different seller</li>
            <li> And I just ordered a 2nd one for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple ways and on other people and received no results.</li>
            <li> kind of painful to use , not really for someone whonever used it before</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are looking for a single remover tool.</li>
            <li> I did not have much luck with this product and maybe I am not a good example for this tool.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to use but gets them out from deep down.</li>
            <li> Yeah, like the title says, you bust this sleek piece of medical equipment out that black head will literally jump out of your skin thinking its a party.</li>
            <li> This extractor does the job of what the same item from Sephora or Ulta does at over 50% less cost.</li>
            <li> This product will unlikely to cause excessive redness or peeling skin after use, better than the one I had before.</li>
            <li> Even a little paper of simple instructions would help people out.</li>
            <li> The product came as ordered,fast shipping, and its solid little thing.</li>
            <li> Its still hard but not blemish when using it so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more about angle/placement than force with this bad boy.</li>
            <li> got the job done for sure, it was painful though</li>
            <li> The two different angles on the heads really helps for putting pressure where you need it without having to contort your body weirdly.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Does just what it is expected to do.  </li>
            <li> A lil rough.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you misuse this tool you will create marks on your skin.</li>
            <li> only a few times and the loops began to bend and wouldn&#x27;t hold pressure to extract anything after awhile</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> But if the darn zit is not ready, you can poke and prod all you want</li>
            <li> However, I got it wet</li>
            <li> That should really never be the case and never happened to me.</li>
            <li> expected a week as I ordered the weekend before a holiday...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for another brand (unknown)</li>
            <li> it came with absolutely no instructions.</li>
            <li> Works as expected but</li>
            <li> It works well as expected.</li>
            <li> this item gets the job done, I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I have never been to a dermatologist, thus never really hearing about these things.</li>
            <li> I never really had experience with these before.</li>
            <li> I will say that it is easier in some locations, and harder in others.</li>
            <li> Not really a Acne Pimple Extractor...</li>
            <li> Sturdy, heavy, feels solid.</li>
            <li> It only got a few, but on YouTube, it showed these tools getting a ton.</li>
            <li> For older blackheads which may have been in the skin a while or are deeper in the skin, this product does not work because you have to push it into the skin very hard and it leaves red marks on the skin which take a few days to fade away.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for an extracting tool, since my previous one finally broke (I might be just a little over-zealous).</li>
            <li> So, out of the shower, I have been using my reading glasses to squeeze the few white head and TONS of black head that collect around my nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the big side and the small side, on all kinds of pores -- and nothing happens.  </li>
            <li> Works just as I expected it to!</li>
            <li> I remember my dermatologist used a small hooked spoon, but it was much smaller, rounder and thicker.</li>
            <li> , the reason I bought this item is my other one broke</li>
            <li> I have not used any other of this type of product before</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> But maybe it does for other people?</li>
            <li> Cleared out my face just as any other.</li>
            <li> it is sturdy, does not bend like other flimsey brands i&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> It did scrap off the small white heads but ruined the skin around it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it leaves a slightly small, red mark, other times it does not.</li>
            <li> and before work the other day, I couldn&#x27;t stand it -- I had to try my Utopia Care Blackhead Blemis Remover  --</li>
            <li> For my face, I&#x27;m afraid that I&#x27;m back to my old method of squeezing the pores between my fingernails, yielding prodigious results but causing some pain (and maybe eventual arthritis) of the last finger joint.</li>
            <li> I have never use other type of products, so I cannot give a comparison.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out how to use the other side for whiteheads.</li>
            <li> In other words.</li>
            <li> Both ends of the blemish remover is sturdy, unlike other flimsy ones.</li>
            <li> Works just as I expected!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have small ones and larger ones.</li>
            <li> One side is a regular stiff wire, the other side is a flatened wire which leave less of a mark.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that i felt it should have been a little longer by a few inches...</li>
            <li> I feel the other side isn&#x27;t wide enough because the loop is too thick.</li>
            <li> Only down side is, it does hurt to use :/</li>
            <li> My family member had used another extractor but it didn&#x27;t work...or it work a little but not really (the extractors from the drugstore).</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from moderate-severe acne (at least in my opinion) for the last 6 months.</li>
            <li> Wastes money spent.</li>
            <li> Metal pieces too thick to get close enough to the area.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the technique down on how to extract pimples, it works well.</li>
            <li> I have yet to get down the technique for this</li>
            <li> directions came with the tool and 2) if the useless larger side had an opening much smaller than the other side.</li>
            <li> Warning, the edges are a little sharp</li>
            <li> I mean where can you find a product where the shipping doesnt cost you the same as the cost of the product...    </li>
            <li> $4.99, and with an average review rating of 4 and a half stars</li>
            <li> , I got this for my black heads</li>
            <li> less germ-y.  </li>
            <li> It got some black heads I have been trying for the longest time.</li>
            <li> One day while reading up on the subject, I came across an article mentioning these extractors.</li>
            <li> I removed a zillion or so black heads</li>
            <li> like I did with my previous extractor.</li>
            <li> A curious little tool that does often help!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually get big blackheads often, and trying t remover little ones using this usually just irritates my skin and leaves lines from the tool.</li>
            <li> It saves a mess and pain, compared to squeezing pimples with your figures.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually know what the thick side is used for as I only use the thin side.</li>
            <li> This uses surprisingly little pressure to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Took a little practice to get the hang of, but with practice and a lot of you tube vids...</li>
            <li> Leave your face a little damp and presto!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Need a little patience to learn how to use it</li>
            <li> Nifty little gadget for removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> Altogether, I think this is a neat little tool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my husband(who has oily skin) and junk comes out of his pores with little pressing effort.</li>
            <li> It could be a little longer though.</li>
            <li> the ends are thin but sturdy enough to get the black heads out without damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> not exactly what i was expecting and its pretty painful to use at time because of the pressure needed to use it</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any bruising or broken skin, despite pushing on it really hard.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and well rounded, leading to the least painful extraction you can get.</li>
            <li> This is amazing .. as it does remove those disgusting blackheads.</li>
            <li> It popped a few zits and squeezed out a few blackheads.</li>
            <li> Heavy tool.</li>
            <li> A bit frustrating to work with; just ended up with bruised and red marks all over my face and no pimples/blackheads affected.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos on how to use this.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and Does not leave red marks behind.</li>
            <li> one of the loops completely broke off the tool making it totally useless.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few weeks now on both myself and my husband.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn blackheads around my nose and a few on my cheeks/forehead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing almost everyday since we bought it</li>
            <li> *** was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i have been using it every few days after a shower</li>
            <li> I did find a few youtube tutorials that demonstrated how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use both green tea and aloe vera on my face to reduce redness and increase recovery time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fully metal and feels heavy in the hand.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money IMHO.</li>
            <li> The metal seems legit because it is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these things since college, zit comes to a head, I put the round side around it then push until the nasties are out and blood comes out the hole.</li>
            <li> It is the thin wire end, not the flat end.</li>
            <li> You can even extract sebum (ew) from the tiniest of white heads, preventing big ugly breakouts.</li>
            <li> Any little bit helps!</li>
            <li> Now he&#x27;s been using this little gadget himself!</li>
            <li> She said no more to the hard metal squashing her tender little nose before I could get anything out.</li>
            <li> This did not help my blackheads in the least little bit.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to use it even when the order arrived.</li>
            <li> small and compact</li>
            <li> I ordered this because like a lot of people, I usually pop my pimples.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t say the problem was me or the tool. :-/</li>
            <li> I guess my pores are too small for this too work.</li>
            <li> So I have this weird oval shape that is all red.</li>
            <li> Its small, portable and sturdy and does its job well.</li>
            <li> a small blackhead remover.</li>
            <li> I think using an extractor on an obvious whitehead is helpful because they are extremely difficult to cover up with makeup.</li>
            <li> I usually use this at night before going to bed, after I have steamed/cleansed my face.</li>
            <li> The tool also came with a small plastic sleeve to store it in.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the product or me?</li>
            <li> There is nothing to NOT love about this product.</li>
            <li> No more scabbing over.</li>
            <li> No more acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some postings in the past from people who are too ignorant to know</li>
            <li> Kinda small....</li>
            <li> and not okay.</li>
            <li> Disappointed really</li>
            <li> It may well be that the skin on my cheeks and my nose is just not suitable to this type of intervention.</li>
            <li> Do not push so hard</li>
            <li> Even with hard pushing, the item holds up well.  </li>
            <li> no matter how hard I push, nothing comes out.</li>
            <li> But this thing just leaves these marks from me pushing to hard into my face.</li>
            <li> I use or how hard I press</li>
            <li> You DO have to push hard, but you also have to push hard when you use your fingers.</li>
            <li> I can hardly remove blackheads with it</li>
            <li> In fact on my nose it made some of my skin peel I had to press so hard.</li>
            <li> No need to press so hard and bruise yourself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
            <li> but my 15 yr old son says it hurts too bad.</li>
            <li> Does not leave any marks on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> At least using this utensil I can eliminate scarring my face.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product as an inexpensive solution to a common problem.</li>
            <li> I am heading towards late fifties and my vision is not what it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about how it would work for me when I saw how thick the business end of the tool was.  </li>
            <li> Very painful to use, but beauty is pain, right?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard, and not particularly good at pimple extraction</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the shipping it took forever to get to my house 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This left painful bruises on my nose</li>
            <li> Pinching with fingernails is not a good idea.  </li>
            <li> Its less painful and less irritating to the skin then manually squeezing (which you shouldnt do anyways)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I paid almost $5 for it on Amazon and my local Walmart sold one just like it for about $2.</li>
            <li> You push it very hard to apply pressure over the pimple.</li>
            <li> The blackhead loop is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> Also, even when you do this, you can&#x27;t be afraid of a little pain.</li>
            <li> I honestly never thought i&#x27;d would work, i was wrong.</li>
            <li> The poor kid.</li>
            <li> One tip of extractor was broken when it reached me..</li>
            <li> Blackheads are such an annoying problem, so I&#x27;ll pass on what works for us and hope it works for someone else.</li>
            <li> I wanted something for very small, difficult to deal with clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done and my boyfriend says it is less painful than fingers</li>
            <li> Im tired of all these fake comments</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> I read on one review that it came with instructions, unfortunately mine did not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a thing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got the wrong thing</li>
            <li> He is obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> but i was unable to find it at Walmart or Target</li>
            <li> Using fingers is terrible and leave big marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> , It took my husband nasty black heads .</li>
            <li> I feel badly about this comment; unfortunately, it does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> The use cold water to close the pores once you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> If you soften the skin and work through the pain you could be in business to get a few of those awful blackheads that are driving you crazy!</li>
            <li> , i received my order on the day promised but the bad part is i did not receive the size of tool i asked for</li>
            <li> Thankfully I dont have bad skin, but everyone has one or two blackheads they want to extract.</li>
            <li> I am someone with moderately bad acne</li>
            <li> But it turned out it&#x27;s not as painful as I thought.</li>
            <li> Can be quite painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to figure out some way to get it off, because it&#x27;s ugly to look at.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite painful when I use it for areas like cheek and chin for blackheads.</li>
            <li> I was sick of pinching them with my fingers to remove all the gunk.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this years ago instead of using my nails. :(</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed that it included no instructions.</li>
            <li> While it is painful and bad for your skin to use this, and causes peeling it does get rid of blackheads!</li>
            <li> but you hate scaring get this</li>
            <li> the pore must have been blocked for a while because all the gunk that came out of it,i was shocked!</li>
            <li> I have the tendency to pop all my pimples and I leave them in very bad condition and scar my face.</li>
            <li> Painful!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work. just hurts</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described. No problems. I would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> Not as professional as I thought it&#x27;d be.  The loops, while metal, are kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me. It&#x27;s hard, and not particularly good at pimple extraction</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t know how to use it -- or if it doesn&#x27;t work.  I steam my face, get all up in there and ready to clean some pores -- put the wand thing over a clogged pore -- push -- and.... nothing.  Nothing happens.  I&#x27;ve tried the big side and the small side, on all kinds of pores -- and nothing happens.  Oh well, at least it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find this particularly useful or effective.</li>
            <li> love it!  my sister told me about it.  love it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!! I have pale skin, and wanted something to remove blackhead because when I do it on my own I always feel like I am doing more damage to my skin with all the tugging.  It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin and is easy to keep clean. My boyfriend has even started using this before he showers.</li>
            <li> Very good product, as it was reviewed. I wish I had ordered these two orders ago.  Professional feel, great quality, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Product is good quality and works well. Shipping took longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used blackhead strips and after washing my face to open my pores this tool works pretty well possibly better than strips and is a lot cheaper. You&#x27;ll be amazed how much dirt is in your pores, for me it only works well on my nose. But still a good product.</li>
            <li> Works just as I expected it to! VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE, ESPECIALLY FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE! Great buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really working. The remover is pretty strong to work. This is exactly what I want and I&#x27;m so satisfied. :)</li>
            <li> It is much larger in size than I thought. It is almost 5\\&quot; total length with a three quarter inch large flat end and a half inch small hooked end. I remember my dermatologist used a small hooked spoon, but it was much smaller, rounder and thicker. I cannot figure out how to use the small end, so I am using the large flat end so far. I know there is a certain way to use this tool, but I am trying to be safe and not damage my skin, so I can&#x27;t really say that it really removes blackheads completely. But it is better than just using your fingers, especially when you have long nails. It seems to be durable too.</li>
            <li> The blackhead loop is a little awkward. However, the white head loop is super super great. The handle is sturdy, and the loops are very secure. They are smooth and well rounded, leading to the least painful extraction you can get.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it works very well.  I wish it had more of a curve on it for easier blackhead extraction but even with that said I still give it 5 stars, what it lacks in ease it more than makes up for in quality.  It is made very well, the reason I bought this item is my other one broke and I can tell by the way this one is made that its probably going to be the last one I&#x27;d have to buy.  Would definitely recommend this to a friend or anyone for that matter.</li>
            <li> Removes whiteheads too.  Does not leave any marks on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Does just what it is expected to do.  Very sturdy, and well made.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> idk this product is working well or not. cuz this one is not working for my face</li>
            <li> Thought more round at the tips like at a dermatologist office tool.  This isn&#x27;t useful at all.  Dislike. Wastes money spent.</li>
            <li> This works great.  Gets out all of the pesky blackheads and cleans out all of my clogged pores.  So much more hygienic than using your fingers and with no pain.</li>
            <li> My girl bought one of these from the mall for like $40. This is a nice version of what she got but way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, especially for the price. I have not used any other of this type of product before so I cannot say for sure. I did remove most of my blackheads with pure tea-tree oil and this hemmed with the rest</li>
            <li> My son is very happy with this excellent product  really work  thank you</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Seller shipped promptly, and we received the correct item.</li>
            <li> This item was reasonably priced.  Also, it did the job.  I was using it for a skin tag and I got rid of it.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works as you would expect. Love it</li>
            <li> This product is sturdier than I thought it would be, considering how inexpensive it is.  I ordered as a gift, so I can&#x27;t comment on effectiveness, but it looks like it will work as promised.</li>
            <li> Works well! Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Good quality and great price!</li>
            <li> Tool works as advertised. I have used it several times and it works very well. Easy to use also.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, is just as described and expectation, no surprises. Shipping and handling was as good as it gets, no issues whatsoever. Highly Recommended for any1 who needs this !!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok to use, does not make it as easy as I thought, i guess.&lt;br /&gt;but if you use it after a  hot bath, when the face is well moist and the pores are open, works nicely</li>
            <li> Not sure how to use it even when the order arrived. Suprisingly, once I picked up this thingy, things became sort of easy --- just pushing one end against your blackhead area. So far I&#x27;ve used it twice, and it works great. Based on few reviews that I read before placing the order, I thought it needs really large pressure for it to work. But it turned out it&#x27;s not as painful as I thought.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was after for cheap!</li>
            <li> This product works ALRIGHT. Like many people hope for are some sort of instructions on how to use it, and which side to use for what kind of pimples/blackheads. I removed a star for not including any form or instructions on this product. Even a little paper of simple instructions would help people out. I removed another star because I ordered TWO, one came in perfect condition, the other one had an end that wiggled. It is the thin wire end, not the flat end. The wire end that is mainly used wiggles back and forth, making me feel unsafe using this one as it seems like it may break and I might slip and stab myself. I understand some products get faulty, but this product seems very simple to make and have such basic parts that there shouldn&#x27;t be a wiggly end. Otherwise it&#x27;s an alright product, gets an OK amount of blackheads and pimples out, but use it carefully!</li>
            <li> The item is in good quality, comes with a small porch, and the price is right. Shipping a quite slow, so if you need it for immediate use better to buy it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well. Makes it super easy but my 15 yr old son says it hurts too bad.</li>
            <li> It popped a few zits and squeezed out a few blackheads.</li>
            <li> Great! Very good quality, and arrived fast. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> It was perfect the way I wanted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
            <li> I got this because my docor suggested I could remove milia.  It did not work for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Item and delivery were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> it removed all my blackheads, but worked too well and it popped my skull out of my head. Now i have no skull.</li>
            <li> These things are really quite rough on your face.. They work well for places you cant get to with your fingers, but honestly, I prefer using my nails!! This left painful bruises on my nose but I also have sensitive skin! I do use it for the sides of my nose still though</li>
            <li> small and compact&lt;br /&gt;the two ends were strong and not flimsy like the rest out there&lt;br /&gt;did the job&lt;br /&gt;its strong and durable to fight deep acne too</li>
            <li> Best product on the market to remove those unwanted black heads. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does its job as specified a great blackhead remover. If you don&#x27;t know how to use this tool then I do not recommend you purchasing it. Do not push so hard cause it can cause bruising.</li>
            <li> Simple tool that works great.</li>
            <li> This product works well and seems to be of good quality. I feel like the metal ring is sturdy and well made. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> It works effectively, effectively with blackheads on the nose. But it does hurt a bit. I hope this would be more hygienic than finger tips.</li>
            <li> Loops are a lot bigger than I expected.  I wanted something for very small, difficult to deal with clogged pores.  This tool has big loops.  It was good quality and would be good for big blackheads.  The description should mention the loop size.</li>
            <li> The holes are  little bigger then expected,  but it works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience using this kind of tool so all I have to compare it to is my fingernails. I was disappointed that I paid almost $5 for it on Amazon and my local Walmart sold one just like it for about $2.</li>
            <li> This comes in very handy when you have stubborn whiteheads or blackheads.</li>
            <li> This was much nicer than I was expecting, solid stainless steel. No wiggle at the ends. Ships from US! Thank you, excellent product :)&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I ordered a couple other aesthetician tools from a different seller and I&#x27;m still waiting on those to come from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Better than expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but so far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. I&#x27;ve had more luck with getting rid of whiteheads than with blackheads, but I haven&#x27;t had myself a \\&quot;spa\\&quot; day to really try it out. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m quite happy with it so far. It&#x27;s a good product to own if you suffer from acne like I do. Any little bit helps!</li>
            <li> Heavy tool. A bit frustrating to work with; just ended up with bruised and red marks all over my face and no pimples/blackheads affected. Very painful to use, but beauty is pain, right?</li>
            <li> Great tool and was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> A good product with great customer service. My first order didn&#x27;t come in so another was sent right away. The tool does take a good amount of pressure but it is less likely to break skin than if you were to use your hands. It&#x27;s more about angle/placement than force with this bad boy.</li>
            <li> Useless. This did not help my blackheads in the least little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product! It makes getting black heads and visible white heads out easily. If you have a zit that doesn&#x27;t have a clear Whitehead or blackhead, then this won&#x27;t work and you&#x27;ll hurt yourself more than anything.</li>
            <li> Have had this for a few months and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It dose the job very well!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think the heads were well shaped. I&#x27;d get the circular headed ones if I bought again.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Helps me clean my pores thoroughly, more than what I could ever do with my fingers. Its much more precise and hygienic. Totally recommend it. Plus the quality of the material of the remover is quite good!!</li>
            <li> If you remember back to your teens when you were told not to squeeze zits and blackheads, this tool could have been a handy solution. I tried all the potions, lotions, vitamins, and diets, but I still had greasy skin prone to pimples and blackheads. Thank heavens I didn&#x27;t scar. A tool like this would have come in handy back then. Now, I have found that this tool is quite effective at removing troubling blemishes. Before I looked on Amazon for a product, I checked out YouTube for methods. This and the round, spoon-like tool with a whole in the bottom to fit over the blemish were the methods of choice. The problem with the videos I watched was that a professional was recommended for the task. As an avid DIYer, I did it myself with the Utopia product. It worked well; I recommend it. Can it handle something big -- like a boil -- I doubt it; I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to try. However, this is an attractive, well-made tool that is eminently suited to the task. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Have no idea how this is supposed to work</li>
            <li> not strong enough and the heads bent easily.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but after using it the first time it was a lot easier to remove &amp; extract blemishes than using my fingernails. I recommend leaving a small warm towel on the face to loosen up the pores/skin before extracting. Fast shipping &amp; got it sooner than expected. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson, I have one and when he comes to my house he always uses it so I bought him one, and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, great value for the price and shipped immediately.</li>
            <li> This tool works much better than your big fingers especially for hard to reach areas like next to your nose.  Even with hard pushing, the item holds up well.  It also arrived fairly quick</li>
            <li> Does the job. No frills. Worth the few bucks!!</li>
            <li> works great, it pops the tough pimpled under the skin. be sure to only use it if you know you can pop it. or it will damage your skin. keep it clean with alcohol between use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but needs more pressure then expected. Overall a nice tool to have when dealing with problem skin and keeps the area clean and sanitized without hurting the area</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos on how to use this. And I did it quite right. But, it doesn&#x27;t get the pimple or blackheads all the way. Disappointed really</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I was afraid that it would not be effective. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised! It is a great quality product! Very good  construction and not flimsy at all. It&#x27;s very sturdy and feels like it will last a long time. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times already and it has really helped me with some of my blemishes. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have never owned a blemish tool before purchasing this tool.  It is a high quality tool. I have found the more unruly your blemish is the better the tool works. The flat side works best on my blackheads. It has a good feel in the hand as far as control goes.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old-fashioned method.  Save your money.  Here are the final words required by Amazon.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and my boyfriend says it is less painful than fingers so that&#x27;s nice. I still like to use my fingers but if this is around for stubborn ones it is great. I think with practice it will be better, just have to figure it out more. I really like the bigger end for bigger harder pimples to pop. Either way it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> This thing Works great!!! Gets the job done and Does not leave red marks behind. I love it and wild highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The extracting tool works like advertised and looks to be sturdy enough to get the job done. So far I haven&#x27;t had any bruising or broken skin, despite pushing on it really hard. Having the dual ends is beneficial, although I mostly use the rounded tip instead of the flat one. My reason for only four stars is the packaging - the plastic holder is too flimsy for long-term storage (and likely not the most hygienic) and the tool had broken through one end during shipping. I need to find a better way to store it to keep it clean between uses, but it looks like I&#x27;ll keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Its ok. A lil rough. But good size...</li>
            <li> Just as described and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> works, ok, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfy with my purches thank you for your help I will recommend it to any one and also the seller really professional help me with all my needs and question 100% 👍👍</li>
            <li> kind of painful to use , not really for someone whonever used it before</li>
            <li> This thing actually works! You can even extract sebum (ew) from the tiniest of white heads, preventing big ugly breakouts.</li>
            <li> Prompt and clean. Thanks :)this product will save my marriage, naw jk but it is really fun to watch how easily this gets rid of zits!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Bought it for my adolescent brother and his face looks very clear now with most blackheads gone.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t live your life without one of these. The long flat loop side is pretty useless in my experience, but the other side of the tool works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because like a lot of people, I usually pop my pimples. This is easy to use and keeps from getting even more bacteria on your face, which you can get when using your fingernails. I like to rinse it off with alcohol when I&#x27;m finished using it. You will notice if the pimple isn&#x27;t quite ready to pop, this device will leave a temporary mark on your face. Other than that, it seems to work well. If at first you don&#x27;t succeed in popping your pimple, give it a few days &amp; try, try again!</li>
            <li> The tool is great.  Received fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the pimple extractor to remove blackhead and the product works really well.  My family member had used another extractor but it didn&#x27;t work...or it work a little but not really (the extractors from the drugstore). But she was amazed at how well the product worked and wanted to know where to order it.  Overall, the products is good but sometimes a bit harsh for my face.</li>
            <li> facial use was good.  my boyfriend tried to use on my back and he didn&#x27;t like it LOL I found it was good for me to use on my face/ nothing else worked as well</li>
            <li> It works very well for whiteheads and blackheads. Be careful if you misuse this tool you will create marks on your skin.</li>
            <li> got the job done for sure, it was painful though</li>
            <li> Very disapointed with this.&lt;br /&gt;Used only a few times and the loops began to bend and wouldn&#x27;t hold pressure to extract anything after awhile one of the loops completely broke off the tool making it totally useless.</li>
            <li> This is easy to hold onto even with lotion on your hands. The best Sebaceous Cyst etc. remover I have ever seen or had, and I am 73. But the listing of Stainless Steel is why I bought it. And I just ordered a 2nd one for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the seller or quality;however, I got this for my black heads and I can&#x27;t seen to get it to work for that purpose. The product itself is a good item, but useless for the purpose it is sold for. I would use the sellers again, but I dont think I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> the product i recieved was made with  high quality stainless steel works great ! i STRONGLY recommend this product !</li>
            <li> This is just like the tool that my dermatologist used. I use it for my blackheads and pimples. Works great and is super cheap. Saved me from going to my dermatologist and it works better than those pore strips.</li>
            <li> Works great and comes with case to hold it in so it doesn&#x27;t get dirty. Only down side is, it does hurt to use :/ but you can definitly get out most of your nose black heads.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions. Found that it&#x27;s easier to remove blackheads with Clearasil products.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product to arrive (multiple black heads) I read on one review that it came with instructions, unfortunately mine did not. I watched a couple videos on youtube though, then tried it out. None of it worked.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase the only thing I would say bad is that it does not come with any instructions and it has two different ends so I wasn&#x27;t real sure how to use it but I think I have it figured out for the most part and it seems to work good</li>
            <li> The remover tool arrived exactly as described and is the same blemish tool from another brand I purchased at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I like this product it works how it suppose to be meant for. Im tired of all these fake comments so let me be honest. The only bad thing is the shipping it took forever to get to my house 2 weeks thats it. Everything good besides shipping so 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t you know it? I order this thing and haven&#x27;t had a blackhead/blemish since getting it.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem sturdy though and the shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the item as well.</li>
            <li> The flat end is much practical for usage as opposed to the rounder end, it&#x27;s too bulky to actually &#x27;squeeze&#x27; anything out. Just using the flat end as scraper works fine, you don&#x27;t have put the zit or whatever in the loop to pop it. gross I know but c&#x27;mon what ARE you buying this thing for?</li>
            <li> Yeah, like the title says, you bust this sleek piece of medical equipment out that black head will literally jump out of your skin thinking its a party.</li>
            <li> This extractor does the job of what the same item from Sephora or Ulta does at over 50% less cost. Have used it just a few times (thinner end only)on stubborn whiteheads and has held up so far. It&#x27;s a simple, well-made product that is much more inexpensive than the competition, and does a fine job for a relatively simple (but oh so painful) task.</li>
            <li> Just as describe .. The tool is of good material , it was challenge to use it at first , but a few YouTube videos on how to it did help .</li>
            <li> And Im not sure if it is this one in particular, or if it is blackhead removers in general.&lt;br /&gt;But no matter how hard I push, nothing comes out. I tried it maybe 5 or 6 times, even after a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I would recommend using your fingers, The metal feels like its jamming through your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with these things not holding up well, &amp; while it&#x27;s only been a limited amount of time I&#x27;ve had this particular product, so far it appears to be doing  well.  It certainly arrived quickly, was reasonably priced, &amp; was well protected by its packaging.  Now I just need to see if it lasts more than a few months before the wire loop, almost mysteriously, seems to just fall apart!</li>
            <li> Was shipped fast works great</li>
            <li> Very good at getting blemishes.  Not so good at getting the little gunk out of pores or &#x27;comedomes&#x27; though.</li>
            <li> Fine well made product. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery.intact and on time. Product as expected. ExActly what I wanted...and what I needed for school...i am training to be an esthetician.....thanQ</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he likes it. I think it was a great value and also has free shipping.</li>
            <li> Everything came without a problem! I like to use this tool after I&#x27;ve already washed my face. It&#x27;s good to open your pores with warm water before you try to use it. You get better results that way. There was no problems with shipping, so everything is all good. It&#x27;s a cool, nifty tool.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few weeks now on both myself and my husband. Works great, does a good job of getting out pesky blackheads and pimples. Works better if the skin was recently warmed and softened under a hot towel.</li>
            <li> OK.  This is going to sound gross.  So, I bought this for my teenage kids.  But any gadget is a source of interest in our house.  My daughter tried just putting one of the loops around a zit and pressing and . . . nothing.  My son tried just pressing and had limited success.  But my creative son started putting the loop around and sort of pressing/pulling.  Let&#x27;s see, he said he would maintain downward pressure and then sort of pull the loop toward (and under?) the zit.  It worked!!!  Well, we all had to experiment with this.  The result is, if the zit is ready to pop, this will work great!  If it has a hard top, it works sometimes.  But if the darn zit is not ready, you can poke and prod all you want an nothing will happen.</li>
            <li> i was using the wire loop end and it snapped off. the metal gouged my skin.</li>
            <li> Great tool. Great price. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or it will mark your face. Push gently many times and change position.</li>
            <li> Does the job it says it will do. Great quality tool, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap while using it. Would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Feels good and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I am a physician and as a student I worked in a dermatologists office and this tool is very similar to what the dr. used to remove blackheads etc. It is good quality steel and if you know how to use it you will get good results, just youtube it and you will be happy with this product</li>
            <li> Not a miracle worker, but I did see improvement. For the price, this product is good and will handle most blackheads, though not all.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to, love it. Stop using your hands and get this tool. It saves my face.</li>
            <li> Heavy medical grade stainless steel with a non slip grip it comes in a handy plastic sleave so you can always find it and shipping was right on time. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Takes quite a while getting used to how to use it. Can be quite painful. But clears up black heads, and no need to fiddle around with strips that always seem to miss certain places.</li>
            <li> As long as you understand how to use this tool and what it does, it works just well.  These types of tools do hurt to use.</li>
            <li> not exactly what i was expecting and its pretty painful to use at time because of the pressure needed to use it and it has cause my skin to peel around the area i used it on my nose.</li>
            <li> I was simply looking for best price with most favorable reviews and am suprised at how well this little thing works. It is very durable and sturdy and comes in its own slip-in closable  carrier (convenient for travel). Works well on freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li> Works great! Watch some youtube videos that show how to use it. It also helps if the area has had a hot rag over it to loosen it up.</li>
            <li> I just got the Blackhead Remover, and it works just fine for removing blackheads and small pimples. However, I got it wet and I guess I didn&#x27;t dry it completely before I put it back into it&#x27;s plastic it did. I noticed rust on it the next day. I would have never expected that to happen so quickly, but whatever. I&#x27;ll try to figure out some way to get it off, because it&#x27;s ugly to look at. I bought this one because it was one of the cheapest, so I got what I paid for. If you are shopping around for a Blackhead Remover, you might want to spend a little more for quality.</li>
            <li> I like this very much. It does what it is suppose to do and is well made. It&#x27;s a good price too.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the quality of the Blackhead/Pimple Blemish Remover Tool.  It is compareable to a tool bought from the beauty supply store. It arrived very promptly and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> it is not working.&lt;br /&gt;i would spend 100 go to massage spa to do it .  plz do not buy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know how to use it @ 1st. I had to go on YouTube to find instructions. Then I put it to use &amp; didn&#x27;t get the easy results I&#x27;ve seen it have when other&#x27;s use it. So I can&#x27;t say the problem was me or the tool. :-/</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well.</li>
            <li> user friendly, totally worth every penny plus some! easy to use and not sure how i hadnt had one in my life before!</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I expected this product to easily extract my black heads without scarring.  This is true for the T zone but didn&#x27;t hold true for the fatty areas of the face, like the cheeks, or for deep seated blackheads. The search continues....</li>
            <li> Amazing...it worked the first time my wife used it on the back of my neck. I had a big one I thought I would have to go to the Dr. but this tool took it right out!  All these years I never knew there were tools for this problem.</li>
            <li> I like it. It works like a tool that a liscenced dermatolagist would use. much better than any other cheap one bought from a store</li>
            <li> Definitely a good tool to have in one&#x27;s arsenal against acne. Easily extracts blackheads and whiteheads, which ultimately shortens the amount of time they stay on your face. It does typically leave the area a little red obviously, so it&#x27;s ideal to use this tool at night rather than in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased overall, great price too. I wish I had it years ago.</li>
            <li> Great buy!!! Fast shipping and great price!!! and it works so good!!! Totally recommend!!!☺</li>
            <li> A curious little tool that does often help!</li>
            <li> This simply didn&#x27;t work for me.  But maybe it does for other people?</li>
            <li> I love this product and will using it for a long time.  I have stubborn blackheads around my nose and a few on my cheeks/forehead.  This works  so much better than using your fingers to pop them.  It doesn&#x27;t leave red marks, your skin recovers faster from this.  It&#x27;s allowed me to get some of the ones I&#x27;ve never been able to before. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you have pimples and you like to pop them but you hate scaring get this it want scare your face</li>
            <li> I occasionally still get a blackhead or two. Pinching with fingernails is not a good idea.  This uses surprisingly little pressure to get the job done.  Nearly painless.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I guess my pores are too small for this too work. I bet it works on some people, but haven&#x27;t been able to make it work for me. It just gives me horseshoe shaped marks on my face that people laugh at.</li>
            <li> Very we&#x27;ll made. Awesome grip handle. Pimples don&#x27;t stand a chance. Blackhead removal is a breeze with this tool. I live this tool</li>
            <li> Did not like this.  Thought it may damage my skin.  Consider that while making the purchase.  Good luck to you with this.</li>
            <li> Good grip, but the ends are very sharp. It cut my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product on a great price!!! Cleared out my face just as any other. Would buy again. Love it!!!! Works great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!!!!</li>
            <li> The tool was easy to use and alleviated the redness once you extract the pimple. It didn&#x27;t seem to hurt either.</li>
            <li> I have a face with full of blackhead, and this one help me a lot. You should attach something hot to blackhead area before to take out blackhead. In addition, just only use it to remove blackhead</li>
            <li> works good push down and blackheads come out. its great for the price!!! i would buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use to pop all the white heads when they showed up. But this thing just leaves these marks from me pushing to hard into my face. So I have this weird oval shape that is all red. To be completely honest I think I&#x27;ve got 1 whitehead with this tool. And I&#x27;ve tried on many. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong as the other reviews seem to be good. But I don&#x27;t see myself using it in the future. Which is really too bad because I was very excited about this product.</li>
            <li> Well i was looking forward for the tool and the reviews convinced me to buy this, i received my order on the day promised but the bad part is i did not receive the size of tool i asked for and now i Have to wait to get a response from seller so i can return this and receive what i asked for, so i will not rate the product until im actually able to use what i ordered, but it is a nice weight and seems easy to use</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hold out much faith that this stubborn blackhead would be removed, but it was.  My only wish was that it came with some type of instruction but a internet search showed me what to do.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to have this tool handy. Especially teenagers.  It gets those tricky blackheads near the nose and chin as well.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the blackhead remover! Didn&#x27;t know how such a thing could remove blackheads, but first time I used it, I was so surprised!!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at first, but I kept trying it different ways. Once you get the technique down on how to extract pimples, it works well. I like to lance the pimples first, but do that at your own discretion..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who&#x27;s starting to get acne.  He has a lot of blackheads around his nose and on his chin.  I tried it on myself first and found it somewhat painful, even using it after showering, but works great.  I would recommend it to get rid of those pesky pimples.</li>
            <li> I feel badly about this comment; unfortunately, it does not work for me.  No matter which end I use or how hard I press, I have gotten no results.</li>
            <li> Bot it for me, but the wife loves it</li>
            <li> item was completely as pictured and described.  it is sturdy, does not bend like other flimsey brands i&#x27;ve had.  5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Not much to say...works well for getting rid of those occasional blackheads and whiteheads...Does the trick.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its small, portable and sturdy and does its job well. Worth the few dollars it costs. It&#x27;s not much but cleanly gets the acne out.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but works great!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really worked for me but I will still keep it and continue trying to get it to work. Good price.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and seems well-made. However, I still have not been able to make it work when I need to. There is the caveat that I have disability in my hands. If one has learned all ready how to use one of these, it will probably work. But three stars for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> product works really well.  extracts the um....  gross  stuff  without scaring up your face as much as doing it with your fingers..  less germ-y.  wish it had come with  something  instructional.  works great on my bfs  ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Works how it should great price , and you get a pack of two it&#x27;s a great tool for removing unwanted pimples</li>
            <li> I can achieve the same effect with a bobby pin for 2 cents. I would not recommend. There are other brands of comedone/blackhead extractors that work much better. Guess you get what you pay for here. Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT, SHIPPED FAST AND DID NOT COST A LOT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well. First product of this kind that I have tried and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast- exactly as pictured. Works beautifully. The dual sides are really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews saying these tools made them bleed. That should really never be the case and never happened to me. Definitely disregard those- they had to be pushing incredibly hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out! I love mine!</li>
            <li> I use it for the pores on my nose. I suggest that you only use this once a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool because I saw my friend use it, and I am so happy I did. It works really well in removing pimples and blackheads with out too much pain or strain. It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my face like when I use my fingers to remove acne, and its super easy to clean with a little alcohol and a napkin.</li>
            <li> I received it earlier than Amazon said I would. It is quite stable. I will say there isn&#x27;t any instructions, but you can easily find out how to use the tool/tools on YouTube. There isn&#x27;t a thing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> This is made of stainless steel, so it&#x27;s sturdy and seems durable. I have had it a couple weeks and it works great.. It has a rounded side and a flat side, with good grip.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of blackheads  And I was looking for this one a long time ago thank goodness amazon has it. This is exactly the one my dermatologist is using in removing my blackheads, whiteheads (facial cleaning). Steam your face before using it so that it will easily remove all the dirt in your face without too much pain. I love it and highly recommend Blemish Remover.</li>
            <li> Took a little practice to get the hang of, but with practice and a lot of you tube vids...lol..worked great!!&lt;br /&gt;It worked best for me after a nice steamy shower. Leave your face a little damp and presto!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast...expected a week as I ordered the weekend before a holiday...got it the day after the holiday.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitly order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Works just like those on YouTube!  Works on those harder to reach blackheads on my upper back.  Great little tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use and we are VERY pleased. Quick shipping and the actual tool is really good quality. I&#x27;d advise any buyer to watch some youtube videos that will show you tips and the proper way to use it. But one you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever did without it! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Really good product, good quality. Fast and clean. It&#x27;s not painful and doesn&#x27;t leave marks. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for an extracting tool, since my previous one finally broke (I might be just a little over-zealous). Price was an important factor, since I don&#x27;t want to wind up spending more than I have to on something that may or may not last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $4.99, and with an average review rating of 4 and a half stars, I decided upon this one by Utopia Care. At no surprise, it is pure stainless steel --- I can leave my worries behind regarding rust and any other attributes that come with lesser quality cheap metals. The extracting ends seem to be well built. I trust that they will hold up for quite some time before they (inevitably?) bend, snap and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; this tool is. Also, its extracting ends are nearly perfectly shaped. I say nearly, because my previous extractor seemed to perform a tad bit better --- which is the reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this extracting tool to anyone who is in need of one. It will most likely fulfill your needs. And for the quality and price, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I recently had a bunch of clogged pores from leaving makeup on too long. This product did a great job at helping fight the resulting blackheads. Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> II had high hopes for this tool but it&#x27;s not nearly as productive as I had hoped.  Overall the product seems well made, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I initially wanted an extractor because using my fingers/fingernails was too damaging on my skin. I had tried a nice one that worked great, but was a little expensive at $15. I wanted the same quality at a lower price, and this product fits the bill! I use the short end all the time to remove blackheads, and it&#x27;s generally successful! I&#x27;ll be honest in that I don&#x27;t find much use for the long flat end, but the short, angled end usually works for me so it&#x27;s not much of a problem. The smooth, curved edges are fairly gentle on the skin and don&#x27;t rough it up like my fingernails did, so it solves that problem! The shipping was also pretty quick, which was surprising since they offer it for free. Overall, it&#x27;s a great value for the money and quick shipping, so I would definitely recommend this product! My only issue is that I wish the other side was more useful.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes it would duplicate what my Esthetician can do for me. Wrong! Thankfully I dont have bad skin, but everyone has one or two blackheads they want to extract. I tried using this right after a shower, since that steams your face and makes it easier to extract anything within your pores. I did not have much luck with this product and maybe I am not a good example for this tool. All I know is it did nothing and hurts using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing.....it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> It is a really good remover!!! Helps a lot! Very easy to use  and clean. Good to use after shower when pores are open. I am happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Its a must have. The day i got it , i have to try it right away and it does the job really good, It took my husband nasty black heads .</li>
            <li> I have a problem with clogged pores. I was sick of pinching them with my fingers to remove all the gunk. This tool combined with some good face wash does a great job.</li>
            <li> Works great, wish I didn&#x27;t have to use it.</li>
            <li> perfect. literally no flaws.</li>
            <li> I just started using it but, it works but still observing. I like the fact that it&#x27;s so small and easy to use</li>
            <li> The product is good maybe im not steaming my face long enough. Its still hard but not blemish when using it so far</li>
            <li> This product works for blackheads that are not deep in the skin and are fairly new. For older blackheads which may have been in the skin a while or are deeper in the skin, this product does not work because you have to push it into the skin very hard and it leaves red marks on the skin which take a few days to fade away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing almost everyday since we bought it and I love it. You DO have to push hard, but you also have to push hard when you use your fingers. At least using this utensil I can eliminate scarring my face. I do gotta say though recently it&#x27;s been making my face peel from where I&#x27;ve drug it across my skin. I don&#x27;t think this is normal, but I also chemically peel my face sometimes, although, I don&#x27;t use the blackhead remover before or after my chemical peels. This is not your best option for big pimples, but it&#x27;s great for those tiny a-hole pimples and blackheads for sure!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it&#x27;s suppose to. If you love r/popping, perfect product for you. Cheap, would buy again. Good</li>
            <li> Makes getting ingrown hairs and popping pimples easy. Nice product.</li>
            <li> this is a fine tool if your blackheads are very very large.  This tool is just too big for a regular size blackhead.  Perhaps I got the wrong thing but this was just too big to be useful.</li>
            <li> Tried it. It got some black heads I have been trying for the longest time. Need a little patience to learn how to use it but once you get it, its great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really extract that well, it does leave a pretty large indent in my face. If I could go back, I&#x27;d spend a little more money and get something that is of a better quality.</li>
            <li> ...and great quality &amp; value. Definitely recommend this one for home facials/extraction!&lt;br /&gt;Probably best if you gently clean &amp; steam your face before using this tool.</li>
            <li> This small tool is very important. My physiotherapy doctor told me before not to use my fingers to squeeze black heads because they get infected, and it is true, every time I squeeze them they get infected if the black head doesn&#x27;t come out!&lt;br /&gt;this is why i purchased this tool, i tried it to squeeze a blackhead and it didn&#x27;t take a long time (as it used to do) to get it out , then i cleaned the area with sterile, very good tool.</li>
            <li> great price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Metal pieces too thick to get close enough to the area.  Total waste of money, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, just add a bit of water to make paste.  Super at lifting oil, better yet it is all-natural, too.  Can use it frequently, b/c no strong odors.  The price helped a lot, and it will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted. a small blackhead remover. i used to have one similar but it was too big, this one is small and fits into my lil make up pouch perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works to take out pimples.  It is sturdy but not bulky, does just what we needed.</li>
            <li> Product works! No complaints!</li>
            <li> A gentle tool that is a favorite for extraction. The description speak of the product that I received. The shipping was fast and I am enjoying the use of my comodone extractor. Thank you Utopia.&lt;br /&gt; Denise Rose&lt;br /&gt;Ceo&lt;br /&gt;Serenity Spa</li>
            <li> It works, easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. Hurts more than I thought it would but it works well.</li>
            <li> This works great. I had a more expensive brand that worked well, but finally broke. This was an excellent replacement for it.</li>
            <li> Working great without any permanent marks or the pain that would normally come from using fingernails.</li>
            <li> works great. I was impressed with the weight and quality of this tool for the price. It is a very nice.</li>
            <li> We received the remover and went to work right away! This tool is awesome! Highly recommend for the stubborn spots.</li>
            <li> While it is painful and bad for your skin to use this, and causes peeling it does get rid of blackheads! Definitely a good tool to have in the toolbox.</li>
            <li> The product feels like it is sturdy and will last a long time. It works wonderfully, and you can&#x27;t beat the price! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I purchased from Utopia Care and received it in 2 days with free shipping!)</li>
            <li> This s*** was a waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Thank God it wasn&#x27;t like $10 I wud have been pissed</li>
            <li> seems like it work very well for pimples and/or larger blackheads but it does not work very well for small blemishes and/or sebaceous filaments.</li>
            <li> It was delivered days before the estimated date it wouldve arrived so that was a surprise.It works just as well as it states just have to gently use it so you don&#x27;t have marks in your face.im quite happy to have it</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for another brand (unknown) i had lost. this one seems to &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; my skin more easily and leaves some debris in my pores. basically it damages my skin. wish I could find the one I had as it seemed to roll more smoothly over my skin and dramatically removed pore grime.</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery</li>
            <li> STOP ASKING ME TO RATE THIS THROUGH MULTIPLE EMAILS. IT&#x27;S GREAT. Dx</li>
            <li> This tool is okay, I like how it can extract whiteheads around my nose but it&#x27;s quite painful when I use it for areas like cheek and chin for blackheads. This is also my first tool and probably I can learn more in using this - probably I need to warm up my face even more. Usually I only wash my face with warm water and then I use this. I would probably need to warm it up more.&lt;br /&gt;This tool does its job.</li>
            <li> Works great! If you have never used one before I suggest watching a video on youtube</li>
            <li> Received in good time. Very well-made, professional instrument. I&#x27;ve not had time to use it yet, but hope to be an expert soon!</li>
            <li> Works fairly well.  Not as effective on smaller whiteheads, but does work on larger ones.</li>
            <li> Works as needed. It does help to steam your face in the shower first.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be useless because of all the great reviews, but it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face, used a scrub to soften my face, steamed my face and tried this decide this way and all it did was leave red marks on my face. I am dissapointed as I wanted it to work on the whiteheads I have on my face and neck. I know it says blackhead remover but lots of people spoke on it working on whiteheads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone who has used it can offer suggestions on how to use it effectively I would appreciate it - otherwise, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son. He is obsessed with it. That&#x27;s a good thing. He is one satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> As expected,  fast shipping,  thanks !!!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Wish I had discovered this years ago</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my tweener Son who is getting alot of blackheads in his ears.  It does the job quickly and without any pain.  I recommend this product as an inexpensive solution to a common problem.</li>
            <li> Just an amazingly effective little gadget. It&#x27;s high quality, like a surgical instrument.  Thought it was kinda funny it came with absolutely no instructions. You&#x27;ll figure it out.  Steam your face first...this little thing is magical.  I feel shamefully un-informed not knowing before now this existed.  JK.  :-)</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if it had come with instructions so I did not have to use my husband as a Guinea pig. Who am I kidding... that was the best part!  Works as expected but seriously, it would have been nice to have some type of directions with it...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work but my husband had a blackhead on the back of his neck that had been staring at me for too long. After looking at other reviews, we put a hot wet washcloth on the area for a short time and then used the tool, the blackhead came out no problem.  Yay!!!</li>
            <li> This product is super amazing! If anyone out there who can&#x27;t resist popping your pimples this will be your solution. I have the tendency to pop all my pimples and I leave them in very bad condition and scar my face. With this product you easily just poke your pimple with a needle( all it takes is one poke and it doesn&#x27;t have to be deep) and then just use the loop side and press against your face and it comes out super easy! I think this product is so awesome because it doesn&#x27;t leave any scars and it&#x27;s not frustrating because the pimple come out so easily. So I really recommend this product if any of you have a problem with popping pimples. Oh and the flat side takes off blackheads very good as well. All you do is scrap against your skin that has blackheads.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work pretty well as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t leave any bruises on your face like using your fingernails does.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.  Maybe I did not use it properly.  It appears to be made sturdily and does not appear cheap.</li>
            <li> Awesome item. Works as intended. I definitely recommend. My nose has never looked better after using this product. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and use. the quality looks good. if you use it in the right way, it won&#x27;t hurt you. Really recommend using it after shower.</li>
            <li> The blackhead remover worked as advertised. It arrived without instructions, so I watched a video on YouTube that showed how to use it properly. Works great.</li>
            <li> So i wanted this tool to help with taking care of my skin and i dont know why but i was unable to find it at Walmart or Target, the store reps said they didnt know if it was discontinued or not. so i ordered it through Amazon, it came right when they said it will, and so far i have loved it!!! i was starting to develop a tiny cyst like zit on my forehead and after a warm bath (to open up the pores n soften the skin) i used this tool and OMG! the pore must have been blocked for a while because all the gunk that came out of it,i was shocked! the zit went away the next day and no marks left ( and i scar EASY)&lt;br /&gt;so i have been using it every few days after a shower and it i love it!!</li>
            <li> Works great, but use with caution. Don&#x27;t get carried away with popping pimples it can cause scaring.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  This product works great.  Helping keep my skin clear from blackheads.</li>
            <li> This tool didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin, there is a tool with a little circle, and an &amp;#34; eyehole&amp;#34; design that worked better.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right, but even so, I don&#x27;t like a product that requires so much research to figure out how to use. The flatter end is kind of sharp and scrapped my skin. It did scrap off the small white heads but ruined the skin around it. The other end didn&#x27;t really work either, too rounded I think. I would rather use my fingers after washing my heads. Faster and more effective.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty typical tool used ot extract blackheads and blemishes.  Worked great for me.  Pretty good quality. A</li>
            <li> It definitely has a learning curve and can result in some initial frustration. It really does help with popping those pimples, but by no means is the ultimate solution. It&#x27;s a solid product that I use often, most of the time after showers when your pores are open (I find this helps a lot).</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was exactly as described. It has a nice weight to it and seems almost indestructible. Does its job very well if you are using it correctly. I find best results after exfoliating and a hot shower. At that point the dead skin is gone and your pores are more accessible. There is no pain if you use the remover correctly. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Cleans pores very well</li>
            <li> Surprisingly amazing little gadget. I honestly never thought i&#x27;d would work, i was wrong. It&#x27;s really great and leaves no mark on face, just removes blemish.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it came with instructions</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple idea, but it&#x27;s really the only type of tool that works.</li>
            <li> Nifty little gadget for removing blackheads. It takes some practice to use but gets them out from deep down.</li>
            <li> Zits suck. Period. But this tool helps take the place of the normal &amp;#34;picking and squeezing&amp;#34; with your fingers or anything else you can find to extract them. I&#x27;d prefer if the tool was a little more sturdy but I would recommend it especially to teens to help prevent scarring. They are gonna &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; anyway so parents get one for your kid. It&#x27;s a zitty job but somebody&#x27;s gotta do it. Overall good product and good seller.</li>
            <li> Very nice tool to have for those stubborn zits and pimples that just won&#x27;t go away. Easily lifts out the acne from the pores with minimal pain and scarring.</li>
            <li> It works well as expected.</li>
            <li> absolutly love it best tool to get rid of those nasty white heads and doesnt scar like my fingers have causes. thank you i highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> this item gets the job done, I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t be too sure about since this does takes learning a method to work properly. I&#x27;ve used it thus far to get whiteheads out and it seems to work. advice, use hot to warm water on your face to open up the pores to easy extraction. The use cold water to close the pores once you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your nose and the oil generation rate, you may want to do this like every 4 days or so.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars if 1) directions came with the tool and 2) if the useless larger side had an opening much smaller than the other side. I did find a few youtube tutorials that demonstrated how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the low price I wondered about the quality of the workmanship but this  tool is very strong and well made and the loops on both sides are polished so there are no sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller end got a fair number of blackheads especially in hard to reach places like the sides of the nose. However, for some of my problem spots, I need a tool with a much smaller loop than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Get a medical quality lancet. I was not able to extract any whiteheads because I could not properly lance them even though I was using a new, sharp and very fine sewing needle. The whiteheads shifted with pressure from the sewing needle because it wasn&#x27;t sufficiently sharp and fine.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s a great product and the quality is very sturdy! I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly...worth the price, got most of my blackheads and whiteheads out. Try steaming your face before use, it will make it easier.</li>
            <li> Good for removing blackheads on my nose at home. I am not a cosmetologist but it works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> awsome product. love it and very addictive..</li>
            <li> Very professional tool. Wish it came with some instructions though as I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to use it..</li>
            <li> I bought this tools for my sons, and they seem to be happy with it...it does what it should and is easy to keep clean with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I purchased the double loop round tool - I have used it and it is easy to use and works! You do have to push pretty hard to get the &#x27;gunk&#x27; out but that&#x27;s to be expected as that&#x27;s what happens even during a professional facial. For the price this is a GREAT buy! The seller shipped this very fast as well!</li>
            <li> I guess i am used to using the Seki Edge Blackhead Remover by Seki Edge which i lost and should have just replaced it.  It takes too much digging to actually get the black head out when the seki edge remover pulled them out within the first try.</li>
            <li> excellent tool for getting at those hard to extract nuisances. excellent vendor and I recommend them wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> will return...not useful, does not work. I did receive in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Does the job it&#x27;s intended for! Very durable and compact and is great for small blackheads in those hard to reach areas!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from moderate-severe acne (at least in my opinion) for the last 6 months. By following a certain regimen and going all natural, I have really started to clear my face up. However, I still have whiteheads from time to time; I don&#x27;t really have blackheads so I can&#x27;t comment on this extractors effectiveness on that. One day while reading up on the subject, I came across an article mentioning these extractors. I have never been to a dermatologist, thus never really hearing about these things. Apparently these are used at dermatologists offices quite often to safely remove whiteheads and blackheads. (Pardon the image) Instead of using your fingers to pop a pimple, these extractors safely remove them and keep bacteria from spreading, something that happens when you use your fingers to pop a pimple. This specific brand was highly rated and also fairly priced, so I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it about 5-6 times and I think it does the job. I don&#x27;t think it hurts; definitely not worse then actually using your fingers to pop a pimple. I use the skinnier end to extract whiteheads- I feel the other side isn&#x27;t wide enough because the loop is too thick. All you do is place the whitehead inside the circular area and gently press down on your skin. Be sure to use alcohol to clean the extractor so it stays clean. I think using an extractor on an obvious whitehead is helpful because they are extremely difficult to cover up with makeup. I usually use this at night before going to bed, after I have steamed/cleansed my face. Sometimes it leaves a slightly small, red mark, other times it does not. I think it just depends on your skin and healing time. I use both green tea and aloe vera on my face to reduce redness and increase recovery time. Altogether, I think this is a neat little tool and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> did not work at all. I tried multiple ways and on other people and received no results.</li>
            <li> This little tool seems to do its job just fine. It will remove blackhead in a matter of seconds. I am glad I purchased this at a really good price from this seller here on amazon.</li>
            <li> This blackhead extractor works as well as the one for which I paid $11.97 (Tweezerman brand).  It works great, was shipped quickly, carefully wrapped, and is certainly priced right ($4.99 shipping included).  A recommended Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> I never really had experience with these before. I was always popping my zits with my fingers. This works well for whiteheads but not extraordinarily well for blackheads unless they&#x27;re really ripe for the popping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a certain technique to it and I recommend anyone who uses it for the first time to read up on how the professional aestheticians use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very unsatissfied! Even though this product worked well, it broke quickly even with gentle use! Both heads broke off in a matter of a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. They don&#x27;t just magically pop out of the skin, and a decent amount of pressure and some pain is still required. I will say that it is easier in some locations, and harder in others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this MONTHS and still use it frequently. I love it! Something about not having dirty greasy hands touching my face makes it worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Great to squeeze out those blackheads. I have dry skin so this tool works much better immediately after a shower. For those with oily skin you can probably use it any time. I&#x27;ve used this on my husband(who has oily skin) and junk comes out of his pores with little pressing effort.</li>
            <li> It works, but I don&#x27;t know how to use without leaving marks on my face. Maybe it is a problem of my skin, it is very sensitive, or I don&#x27;t know how to use properly, but no way it doesn&#x27;t get red at least for a day or two.</li>
            <li> I am heading towards late fifties and my vision is not what it used to be.  A year ago, my teen daughter, who uses blackhead scrubber products on her face, told me that I had a lot of black and white heads -- I just couldn&#x27;t see them anymore. So, out of the shower, I have been using my reading glasses to squeeze the few white head and TONS of black head that collect around my nose.  I happened to see this product as a suggested product on amazon and boy it was the best purchase I have made in many a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a 10x mirror - because of my vision .. and before work the other day, I couldn&#x27;t stand it -- I had to try my Utopia Care Blackhead Blemis Remover  -- I removed a zillion or so black heads a couple white heads all around my nose - KNOWING my nose was going to be bright read all day at work (my nose stays red for about 24 hours after a good black head squeezing with my nails....) but not with the utopia!!! My nose was nearly blackhead FREE and NOT RED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY this product - it works well - there are videos on youtube about it as well.....</li>
            <li> I can hardly remove blackheads with it like I did with my previous extractor. Probably need some more time to get used to it!</li>
            <li> The product came as ordered,fast shipping, and its solid little thing. The metal doesn&#x27;t bend with pressure applied in normal application. It could be a little longer though.</li>
            <li> very good quality. Feels tough and is nice and heavy. I have yet to get down the technique for this but it is a good product</li>
            <li> This is a good quality extractor.  It&#x27;s fully metal and feels heavy in the hand.  It&#x27;s a little longer than I thought (about an inch short of pen length), but it&#x27;s still good for the job.  The two different angles on the heads really helps for putting pressure where you need it without having to contort your body weirdly.  Really good extractor; would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works Great! Very effective at removing Black/White heads. Sturdy and well designed.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. And fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works very well! Better than using a bobby pin! Very durable build and great size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Solid product, easy to use. The size is perfect for most areas that you may need it for. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, and feels comfortable in your grip. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a single remover tool.</li>
            <li> Great product, work great to get rid of blackheads. Well crafted tool.</li>
            <li> Good quality blackhead remover. Looks like something you&#x27;d find at a dermatologist&#x27;s or esthetician&#x27;s office. It feels sturdy. The grooved handle makes it easy and comfortable to hold. I find it easier to extract blackheads after cleansing or a shower. Applying a mask before extraction is also a good way to loosen up the plugs even more with less pressure. The tool also came with a small plastic sleeve to store it in. Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as squeezing with your fingers or fingernails, but leaves less of a mark. Not really a Acne Pimple Extractor... Just a wire with an opening large enough to let out the blackhead. One side is a regular stiff wire, the other side is a flatened wire which leave less of a mark. You push it very hard to apply pressure over the pimple. The mark goes away in 10-60 minutes.</li>
            <li> a) good steel, not folding/ banding&lt;br /&gt;b) small loop size is good for medium thickness of the skin, a little big for skin around eyes&lt;br /&gt;c) the bigger loop should be bigger&lt;br /&gt;since its durable and convenient for most cases its an excellent tool</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as it is stainless steel and works great without pain. You can also clearly see through the slots...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this 4 stars only because I haven&#x27;t used or owned the product enough to determine it&#x27;s robustness. The extractor seems solid and may last me 20 to 30 years depending on it&#x27;s corrosion resistance and the thoughness of the loops.</li>
            <li> it works great and even gets the stuff i cant see</li>
            <li> Works great. Prevents scaring.</li>
            <li> It may well be that the skin on my cheeks and my nose is just not suitable to this type of intervention. So it may work for you, even though it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It leaves deep, red impressions where I have attempted to use it, and the pressure necessary to get anything to come out of the pores causes the metal parts of the device to bend. It&#x27;s been a little more effective around my sternum. For my face, I&#x27;m afraid that I&#x27;m back to my old method of squeezing the pores between my fingernails, yielding prodigious results but causing some pain (and maybe eventual arthritis) of the last finger joint.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this years ago instead of using my nails. :(</li>
            <li> Its a tool that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all. It hurts more than it works..</li>
            <li> This is a very effective tool. You can extract with out damaging the skin. A clean plastic case is included.</li>
            <li> If you have a partner who loves picking/popping blackheads, this is the gift for them.  Bring back the romance in your relationship.  Flip over and let her have at your acne ridden back.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially around my nostrils. I have yet to farm my boyfriend&#x27;s back, but I&#x27;m sure it will be perfect for the job!</li>
            <li> This works great and the price is great! Ive been using it about once a week. Its less painful and less irritating to the skin then manually squeezing (which you shouldnt do anyways) your blackheads and whiteheads. I was always bugging my husband to let me remove his blackheads on his face and he wouldnt let me come near him because he said i hurt him. Now he&#x27;s been using this little gadget himself! I just wahs it with soap and water or rub it with a cotton ball and alcohol after each use. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift, she liked it I guess.</li>
            <li> Great product. Happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> For the money this is very well made. Fast delivery and good communication. No instructions though so not quite sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li> I could not get this to work for me even with multiple attempts.</li>
            <li> Was very impressed with the quality with which this item was constructed.  I believe it is surgical grade stainless steel. Has a nice no-slip grip.  I was concerned about how it would work for me when I saw how thick the business end of the tool was.  My skin eruptions are no longer like a teenagers, and I just would not be able to benefit from the device.  The seller kindly refunded my money no questions asked.</li>
            <li> Great tool for black/white heads. It does not come with directions but those were easily found on YouTube. Tool is durable and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good idea to get this tool which is designed to provide a well-balanced pressure when extracting pimples. It did not work for me however, and only scarred certain areas of my face. I tried it without steaming my face which is not something that I would normally do anyway.</li>
            <li> Good product overall!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use it I followed directions and it just isn&#x27;t working for me. Not sure if it&#x27;s the product or me?</li>
            <li> I was looking for different similar options and finaly decided for this one because of the price and it was available to ship to my location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool seems very goodd quality and very resistant assembly. If it is real stainless steel then this tool should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary,it is a very goood purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible. My husband and I both used it. It&#x27;s simple, effective, fast and does an excellent job. My skin looks and feels awesome.</li>
            <li> Works excellent and is very durable. It is better than using fingers or a bobby pin since the blackhead remover does not break the skin as easily.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it works! And it works without causing damage and redness to your skin. This is my second tool, and if I lose it, I will be buying a third. Squeezing your skin causes redness swelling and sometimes infection. I HIGHLY. Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> invest in a better product doesn&#x27;t leave scarring but is better for big pores with black and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that many blackhead or pimples. So I use it not that often. But it does its work and remove them. Before I just used my fingers to press the pimple and my nose to remove the blackhead. Using fingers is terrible and leave big marks. Using this thing leaves very small marks and my skin recovers very fast. So I think it is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I have never use other type of products, so I cannot give a comparison.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and chin. And I was looking for this one a long time ago thank goodness amazon has it. This is exactly the one my dermatologist is using in removing my blackheads, whiteheads (facial cleaning). Steam your face before using it so that it will easily remove all the dirt in your face without too much pain. I love it and I will recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Did it&#x27;s job. Soaked face first in hot water than did my face. Got out all gunk in my pores without pain ! Well worth the purchase !</li>
            <li> it does get all the blackheads I never imagined f getting, but you have to press super hard. In fact on my nose it made some of my skin peel I had to press so hard. so be careful and keep clean!</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast delivery. These line of products are rare to find in your local pharmacy, but once you find them you will be very happy to use them. Always wash your face with warm water and soap, if not any other face cleaning product before using it. You will love this to get rid off your blackhead. Always be gentle with your face.</li>
            <li> I will be honest and say that I&#x27;ve never used a product like this.  It seems to be a high-quality product for the price, but I haven&#x27;t personally had a lot of great results.  That could be because of my lack of experience with this kind of tool, though.</li>
            <li> I have many small blackheads on my nose and this product worked great for it. It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean and it really works</li>
            <li> I got it and im doing minor extractions by myself at the house, always staming the area very well before using it, better than using your own fingers :)</li>
            <li> Really hurts if you use it on your nose, but is fantastic for hard-to-reach spots and clearing out pores.</li>
            <li> The extractor is well made and works well.  However, the downside to using something like this is that it has a tendency to leave marks on my face.  It&#x27;s not the fault of the extractor since there is no other way to get blackheads and whiteheads out. I guess that is the price that is paid for removing blemishes.</li>
            <li> Product works decent. I have seen better results online with similar products. I have only tried it one time though.</li>
            <li> Works great for blackheads especially around the nose area. Haven&#x27;t figured out how to use the other side for whiteheads. Directions should be included.</li>
            <li> This tool for popping pimples causes bruises. Painful!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly sturdy product. Needle first. No need to press so hard and bruise yourself. Be gentle but efficient. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> works great. My 13 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Great for the money.  Don&#x27;t press too hard. This product if used properly is gentle and works.</li>
            <li> This little tool has been amazing, doesn&#x27;t leave marks and is very effective.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this on Amazon and I ordered for her and I asked her last night how did she like it and does it work? She said yes and yes, so that closes the deal.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described. Great quality stainless steel. Shipping was great and super fast.</li>
            <li> Saw these types of tools on some videos and figured I&#x27;d try them out.  A lot sturdier and we&#x27;ll made than I was anticipating for price.  Over all good product and worth the money if you needsomething life this</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I can get tons more just by doing it wit my fingers. Waste of money IMHO.</li>
            <li> Works well. Sturdy, heavy, feels solid.</li>
            <li> It does the job pretty well, this is the first one ive ever used tho so I am no expert.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product I&#x27;m glad I ordered it. Thanks to Utopia Care for this great product. it is nice.</li>
            <li> Having never used one of these before there was a bit of a learning curve but it definitely works. Good grip / Stiff tips</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this tool for so long. It&#x27;s so efficient and saves me from damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this and waited months to get it. I was sorely disappointed. The thing pushes down hard on your skin and makes deep impressions without really popping the pimple. It didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so I don&#x27;t know if there is a special way to work it. Seems like the ladies in the beauty salon have a different device when doing facials.</li>
            <li> Works well and got here fast.</li>
            <li> This tool does remove blackheads, but as a word of caution you should consult YouTube for videos on how to use the tool properly, otherwise it is easy to leave a scar.</li>
            <li> The product is well-made and has good quality. The metal seems legit because it is quite heavy. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to remove blackheads on my nose. Works well better than extracting it with your fingers. I don&#x27;t actually know what the thick side is used for as I only use the thin side.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money! It&#x27;s nit a miracle or anything but I do like it. It works esecially well on my nose. Buy one!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without. lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Great product. It is as described.</li>
            <li> I just love it. Thank you. Danna</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Its alright. Not the best thing i have bought. In other words. It fills my heart with just enough joy to not really care.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool because of my 12 year old- who got blackheads in his ear. I know- ewe. The poor kid. It did get them- but it wasn&#x27;t entirely without pain as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good  product but still you have to work to get your pores clean I find out that if you put on a hot towel or if you steam your face first then it will be easier. Also it&#x27;s the best method because it won&#x27;t live you a nasty scar.</li>
            <li> This product came quickly (received it in only one day after I ordered it!) and is of really nice quality! Both ends of the blemish remover is sturdy, unlike other flimsy ones. It is made out of stainless steel and works great! One really nice things about this tool is that it doesn&#x27;t really leave a lasting mark on your face if you apply some sort of mask after you disinfect your areas you used the tool on!</li>
            <li> My main goal when I bought this was to remove this one stubborn blackhead and I finally got it using this tool. I don&#x27;t usually get big blackheads often, and trying t remover little ones using this usually just irritates my skin and leaves lines from the tool. Worth the price :)</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality of this tool, being that it is stainless steel and looks to be well designed. However, I was disappointed that it included no instructions. I feel I need to explore a site for ways to successfully use it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing to NOT love about this product. It works great and really takes out the black/whiteheads. I am very satisfied with this product. The very stubborn, deep blackheads will require steaming to open the pores and to make the skin a bit softer for it to work its magic.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Product. Great Service. Quick shipping! Works really well. It&#x27;s so gross how well it works and I love it! HaHa</li>
            <li> Works great, very satisfied! Can&#x27;t believe I went this long without one. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I  really enjoyed my new thing. It is nice, useful and looking just like on web picture. I am happy with a quality and price. Definitely positive feedback :)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. I&#x27;ve had many of these before and this one is definitely the best value. Warning, the edges are a little sharp so it&#x27;s easy to peel some skin off when extracting.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when this arrived and used it right away! The best way to use this tool is to wash your face with warm water first to open up your pores.</li>
            <li> Works just as I expected! Really glad to have this to help eliminate stubborn blackheads on my face without spreading germs with my fingers. It also prevents damage to my skin that my fingernails would otherwise cause. No more scabbing over. Just a quick blackhead removal without the mess.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Free and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Came with a protective case&lt;br /&gt;One of the better blackhead removers ive used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;takes some practice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after getting out of the shower with damp skin, just pull across my skin with low pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Works great a lot of gunk comes out. First week had some redness but also removed the most.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week now with no redness and good results</li>
            <li> i loved this product... on seller&#x27;s part, the product came in nice packaging and was on time... on product&#x27;s part, the product is nice and do what it is meant to do... nice buy... recommended if you need to remove black or white heads... you don&#x27;t need to spend $15 when you can get same thing for cheaper...</li>
            <li> I bought the blackhead extractor because I had been watching first impressions of thwm on youtube and I saw great results when they did it.So I looked them up and it was only 5 bucks so I figured why not and bought it I received it sooner then amazon said I would. I tried it out the way the YouTubers did and I saw just as great results as they did. Its truly amazing and all yout blackheads will be erased.</li>
            <li> It may work for others but I didn&#x27;t like it. It kinda hurts lol oh well. I&#x27;m sorry I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Item was ok.  It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as the one the dermatologist uses.  I found it left indents in my skin even when I steamed and prepped skin prior to using tool.  If I had to do it over again, I would not purchase this item.  I gave it three stars, because it was consistent with the description.  It might suit some people.</li>
            <li> Takes care of business! I recommend using it after a hot shower to loosen up pores. I&#x27;ve been using these things since college, zit comes to a head, I put the round side around it then push until the nasties are out and blood comes out the hole. Especially handy to have on vacations!</li>
            <li> item came with no instructions for use.  Had to watch videos on line for instruction.  Item does not work that well</li>
            <li> Good quality not cheaply made</li>
            <li> As i&#x27;ve used similar product in the past I knew that this type of product would be great and it has been.  Very durable and built well.  I plan on using it until either myself or the remover goes in the garbage!</li>
            <li> This works marvelously! It is almost addicting. Works very well!  No more acne scars.  I even use this on my boyfriend&#x27;s back acne.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I like it! Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I Would happily recommend this to all my friends to use it.&lt;br /&gt;fsle</li>
            <li> This is a staple in our house! Each of us have one and love. They are well made and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> I never knew this tool existed until a girlfriend of mine whipped hers out. This is amazing .. as it does remove those disgusting blackheads. It is very sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not as helpful as I imagined it to be. However it does a fine job for picking out small pimples.</li>
            <li> I love this product, works great! And doesn&#x27;t leave scars like removing blackheads with your nails might.</li>
            <li> good product, quick delivery, fits in my mail box.  Only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 is the last one I had, one of the metal loops fell out.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to remove your blackheads if used properly. Love it!</li>
            <li> This post is for those that are not dumb in life. I&#x27;ve read some postings in the past from people who are too ignorant to know this is actually a tool that people do go to school for to learn how to use. Yeah you can skip that process like myself and just learn on the fly as a DIY. Positive thing though is that I know people that can and have taught me how to mess with this product. You don&#x27;t go all fast and expect your face to cooperate without the proper sterile and prepping. Do yourselves a favor and YouTube or ask a person like a dermatologist or person who does facials to learn how to exactly clean your face, open your pores, then use the remover. It&#x27;s not hard especially if you get facial treatments to know how to relax the pores. Other than that if you scared, pay the $10-35 fee of getting pampered.</li>
            <li> works best after working out or warm shower when pores are open. i LOVE this thing!</li>
            <li> Great quality product for a great price! Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. Kinda small.... But does the job, if I&#x27;m doing it right. Would be more helpful if it came with instructions?!?&lt;br /&gt;But all in all its good! :-)</li>
            <li> does it&#x27;s job but use sparingly as it can bruise your skin if you&#x27;re applying a lot of force.</li>
            <li> A friend showed me one of these to me when we were kids and she had acne. It really works to remove blackheads without causing bruising. Unfortunately my order got turned around in the mail, but because it is such a great tool I wanted to give it a review. I have small ones and larger ones. The circle ones also work well.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipment.</li>
            <li> great product. worked perfectly. best on market in my opinion. fast ship. would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Your zit/blackhead has to be in the right &amp;#34;state&amp;#34; in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> its a very useful tool and comes in handy when needed. However make sure you know how to use it first before purchasing, google some videos lol</li>
            <li> I like it! Great delivery service and product does its job!</li>
            <li> One tip of extractor was broken when it reached me..I have send it back to you..waiting for a new one!</li>
            <li> Great price fast delivery</li>
            <li> Received it very quickly...works well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and the shipping is fast. This product will unlikely to cause excessive redness or peeling skin after use, better than the one I had before. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great!</li>
            <li> super easy to use.  I only use the one end though.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product. It saves a mess and pain, compared to squeezing pimples with your figures. I am someone with moderately bad acne so I use this tool almost every day and have slain many pimples already.&lt;br /&gt;I really only use one side of the tool. I highly recommend this to anyone with white heads and some black heads(didn&#x27;t work on all black heads for me). Of course it isn&#x27;t going to be a cure to your acne but it will help you to maintain it better.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product. I&#x27;ve seen blackhead removal tools on YouTube and I was expecting it to work a lot better. It only got a few, but on YouTube, it showed these tools getting a ton. I think the trick is to soften the skin with a towel soaked in warm water. Also, even when you do this, you can&#x27;t be afraid of a little pain. It definitely was not the most comfortable experience for me to bust those blackheads! If you soften the skin and work through the pain you could be in business to get a few of those awful blackheads that are driving you crazy! Also, the zit has to be ready to come so that could have been one of the reasons that it didn&#x27;t get as many as I would&#x27;ve wished! Don&#x27;t forget to sanitize the tool with hot water or rubbing alcohol after every use. You don&#x27;t want any more zits coming back!</li>
            <li> Having the right tool makes any effort easier, and this is one of those things you don&#x27;t think of needing until you need it.  Good tool, good seller.  What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my pimples, just left a mark from pressing. Nay have worked better with a steamer.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that i felt it should have been a little longer by a few inches...but since it does what it&#x27;s suppose to, i got no complaints...the shippment arrived on time...well before the day losted actually...and there was no shipping!!!  I mean where can you find a product where the shipping doesnt cost you the same as the cost of the product...    Great product, good price, and free shipping...works for me!</li>
            <li> Totally useless. It&#x27;s hurt when I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhere between barely okay and not okay. I gave it 2 stars because my husband, who has a greater tolerance for pain, sat still while I pressed this way and that, mashing his skin pretty hard before I finally did get most of 2 blackheads out that had been there for a while. But my daughter, who I bought it for, did not like it at all. You have to press hard enough for it to really hurt to accomplish anything on smaller blackheads, which she has a lot of. It didn&#x27;t do a thing for any of hers. She said no more to the hard metal squashing her tender little nose before I could get anything out. We&#x27;ve actually had more success using witch hazel then Elmer&#x27;s glue as a mask. We will keep this regimen up, it looks like it won&#x27;t be an overnight fix, but that it will help a lot if used regularly.  Blackheads are such an annoying problem, so I&#x27;ll pass on what works for us and hope it works for someone else. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a the second one of these that we&#x27;ve purchased.  They work great and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for..No complaints !</li>
            <li> I love this blemish remover the ends are thin but sturdy enough to get the black heads out without damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected good product for the price the only thing I can complain about is lack of instructions on how to use this contraption</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Simply the best one out there..recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price, and perfect condition!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Satisfaction was met.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick. However, I  wish there was a mini manual/description on how to use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others that didn&#x27;t work, but this does.</li>
            <li> Good product, takes awhile to figure out how to use it correctly.  Nice heavy-duty tool</li>
            <li> just couldn&#x27;t use this. too big.</li>
            <li> takes some practice to learn how to use but once you get it down it works pretty well. defiantly better than by hand.</li>
            <li> only used it once but did what its intended for</li>
            <li> Works well. As advertised</li>
