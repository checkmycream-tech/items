            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>Great fun!</li>
            <li>It is true to the picture and is great quality.</li>
            <li>The comb attached it very securely.  </li>
            <li>This is adorable.  </li>
            <li>The ivory hats is cute.</li>
            <li>This is the most adorable hair adornment.  </li>
            <li>.&lt;br /&gt;I added another flower on the top of the flower in a coral color to match my outfit.  </li>
            <li>Love the feather and bead top part.</li>
            <li>many compliments</li>
            <li>The five stars are for the item itself, which is adorable, (though it differs in detail from the pictures).  </li>
            <li>It was pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>So, you may not get exactly what you&#x27;re expecting, but you might like it even better!</li>
            <li>Received on time, fits well and looks beautiful on my very short salt and pepper hair style.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments because of this headpiece and that is why I gave it the full star treatment.  </li>
            <li>Nice hat, exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>This hat is super cute in person too</li>
            <li>Despite the need for a few easy tweeks, great product for the price!</li>
            <li>The hair clip underneath is quite large and the hat stayed on my head nicely put as I walked around in front of the mirror, which leads me to believe that it will stay in place when I wear it with a 1940s wig for a prolonged time during a play.</li>
            <li>I got these mostly because the price is right.</li>
            <li>Luckily they are easily removed by unbending the pipe cleaner wire.</li>
            <li>just enough&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; to add something special.</li>
            <li>overall, good.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was very cute. :)</li>
            <li>I liked the fascinator itself; however, I ordered white and I was sent a cream colored one.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for fabulous but not the high price</li>
            <li>The hat is exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly ad pictured.</li>
            <li>smaller than i expected, and it took  bit of adjusting my hair for the right look, changing the position of my victory rolls, but  think overall, ths will be perfect for my rockabilly wedding, along with the veil.</li>
            <li>The comb was attached securely to the hat, and only 2 out of 4 of us needed bobby pins to keep the hat in place.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too fluffy and fits nicely on the head.  </li>
            <li>I may order more ..... in other colors.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw the flowers, I started to complain to the seller, but tried it on first and the shape of the conjoined-twin-floral-Mohawk actually looked even better on me than a single upward facing flower would, likewise the longer netting works particularly well for me.  </li>
            <li>they were small and easy to pack, and we could wear them right out of the bags they came in.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely little hat / fascinator.  </li>
            <li>My mom and sisters and I were headed to New Orleans over Easter Weekend, and needed a hat for Easter Sunday</li>
            <li>The backward facing comb makes it harder to put in place, but may stay on even better than a properly oriented on would.  </li>
            <li>Other clips like this cost the same or more without that piece, so I didn&#x27;t mind ripping it off.</li>
            <li>( really) this hat had such potential and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It came quick enough (thanks to PRIME) and was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>that others I looked at on line that were much the same.</li>
            <li>I got this for my Japanese styled wedding and it works out very well with the style.</li>
            <li>The netting on mine is much larger than pictured - really almost a veil, and mine came with two back to back flowers that looked like conjoined twins, instead of the single one shown.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased that the ivory hat is indeed ivory - not white, as it sometimes happens with online purchases (I had purchased ivory gloves to match and disappointingly received them in white instead).</li>

            <li> It overshadowed the delicate pretty concept of the piece and just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to find another excuse to wear it.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the dots on the veil are actually pipe cleaners.</li>
            <li> I liked the hat but was a bit disappointed with the flower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to keep the veil held down to get it into the proper and keep it there.  </li>
            <li> The polka dots are actually little pieces of white pipe cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not too flashy but just right.  </li>
            <li> The feathers were a little long for my taste, so I trimmed them a bit.</li>
            <li> I didnt really like all the weird feathers and the little white things in the veil</li>
            <li> The only problem I foresee is my hair being so slick</li>
            <li> but all I did was twist and pull them out the veil very carefully.</li>
            <li> The item was a little less substantial than I expected it to be, but it will &amp;#34;pass.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I ordered two ivory and two black -</li>
            <li> Black Fascinator was never received.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not adequate, and so the flowers and feathers needed a little hand fluffing to revive them.  </li>
            <li> I wore this little hat to a semi-formal event with a 40&#x27;s style dress I&#x27;ve had for ages...</li>
            <li> that part was way too big and also very thick.</li>
            <li> I received it in just a few days.</li>
            <li> It is a darker creamer color and looks dirty next to the stark white of the hat.  </li>
            <li> The small bead like looking items in the netting are pipe cleaner</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small head piece.</li>
            <li> The small dots on the veil are small pieces of a pipe cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they put them on this</li>
            <li> Well made - not too flashy, but</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a birdcage veil and cutting off the veil part of the hat, will be wearing both.</li>

            <li> Well made, beautiful headpiece.</li>
            <li> This is a great accessory to any outfit. I am using it as a costume piece for my daughter&#x27;s dance recital. It is true to the picture and is great quality.</li>
            <li> Got this to wear to my daughter&#x27;s wedding and it matched my dress perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is adorable.  I&#x27;ve had to keep the veil held down to get it into the proper and keep it there.  The only problem I foresee is my hair being so slick it won&#x27;t hold.  But this piece is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This hat is super cute in person too</li>
            <li> The hat portion is beautiful - the veil part looks like pipe cleaners attached to tooling. Not what I expected. I ended up buying a birdcage veil and cutting off the veil part of the hat, will be wearing both.</li>
            <li> My mom and sisters and I were headed to New Orleans over Easter Weekend, and needed a hat for Easter Sunday (you&#x27;ve gotta wear hat there on Easter Sunday!). I got these mostly because the price is right. I am glad I did, they worked perfectly. I ordered two ivory and two black - they were small and easy to pack, and we could wear them right out of the bags they came in.

            <li> it brought out my wedding dress just perfect, the color matched perfectly. even though it was purchased separtel. my wedding outfit was the talk of the town.</li>
            <li> I wore this little hat to a semi-formal event with a 40&#x27;s style dress I&#x27;ve had for ages...it freshened my look and I received numerous compliments...very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The ivory hats is cute. The flowers on the hat were way to yellowish. The small bead like looking items in the netting are pipe cleaner( really) this hat had such potential and the price was right.</li>
            <li> This is the most adorable hair adornment.  I ordered for my daughter&#x27;s surprise bridal shower tea party for her to wear.  Another friend saw it and is going to use it for her garden wedding.  I may order more ..... in other colors.  Well made - not too flashy, but just enough&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; to add something special.</li>
            <li> The item was a little less substantial than I expected it to be, but it will &amp;#34;pass.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wore it to a Downton Abbey Tea.  Great fun!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely little hat / fascinator.  It isn&#x27;t too fluffy and fits nicely on the head.  The polka dots are actually little pieces of white pipe cleaner.  I would have preferred sewn in dots but it&#x27;s for my daughters prom and she didn&#x27;t have a problem with it at all.</li>
            <li> Have used it for many partys from tea party to dress up! Great bang for the the buck! So many compliments!</li>
            <li> It was pretty good for the price. No compaints, I had to iron the mesh with a very low temp to eliminate some wrinkles but overall, good. I used mine for a vintage bridal party.</li>
            <li> The hat is exactly as pictured.  I tried it on and it looked beautiful.  The hair clip underneath is quite large and the hat stayed on my head nicely put as I walked around in front of the mirror, which leads me to believe that it will stay in place when I wear it with a 1940s wig for a prolonged time during a play. I was very pleased that the ivory hat is indeed ivory - not white, as it sometimes happens with online purchases (I had purchased ivory gloves to match and disappointingly received them in white instead). Wonderful item!</li>
            <li> Received on time, fits well and looks beautiful on my very short salt and pepper hair style. Black Fascinator was never received.</li>
            <li> I liked the fascinator itself; however, I ordered white and I was sent a cream colored one.</li>
            <li> I received it in just a few days. and i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a hat. it&#x27;s a small head piece. It&#x27;s of no use to me. I want my my money back.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your money.</li>
            <li> I liked the hat but was a bit disappointed with the flower.  It is a darker creamer color and looks dirty next to the stark white of the hat.  .&lt;br /&gt;I added another flower on the top of the flower in a coral color to match my outfit.  It was aquite a bit more expensive that others I looked at on line that were much the same.</li>
            <li> The perfect size...Large enough to be noticed but small enough not to be too gaudy or &amp;#34;costumey&amp;#34;. Product is exactly ad pictured. As other reviewers have mentioned, the dots on the veil are actually pipe cleaners. Luckily they are easily removed by unbending the pipe cleaner wire. The veil is made of toole and not netting. The feathers were a little long for my taste, so I trimmed them a bit. Despite the need for a few easy tweeks, great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I got this for my Japanese styled wedding and it works out very well with the style. I didnt really like all the weird feathers and the little white things in the veil are just pieces of pipe cleaner. Other than that it was very cute. :)</li>
            <li> This hat was great.  It was perfect for the &amp;#34;Derby Party&amp;#34; that I attended.  The comb attached it very securely.  I loved it.</li>
            <li> just what i was wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this piece ! I wear it with my vintage victorian outfit .</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a wedding in ivory. The small dots on the veil are small pieces of a pipe cleaner. I am not sure why they put them on this but all I did was twist and pull them out the veil very carefully.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money.  I needed this for a Diner en Blanc NY event.  It came quick enough (thanks to PRIME) and was not what I expected.  Not too flashy but just right.  I received so many compliments because of this headpiece and that is why I gave it the full star treatment.  If you are looking for fabulous but not the high price this is the hat/fascinator for you.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Love the feather and bead top part. I removed the pate (fabric piece underneath that the comb was attached to.) that part was way too big and also very thick. It overshadowed the delicate pretty concept of the piece and just didn&#x27;t work. Other clips like this cost the same or more without that piece, so I didn&#x27;t mind ripping it off. It looked great in my hair and served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Loved it,,,wore to church for a wedding...many compliments</li>
            <li> Nice hat, exactly as shown.  Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> The completed my outfit for the Mother Daughter tea party!</li>
            <li> Wore it to a garden party wedding and it was great.  You need to fasten the comb with bobby pin and the clip takes some getting used to as it goes forward (not backward).</li>
            <li> The five stars are for the item itself, which is adorable, (though it differs in detail from the pictures).  The packaging was not adequate, and so the flowers and feathers needed a little hand fluffing to revive them.  The netting on mine is much larger than pictured - really almost a veil, and mine came with two back to back flowers that looked like conjoined twins, instead of the single one shown.  When I first saw the flowers, I started to complain to the seller, but tried it on first and the shape of the conjoined-twin-floral-Mohawk actually looked even better on me than a single upward facing flower would, likewise the longer netting works particularly well for me.  It is not mounted on a clip, but on a comb - a comb that faces backwards.  The backward facing comb makes it harder to put in place, but may stay on even better than a properly oriented on would.  So, you may not get exactly what you&#x27;re expecting, but you might like it even better!</li>
