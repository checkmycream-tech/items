            <li>Then I find out I can&#x27;t return because it&#x27;s a hazardous material</li>
            <li>Beautiful packaging, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still able to get some perfume out.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s still around :)</li>
            <li>Other days it works perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  just a clean and perfume-me smell ...</li>
            <li>I find this being sold at a excellent price it will purchase at least three.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean the nozzle many different ways.  </li>
            <li>The spraying mechanism seems to be faulty, also it doesnt smell quite right.</li>
            <li>Glad I only ordered one tester before buying in bulk...</li>
            <li>and  you are lucky you may be able to empty the bottle--- almost.  </li>

            <li>such a unique deep rich smell not strong not heavy just a deep smell...</li>
            <li>However, last time I went to Neiman Marcus to buy a new bottle they told me it had been discontinued!</li>
            <li>I used 1 bottle of this perfume and am now starting my second which I purchased at the same time as the first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it at low as $15 (online - Amazon) , and have paid as high as $60 (canal st. NYC -prior to online search engines) and seen it on Neiman Marcus website for well over $100.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I went to use it this morning, barely anything came out.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am not going to knock on Jivago..because it is a great perfume..it is all I wear!  However this time when I ordered the bottle was not working properly!  I couldn&#x27;t spray it for nothing..I tried to clean the nozzle many different ways.  I eventually ended up using pliers to get the top off, so now I have a broken hole in the top and I have to apply the perfume with a cotton ball.  And I noticed later that the attachment inside where the perfume is supposed to come through had a block inside of it..I mean really?!?!?  I will continue to use it but may look for a different supplier!</li>
            <li> The spray bottle didn&#x27;t work, so I was never able to use the perfume.</li>
            <li> FAKE product. Smells like sh*$. I have used this perfume previously. It does not smell like this.</li>
            <li> The smell is great grandmother loved it</li>
            <li> The product should have a seal on the back with authication coding. If it doesnt its fraudulent. The packaging has a difficult to open plastic wrsp. Not flimsey.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift. Beautiful packaging and light fragrance. I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfume and must test before I purchase</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging, quick delivery. This is the only fragrance I wear and I was told they are phasing it out of production. I am going to stockpile!</li>
            <li> Smells so delightful. Been wearing the fragrance for over ten years and it&#x27;s still wonderful.</li>
            <li> The perfume I love!  The sprayer is horrible it stops working even if you have 3/4 of the perfume left in the bottle, and there&#x27;s no way to get it out. I&#x27;ve ordered several so it&#x27;s not only one bottle. They are all like that. The maker should redesign them. Waste of money in my opinion. To bad because it smells wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> every girl has their signature scent and this one is mine. However, last time I went to Neiman Marcus to buy a new bottle they told me it had been discontinued! Anyone how has a signature scent knows that sinking feeling in their stomach at the thought of that happening. So, I found a bottle on amazon and ordered it immediately. When I went to use it this morning, barely anything came out. The spraying mechanism seems to be faulty, also it doesnt smell quite right. Glad I only ordered one tester before buying in bulk...</li>
            <li> seems very authentic.</li>
            <li> Just received and already can&#x27;t get the spray to come out, when I finally got a little to come out of the bottle it has more of a alcohol smell to it.  This does not smell like the bottle that I had for quite some time. Then I find out I can&#x27;t return because it&#x27;s a hazardous material, well they shipped it to me so why can&#x27;t I ship it back? Not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> Sinatra fragrance..I agree that the bottle needs revisiting to get it to actually spri5z..but I found a way to make it work.</li>
            <li> Setting the scent aside I will never purchase this product again due to the ridiculous sprayer this brand has.  I used 1 bottle of this perfume and am now starting my second which I purchased at the same time as the first.  The delivery system of this sprayer makes it impossible to get the product out.  It is one little squirt after another little squirt.  And if you spend lots of time and  you are lucky you may be able to empty the bottle--- almost.  Why do these designers and manufacturers always come up with silly ideas to make their product look &amp;#34;special?&amp;#34;  There is another expensive perfume I tried with the dumbest top (made for show) that breaks off almost immediately and making it impossible to spray the bottle.  That one I will also never buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!! Doesn&#x27;t smell like a flower garden or a candy shop like a lot of other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jivago for over 15 years and was so upset when they discontinued it.  This last X-mas my daughter gave to me as a gift and told me that Amazon has it, I was so happy that I can still use this perform. I haven&#x27;t found any other perfurm that I like.</li>
            <li> This has been my pefurme for at least 10 years. It&#x27;s the only scent that I will wear. I receive compliments all the time from both women and men.&lt;br /&gt;When I find this being sold at a excellent price it will purchase at least three. I&#x27;ve bought it at low as $15 (online - Amazon) , and have paid as high as $60 (canal st. NYC -prior to online search engines) and seen it on Neiman Marcus website for well over $100.&lt;br /&gt;I know reviewers had problems with the nozzle and had to actually remove it in order to get the perfume out.  Sometimes my nozzle sticks a bit but I&#x27;m still able to get some perfume out.  Other days it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Thank you Jivago for staying around... such a unique deep rich smell not strong not heavy just a deep smell...everyone knows me for this smell and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s still around :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  just a clean and perfume-me smell ... I get lots of complement that I smell so good.</li>
