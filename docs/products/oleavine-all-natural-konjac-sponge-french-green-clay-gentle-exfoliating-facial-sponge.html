            <li>I was fortunate to get these on sale.</li>
            <li>According to Oleavine, the Konjac fiber for their sponges is grown on the ‘pristine volcanic plains of Jeju Island in South Korea, free from chemicals, pollution and irritants’.  </li>

            <li>It also leaves my face feeling smooth and clean, not like I missed something or that the sponge did not do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Really fun sponge!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Ideal shape for the contours of your face but still large enough for your body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a loofah or washcloth to clean my skin.</li>
            <li>This is far better than any sponge I have used before and does way more than just cleansing my face.</li>
            <li>while this says you can use it without a cleanser, I did not feel as if my skin was as clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the sudsy, squeaky clean</li>
            <li>This sponge is also 100% natural, eco-friendly and biodegradable with is a huge plus and a must for me when shopping for products!!</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin I have to say this sponge works great on sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and gentle the sponge was, after it was soaked in warm water and after cleansing my face with it!  </li>
            <li>, this was the most gentle exfoliate I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m torn between lowering to three stars and it being good enough for five</li>
            <li>This sponge is really cool.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>But once you rinse the sponge in warm water it absorbs the water and turns into a soft sponge.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good quality.</li>
            <li>You can read the full review on my blog.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>sponge has an amazing teardrop shape, which is suitable for large areas of the face or body, and a smaller section which is absolutely perfect for smaller areas, such as those around the nose and eyes!</li>
            <li>It is well made and was shipped in the box in plastic to help keep it fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this sponge and with proper care</li>
            <li>I really liked the sponge and the way it left my face clean and glowing afterward.</li>
            <li>No artificial colors or preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>If you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft it feels and how it cleans my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been seeing them everywhere, people are talking and raving about them everywhere, though i had never tried one, till Oleavine was kind enough to offer me one of theirs!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review purposes and only give honest feedback.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love using it in the shower or by the mirror!&lt;br /&gt;•100% NATURAL, ECO-FRIENDLY and BIODEGRADEABLE -</li>
            <li>I love it because even though it&#x27;s soft, as soon as I add water it cleanses and exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to even the most sensitive skin types in terms of its texture and ability to give skin smoothness.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that Oleavine created a product that is 100% natural and vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li>Since I wear makeup, I use the sponge with a cream cleanser (the only kind recommended for use with the sponge).</li>
            <li>I received this konjac sponge for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>but once you get it good and wet, it softens up alot!</li>
            <li>If you haven’t tried one of these amazing Japanese Konjac sponges yet, you REALLY need to get with the times, and try one of these out!</li>
            <li>The design of the sponge allows me to easily clean my whole face without having to manipulate the sponge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked other Konjac Sponges more, this one smelled bacteria&#x27;ish by the end of its use which doesn&#x27;t normally happen for me with using these.</li>
            <li>One side of my sponge the pores are very smooth and absolutely does not exfoliate at all, but the other side the pores you can feel much more</li>

            <li>One side of my sponge the pores are very smooth and absolutely does not exfoliate at all, but the other side the pores you can feel much more</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super gentle.  </li>
            <li>When wet, however, this is the most softest sponge ever!</li>
            <li>pressed the sponge free of water easily and hung it up to dry and took a look in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s like the poor holes are smoothed or glossed over on on top and more real and natural on the bottom if that makes sense at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, maybe a pull tab for opening the plastic, could be something to think about.</li>
            <li>I found the pureSOL sponge to have a better composite and overall effectiveness.</li>
            <li>She has fantastic skin for 82 years old.  </li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s like the poor holes are smoothed or glossed over on on top and more real and natural on the bottom if that makes sense at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was again happy to see that it removed my makeup and left my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>Always get pretty pinkish complexion after using it.</li>
            <li>you!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who wants a great way to cleanse the face, without having to use harsh chemical cleansers or filmy soap!</li>
            <li>With the Oleavine Beauty sponge I know exactly what it is made of and it has no smell.</li>
            <li>It comes to you incredibly dry, but as soon as you add warm water to it, it really puffs up.</li>
            <li>100% Natural, Eco Friendly and 100%</li>
            <li>Taking care of my face is how I plan to keep my skin fresh and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that there are no harsh chemicals in this Konjac sponge and that it is biodegradable and 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>- Soft enough for a baby&#x27;s skin while still providing effective exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The French Green Clay is ideally suited for oily skin</li>
            <li>With the pointed shape I was able to get into the tight spots around my nose where I tend to breakout, and did notice a significant change in the amount of breakouts I got while using</li>
            <li>I have large pores and oily skin, this product did not help at all.</li>
            <li>Good for occasional use on dry retin-a treated skin.</li>
            <li>we are used to in the states, but the acne that&#x27;s been on my left cheek for months has notably faded since I began use, so clearly it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>Konjac Sponge - French Green Clay sponge come in a nice tear drop shape, which makes it easy to use around the eyes.</li>
            <li>This French green clay konjac sponge is luxuriously soft and is a great sponge for gently exfoliating/cleansing your skin!!</li>
            <li>It doesn’t really have a smell, just the sponge smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Airdrying didn&#x27;t really work for me and it started to smell after a while.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>I do not notice as much redness as before.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>DO NOT wring out as this will ruin its design, instead, just gently squeeze or scrunch it between your palms and then cleanse your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry especially since I use my face for so many things.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face with a gentle cleanser every night.</li>
            <li>shape of sponge is nice as I can use the point to get close to my eyes without getting soap in my eyes and the bigger side can be used on the bigger sections of my face and neck that I don&#x27;t have to be as cautions.</li>
            <li>Relaxing and gentle for daily use even on the most sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>This soft sponge is makes my skin feel instantly soft after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Works as scrub for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>100% Natural is what loured me in like a kid to a candy store.</li>
            <li>My highly sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t even irritated the slightest bit.</li>
            <li>It is a nice generous size, and comes packaged dry and hard but softens up really quick once you get it completely wet.</li>

            <li>It is a nice generous size, and comes packaged dry and hard but softens up really quick once you get it completely wet.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not a hard rock nor its a harsh or rough material its 100% Natural Konjac Fiber.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates very gently and is not at all rough like a washcloth or loofah</li>
            <li>It really is gentle enough for daily use, even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This sponge was bigger than I had expected, you wet it apply your favorite cleanser and cleanse your face.</li>
            <li>The first impression I had of this Konjac sponge is that it was going to be rough against my face.</li>
            <li>I use a small amount of my face wash directly on the sponge so that my face gets the clean feel and get rids of the dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>After using the sponge make sure to wash off the soap and air dry it, to increase its longevity else if it is wet for too long its falls apart</li>
            <li>These are gentle enough for daily exfoliation but if your face is oily, then you should also be using cleanser with it too.</li>
            <li>next day my skin looked clear and. . .</li>
            <li>If you never used a Konjac Sponge before, directions on how to use the sponge and how to properly take care of the sponge are clearly stated on the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much it has changed the appearance of my skin, but it is very soothing to use.</li>
            <li>Not rough on the skin</li>
            <li>for exfoliating, but is just not firm enough for me.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin and there is no abrasiveness compared to other facial cleansing sponges.</li>
            <li>Plus, my face is usually super red from me scrubbing at my face to get dead skin off or working at some</li>
            <li>I saw a red one, a black one, and a red one, which is the one for Anti Aging, which is what I really need!!</li>
            <li>While both left my skin feeling soft and refreshed, for me, personally, the French Red Clay worked best--I found it to exfoliate my combination skin a little better than the Green Clay version and it left my skin smoother and tauter than when I started using it, without the drying effects of a stronger exfoliation product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One side of the sponge pores are very smooth and are not enough to exfoliate the skin properly, but the other side the pores are much bigger and at least you can feel it is exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li>This product will shrink back down to original size after it has dried.</li>

            <li> I was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Ideal shape for the contours of your face but still large enough for your body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a loofah or washcloth to clean my skin.</li>
            <li> This is far better than any sponge I have used before and does way more than just cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> while this says you can use it without a cleanser, I did not feel as if my skin was as clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the sudsy, squeaky clean</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and gentle the sponge was, after it was soaked in warm water and after cleansing my face with it!  </li>
            <li> , this was the most gentle exfoliate I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m torn between lowering to three stars and it being good enough for five</li>

            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> But once you rinse the sponge in warm water it absorbs the water and turns into a soft sponge.</li>

            <li> Plus, I love that Oleavine created a product that is 100% natural and vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li> Since I wear makeup, I use the sponge with a cream cleanser (the only kind recommended for use with the sponge).</li>
            <li> I received this konjac sponge for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> but once you get it good and wet, it softens up alot!</li>
            <li> If you haven’t tried one of these amazing Japanese Konjac sponges yet, you REALLY need to get with the times, and try one of these out!</li>
            <li> The design of the sponge allows me to easily clean my whole face without having to manipulate the sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked other Konjac Sponges more, this one smelled bacteria&#x27;ish by the end of its use which doesn&#x27;t normally happen for me with using these.</li>
            <li> One side of my sponge the pores are very smooth and absolutely does not exfoliate at all, but the other side the pores you can feel much more</li>
            <li> One side of my sponge the pores are very smooth and absolutely does not exfoliate at all, but the other side the pores you can feel much more</li>
            <li> One side of my sponge the pores are very smooth and absolutely does not exfoliate at all, but the other side the pores you can feel much more</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super gentle.  </li>
            <li> When wet, however, this is the most softest sponge ever!</li>
            <li> pressed the sponge free of water easily and hung it up to dry and took a look in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s like the poor holes are smoothed or glossed over on on top and more real and natural on the bottom if that makes sense at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, maybe a pull tab for opening the plastic, could be something to think about.</li>
            <li> I found the pureSOL sponge to have a better composite and overall effectiveness.</li>
            <li> She has fantastic skin for 82 years old.  </li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s like the poor holes are smoothed or glossed over on on top and more real and natural on the bottom if that makes sense at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was again happy to see that it removed my makeup and left my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> Always get pretty pinkish complexion after using it.</li>
            <li> you!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who wants a great way to cleanse the face, without having to use harsh chemical cleansers or filmy soap!</li>
            <li> With the Oleavine Beauty sponge I know exactly what it is made of and it has no smell.</li>
            <li> It comes to you incredibly dry, but as soon as you add warm water to it, it really puffs up.</li>
            <li> 100% Natural, Eco Friendly and 100%</li>
            <li> Taking care of my face is how I plan to keep my skin fresh and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that there are no harsh chemicals in this Konjac sponge and that it is biodegradable and 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> - Soft enough for a baby&#x27;s skin while still providing effective exfoliation.</li>
            <li> The French Green Clay is ideally suited for oily skin</li>
            <li> With the pointed shape I was able to get into the tight spots around my nose where I tend to breakout, and did notice a significant change in the amount of breakouts I got while using</li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily skin, this product did not help at all.</li>
            <li> Good for occasional use on dry retin-a treated skin.</li>
            <li> we are used to in the states, but the acne that&#x27;s been on my left cheek for months has notably faded since I began use, so clearly it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Konjac Sponge - French Green Clay sponge come in a nice tear drop shape, which makes it easy to use around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This French green clay konjac sponge is luxuriously soft and is a great sponge for gently exfoliating/cleansing your skin!!</li>
            <li> It doesn’t really have a smell, just the sponge smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Airdrying didn&#x27;t really work for me and it started to smell after a while.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> I do not notice as much redness as before.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> DO NOT wring out as this will ruin its design, instead, just gently squeeze or scrunch it between your palms and then cleanse your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry especially since I use my face for so many things.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face with a gentle cleanser every night.</li>
            <li> shape of sponge is nice as I can use the point to get close to my eyes without getting soap in my eyes and the bigger side can be used on the bigger sections of my face and neck that I don&#x27;t have to be as cautions.</li>
            <li> Relaxing and gentle for daily use even on the most sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I love mine, it gets right next to next to my eye and nose without feeling like I am shoving a ball or fist in to my eye.</li>

            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this Konjac sponge, that is infused with French Green Clay, the first time I used it!  </li>
            <li> After using the Activated Charcoal and the French Green Clay, I have found the French Red Clay to be the best for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend giving this sponge a try.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you spend that $10.00 bucks, and try one of their sponges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shape allows me to get in all areas of my face but still big enough for a fast easy all over body exfoliation.</li>

            <li> My highly sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t even irritated the slightest bit.</li>
            <li> It is a nice generous size, and comes packaged dry and hard but softens up really quick once you get it completely wet.</li>

            <li> It is a nice generous size, and comes packaged dry and hard but softens up really quick once you get it completely wet.</li>
            <li> I love that it is not a hard rock nor its a harsh or rough material its 100% Natural Konjac Fiber.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates very gently and is not at all rough like a washcloth or loofah</li>
            <li> It really is gentle enough for daily use, even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This sponge was bigger than I had expected, you wet it apply your favorite cleanser and cleanse your face.</li>
            <li> The first impression I had of this Konjac sponge is that it was going to be rough against my face.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of my face wash directly on the sponge so that my face gets the clean feel and get rids of the dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> After using the sponge make sure to wash off the soap and air dry it, to increase its longevity else if it is wet for too long its falls apart</li>
            <li> These are gentle enough for daily exfoliation but if your face is oily, then you should also be using cleanser with it too.</li>
            <li> next day my skin looked clear and. . .</li>
            <li> If you never used a Konjac Sponge before, directions on how to use the sponge and how to properly take care of the sponge are clearly stated on the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it has changed the appearance of my skin, but it is very soothing to use.</li>
            <li> Not rough on the skin</li>
            <li> for exfoliating, but is just not firm enough for me.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin and there is no abrasiveness compared to other facial cleansing sponges.</li>
            <li> Plus, my face is usually super red from me scrubbing at my face to get dead skin off or working at some</li>
            <li> I saw a red one, a black one, and a red one, which is the one for Anti Aging, which is what I really need!!</li>
            <li> While both left my skin feeling soft and refreshed, for me, personally, the French Red Clay worked best--I found it to exfoliate my combination skin a little better than the Green Clay version and it left my skin smoother and tauter than when I started using it, without the drying effects of a stronger exfoliation product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One side of the sponge pores are very smooth and are not enough to exfoliate the skin properly, but the other side the pores are much bigger and at least you can feel it is exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li> This product will shrink back down to original size after it has dried.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my skin feels soft and pores are less apparent.</li>
            <li> I just press it between my palms until it is completely soft….softer than any other exfoliant that I’ve used in the past, yet it really feels like it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Not only is this sponge naturally pH balanced, and with proper care, doesn’t get stinky, but it’s INFUSED with French Green Clay!</li>
            <li> Once done, simply squeeze any excess water from the sponge and hang to dry by the string that’s attached to it.</li>
            <li> The Konjac Sponge infused with French Green Clay, by Oleavine, is 100% natural, biodegradable and Eco</li>
            <li> and I could even use a smaller amount directly on the sponge than I usually use with my finger so it will make my fash wash last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these konjac sponges sponges on alternate days, the French Red Clay one day, followed by the Green Clay the next, without any cleanser at all.</li>
            <li> It is a 100% Natural sponge made of Konjac fiber that exfoliates, cleanses, detoxes and refreshes and is infused with french green clay!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would exfoliate thoroughly, but it really seems to - while feeling soft against my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I first thought I would not complain about the product but have changed my mind due to being bombarded by e-mails vowing to be helpful and asking me not to post a negative review.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of hype for a sponge that is no different from any other sponge.  </li>
            <li> As far as texture, it definitely feels like konjac fiber, but it does not feel quite as hard as I&#x27;m used to these sponges</li>
            <li> It is about the size of my hand, and has a string attached so you can hang the sponge up to dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It is about the size of my hand, and has a string attached so you can hang the sponge up to dry.</li>
            <li> It comes hard, but when you wet it and use it, it&#x27;s very soft!</li>
            <li> I mean, it is hard as ever and doesn&#x27;t seem to be friendly against your face.</li>
            <li> I use a facial cleaner (a little goes a long way) with the sponge</li>
            <li> Now he does use but not all the time, typical teenage boy.&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;</li>
            <li> Alone it definitely did not clean my face at all, I rubbed it all over</li>
            <li> Alone it definitely did not clean my face at all, I rubbed it all over</li>
            <li> My family uses Clarisonic for cleaning their faces but I wanted to look for something that was less expensive and is environmental friendly.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for all natural products.</li>
            <li> It is also very lightweight and comes with a thin string to hang it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With care, I removed the wrap from the sponge being careful not to cut the string -</li>
            <li> It feels really rough</li>
            <li> make up that may have been left on and with the green clay</li>

            <li> It is also very lightweight and comes with a thin string to hang it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed a difference between the colors.</li>
            <li> Just enough texture to get the slim layer of any dead skin away.</li>
            <li> MIRACLE SPONGE&amp;#34; FOR YOUR DAILY BEAUTY REGIME - No other beauty sponge will work so hard for you!</li>
            <li> Now I was a bit skeptical because when I opened the box I found this hard lump of sponge and wondered how could this thing clean my face without tearing it to shreds?!</li>
            <li> My only trouble area is my nose and this has seemed to wash away the black heads and helped shrink my pores.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try their other Konjac products.</li>
            <li> sponge is bigger than some I&#x27;ve used in the past and has a raindrop shape.</li>
            <li> I had a rough time getting in to it, i even tried my teeth!</li>
            <li> so I cannot compare it with other products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t store this in the shower and treat it very carefully.</li>
            <li> I imagine the Konjac Sponge has a lot less mold that forms in it because it dries</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> You know that look you get when you&#x27;re a little flushed or blushing?</li>
            <li> I ended up getting scissors and digging in to the sponge a little.</li>
            <li> won’t be using this as a stand-alone product for face cleansing but as an addition to my face wash I would buy it if it is priced a little lower.</li>
            <li> it is apart of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> This Konjac sponge is a non-irritating sponge so you can say goodbye to harsh exfoliating methods that damage your skin &amp; don&#x27;t do the job they are suppose to.</li>
            <li> turn the water on and saturate the sponge with a few turns and I am already to start cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> We painstakingly evaluated countless Konjac sponges on the market before putting our reputation behind this beauty.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that the green clay in it adds anymore healing properties to it</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder unless the price comes down</li>
            <li> The sponge comes in a slick, upscale looking box trimmed with silver accents.  </li>
            <li> Going with the no cleanser method, I washed using small circular motions all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about using them for 3 months since they&#x27;re not self cleaning..</li>
            <li> The green clay helps absorb excess oils, impurities, yucky bacteria, and preps your skin to absorb whatever serums or creams you want to use!</li>
            <li> Using it alone it definitely did not clean my face at all, it still felt a bit oily and dirty.</li>
            <li> If you know what they are, you won’t be surprised by this, but I was!I’ll tell you, it felt a like very expensive piece of very stiff styrofoam.</li>
            <li> I wash my face at least twice a day and after a month of use I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> The voice on the phone said it was an inconvenient time to call, took my number and never called back.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive a suction cup with my sponge.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical when I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As someone that is obsessed with using Konjac sponges to exfoliate my face</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to the irritation caused by harsher exfoliating methods and expensive electronic gadgets.</li>
            <li> I was certainly skeptical -</li>
            <li> Would also help, if i had some nails to just tear the plastic with my fingernail, but no I can’t grow these suckers for the life of me :(</li>
            <li> and it still felt a bit oily and dirty.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t plan to use this one every day, but I will keep it in the weekly rotation to help keep my crazy combo skin in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using an artificial sponge from the drugstore and immediately felt the difference.</li>
            <li> and it still felt a bit oily and dirty.</li>

            <li> Love Oleavine products. I first used their French Red Clay all natural Konjac sponge and liked it. I thought I would try their other Konjac products. After using the Activated Charcoal and the French Green Clay, I have found the French Red Clay to be the best for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this Konjac sponge, that is infused with French Green Clay, the first time I used it!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and gentle the sponge was, after it was soaked in warm water and after cleansing my face with it!  It was almost like the sponge, itself, had moisturizers or something in it, to give it that silky sultry feeling.  I loved the teardrop shape, as it made it easy to get around the nose and eye area.&lt;br /&gt;For a sponge that is suppose to exfoliate and cleanse, this was the most gentle exfoliate I&#x27;ve ever used.  I also love the fact that there are no harsh chemicals in this Konjac sponge and that it is biodegradable and 100% natural.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It really makes skin soft. I also like the shape.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to try and review, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m torn between lowering to three stars and it being good enough for five so I&#x27;m going with four. It&#x27;s a sponge, a very nice sponge...but still just a sponge. It sounds great, but I&#x27;m not seeing any difference in my face that I wouldn&#x27;t get from using my face loofah pad or just my fingers or a washcloth. It is a nice generous size, and comes packaged dry and hard but softens up really quick once you get it completely wet. It is also very lightweight and comes with a thin string to hang it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any difference in my face using it, maybe I need more time?. Alone it definitely did not clean my face at all, I rubbed it all over and it still felt a bit oily and dirty. I put a small bit of my face cleanser on it and it spread it around on my face nicely and I could even use a smaller amount directly on the sponge than I usually use with my finger so it will make my fash wash last longer. After I have my face was lathered all over my face I rise the sponge out by flatting it between my hands like they say to do and then I run it over my face with just water to rinse the face wash off. Once I&#x27;ve done all this my face feels good and clean but for my face I definitely need some kind of soap on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of sponge is nice as I can use the point to get close to my eyes without getting soap in my eyes and the bigger side can be used on the bigger sections of my face and neck that I don&#x27;t have to be as cautions. One side of my sponge the pores are very smooth and absolutely does not exfoliate at all, but the other side the pores you can feel much more and though it&#x27;s not a rough exfoliation like a washcloth or loofah pad it still feels like it is doing something to your skin but very gently. Honestly it&#x27;s like the poor holes are smoothed or glossed over on on top and more real and natural on the bottom if that makes sense at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this sponge with my face wash as I do like how it will make it last longer, but as just a stand alone sponge I don&#x27;t feel that I would purchase this regularly.ill keep using this sponge with my face wash as I do like how it will make it last longer, but as just a stand alone sponge I don&#x27;t feel that I would purchase this regularly.</li>
            <li> The sponge comes in a slick, upscale looking box trimmed with silver accents.  The sponge is shrink-wrapped and comes with a string attached. Unfortunately, I did not receive a suction cup with my sponge. I doubled checked the box, but it was not there. Could have just been a packing error - or better yet, just my luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is bigger than some I&#x27;ve used in the past and has a raindrop shape. With care, I removed the wrap from the sponge being careful not to cut the string - yes I have done this before!  As far as texture, it definitely feels like konjac fiber, but it does not feel quite as hard as I&#x27;m used to these sponges feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to soak it in water and watch the magic happen.  It actually soaks up the water a bit faster, so I&#x27;m off and ready to cleanse my skin. Going with the no cleanser method, I washed using small circular motions all over my face.  Keeping in mind that I do have combination skin, I felt fine using this all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pressed the sponge free of water easily and hung it up to dry and took a look in the mirror.  You know that look you get when you&#x27;re a little flushed or blushing? That&#x27;s what my face looked like.  Let me explain myself.  It looked as if the sponge had indeed amped up the circulation in my face, leaving it with a glow.  The bonus - I felt like I had just had a quick facial massage - my face was feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day my skin looked clear and. . . dare I say. . .refreshed!  It&#x27;s officially a keeper!  However, I don&#x27;t plan to use this one every day, but I will keep it in the weekly rotation to help keep my crazy combo skin in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest pros?  The Oleavine Beauty Professional Konjac French Green Clay Infused Facial Sponge is 100% natural, biodegradable and sustainable.  Free of chemicals, pollutants and irritants. No artificial colors or preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest cons?  I didn&#x27;t get a hook - if they provide them - I don&#x27;t know - I didn&#x27;t get one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it&#x27;s still a great sponge and I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product in exchange for an honest review.*&lt;br /&gt;If you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.

            <li> This sponge is really cool. It feels really rough but once you get it good and wet, it softens up alot! It&#x27;s 100% natural and biodegradeable. I love that it contains no chemicals and you don&#x27;t even need to use cleanser. It&#x27;s shape allows me to get in all areas of my face but still big enough for a fast easy all over body exfoliation. I am so glad I recieved one for my review. I was very pleased with this sponge and with proper care it lasts a really long time. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these sponges, this is her second order</li>
            <li> Great feel on face after washing, the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical when I found this on Amazon. My family uses Clarisonic for cleaning their faces but I wanted to look for something that was less expensive and is environmental friendly. These are gentle enough for daily exfoliation but if your face is oily, then you should also be using cleanser with it too. I&#x27;m not sure about using them for 3 months since they&#x27;re not self cleaning..&lt;br /&gt; I have also found it easier to take off mascara with the sponge instead of just using my hands since you can run them around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it feels and how it cleans my skin.  I have been using for a moment and its really great. I&#x27;m going to buy everyone in the family one. I have it hanging in my shower it is apart of my everyday routine. I received the product free for using from tomoson</li>
            <li> I love this sponge because I can feel and see the difference in my face for the better. The design of the sponge allows me to easily clean my whole face without having to manipulate the sponge. I can feel my face being exfoliated while using this product. I use a facial cleaner (a little goes a long way) with the sponge and I can feel it being massaged into my pores. My face appears brighter, healthier, and firmer. If you never used a Konjac Sponge before, directions on how to use the sponge and how to properly take care of the sponge are clearly stated on the box. I would highly recommend giving this sponge a try. (I received this product complimentary to review, but my opinions are strictly my own.)</li>
            <li> This Beauty Konjac Sponge by Oleavine! Omg, This makes my face feel amazing!! Oleavine sent me this product for testing purposes and for my honest review of their product and I will forever be a believer of the Konjac Sponge. I had never tried a Konjac Sponge before, though I have heard an awful lot about them! I have been seeing them everywhere, people are talking and raving about them everywhere, though i had never tried one, till Oleavine was kind enough to offer me one of theirs! If you know what they are, you won’t be surprised by this, but I was!I’ll tell you, it felt a like very expensive piece of very stiff styrofoam. First of all, maybe a pull tab for opening the plastic, could be something to think about. I had a rough time getting in to it, i even tried my teeth! I ended up getting scissors and digging in to the sponge a little. Would also help, if i had some nails to just tear the plastic with my fingernail, but no I can’t grow these suckers for the life of me :( When I finally got it under warm water, it took less than a minute to become soft! I was amazed!! It doesn’t really have a smell, just the sponge smell. Not bad at all. You can use this with a cleanser or without, thats the cool thing! And like i said, it made my face feel amazing, my hands too! 100% Natural, Eco Friendly and 100% Biodegradable! Don’t even throw this away. Go outside, and bury it in your garden!!! How cool is that! I love the shape of it! I love the tear drop shape. It fits perfectly in my hand, which makes it nice rubbing it all over me in the shower! I highly recommend you spend that $10.00 bucks, and try one of their sponges. I saw a red one, a black one, and a red one, which is the one for Anti Aging, which is what I really need!! lol This one is more for if you suffer break outs and acne, and skin imperfections! I will be getting the red one soon!</li>
            <li> As someone that is obsessed with using Konjac sponges to exfoliate my face I was extremely excited to receive this product in the mail!! After trying this Oleavine all natural Konjac sponge I was extremely impressed. This French green clay konjac sponge is luxuriously soft and is a great sponge for gently exfoliating/cleansing your skin!! This sponge is naturally pH balanced &amp; helps absorb excess oils, impurities and acne causing bacteria!! This sponge leaves your face feeling refreshed and radiant after each and every use!! As someone with sensitive skin I have to say this sponge works great on sensitive skin!! This Konjac sponge is a non-irritating sponge so you can say goodbye to harsh exfoliating methods that damage your skin &amp; don&#x27;t do the job they are suppose to. This sponge works amazing with and without the use of a face cleanser!! It’s the perfect sponge to use to battle blackheads and breakouts!!  This Konjac sponge comes in a improved teardrop shape this ergonomically designed shape is made to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand while the soft rounded point of the sponge allows for gently exfoliating sensitive hard to reach areas of your face such as around your eyes and nose. This sponge is also 100% natural, eco-friendly and biodegradable with is a huge plus and a must for me when shopping for products!! This sponge is free from all chemicals and pollution and irritants!! I personally love this Oleavine French Clay Konjac sponge and would definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> i was amazed by how wonderful this product cleans, it feels so wonderful on my face</li>
            <li> Not too abrasive, yet does a great job scrubbing and leaves my skin feeling so clean. Really fun sponge!</li>
            <li> It feels nice on my skin so I liked using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Airdrying didn&#x27;t really work for me and it started to smell after a while. I tried washing it with soap but maybe it&#x27;s because I use an organic facial cleaner with it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was good and useful. Wasn&#x27;t miraculous or anything but it is definitely perfect for gentle scrubbing.</li>
            <li> All is well with the Konjac sponge.  I have tried a couple of them now and am very satisfied with the product.  They are very gentle for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked other Konjac Sponges more, this one smelled bacteria&#x27;ish by the end of its use which doesn&#x27;t normally happen for me with using these.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> This sponge was bigger than I had expected, you wet it apply your favorite cleanser and cleanse your face. This product will shrink back down to original size after it has dried. Overall I enjoyed this sponge!!!</li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily skin, this product did not help at all. I did not feel that it did a good job of cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> Works great , simple to use. Not rough on the skin , I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin but I still continue to use this.</li>
            <li> This sponge feels so good against my skin. I had been using an artificial sponge from the drugstore and immediately felt the difference. I&#x27;m not sure how much it has changed the appearance of my skin, but it is very soothing to use.</li>
            <li> Shaving your face daily. Asian women have done it for centuries. Wash face, shave, then moisturise. I&#x27;ve been doing it for 20 years. Of course, it helps to have good genes...</li>
            <li> I love that it cleans and exfoliates with out being harsh on my skin. It comes hard, but when you wet it and use it, it&#x27;s very soft! I&#x27;ve always used a loofah or washcloth to clean my skin. I imagine the Konjac Sponge has a lot less mold that forms in it because it dries quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there is no bad chemicals in it. My skin is sensitive. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a blogger, and got this product for review. I do state my true and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> love this product but its pricey so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder unless the price comes down</li>
            <li> I love mine, it gets right next to next to my eye and nose without feeling like I am shoving a ball or fist in to my eye. It also leaves my face feeling smooth and clean, not like I missed something or that the sponge did not do it&#x27;s job. Nor do I have to stand around waiting for it to get water soaked in just to use it. Which, I love I can walk in there turn the water on and saturate the sponge with a few turns and I am already to start cleaning my face. Plus, my face is usually super red from me scrubbing at my face to get dead skin off or working at some make up that may have been left on and with the green clay I do not notice as much redness as before. I so cannot wait to try them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> When I got my Konjac Facial Sponge I was really excited to try it out. Now I was a bit skeptical because when I opened the box I found this hard lump of sponge and wondered how could this thing clean my face without tearing it to shreds?! But once you rinse the sponge in warm water it absorbs the water and turns into a soft sponge. I really liked the sponge and the way it left my face clean and glowing afterward. This is far better than any sponge I have used before and does way more than just cleansing my face. It was soft and didn’t irritate my skin. With the pointed shape I was able to get into the tight spots around my nose where I tend to breakout, and did notice a significant change in the amount of breakouts I got while using it.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review purposes and only give honest feedback. All opinions are always my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these konjac sponges sponges on alternate days, the French Red Clay one day, followed by the Green Clay the next, without any cleanser at all. While both left my skin feeling soft and refreshed, for me, personally, the French Red Clay worked best--I found it to exfoliate my combination skin a little better than the Green Clay version and it left my skin smoother and tauter than when I started using it, without the drying effects of a stronger exfoliation product. Overall, totally worth the money! Pick one up and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> This sponge did nothing for me. Waste of money. This company is laughing all the way to the bank. Please don&#x27;t fall for the hype like I did. NO stars, I had to put one star to put in this review.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin and there is no abrasiveness compared to other facial cleansing sponges. It left my skin soft, smooth, and helped to control the oiliness of my skin. Great customer service from Oleavine too!</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge and the pureSOL konjac sponge at the same time and used both. I found the pureSOL sponge to have a better composite and overall effectiveness. This sponge is no doubt o.k. for exfoliating, but is just not firm enough for me. Its shape is off.</li>
            <li> This sponge is the perfect texture to gently exfoliate while still being super soft! The size and shape of the sponge is also great for facial cleansing. I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost a week and have already noticed some improvement in my skins appearance.  I will definitely be ordering another one of these!</li>

Our Konjac fiber is grown on the pristine volcanic plains of Jeju Island in South Korea, free from chemicals, pollution and irritants. The sponge hydrates quickly, and lasts longer with proper care than others we tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to be using this facial sponge, I use it in the morning and at night. I love that it is not a hard rock nor its a harsh or rough material its 100% Natural Konjac Fiber. I love it because even though it&#x27;s soft, as soon as I add water it cleanses and exfoliate my face. I don&#x27;t even need to put any face wash on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what I do is wash my face with the face wash or exfolient and then I rinse the sponge with warm water, let it absorb the water then I message my face with the sponge. It leaves my face glowing and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It states that the sponge gently exfoliates, cleanses, is naturally ph balanced, promotes circulation, absorbs toxins and fights bacteria while leaving your face glowing and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;By my experience with it, it does promotes circulation because it leaves my face glowing and soft, that it feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to try and review, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac Sponge - French Green Clay sponge come in a nice tear drop shape, which makes it easy to use around the eyes. It is a nice generous size, and came packaged dry and hard but softens up quickly once it is completely wet. It is also very lightweight and comes with a thin string to hang it on.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used any sponge particularly for my face before so I cannot compare it with other products. By using the product I don&#x27;t see any difference in my face using it, maybe I need more time. Using it alone it definitely did not clean my face at all, it still felt a bit oily and dirty. I use a small amount of my face wash directly on the sponge so that my face gets the clean feel and get rids of the dirt and oil. After lathering I flatten the sponge in between hands (as they said to do) and rinse off the lather by running it over my face. After using the sponge make sure to wash off the soap and air dry it, to increase its longevity else if it is wet for too long its falls apart very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side of the sponge pores are very smooth and are not enough to exfoliate the skin properly, but the other side the pores are much bigger and at least you can feel it is exfoliating your skin. It exfoliates very gently and is not at all rough like a washcloth or loofah pad.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I must say about the price $10 for  a sponge seems too much, after all it&#x27;s a sponge, may be its of 100% natural still I feel the price is a bit high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won’t be using this as a stand-alone product for face cleansing but as an addition to my face wash I would buy it if it is priced a little lower.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect gift for my mom who loves to pamper herself.  She has fantastic skin for 82 years old.  I know she will get plenty of use out of them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I use it most for scrubbing my face. It really makes your skin feel clean and fresh. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The shape of sponge is nice as I can use the point to get close to my eyes without getting soap in my eyes and the bigger side can be used on the bigger sections of my face and neck that I don&#x27;t have to be as cautions. The Konjac Sponge infused with French Green Clay, by Oleavine, is 100% natural, biodegradable and Eco-Friendly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sponge, a very nice sponge...but still just a sponge. It sounds great, but I&#x27;m not seeing any difference in my face that I wouldn&#x27;t get from using my face washcloth. One side of my sponge the pores are very smooth and absolutely does not exfoliate at all, but the other side the pores you can feel much more and though it&#x27;s not a rough exfoliation like a washcloth and feels like it is doing something to your skin but very gently. Once I&#x27;ve done washing, my face feels good but definitely need some kind of soap on it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any difference in my face using it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It was non-irritating on my skin and I recommend it to even the most sensitive skin types in terms of its texture and ability to give skin smoothness.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to review this sponge from Oleavine. This is an exfoliating facial sponge that gently cleans your face. I have washed my face a few times with this sponge and really like the effects of it. I wouldn&#x27;t say that the green clay in it adds anymore healing properties to it but the sponge is really nice and very easy to hold and clean your face. Overall it is a good quality.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to try and review, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sponge, a very nice sponge...but still just a sponge.

Honestly it&#x27;s like the poor holes are smoothed or glossed over on on top and more real and natural on the bottom if that makes sense at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this sponge with my face wash as I do like how it will make it last longer, but as just a stand alone sponge I don&#x27;t feel that I would purchase this regularly.</li>
            <li> This sponge is all natural, biodegradable, and is Eco-Friendly. I love that this sponge is so Earth-friendly. It is a 100% Natural sponge made of Konjac fiber that exfoliates, cleanses, detoxes and refreshes and is infused with french green clay! The first impression I had of this Konjac sponge is that it was going to be rough against my face. I mean, it is hard as ever and doesn&#x27;t seem to be friendly against your face. When wet, however, this is the most softest sponge ever! The best way to describe it is comparing it to squishing soft rice against your fingers, without the stickiness of course! It is soooo soft! It is so gentle that you almost think you cannot get any makeup off your face because its too soft but it gets the job done. It has a teardrop shape that makes it easy to get around super hard to reach areas such as your eye area and around the nose. The sponge is gentle on the face and does not leave your skin red or irritated. The directions on this sponge state that you do not need to use or add any cleansers to the sponge, unless you want to then feel free to. All you need to do is soak it in warm water until it is fully saturated and then proceed to use it.  DO NOT wring out as this will ruin its design, instead, just gently squeeze or scrunch it between your palms and then cleanse your face. Once done, simply squeeze any excess water from the sponge and hang to dry by the string that’s attached to it. That&#x27;s it! I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The Beauty Sponge arrived shrink wrapped. It is about the size of my hand, and has a string attached so you can hang the sponge up to dry. I was surprised that the sponge did not grow much when I soaked it in water. However, it did get extremely soft! I cannot even begin to describe how soft and luxurious this sponge felt on my skin. It glided over easily, and felt so, so nice. My skin has been dry and flaky, and I couldn’t believe how soft and smooth it felt after using this sponge just one time! I really loved the process of cleansing with this sponge and can’t wait to continue using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this Beauty Sponge can be used with cleanser, I chose to test it without any additional product. I was again happy to see that it removed my makeup and left my skin clear and soft. I have to say this product lives up to all of the brand’s claims! Plus, I love that Oleavine created a product that is 100% natural and vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review on my blog: http://adventures-in-polishland.com/2015/01/12/oleavine-beauty-100-natural-french-green-tea-infused-beauty-sponge-review/</li>
            <li> Good for occasional use on dry retin-a treated skin. Don&#x27;t store this in the shower and treat it very carefully.</li>
            <li> I got this tear shaped sponge which I gave to my nephew for his acne skin. I have dry skin and I did try it before giving it to my nephew. The Beauty Sponge arrived shrink wrapped. It is about the size of my hand, and has a string attached so you can hang the sponge up to dry. I was surprised that the sponge did not grow much when I soaked it in water. However, it did get extremely soft! I cannot even begin to describe how soft and luxurious this sponge felt on my skin. It glided over easily, and felt so, so nice. My skin has been dry and flaky, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth it felt after using this sponge just one time! I use it on my nephew’s face who has acne, teenager. His skin felt and looked better after teaching him on how to use it. Now he does use but not all the time, typical teenage boy.&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
            <li> Good exfoliating sponge. Gets in all the corners well. I have not really noticed a difference between the colors. They are each supposed to do something different, but I don&#x27;t notice it. I have tried four different ones. A little expensive, but they last a long time. I was fortunate to get these on sale.</li>
            <li> I like sponges to wash my face because it is gentler on skin than a wash cloth. This soft sponge is makes my skin feel instantly soft after I wash my face. while this says you can use it without a cleanser, I did not feel as if my skin was as clean. My oily skin needs the extra of a cleanser. I wash my face at least twice a day and after a month of use I had to throw it away. I like this a lot. I just wish they would last longer.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of hype for a sponge that is no different from any other sponge.  I called the  maker as requested to in several e-mails.  The voice on the phone said it was an inconvenient time to call, took my number and never called back.  I first thought I would not complain about the product but have changed my mind due to being bombarded by e-mails vowing to be helpful and asking me not to post a negative review.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works as scrub for my sensitive skin. Always get pretty pinkish complexion after using it.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what these sponges were about, but I&#x27;ve been seeing more of them and was happy to try when Oleavine sent me one for testing purposes. I was certainly skeptical - the sponge is so soft that your face doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really being cleaned. On top of that, you don&#x27;t even have to use a cleanser. Since I wear makeup, I use the sponge with a cream cleanser (the only kind recommended for use with the sponge). It&#x27;s definitely different - it&#x27;s not the sudsy, squeaky clean we are used to in the states, but the acne that&#x27;s been on my left cheek for months has notably faded since I began use, so clearly it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I own a few of these. LOVE LOVE LOVE them. Great for exfoliating!</li>
            <li> If you haven’t tried one of these amazing Japanese Konjac sponges yet, you REALLY need to get with the times, and try one of these out! They provide natural exfoliation beyond my wildest dreams! Let me tell you everything I know about them:&lt;br /&gt;This sponge has an amazing teardrop shape, which is suitable for large areas of the face or body, and a smaller section which is absolutely perfect for smaller areas, such as those around the nose and eyes! It comes to you incredibly dry, but as soon as you add warm water to it, it really puffs up. I just press it between my palms until it is completely soft….softer than any other exfoliant that I’ve used in the past, yet it really feels like it gets the job done! According to Oleavine, the Konjac fiber for their sponges is grown on the ‘pristine volcanic plains of Jeju Island in South Korea, free from chemicals, pollution and irritants’.  It really is gentle enough for daily use, even on sensitive skin. You can use this all by itself, or with your favorite cleanser, to battle blackheads and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t even talked about the BEST PART YET! Not only is this sponge naturally pH balanced, and with proper care, doesn’t get stinky, but it’s INFUSED with French Green Clay! The green clay helps absorb excess oils, impurities, yucky bacteria, and preps your skin to absorb whatever serums or creams you want to use! They also offer a money-back guarantee, but I don’t feel like you’ll be pushing for your money back anytime soon! Just take care of it, and It’ll take care of you!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who wants a great way to cleanse the face, without having to use harsh chemical cleansers or filmy soap! I received this konjac sponge for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use. I was not told what to say, only asked to give an honest review based on my own experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of Konjac Sponges before.  They come infused with different clay that are designed to help with different skin conditions.  The French Green Clay is ideally suited for oily skin so I gave it to my daughter.  She loved it.  As someone who hates using chemicals on her face the Konjac sponge gave her a pure way to clear up her acne outbreaks and it&#x27;s super gentle.  Will definitely purchase again.

            <li> 100% Natural is what loured me in like a kid to a candy store. So many sponges come with a weird smell or have added textures but no ingredients. Knowing what is in my facial item is a must at all times. With the Oleavine Beauty sponge I know exactly what it is made of and it has no smell. I am a sucker for all natural products. When we live in a world where you have more chemicals, recalls, poor businesses taking the quality right out of our products. It&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry especially since I use my face for so many things. Taking care of my face is how I plan to keep my skin fresh and vibrant. This sponge is actually pretty soft compared to it&#x27;s store bought competitors. It did not feel as if I was scratch myself nor too light like a dish sponge. Just enough texture to get the slim layer of any dead skin away. Afterwards my skin feels soft and pores are less apparent. My highly sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t even irritated the slightest bit. I love this sponge!! My only downfall when using the Oleavine Beauty is the string. The string either needs to be a bit longer or thicker. Either though the sponge is wonderful and gentle. - See more at: http://www.frugalmomandwife.com/2015/01/oleavine-beauty-professional-100.html</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I was skeptical that it would exfoliate thoroughly, but it really seems to - while feeling soft against my skin at the same time. I use it on my face with a gentle cleanser every night.</li>
            <li> This sponge is simply amazing. I received this for review and I am so glad I did. The Konjac sponge has left my skin super soft. My only trouble area is my nose and this has seemed to wash away the black heads and helped shrink my pores. I am so happy with this sponge! It is well made and was shipped in the box in plastic to help keep it fresh and clean.</li>
