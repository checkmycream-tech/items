            <li>I love these nail art decorations, they came on time and as described by seller!</li>
            <li>Nice colors but</li>
            <li>they came nicely wrapped.</li>
            <li>just need to make sure you have a really good sealing polish for them</li>
            <li>I liked all the colors that it had to offer.</li>
            <li>Would have liked if some of the MASH products would come with a glue to apply, but a dot of top coat on a piece of parchment paper and a wood stick are magical things.</li>
            <li>just given how cheap it was, but it came quickly with over 100 pieces of most colors and in a great sturdy storage case.</li>
            <li>The rhinestones are awesome, but they&#x27;ve got all mixed up in the container during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have so many uses in nail art.  </li>
            <li>Buy them, use them, love them:)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay atleast for me .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy and would totally order these again.</li>
            <li>I have used these on many occasions and have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>My daughters love to &#x27;glam up&#x27; their nails, but I have no interest in paying salon prices for my wee ones.  </li>
            <li>would recommend buying this product for sure :)</li>
            <li>so it was fine and great for nail art and not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>More importantly, these are some of the cheapest rhinestones you&#x27;ll find on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>and careful of moving the disc where you want it sometimes things fly out!</li>
            <li>Easy to pick up with fine-tip tweezers.</li>
            <li>easy to put on.</li>
            <li>otherwise they come off as easy as pie.</li>
            <li>These are great little gems that look nice and were easy to apply with topcoat.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted! :)</li>
            <li>The price is fabulous and the quality exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li>This seller offers a GREAT alternative for anyone willing to do it themselves.  </li>
            <li>One or two single stones are good, but more than that started to look a bit gaudy.  </li>
            <li>Even for half the number, this is definitely worth the price, and I will happily buy more when I run out of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was such a great purchase for the price , not to mention shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>These are such a nice workable size and the colors are so pretty!</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>For the price, the crappy advertising is still worth it for what I need.</li>
            <li>but I can see how they are just right for nails.</li>
            <li>These build up static electricity, so the gems kinda get everywhere and mix together when you open the container.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only other issue I experienced was that my gems showed up in one of those wheel holders, not the (much handier) clasp holder shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>I tend to be hard on my nails and was looking for something that looks good but wouldn&#x27;t cost me a lot.</li>
            <li>She uses them when she&#x27;s doing Acrylic Nails and absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nowhere.</li>
            <li>First off, there is NO WHERE near 1200 pieces in here.</li>
            <li>Really vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>overall, definitely recommend, and even ordered myself a 2nd right away :)</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic product for anyone interested in a little sparkle and uniqueness to their makeup, nail art, crafts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say MAYBE half that amount, but I&#x27;m thinking more like a third.</li>
            <li>My coworkers are surprised I do the designs myself.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order things like this, even though the items are no where near what&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d cost five times as much for me to buy this stuff locally.</li>
            <li>i love the tear drop shape too as a little something different from the usual round rhinestones, makes it easy to make some cute shapes too by using a few (bows, hearts, etc).  </li>
            <li>i was a little hesitant at first</li>
            <li>The container is a little large and makes it look like you got hosed on the quantity</li>

            <li> The color is vibrant and the shapes are well-defined, but they are a little too big to do any designs on my nails.  </li>
            <li> in packaging they got a little mixed and were in a loose rhinestone wheel but didnt mix so much</li>
            <li> Small than expected but pretty</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t sort them out like other people did, but it&#x27;ll be pain in the neck to pick up the same color from different sections.</li>
            <li> These are teeny tiny jewels and ended up being too small for the craft product I was doing</li>
            <li> It was as described, but not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to waste my time counting them though....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst though, I&#x27;ll probably just buy a new organizer at a craft store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they just put a random sprinkle of each color in the wheel and call it a day.</li>

            <li> I have reordered again  good qiality</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are awesome, but they&#x27;ve got all mixed up in the container during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t sort them out like other people did, but it&#x27;ll be pain in the neck to pick up the same color from different sections.</li>
            <li> Small than expected but pretty</li>
            <li> These are great little gems that look nice and were easy to apply with topcoat. I&#x27;m not gonna count, but just by looking it&#x27;s obvious that there is not 100 of each color. It looks closer to 50 each. Even for half the number, this is definitely worth the price, and I will happily buy more when I run out of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other issue I experienced was that my gems showed up in one of those wheel holders, not the (much handier) clasp holder shown in the picture. These build up static electricity, so the gems kinda get everywhere and mix together when you open the container.

            <li> Easy to pick up with fine-tip tweezers. Really vibrant colors. Would have liked if some of the MASH products would come with a glue to apply, but a dot of top coat on a piece of parchment paper and a wood stick are magical things. The container is a little large and makes it look like you got hosed on the quantity though - they could do with a smaller wheel.</li>
            <li> These rain drop rhinestones have so many uses in nail art.  More importantly, these are some of the cheapest rhinestones you&#x27;ll find on amazon.com.  Buy them, use them, love them:)</li>
            <li> Nice colors but in packaging they got a little mixed and were in a loose rhinestone wheel but didnt mix so much so it was fine and great for nail art and not expensive at all. Great buy for your money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! :)</li>
            <li> These are just the perfect size for my fingernail projects</li>
            <li> It took a month to get this item. It was as described, but not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This was such a great purchase for the price , not to mention shipping was super fast it came three days before the estimated delivery date . I was upset to see that it came in a wheel instead of the case shown in the picture but it&#x27;s okay atleast for me . I would purchase again .</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. She uses them when she&#x27;s doing Acrylic Nails and absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> The colors were all intermingled when it arrived</li>
            <li> Perfect, good product :-)</li>
            <li> These are such a nice workable size and the colors are so pretty! I&#x27;m very happy and would totally order these again.</li>
            <li> These are a great buy! I have looked all over for nail art rhinestones that are inexpensive and these are it. I tend to be hard on my nails and was looking for something that looks good but wouldn&#x27;t cost me a lot. I have used these on many occasions and have gotten many compliments. My coworkers are surprised I do the designs myself. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product for anyone interested in a little sparkle and uniqueness to their makeup, nail art, crafts. i was a little hesitant at first just given how cheap it was, but it came quickly with over 100 pieces of most colors and in a great sturdy storage case. i love the tear drop shape too as a little something different from the usual round rhinestones, makes it easy to make some cute shapes too by using a few (bows, hearts, etc).  overall, definitely recommend, and even ordered myself a 2nd right away :)</li>

This seller offers a GREAT alternative for anyone willing to do it themselves.  The price is fabulous and the quality exceeds my expectations.  I recommend this without any reservations.</li>
            <li> they came nicely wrapped. easy to put on. just need to make sure you have a really good sealing polish for them otherwise they come off as easy as pie. and careful of moving the disc where you want it sometimes things fly out!</li>

            <li> perfect loved it! worth every pennyperfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is the third set of rhinestone I&#x27;ve purchased and these are the biggest.  The color is vibrant and the shapes are well-defined, but they are a little too big to do any designs on my nails.  One or two single stones are good, but more than that started to look a bit gaudy.  I will use these on my toes.</li>
            <li> This was a great wheel of rhinestones. I&#x27;ve used a ton and still have a ton left! I liked all the colors that it had to offer.</li>
            <li> Alright... First off, there is NO WHERE near 1200 pieces in here. NO WAY IN H*LL. Absolutely nowhere. I can&#x27;t stress that enough. I&#x27;d say MAYBE half that amount, but I&#x27;m thinking more like a third. I&#x27;m not going to waste my time counting them though.... Anywho, I purchased two of these because I use a lot of gems and rhinestones to decorate random things, mostly lighters. I will continue to order things like this, even though the items are no where near what&#x27;s advertised. For the price, the crappy advertising is still worth it for what I need. It&#x27;d cost five times as much for me to buy this stuff locally. I&#x27;ve attached a picture comparing the advertised picture and the two wheels that I actually received to show the actual amount you get. Even the two wheels I got had completely different amounts of gems, as shown in the picture. It&#x27;s like they just put a random sprinkle of each color in the wheel and call it a day. I hope this review was helpful for some of you. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love these nail art decorations, they came on time and as described by seller! would recommend buying this product for sure :)</li>
