            <li>Literally 1 minute, magic!</li>
            <li>My hands felt amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I have even tried whipping up my own homemade remedies.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take a lot so adjust usage to your own need.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great &#x27;quick fix&#x27; to soften and exfoliate your hands and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I have given many for gifts as it is very good for the woman who does not have time for a lot of pampering but still wants her hands and nails to look healthy and nice.</li>
            <li>the product works as advertised; great scent, and my hands/feet began to look/feel better after the first application.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>(I also use nail hardener (Nail Techniques) and top coat (Out the Door), but this is the product that helps my  cuticles.)</li>
            <li>This item is good for your hands (and feet)and the $ amount is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>and they even sent some free samples!</li>
            <li>Smelled nice, light minty scent, too.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love One Minute Manicure.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>Now that I am on my own, however, I cannot afford to get manicures anymore, so I give light ones to myself.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>I like the Pineapple better.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years, and have found it to be the fastest, easiest, and best way to moisturize hands, nails, and cuticles.</li>
            <li>My hands are so soft and my cuticles look great</li>
            <li>Love the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet look straight from the pedicure shop fresh, shiny and well moisturized, and it even makes cuticles look great.....</li>
            <li>Also, if you have a cut, you may want to forego the one-minute manicure until the cut heals, since the sea salt in the manicure is a bit strong and does tend to sting if there&#x27;s an opening in the skin.</li>
            <li>However, from the first time I tried it, I liked it.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you work it into your hands for the full minute.</li>
            <li>And then rinse your hands with warm to hot water.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best product on the market for exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li>I like the exfoliation benefits for my hands -- leaves them smooth and moist.  </li>
            <li>Your hands will be exfoliated and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I love to use it right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have been using this since I first saw the inventor on the Oprah show many years ago.  </li>
            <li>After working in the yard I use this scrub to clean and moisturize my hands and knees</li>
            <li>manicure is great at at rejuvenating my feet after hours of exposure to rough sand.  </li>
            <li>and I just love the smell and feel so much</li>
            <li>I still love it just as much.</li>
            <li>Now 6 hours later my hands are still silky smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other scrubs, and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid gardener and need all the help I can find!  </li>
            <li>and it is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a better product to ensure soft hands.</li>
            <li>But it isn&#x27;t as effective as it is with dry hands.</li>
            <li>The oils used in this are very nice, but the sea salt is very harsh.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of different products but this is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it often as it is an oil product and doesn&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li>This is gentle enough to use more than once a day as well.  </li>
            <li>I first learned about this product from my manicurist when my mom would pay for manicures when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>and it was packed very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>When using this, really concentrate around each nail cuticle.  </li>
            <li>The salt worked ok at removing the rough skin</li>
            <li>so I can really wash on the remaining residue after I use it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t have wet hands before using it.</li>
            <li>My hands look and feel much softer after using this.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but it didn&#x27;t come with a spoon as it says, which makes it more difficult to scoop.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Pineapple cost a little more.</li>
            <li>In fact, as I type this I just sent my hubby out for a new jar.</li>
            <li>and the 13oz should last a long time as it doesn&#x27;t take much to make your hands/feet feel smooth, soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>If you use this consistently, you will definitely see improvement in your nails and hands.  </li>
            <li>Love it, will try some of the other scents when I get low on this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several others, mostly because they were less expensive,but none of them worked as well.  </li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It leaves a silkiness on your hands after using that isn&#x27;t oily at all, which is what I was expecting, so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It scrubs your hand and cleans and moisturizes your nails like no other product.  </li>
            <li>Then when you rinse, your hands are left baby skin soft!</li>
            <li>Besides working really well, an additional positive feature is that it takes such a little amount to do the job.</li>
            <li>They will remain soft the entire day.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the one shipped to me must&#x27;ve been old because it smelled really bad and the consistency wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this, although keeping it near my sink with a real plastic spoon to keep the mess at a minimum.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other than the Classic Mint</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and get hangnails frequently.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other than the Classic Mint</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and get hangnails frequently.</li>
            <li> Jar will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use, and it is simply a must have essential to keep by all your sinks.  </li>
            <li> I play sand volleyball all summer long and one minute</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> and I have tried tons of products for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry cuticles and split nails.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting something a little different</li>
            <li> Makes it harder to use.</li>
            <li> If you use this daily I have found it helped to keep the dead skin and rough cuticles in tow.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this</li>
            <li> At first I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This year I purchased several of the small 3 oz bottles for Christmas gift bags to get my friends and family to try it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> As a result, one jar lasts for several months (at least).</li>
            <li> I guess.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely greasy!</li>
            <li> I opened it and attempted to stir it up with the &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34;, it made an oily mess all over the counter.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a less messy way to use it.  </li>
            <li> Boggles the mind at how this little product works</li>
            <li> that you by fresh at the store, which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing</li>
            <li> I usually give up and send my hubby to Wegman&#x27;s for a jar.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a small bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to use it every day at least once</li>
            <li> My husbands&#x27; feet were a train wreck- dry, dry, dry and his cuticles looked horrible.  </li>
            <li> My hand were so ugly and dry and after using this, they look youthful and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34; included was a lame wedge of plastic.  </li>
            <li> dry, brittle and cuticles end up bloody and painful.  </li>
            <li> I used the one minute manicure nightly for a week, and it dried my cuticles out terribly.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> It was too painful to use on my hands; I used it on my feet a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it before you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m going to have to spend the $35 for Satin Hands after all :(</li>

            <li> Best foot and hand scrub ever.  Love the original fragrance. Always keep it in stock friends....you will really love it!</li>
            <li> The oils used in this are very nice, but the sea salt is very harsh.  It was too painful to use on my hands; I used it on my feet a couple of times.  But I ended up just throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a less messy way to use it.  Always end up with oil around my sink.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was a teenager. There is NOTHING on the market like it and I have tried tons of products for dry skin. I have even tried whipping up my own homemade remedies. I usually give up and send my hubby to Wegman&#x27;s for a jar. It is hands down the best product on the market for exfoliating your skin. In fact, as I type this I just sent my hubby out for a new jar. It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> the product works as advertised; great scent, and my hands/feet began to look/feel better after the first application. My husband works outside occasionally, and he uses the product to help soften his hands as well. We love this product!</li>
            <li> Freat for the feet too!</li>
            <li> Repeat customer....I LOVE this product.  When used 1-2 times weekly, it helps not only the nails, but the cuticles as well.  I am an avid gardener and need all the help I can find!  (I also use nail hardener (Nail Techniques) and top coat (Out the Door), but this is the product that helps my  cuticles.)</li>
            <li> Works great. My hands are so soft and my cuticles look great</li>
            <li> I love this product but the one shipped to me must&#x27;ve been old because it smelled really bad and the consistency wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other than the Classic Mint and I just love the smell and feel so much, I can&#x27;t bear to even try any of the others, but they may be just as great.  If you use this consistently, you will definitely see improvement in your nails and hands.  I like the exfoliation benefits for my hands -- leaves them smooth and moist.  And without using this in the winter, my cuticles and nails get dry, brittle and cuticles end up bloody and painful.  I have been using this since I first saw the inventor on the Oprah show many years ago.  I have given many for gifts as it is very good for the woman who does not have time for a lot of pampering but still wants her hands and nails to look healthy and nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s a great &#x27;quick fix&#x27; to soften and exfoliate your hands and cuticles.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and my hands feel amazing when I use it.  Very nice packaging.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This item is good for your hands (and feet)and the $ amount is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it every day at least once and you can feel the change in&lt;br /&gt;your hands. I use it every morning when I take my morning shower and every&lt;br /&gt;evening when I take my shower before I go to bed. this is a great product&lt;br /&gt;and anyone that have cuticle or problems with your hands; this is the&lt;br /&gt;product for you.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product. My hand were so ugly and dry and after using this, they look youthful and hydrated. I like to apply it and then use cotton gloves to let the product absorb into my skin. Then, I wash off and apply hand lotion. I look like a hand model!</li>
            <li> Definitely a great manicure in a minute! I so love this product! You will notice a difference immediately after using this product. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other scrubs, and this one is by far the best.  It makes my feet look straight from the pedicure shop fresh, shiny and well moisturized, and it even makes cuticles look great.....one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li> If you use this daily I have found it helped to keep the dead skin and rough cuticles in tow. The price is perfect. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot so adjust usage to your own need.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Love this product and it was packed very well and they even sent some free samples! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I got this stuff today.  At first I was not impressed. The &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34; included was a lame wedge of plastic.  I opened it and attempted to stir it up with the &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34;, it made an oily mess all over the counter. Did the best I could with it though, the applied the goop and massaged it in, then rinsing well. Wow. My hands felt amazing. Smelled nice, light minty scent, too.  Now 6 hours later my hands are still silky smooth and nice. I will definitely be using this, although keeping it near my sink with a real plastic spoon to keep the mess at a minimum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since the product&#x27;s inception.  The gal who invented this was brilliant--just wished I&#x27;d thought of it sooner!!  This couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use, and it is simply a must have essential to keep by all your sinks.  I use it every am, then follow with my fave hand cream, put on my rings, and then I know my hands look their best for the day.  This is gentle enough to use more than once a day as well.  I like to use it (I forget to use my rubber gloves sometimes) after washing some of the dishes after having a gathering.  It makes your hands feel great once again.  When using this, really concentrate around each nail cuticle.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at the results, and for you gals with shellac manicures, no worries--just makes manis even prettier!  This is one product I can&#x27;t be without!!</li>
            <li> A must-have for hand care.</li>
            <li> I discovered this several years ago when Oprah had it on her show.  I still love it just as much. I have tried lots of different products but this is still my favorite. This year I purchased several of the small 3 oz bottles for Christmas gift bags to get my friends and family to try it.  I saw a comment that it is pricey.  A little bit goes a long way with this and it is well worth the price.  I love to use it right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love One Minute Manicure.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it before you will not be disappointed.  It does a great  job exfoliating and softening hands and feet.  I play sand volleyball all summer long and one minute manicure is great at at rejuvenating my feet after hours of exposure to rough sand.  Definitely worth the price and the 13oz should last a long time as it doesn&#x27;t take much to make your hands/feet feel smooth, soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> After two night&#x27;s use, my hands are noticeably softer, and my cuticles aren&#x27;t so...crazy.  It leaves a silkiness on your hands after using that isn&#x27;t oily at all, which is what I was expecting, so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Product seems like it would work well, but the jar leaked like a sieve &amp; all the oil drained out. Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Shows picture with a wooden spoon to scoop it up and use. However there was not one with package. Makes it harder to use.</li>
            <li> Ten years ago my wife suggested that I try the one-minute manicure. I was skeptical at first. However, from the first time I tried it, I liked it. I have been using it daily ever since. I can&#x27;t think of a better product to ensure soft hands. Besides working really well, an additional positive feature is that it takes such a little amount to do the job. As a result, one jar lasts for several months (at least). Today I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I just hope that it remains on the market until the day I die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple tips: Make sure that you work it into your hands for the full minute. And then rinse your hands with warm to hot water. After this, put some lotion on your hands. They will remain soft the entire day. Also, if you have a cut, you may want to forego the one-minute manicure until the cut heals, since the sea salt in the manicure is a bit strong and does tend to sting if there&#x27;s an opening in the skin.</li>
            <li> this is wonderful stuff.  After working in the yard I use this scrub to clean and moisturize my hands and knees</li>
            <li> I was going to order the Mary Kay Satin Hands because I tried it once and it was amazing! Unfortunately it was more than I wanted to pay so I found good reviews for One Minute Manicure and really liked the price so I ordered a small bottle. I was looking forward to the mint scent but it literally smells like mint that you by fresh at the store, which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing but I was expecting something a little different I guess.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely greasy! I have to keep wiping my hands. It feels just like baby oil would. It just leaves an oily residue on your skin for hours. The salt worked ok at removing the rough skin but it&#x27;s nothing compared to that Mary Kay product. I think I will use this product in the shower from now on so I can really wash on the remaining residue after I use it. Guess I&#x27;m going to have to spend the $35 for Satin Hands after all :(</li>
            <li> Great product--I bought several to give as gifts and will reorder for myself whenever the jar&lt;br /&gt;is getting low.  I plan to never be without this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff for your nails.  It scrubs your hand and cleans and moisturizes your nails like no other product.  Be sure to use it often as it is an oil product and doesn&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have problems with dry cuticles and split nails. This stuff helps tremendously.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s harder to find in local stores. So glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> Love it, will try some of the other scents when I get low on this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product from my manicurist when my mom would pay for manicures when I was in high school. Now that I am on my own, however, I cannot afford to get manicures anymore, so I give light ones to myself. I have dry skin and get hangnails frequently. So this product is great for that. Just make sure you don&#x27;t have wet hands before using it. It isn&#x27;t bad. But it isn&#x27;t as effective as it is with dry hands. Then when you rinse, your hands are left baby skin soft!</li>
            <li> When I can&#x27;t find time for a manicure this makes me feel as if I just had one!</li>
            <li> I used the one minute manicure nightly for a week, and it dried my cuticles out terribly.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Your hands will be exfoliated and silky smooth. Jar will last a long time.  I do recommend that you stir with spoon instead of shaking.</li>
            <li> This is still the best product I&#x27;ve found for this purpose.  I&#x27;ve tried several others, mostly because they were less expensive,but none of them worked as well.  My hands look and feel much softer after using this.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hands feel after using One Minute Manicure.  There is nothing else like it.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands and feet.  Boggles the mind at how this little product works it&#x27;s magic.  My husbands&#x27; feet were a train wreck- dry, dry, dry and his cuticles looked horrible.  Literally 1 minute, magic!</li>
            <li> It was okay.  I like the Pineapple better.  The Mint does not do the same as the Pineapple.  Cost was perfect.  Pineapple cost a little more.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but it didn&#x27;t come with a spoon as it says, which makes it more difficult to scoop. Works wonders on the hands. Just don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d order from this retailer again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and have found it to be the fastest, easiest, and best way to moisturize hands, nails, and cuticles. Highly recommended.</li>
