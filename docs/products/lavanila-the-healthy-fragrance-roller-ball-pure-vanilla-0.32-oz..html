            <li>/&gt;5 out of 5 recommend :)</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people including myself love to have it sprayed on my clothes and hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last for hours, but it is very pleasant, not overpowering, and I love that I am not breathing harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people who actually love sweet, spicy and warm perfumes, so this should give you an idea of how sweet this is.</li>
            <li>The size makes it so easy to just slip in my purse and use it anytime, anyplace.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews where people detected a strong musk scent . . .</li>
            <li>For those people who want to smell good for 5 minutes, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>after 20-40 min its gone.kind of light parfum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This smells like cheap soap and playdoh.</li>
            <li>It does indeed have a lovely vanilla that is sweet but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li>It has a delightful full vanilla scent but  not overwhelming and really easy to use- also &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34;  I will buy again.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday!</li>
            <li>I bought this partly because it&#x27;s supposed to be very natural, but mostly because I&#x27;m always reading reviews saying that it&#x27;s a very vanilla and nothing else kind of fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the pure sweet smell of this vanilla perfume-</li>
            <li>I find this perfume way too sweet and cloying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why now they think one must add sugar and make it so overtly sweet.</li>
            <li>It works good enough.  </li>
            <li>This is a true vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re expecting a true vanilla scent - like I was - this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I prefer that to having something so strong for the first couple hours so that it lasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of vanilla scent, and this is the most natural smelling vanilla I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>If you smell a vanilla bean, or even a bottle of vanilla extract for food, you can see that the smell is warm, rich, but only very faintly sweet.</li>
            <li>I did think it was a very pretty scent, but a bit on the stronger side for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too sweet, it&#x27;s not artificial,</li>
            <li>If you love a soft vanilla smell, this is for you!</li>
            <li>it lightens up the vanilla and gives it a fresh scent of both.</li>
            <li>If you love a true vanilla you don&#x27;t need to look further.</li>
            <li>I sometimes layer it with a mixture of lavender essential oil, jasmine absolute, and jojoba oil -- that makes for quite a nice combination.</li>
            <li>I tried to apply it very, very sparingly, but even with just a dab of the rollerball point the smell ended up giving me a headache and making me queasy.</li>
            <li>Not too long lasting a scent but great to use after the gym etc...</li>
            <li>Pretty much reviews&amp; hope!</li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d do my best to help others who are ordering somewhat blind.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried I would ruin my clothes but no problems at all.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and especially that it is in a roller ball.</li>
            <li>I liked this the most and the concept behind the brand</li>
            <li>It is a clean soft vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>My problem is I&#x27;m housebound pretty much because of an illness</li>
            <li>I usually have more luck getting perfumes to stay if I spritz them on my clothing, but for a roll-on this had amazing lasting power though.</li>
            <li>k thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;People stop her at school and tell her she smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d write so much for a very inexpensive perfume</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you like supersweet, you will enjoy this, but if you are sensitive to strong smells or are looking for a TRULY pure vanilla scent, this is not a good option.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>new scent.&lt;br /&gt;i smell myself all</li>
            <li>If you are into vanilla perfumes with a mature edge, this one is for you.</li>
            <li>and I think a natural product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that this along with their other scents come in a small pretty glass bottle that&#x27;s a roll on.</li>
            <li>From young male Uber drivers to my mom and her friends, everyone tells me I smell like heaven.</li>
            <li>Smells like an old lady spilled her entire bottle of perfume all over herself.  </li>

            <li> Smells like an old lady spilled her entire bottle of perfume all over herself.  </li>
            <li> but does not last long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smell only lasts about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> (use it together w other perfumes...like Shalimar..to compliment.</li>
            <li> However, I was extremely displeased when I opened it up and smelled it.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelmingly sweet, like some vanilla products are.</li>
            <li> If you had a silk or another delicate expensive piece on I would avoid those just to be careful,but with a roll on you have the ability to have it exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li> It does not resemble the sweet smell of vanilla. :(</li>
            <li> I bought a few vanilla sents from Amazon</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago and already ordered another</li>
            <li> I like giving them as small gifts.  </li>
            <li> If you usually like it on your bra,roll some beneath your breasts and rub it on</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I want to tone it down a bit and want some coconut smell also ill use it in combination with my Bath &amp; Body works Oahu coconut sunset.</li>
            <li> Seriously, people go bonkers when I wear this stuff...</li>
            <li> Not that that is a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> awful awful awful  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so excited for this and it smells like a Grandma&#x27;s perfume. It does not resemble the sweet smell of vanilla. :( Oh well. I continue my quest for a delicious vanilla scent. Any recommendations out there? :)</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and so do my kids and husband. It&#x27;s nice and warm smelling. My daughter always tells me how good I smell when we cuddle.</li>
            <li> This perfume started out smelling like vanilla.  Within 5 minutes, the aroma changed to that of a musty trunk. For those people who want to smell good for 5 minutes, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> nice. but does not last long. after 20-40 min its gone.kind of light parfum.&lt;br /&gt;i well not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought a few vanilla sents from Amazon I liked this the most and the concept behind the brand</li>
            <li> Love, love this scent</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance for my daughter as a gift.  She already uses this fragrance and the roller ball dispenser is a nice size to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> Great for the purse. Not too long lasting a scent but great to use after the gym etc... Cute size to keep in purse or bag.</li>
            <li> I have gotten dozens of compliments on this perfume. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I find this perfume way too sweet and cloying. I am one of those people who actually love sweet, spicy and warm perfumes, so this should give you an idea of how sweet this is. I tried to apply it very, very sparingly, but even with just a dab of the rollerball point the smell ended up giving me a headache and making me queasy. I think the issue is that the smell is not only vanilla, but also sugar. If you smell a vanilla bean, or even a bottle of vanilla extract for food, you can see that the smell is warm, rich, but only very faintly sweet. The earliest vanilla perfumes of many years ago (like the Body Shop) captured this warmth. I don&#x27;t know why now they think one must add sugar and make it so overtly sweet. If you like supersweet, you will enjoy this, but if you are sensitive to strong smells or are looking for a TRULY pure vanilla scent, this is not a good option.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side... the roller-ball container is indeed handy to carry in a purse.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this fragrance, and I love the roller ball! The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because I do wish the fragrance lasted longer. I sometimes layer it with a mixture of lavender essential oil, jasmine absolute, and jojoba oil -- that makes for quite a nice combination. I read some reviews where people detected a strong musk scent . . . I do not. I find it to be very nicely balanced and very pleasant. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla scent!  The roller application is not that great but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $$ on bottle.  It works good enough.  If you love a soft vanilla smell, this is for you!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last for hours, but it is very pleasant, not overpowering, and I love that I am not breathing harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent that rivals Laura Mercier Vanilla Gourmande. Every perfume reviewer ever claims that people tell them they smell good all day, but in this case it&#x27;s absolutely true. From young male Uber drivers to my mom and her friends, everyone tells me I smell like heaven. I almost want to  lie when people ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing so they stop copying me. It&#x27;s not nauseating or toxic at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this partly because it&#x27;s supposed to be very natural, but mostly because I&#x27;m always reading reviews saying that it&#x27;s a very vanilla and nothing else kind of fragrance. I picked it up a while back to try out, and here are my thoughts on it as a former perfumer. It does indeed have a lovely vanilla that is sweet but not overly sweet. However, it is loaded with an in your face musk too. Not that that is a bad thing. Some people love musk. I&#x27;m more of a person who likes it way in the background if at all. I did think it was a very pretty scent, but a bit on the stronger side for me. I can see many people absolutely loving it. Especially fans of the Vanilla Musk perfume, as this reminded me of that quite a bit. Me, well, I just liked it. Love isn&#x27;t a word I would use. I usually have more luck getting perfumes to stay if I spritz them on my clothing, but for a roll-on this had amazing lasting power though. If you are into vanilla perfumes with a mature edge, this one is for you.</li>
            <li> Seriously, people go bonkers when I wear this stuff...men drool and women want to go out and buy it.  You can \\&quot;feather it\\&quot;  (use it together w other perfumes...like Shalimar..to compliment.</li>
            <li> These are nice smelling and I think a natural product.  I like giving them as small gifts.  Can definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> love love LOVE this scent, I only wish it came as a spray (I think I may have to invest in the larger size for that). A very sophisticated vanilla, no sugar cookie smell at all. Very sexy and sweet.</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars but I couldn&#x27;t submit the review without choosing 1 star.  Smells like an old lady spilled her entire bottle of perfume all over herself.  Horrible!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> The reviews for this raved about the great, true vanilla scent which is why I bought it. However, I was extremely displeased when I opened it up and smelled it. There is nothing vanilla about it; if you&#x27;re hoping for vanilla bean or vanilla flavoring type scents, keep looking. This smells like cheap soap and playdoh. &amp;#34;Old lady perfume&amp;#34; if you will. If I could send it back for a refund I would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of vanilla scent, and this is the most natural smelling vanilla I have ever tried. It&#x27;s not too sweet, it&#x27;s not artificial, it&#x27;s pure, delicious vanilla. I always get a lot of compliments whenever I&#x27;m wearing it. The size makes it so easy to just slip in my purse and use it anytime, anyplace. My only complain is I wish it would last me longer.</li>
            <li> Love the pure sweet smell of this vanilla perfume- once applied, it tends to last for up to 4 hours on my skin. Plus, it&#x27;s a healthier alternative to regular perfumes.</li>
            <li> For those of you who like the smell of vanilla, this is a great product. The smell is not overwhelmingly sweet, like some vanilla products are. It is a clean soft vanilla scent. My only complaint is that the smell only lasts about 20 minutes. You would think for the price that it would have more staying power.</li>
            <li> awful awful awful  If you like a vanilla smell, this is NOT for you</li>
            <li> this is everything.&lt;br /&gt;my new scent.&lt;br /&gt;i smell myself all day.&lt;br /&gt;please do not buy... i want to be the only person in the world that smells like this... k thanks</li>
            <li> It has a delightful full vanilla scent but  not overwhelming and really easy to use- also &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34;  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing. My daughter bought it and it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just like the description. It is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People stop her at school and tell her she smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5 recommend :)</li>
            <li> How do you buy perfume on the internet without smelling it? Pretty much reviews&amp; hope! My problem is I&#x27;m housebound pretty much because of an illness so I read reviews and hope for the best. So I thought I&#x27;d do my best to help others who are ordering somewhat blind. This is a true vanilla scent. It has a sweetness to it that is so yummy. Just put in on your wrists and rub them together for a few seconds so they heat up and really absorb into your skin and it smells heavenly!!! I LOVE that this along with their other scents come in a small pretty glass bottle that&#x27;s a roll on. I know a lot of people including myself love to have it sprayed on my clothes and hair. It&#x27;s not a problem though just roll some on your hands and run your fingers thru your hair and I just wipe my hands on my clothes. At first I was worried I would ruin my clothes but no problems at all. If you had a silk or another delicate expensive piece on I would avoid those just to be careful,but with a roll on you have the ability to have it exactly where you want it. If you usually like it on your bra,roll some beneath your breasts and rub it on and you&#x27;re good to go. I never thought I&#x27;d write so much for a very inexpensive perfume but I just can&#x27;t praise it enough. Sometimes if I want to tone it down a bit and want some coconut smell also ill use it in combination with my Bath &amp; Body works Oahu coconut sunset. They are very good together it lightens up the vanilla and gives it a fresh scent of both. The one thing that might be a problem for some is that to have the fragrance last all day with my skin I need to reapply about every 4-6 hours but I prefer that to having something so strong for the first couple hours so that it lasts. That is too overpowering for me. I just got this a few days ago and already ordered another so I always have one in my purse. If you love a true vanilla you don&#x27;t need to look further. Yummy yummy yummy ( that&#x27;s what my husband says)</li>
            <li> OMG--I love this fragrance! Don&#x27;t ever stop making it!!</li>
            <li> GREAT SCENT! LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Handy for travel.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Perfect for everyday!</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance in a trio set with Coconut Vanilla and Grapefruit Vanilla. I think it vaguely smells of vanilla, but when applied it mostly smells powdery. I think in another review, someone likened it to &amp;#34;old lady smell.&amp;#34; I agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re expecting a true vanilla scent - like I was - this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t recommend this - the packaging is cute, and the price is good - but I would advise that you try these fragrances in person to make sure they smell good to you, with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Loved the scent and convenience of the roller ball!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and especially that it is in a roller ball.</li>
