            <li>I recently discovered mineral powder makeup by Maybelline, but my favorite product is the illuminator powder.  </li>
            <li>Ok so when i first got it in the mail, the product was WAY smaller than what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>It just really brightens the face and, since I am pretty fair-skinned, it works.  </li>
            <li>and I am very particular with my makeup  </li>
            <li>I use it on top of a loose foundation powder.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that is interested.</li>
            <li>Helps set my makeup and makes my skin look so fresh and natural.</li>
            <li>I dont feel there is too much &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; and TRUST ME</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of extra color and a bit of fun sparkle!</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have used this product, so I am familiar with it, thus the reason I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>It last a very long time as well and it comes with a pretty brush to apply it with :)</li>
            <li>seriously looks good not an everyday look but love it for dinners</li>

            <li> This is a great mineral powder blush and it is a very pretty and natural looking color for any occasion</li>
            <li> A+ I am extremely satisfied with the experience that I had. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is interested.</li>

            <li> A rather small jar but given only a little is needed to pink up the cheek bones, will last and last. Very nice color. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using this as blush.  Bought the peach a while back and really liked it.  Going to order the &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; next.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of extra color and a bit of fun sparkle! Just the thing to brighten up my complexion.</li>
            <li> This product was discontinued in the stores  and I am very particular with my makeup  When I find something that works I like to keep it  The process of purchasing thru Amazon was very simple and shipping was efficient  I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> It came super fast and it was very cheap (under $3)! I will def re-order! This product is no longer in stores so I&#x27;m happy I found it!</li>
            <li> My store, unfortunately, does not carry this product anymore but I found it online.  At the end of my make-up routine, I brush this illuminator on my cheeks, forehead and chin for an all over and all day natural glow.  I love the pink because it gives just a subtle hint of color and shimmer.  You can especially see the shimmer effect out of doors and in photos.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this illuminator.  Light and beautiful, and gives your face a subtle glow.  Doesn&#x27;t make you look glittery.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> The product comes on a card, and the cards were a little dog eared; however, sealed and product clean and new inside.  This is a hard to find item, and I will certainly purchase from this Seller again.  The product got rerouted while en route for some reason, but Seller oversaw its immediate turn around upon learning of its deflection.  Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered mineral powder makeup by Maybelline, but my favorite product is the illuminator powder.  It&#x27;s a great finishing product and really gives my face a wonderful luminescence.</li>
            <li> ITts so perfect and shine on my skin ... Its good for daily wear... I love it and wear mostly after makeup</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blush of all time! I have to order it online now due to them taking it off the shelf in the local stores here. It works wonderful even for my oily skin!</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed that it was so light in color and glittery, but I have come to love it. It offers a natural looking glow without screaming I HAVE BLUSH ON MY FACE!!! I use it daily as a blush and even let my 4 year old daughter wear it sometimes. It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin. But for myself I do have to apply what feels like a lot to see it at all, but it has good staying power. I use it on top of a loose foundation powder.</li>
            <li> Love this mineral makeup. Makes your skin look like it has a healthy glow.  But doesn&#x27;t make you look done up. Love the shimmer it has in it as well.</li>
            <li> this is my go to blush. It puts such a beautiful glow on your face. Looks like you spent the day in the Sun.</li>
            <li> Am in love with this product.. It&#x27;s a pink shimmery powder, I use  this to highlight my cheeks and great for touch ups on neck and shoulders for night look! The size is pretty small compared to what u see in the pic..  it comes with a little brush applicator .. Great product for this price .. Product was in good condition n arrived in time!</li>
            <li> Good.  It gives a little bit of color and some sparkle to the face.  Nice if you want to look like you haven&#x27;t much on (but the slight sparkles give it away.)  If you want some color this is really not for you.  It just really brightens the face and, since I am pretty fair-skinned, it works.  A slightly dewey look which is very subtle.  I haven&#x27;t worn it over another blush but I may try that and see how it looks.</li>
            <li> Ok so when i first got it in the mail, the product was WAY smaller than what i was expecting. The brush was of cheap quality and when you put the powder on with that brush it just doesn&#x27;t feel right. It&#x27;s also much lighter than expected, which is ok because its not that opaque, but it will last me.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have used this product, so I am familiar with it, thus the reason I ordered it.  I do think the next time I will order the neutral shade.</li>
