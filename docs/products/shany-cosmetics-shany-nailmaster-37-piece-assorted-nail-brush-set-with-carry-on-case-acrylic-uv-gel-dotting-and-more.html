            <li>carrying case its REALLY nice.</li>
            <li>Every kind of brush you can think of (and probably some you can&#x27;t) come in this set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li>I also would have liked to see some care instructions, as I ruined 4 of my brushes already because I soaked them in water overnight.</li>
            <li>But for the most part it&#x27;s a good set for the price</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t honestly say how the product is...</li>
            <li>They wash up nicely.</li>
            <li>Verry good and cheap</li>
            <li>i love the way they came in a carrying case which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this and it showed up about a week after I ordered it!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet</li>
            <li>It is well worth every penny and actually more!!</li>
            <li>you could easily add some of your own brushes to it to store with the ones that come with this set.</li>
            <li>way to many dotting tools, and it was just a purchase I regretted after I got them.</li>
            <li>In fact, so many she doesn&#x27;t know how to use most of them.</li>
            <li>I have so many tools at my disposal to try all the looks I want to now.</li>
            <li>Obviously I&#x27;m not expecting them to be top-of-the-line quality, but for a beginner there are a perfect starter set.</li>
            <li>She is able to do intricate designs without any problem.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>and you get so many.</li>
            <li>The case that it comes in is awesome especially to store them.</li>
            <li>and you can never have too many brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my grand daughter&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li>and I Love a lot of these brushes</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the case that it comes with, in the pic</li>
            <li>I love the leather case it came in.  </li>
            <li>all the items I bought from them came ina  color box, (which is perfect when you give these as a gift) except this brush set, which came in a  blank box, and wrapped.</li>
            <li>I love the case.</li>
            <li>Like perviously stated it does seem to be made better</li>
            <li>I tried to take the plastic cap thing off of a brush after opening it and the metal part of the top of the brush came off.</li>
            <li>This is actually a pretty good set for the money you&#x27;re spending I like the container that it comes in</li>
            <li>The top uses snaps to hold it in place, so you can unsnap them and have easy access to the brushes while you&#x27;re painting.</li>
            <li>Just an all around lovely collection that doesn&#x27;t seem cheap or just tossed together.</li>
            <li>First I got my brush set 2 days early, so of course that&#x27;s just awesome.</li>
            <li>Came quick, excellent xmas present</li>
            <li>The paint comes off the wood ones if you get 100% acetone on them, otherwise they are holding up fine.  </li>
            <li>The case us great and each cup is a different size</li>
            <li>Thank you they are great, they will last well.  </li>
            <li>They may not be the highest of quality brands but they have been fantastic for my nail art</li>
            <li>it looks like a cheap case</li>
            <li>item arrived promptly, my wife is going happily trying and learning the specific usage of every brush and accessory,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>You get a million different brush styles and a great case to carry it in.</li>
            <li>Very Nice, a regular case like one you would buy at Ulta.</li>
            <li>and she says they work really well and clean up nicely.</li>
            <li>The brushes seem to be of high quality and are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Also, when I went to remove one of the rubber protectors of of the tip, the rubber protector pulled the tip right out of the brush!</li>
            <li>I do nail art and was so excited when I got this, but quickly realized that it is</li>
            <li>so I was super excited when this came in.</li>
            <li>The faux leather case (which is very durable and cute) was not hurt at all.</li>
            <li>the containers cool to, i tried keeping it</li>
            <li>These brushes arrived quickly and are just as described.</li>
            <li>Package came quickly</li>
            <li>I could ask for to do nail art and in a variety of natural and synthetic hairs its great for natural and gel nails which is all I do.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why people say there are too many that they had to throw some away, better than having not enough</li>
            <li>I super like that there is a lot brushes to use, and the case is the cutest ever.</li>
            <li>case is super sturdy purple leather.</li>
            <li>I cant begin to explain how much of a great deal this is for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li>They are all in place and do not feel like the brushes will break any time soon (but if they do, I would suggest using a hot glue gun!</li>
            <li>, I spend half of my bonus check on them, and I&#x27;m thrilled with their quality and service and variety of products, but now I expect a better packaging,</li>
            <li>everything i need to do some nail art is in this little set for a great price</li>
            <li>My daughter has been having a lot of fun using these brushes to do nail art.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the variety of these brushes, as well as the amount are somewhat worth the money.</li>
            <li>I went from being creative with safety pins and q-tips to having more than I knew what to do with... which posed a little problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this set for at least a year I think, and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I love all the different options here...</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t even used them all, or took the plastic off of them.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of brushes for many different things.</li>
            <li>The case came with no extra box, it was just a case with shrink wrap, I have more expectation from this brand now</li>
            <li>BUT in my opinion the striping brush included could be better, actually I have one from a cheap set that definitely is better, that&#x27;s my only complaint, all the other brushes included are awesome</li>
            <li>Second I looked over all he dotting tools and brushes and they to me are beautiful, the  handle is shiny black wood.</li>
            <li>As far as the pricing, I really can&#x27;t complain, because the similar brush case by itself is sold for $40 on Amazon, so for $25, I got the nice purple case with all the brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>5 of them of course are for marbleizing, which are obvious to separate, but the rest are not as easy.</li>
            <li>very high quality brushes</li>
            <li>it works really well with paint brushes, but not so much with these nail art brushes...</li>
            <li>I really like dipping them in remover to brush away excess polish on the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>these much...</li>
            <li>She is 13 and very into nails.  </li>
            <li>was what I excepted from the order and was sent out fast</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the brush set.  </li>
            <li>i really do believe what you pay is what you get.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I absolutely LOVVVVE this brush set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice heavy weight to it, so it sit upright and doesn&#x27;t tip over from the weight of the brushes.</li>
            <li>and I have found many other uses for it</li>
            <li>I will just be using super glue and making sure that sucker stays.</li>
            <li>condition, but the package came brand new!</li>
            <li>Brushes brand new still in plastic and numbered!</li>
            <li>I ordered them mainly because they are Shany Cosmetics brushes.</li>
            <li>Third I love all the different brushes.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a wide assortment of brushes that are of very good quality, look no more!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these brushes and dotters.</li>
            <li>Average quality is reflected in the relatively cheap price.</li>
            <li>Five big thumbs up from a pro ;)</li>
            <li>good:&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are Black, and the case is purple, it would have been better if both were same colors.</li>
            <li>and soft ends gives you the details that you want to have</li>
            <li>That fixed my make-up brushes</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 23 yr old daughter</li>
            <li>I should preface by saying that I&#x27;m a professional nail tech at an upscale boutique/nail salon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who is wanting to do Nail Art...from the Beginner to the Professional...</li>
            <li>I know its not a big deal, but the company says in back of the box, please submit any useful feedback which can help you use our product easier.</li>
            <li>They seem just as high quality as professional salons and again, for the price it is such a steal.</li>
            <li>Great brushes only complaint is that when cleaning the brushes the black paint comes off the handle.</li>
            <li>As a new nail student, I could only find one acrylic bunch in the mix and the rest were for gel and nail art that I could determine.</li>
            <li>and I too am confused on why one would need this many</li>
            <li>But hey now i wont have to buy new brushes for long time.</li>
            <li>A few of the brushes were not that great and a few fell off at the tip and a few had glue present around the ferrule.</li>
            <li>, is the brushes are stiff, you have to get them wet and bend them a little but other than that it&#x27;s a great</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and you can never have too many brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grand daughter&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li> and I Love a lot of these brushes</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the case that it comes with, in the pic</li>
            <li> I love the leather case it came in.  </li>
            <li> all the items I bought from them came ina  color box, (which is perfect when you give these as a gift) except this brush set, which came in a  blank box, and wrapped.</li>
            <li> I love the case.</li>
            <li> Like perviously stated it does seem to be made better</li>
            <li> I tried to take the plastic cap thing off of a brush after opening it and the metal part of the top of the brush came off.</li>
            <li> This is actually a pretty good set for the money you&#x27;re spending I like the container that it comes in</li>
            <li> The top uses snaps to hold it in place, so you can unsnap them and have easy access to the brushes while you&#x27;re painting.</li>
            <li> Just an all around lovely collection that doesn&#x27;t seem cheap or just tossed together.</li>
            <li> First I got my brush set 2 days early, so of course that&#x27;s just awesome.</li>
            <li> Came quick, excellent xmas present</li>
            <li> The paint comes off the wood ones if you get 100% acetone on them, otherwise they are holding up fine.  </li>
            <li> The case us great and each cup is a different size</li>
            <li> Thank you they are great, they will last well.  </li>
            <li> They may not be the highest of quality brands but they have been fantastic for my nail art</li>
            <li> it looks like a cheap case</li>
            <li> item arrived promptly, my wife is going happily trying and learning the specific usage of every brush and accessory,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> You get a million different brush styles and a great case to carry it in.</li>
            <li> Very Nice, a regular case like one you would buy at Ulta.</li>
            <li> and she says they work really well and clean up nicely.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to be of high quality and are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Also, when I went to remove one of the rubber protectors of of the tip, the rubber protector pulled the tip right out of the brush!</li>
            <li> I do nail art and was so excited when I got this, but quickly realized that it is</li>
            <li> so I was super excited when this came in.</li>
            <li> The faux leather case (which is very durable and cute) was not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> the containers cool to, i tried keeping it</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived quickly and are just as described.</li>
            <li> Package came quickly</li>
            <li> I could ask for to do nail art and in a variety of natural and synthetic hairs its great for natural and gel nails which is all I do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why people say there are too many that they had to throw some away, better than having not enough</li>
            <li> I super like that there is a lot brushes to use, and the case is the cutest ever.</li>
            <li> case is super sturdy purple leather.</li>
            <li> I cant begin to explain how much of a great deal this is for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> They are all in place and do not feel like the brushes will break any time soon (but if they do, I would suggest using a hot glue gun!</li>
            <li> , I spend half of my bonus check on them, and I&#x27;m thrilled with their quality and service and variety of products, but now I expect a better packaging,</li>
            <li> everything i need to do some nail art is in this little set for a great price</li>
            <li> My daughter has been having a lot of fun using these brushes to do nail art.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the variety of these brushes, as well as the amount are somewhat worth the money.</li>
            <li> I went from being creative with safety pins and q-tips to having more than I knew what to do with... which posed a little problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for at least a year I think, and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I love all the different options here...</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t even used them all, or took the plastic off of them.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of brushes for many different things.</li>
            <li> The case came with no extra box, it was just a case with shrink wrap, I have more expectation from this brand now</li>
            <li> BUT in my opinion the striping brush included could be better, actually I have one from a cheap set that definitely is better, that&#x27;s my only complaint, all the other brushes included are awesome</li>
            <li> Second I looked over all he dotting tools and brushes and they to me are beautiful, the  handle is shiny black wood.</li>
            <li> As far as the pricing, I really can&#x27;t complain, because the similar brush case by itself is sold for $40 on Amazon, so for $25, I got the nice purple case with all the brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 5 of them of course are for marbleizing, which are obvious to separate, but the rest are not as easy.</li>
            <li> very high quality brushes</li>
            <li> it works really well with paint brushes, but not so much with these nail art brushes...</li>
            <li> I really like dipping them in remover to brush away excess polish on the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> these much...</li>
            <li> She is 13 and very into nails.  </li>
            <li> was what I excepted from the order and was sent out fast</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the brush set.  </li>
            <li> i really do believe what you pay is what you get.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I absolutely LOVVVVE this brush set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice heavy weight to it, so it sit upright and doesn&#x27;t tip over from the weight of the brushes.</li>
            <li> and I have found many other uses for it</li>
            <li> I will just be using super glue and making sure that sucker stays.</li>
            <li> condition, but the package came brand new!</li>
            <li> Brushes brand new still in plastic and numbered!</li>
            <li> I ordered them mainly because they are Shany Cosmetics brushes.</li>
            <li> Third I love all the different brushes.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a wide assortment of brushes that are of very good quality, look no more!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these brushes and dotters.</li>
            <li> Average quality is reflected in the relatively cheap price.</li>
            <li> Five big thumbs up from a pro ;)</li>
            <li> good:&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are Black, and the case is purple, it would have been better if both were same colors.</li>
            <li> and soft ends gives you the details that you want to have</li>
            <li> That fixed my make-up brushes</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 23 yr old daughter</li>
            <li> I should preface by saying that I&#x27;m a professional nail tech at an upscale boutique/nail salon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who is wanting to do Nail Art...from the Beginner to the Professional...</li>
            <li> I know its not a big deal, but the company says in back of the box, please submit any useful feedback which can help you use our product easier.</li>
            <li> They seem just as high quality as professional salons and again, for the price it is such a steal.</li>
            <li> Great brushes only complaint is that when cleaning the brushes the black paint comes off the handle.</li>
            <li> As a new nail student, I could only find one acrylic bunch in the mix and the rest were for gel and nail art that I could determine.</li>
            <li> and I too am confused on why one would need this many</li>
            <li> But hey now i wont have to buy new brushes for long time.</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes were not that great and a few fell off at the tip and a few had glue present around the ferrule.</li>
            <li> , is the brushes are stiff, you have to get them wet and bend them a little but other than that it&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li> For the design I&#x27;m using all the smalls ones, and for polishing I use the big ones, I know its pretty obvious but, there isn&#x27;t any other way to figure this out, I also searched yotube and found out about some, but there are some crazy style brushes in here that I really need to ask a nail technician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1st let me start off by saying that my package came 2 days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend getting these brushes as compared to other brushes.</li>
            <li> just keep it closed (like me)</li>
            <li> I thought the cylinder case that case that came with this would be some cheap cardboard, but it is actually some sort of hard plastic wrapped in faux leather!!!!</li>
            <li> Some brushes may need to be trimmed with a pair of sharp scissors, as a few had some long bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dotting tools come in different sizes (usually people ask if they do, so</li>
            <li> Now my possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you are going to be doing acrylic nails, but also these are just fantastic for one stroke nail art!</li>
            <li> The bristles are quite tightly bound together, so I haven&#x27;t had any problems with loose bits sticking out anywhere and causing problems when using them with paint.</li>
            <li> I have been buying and experimenting with different brushes lately</li>
            <li> ALL THE TIME by the other techs!</li>
            <li> This way, the acetone won&#x27;t harm the brushes as badly, but I haven&#x27;t tried using just acetone/nail polish remover to clean the brushes yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My daughter complains that her nailpolish remover has also removed the black varnish from the brush handles.</li>
            <li> for cleaning them, I would use a combination of half water and half acetone.</li>
            <li> i honestly am a little overwhelmed by the amount in this kit.</li>
            <li> the case was a waste , it broke in a few uses</li>
            <li> There is literally NOTHING to not love</li>
            <li> but it definintley isn&#x27;t, its some sort of hard plastic wrapped with leather</li>
            <li> this product have very hard case with lot brushes.</li>
            <li> But not so expensive.</li>
            <li> so I probably used the wrong brush for what I was needing.</li>
            <li> I have used these like crazy since getting them.</li>
            <li> I got this for my gf and everyones (females in my family) are mad</li>
            <li> Yikes bad idea...</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say at all about this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for at least a year I think, and it&#x27;s great.  The brushes are quite durable, and for the price it is an excellent value.  Some brushes may need to be trimmed with a pair of sharp scissors, as a few had some long bristles.</li>
            <li> very high quality brushes&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend it&lt;br /&gt;smooth and soft ends gives you the details that you want to have</li>
            <li> I do nail art and was so excited when I got this, but quickly realized that it is just has a ton of brushes that I don&#x27;t even use. way to many dotting tools, and it was just a purchase I regretted after I got them.</li>
            <li> Got this set for my daughter. Nice case and plenty of brushes and tools. In fact, so many she doesn&#x27;t know how to use most of them. Average quality is reflected in the relatively cheap price. On arrival two of the brush tips were bent and one of the tips fell of the handle and had to be glued back on. My daughter complains that her nailpolish remover has also removed the black varnish from the brush handles. Not a big deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a wide assortment of brushes that are of very good quality, look no more! These nail brushes are for both beginners and professionals. I, for one, am not the greatest at doing nail deigns, but these brushes help make any design a piece of cake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dotting tools come in different sizes (usually people ask if they do, so I hope this helps!). The brushes also come wrapped with plastic around the entire brush and the hair part of the brush as well. They are all in place and do not feel like the brushes will break any time soon (but if they do, I would suggest using a hot glue gun! That fixed my make-up brushes before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cleaning them, I would use a combination of half water and half acetone. This way, the acetone won&#x27;t harm the brushes as badly, but I haven&#x27;t tried using just acetone/nail polish remover to clean the brushes yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got mine in a &amp;#34;used-good&amp;#34; condition, but the package came brand new! The faux leather case (which is very durable and cute) was not hurt at all. I would definitely recommend getting these brushes as compared to other brushes. These brushes have great quality and will make anyone happy!</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived quickly and are just as described. They seem to be an excellent value. I have so many tools at my disposal to try all the looks I want to now. Obviously I&#x27;m not expecting them to be top-of-the-line quality, but for a beginner there are a perfect starter set. I doubt I need anything fancier for home use anyway.</li>
            <li> It was a gif for my wife and she tolk me that is excellent, with too many brushes.  The tube box is verry portable and usefull for keping save all.  Verry good and cheap</li>
            <li> Great brushes only complaint is that when cleaning the brushes the black paint comes off the handle.</li>
            <li> the case was a waste , it broke in a few uses</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 23 yr old daughter and she says they work really well and clean up nicely. She is able to do intricate designs without any problem.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Brushes brand new still in plastic and numbered! As a nail tech it&#x27;s a great nail art brush set</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8ae52a6e0c6301293b62f85910ab3c8c]] This set has a ton of brushes. Everything you could want to design on your nails, there&#x27;s a brush for it. Some of the brushes are double ended, with metal ends on one side that are great for making perfect dots and circles with. The bristles are quite tightly bound together, so I haven&#x27;t had any problems with loose bits sticking out anywhere and causing problems when using them with paint. I also haven&#x27;t had problems with bristles falling out or coming loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case its REALLY nice. The top uses snaps to hold it in place, so you can unsnap them and have easy access to the brushes while you&#x27;re painting. It&#x27;s got a nice heavy weight to it, so it sit upright and doesn&#x27;t tip over from the weight of the brushes. There&#x27;s enough room inside it you could easily add some of your own brushes to it to store with the ones that come with this set. Every kind of brush you can think of (and probably some you can&#x27;t) come in this set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> For its price, this is definitely an excellent product. Will recommend it to friends and family. So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love all the different options here... I went from being creative with safety pins and q-tips to having more than I knew what to do with... which posed a little problem. I would have liked to see some sort of guide telling you which was used best for which technique. I also would have liked to see some care instructions, as I ruined 4 of my brushes already because I soaked them in water overnight. Yikes bad idea... it works really well with paint brushes, but not so much with these nail art brushes... oh well.</li>
            <li> This is a great set for beginners like me for your manis and nail art. A few of the brushes were not that great and a few fell off at the tip and a few had glue present around the ferrule. But for the most part it&#x27;s a good set for the price and you get so many. Package came quickly</li>
            <li> My daughter has been having a lot of fun using these brushes to do nail art.  Some of them are plastic and some are wood.  The paint comes off the wood ones if you get 100% acetone on them, otherwise they are holding up fine.  She has been using them daily for almost two weeks now.  I really like dipping them in remover to brush away excess polish on the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> I should preface by saying that I&#x27;m a professional nail tech at an upscale boutique/nail salon. I get complements on this set ALL THE TIME by the other techs! Has every brush and dotter I could ask for to do nail art and in a variety of natural and synthetic hairs its great for natural and gel nails which is all I do. The case us great and each cup is a different size so u can choose how tall u want it or just keep it closed (like me) to keep those envious eyes from snatching up one of your awesome brushes! Five big thumbs up from a pro ;)</li>
            <li> Woow it was a greatest deal ever in my life...of course shany is good brand.. this product have very hard case with lot brushes. .love these much...</li>
            <li> i love the way they came in a carrying case which is amazing. everything i need to do some nail art is in this little set for a great price</li>
            <li> This was a gift so I can&#x27;t honestly say how the product is...</li>
            <li> Thank you they are great, they will last well.  They wash up nicely. I do like all the dotting tips.</li>
            <li> I got these to do nail art and they work perfectly. Theirs a variety of brushes I can pick. The case that it comes in is awesome especially to store them.</li>
            <li> Very nice set. the case is especially nice and the snaps on the side are sturdy. The assortment of brushes makes it very nice for a beginner to find the brush that best suits their needs.</li>
            <li> I have used these like crazy since getting them. They may not be the highest of quality brands but they have been fantastic for my nail art and you cannot beat the price. You truly get everything you need.</li>
            <li> Loved the case the brushes came in. Wish it had an itemized list included to say what each brush was. As a new nail student, I could only find one acrylic bunch in the mix and the rest were for gel and nail art that I could determine. Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> The description of these brushes/tools is off. They need to warn you that the paint (on the part you hold) comes off of the brush when you accidentally get nail polish remover on it. Also, when I went to remove one of the rubber protectors of of the tip, the rubber protector pulled the tip right out of the brush! I had to glue each one (yes, I found multiple ones like this) back in it&#x27;s proper place. I would only recommend this to people who have the time to fix the mistakes. Otherwise, the variety of these brushes, as well as the amount are somewhat worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this and it showed up about a week after I ordered it!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet but I haven&#x27;t even used them all, or took the plastic off of them.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of brushes for many different things. I don&#x27;t see why people say there are too many that they had to throw some away, better than having not enough and you can never have too many brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is when you take the plastic that protects the brush off, is the brushes are stiff, you have to get them wet and bend them a little but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case: Very Nice, a regular case like one you would buy at Ulta.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter set for all nail art.  Comes with a good variety of quality brushes and doters, and the case it perfect and so cute!&lt;br /&gt;Love this set, and would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grand daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She is 13 and very into nails.  She absolutely loved these brushes.</li>
            <li> This is actually a pretty good set for the money you&#x27;re spending I like the container that it comes in and I have found many other uses for it I would actually recommend this seller</li>
            <li> love these brushes! easy to use and its awesome to paint nails with!!! flawless nail art for pennies on the dollar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend in a heart beat! love shany cosmetics! best accessories ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- jill</li>
            <li> These are really great brushes! I ordered them mainly because they are Shany Cosmetics brushes. I have been buying and experimenting with different brushes lately and I Love a lot of these brushes BUT in my opinion the striping brush included could be better, actually I have one from a cheap set that definitely is better, that&#x27;s my only complaint, all the other brushes included are awesome and I LOVE the case that it comes with, in the pic it looks like a cheap case but it definintley isn&#x27;t, its some sort of hard plastic wrapped with leather</li>
            <li> item arrived promptly, my wife is going happily trying and learning the specific usage of every brush and accessory,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will make arrangements for refills when needed, having perfectly done nails is very important for her</li>
            <li> I super like that there is a lot brushes to use, and the case is the cutest ever. Perfect!! But not so expensive. Will definitely buy again. Recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the product. lots of art brushes. was what I excepted from the order and was sent out fast</li>
            <li> There is literally NOTHING to not love here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is super sturdy purple leather. Removable snaps on the side keep it secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside? TONS of brushes and tools for all sorts of application purposes. If you&#x27;re looking for a good assortment without breaking your piggy bank? This is a great place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the sheer volume of brushes, the diversity of them, had my head reeling. Dotting tools galore, too. Just an all around lovely collection that doesn&#x27;t seem cheap or just tossed together. The brushes are holding up fabulously and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 22 years daughter (who is in the cosmetology profession).  She absolutely loves the brush set.  She assumed I paid a couple hundred dollars for them... lol.  The case was a very nice &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Brush Set for Nail Art!!! It is well worth every penny and actually more!! There is a brush for every design you can think of along with the dotting pens included...I love the leather case it came in.  The Brushes are of great quality and do a superb job of applying nail designs.  I would recommend this product for anyone who is wanting to do Nail Art...from the Beginner to the Professional...Its Great!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased packed very well good quality brush would recommend !!</li>
            <li> First I got my brush set 2 days early, so of course that&#x27;s just awesome. Second I looked over all he dotting tools and brushes and they to me are beautiful, the  handle is shiny black wood. I think it&#x27;s well made. Third I love all the different brushes. I kept thinking they were repeat brushes but the weren&#x27;t Thank-You Shany whoever you are I look forward to doing business with you again.</li>
            <li> Second time I bought these it was for a classmate she loved mine so had me buy her a set too!!!! Highly recommend these brushes and dotters. Alone the French brushes would cost you this amount!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush set is absolutely amazing! I cant begin to explain how much of a great deal this is for such a high quality product. 1st let me start off by saying that my package came 2 days earlier than expected. When I got the package it was well packaged...the set came inside a cardboard box and each of the 37 brushed came individually packaged and stored inside the brush holder. Also the brush holder is actually faux leather so it look really nice and very good to store brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used some of the brushes already on my nails...all i can say is...I love each and every one!! The brushes seem to be of high quality and are very easy to clean. There is a brush in this set for everything you could ever want to do to your nails. I have nothing bad to say at all about this product! I paid 20 all together for a case alone would cost 40.00 and 37 brushes to go along with it! Great Deal Great Price Great Product!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, i recomand, you can do any art nails you need, it has every brush you can think of.</li>
            <li> As far as the pricing, I really can&#x27;t complain, because the similar brush case by itself is sold for $40 on Amazon, so for $25, I got the nice purple case with all the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whats good about it:&lt;br /&gt;37 nail brushes, (which you can use some for the eyeliner gel or lips too ), brush qualities are good, the kolinsky brushes are the best, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to have those in the box, since their picture wasn&#x27;t on the website. I don&#x27;t know how to use these brushes, since I have no idea about them, I do DIY nails at home for myself and my sisters, but I never thought you can have 37 brushes. 5 of them of course are for marbleizing, which are obvious to separate, but the rest are not as easy. Now my possibilities are endless. Since I don&#x27;t know what their uses, so I just pick them based on their size and brush angel. For the design I&#x27;m using all the smalls ones, and for polishing I use the big ones, I know its pretty obvious but, there isn&#x27;t any other way to figure this out, I also searched yotube and found out about some, but there are some crazy style brushes in here that I really need to ask a nail technician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whats not good:&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are Black, and the case is purple, it would have been better if both were same colors. I know its not a big deal, but the company says in back of the box, please submit any useful feedback which can help you use our product easier. So this is why, I want to mention even smallest problems. The case came with no extra box, it was just a case with shrink wrap, I have more expectation from this brand now, I spend half of my bonus check on them, and I&#x27;m thrilled with their quality and service and variety of products, but now I expect a better packaging, all the items I bought from them came ina  color box, (which is perfect when you give these as a gift) except this brush set, which came in a  blank box, and wrapped. The logo and item # was on the box and everything, but no color box.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you are going to be doing acrylic nails, but also these are just fantastic for one stroke nail art!</li>
            <li> I got this for my gf and everyones (females in my family) are mad i didnt get them one too... but it comes neatly packed, every brush is wrapped in plastic inside the container. the containers cool to, i tried keeping it but my gf wasnt having it lol. Came quick, excellent xmas present</li>
            <li> I love the case. Like perviously stated it does seem to be made better then one might think.&lt;br /&gt;All brushes have caps and plastic. i honestly am a little overwhelmed by the amount in this kit. I tried to take the plastic cap thing off of a brush after opening it and the metal part of the top of the brush came off. I couldn&#x27;t be too upset. I will just be using super glue and making sure that sucker stays. OverAll i really do believe what you pay is what you get.  I think I will be making some videos on whats what for these brushes . I do have my license in this department and I too am confused on why one would need this many But hey now i wont have to buy new brushes for long time. (hopefully)</li>
            <li> I thought the cylinder case that case that came with this would be some cheap cardboard, but it is actually some sort of hard plastic wrapped in faux leather!!!! I&#x27;m a dork when it comes to packaging so I was super excited when this came in. Plus I&#x27;m a huge brush hoarder and it&#x27;s perfect to store all the brushes that come with it so I don&#x27;t lose them like I always do. One of the brushes I used with one of the SHANY nail polishes didn&#x27;t give me great color so I ended up having to use the skinny applicator that came in the bottle...but I&#x27;m definitely not a nail tech so I probably used the wrong brush for what I was needing. Either way, I absolutely LOVVVVE this brush set. It has every brush you can think of for any type of design you&#x27;re wanting and they are great quality! They seem just as high quality as professional salons and again, for the price it is such a steal. You get a million different brush styles and a great case to carry it in.</li>
