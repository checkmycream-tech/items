            <li>This is the best hand cream I have found to keep dry hands from cracking and bleeding!</li>

            <li>I have used several hand creams, this one is really great, wish i could get discount if i order more than one</li>
            <li>The item pictured has a flip top which makes dispensing the lotion easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>GREAT lotion - just wish the container was larger.  </li>
            <li>buy the Fragrance free version or else</li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t have the same richness as those hand creams it does a great job of sealing your hands without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it also is free of fragrance and dyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a scent, but I am sure unscented would be better for the skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the old scent, and was amazed to find it replaced by something like bathroom deodorizer.</li>
            <li>Wish I could afford to purchase more right now....</li>
            <li>Starts off just slightly greasy, but once absorbed is a perfect healing lotion for my hands.  </li>
            <li>My first one had a flip top</li>
            <li>What I received after the first order was a screw type top.  </li>
            <li>The description said original or unscented.</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry and cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>Amazon also offers automatic delivery every so many days on this item if you choose to do this!</li>
            <li>This product is very good, you are receiving a high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>Overly sweet and cloying</li>
            <li>Luckily I can across this product as a sampler for another I made.</li>
            <li>I must say I enjoyed this more than the initial purchase I received this for!</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly into the skin and has a neutral scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>This new scent smells like Glad Mountain Spring air freshner.  </li>
            <li>I had thoughts of taking the flip top from my first tube and installing it on my second but the flip top seems fused on.  </li>
            <li>WIll be back for more!</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream for Dry Chapped Hands is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>it is totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This item was pricey, but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>useful on elbows and face.</li>
            <li>The smell is slight and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Still the same great hand cream underneath, but so not the same.</li>
            <li>Really good product, softens skin when no other cream will - American version (which this is) is so far superior to the Korean product I can get locally and is cheaper!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions, which only irritate them more.  </li>
            <li>This hand cream provides a luxurious way to keep your hands smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different hand creams because I wash my hands a lot</li>
            <li>You have to screw the entire top off, dispense lotion, screw top back on, and apply lotion.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough they had in stock &amp; in 2 days</li>
            <li>And as a frequent user of bleach, I have stripped the natural oils from my skin more times than I care to remember.</li>
            <li>I thought that original formula meant original scent but the box actually says new scent!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works to repair the damage plus it soaks in fast!</li>
            <li>Got all of my friends hooked after they saw the cream work its magic on my severely dry hands.</li>
            <li>and found the ones from L&#x27;occitane and Lush to be great creams, but were too rich and made my hands a little bit to oily to do anything without wiping them dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This creme works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really need to start buying this stuff in bulk!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Intense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague.</li>
            <li>It smells like so many other inferior hand creams.  </li>
            <li>The scent seems more subtl and wears off faster than the other scent.</li>
            <li>this cream is the only cream so far that helps keep my hands from becoming chapped.</li>
            <li>fragrance is heavy and stinky not like the REAL original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that you need only a dab for it to work.  </li>
            <li>My husband has very dry hands, and this hand cream is the only kind that works for him.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money because it REALLY works.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to many more expensive selections.</li>
            <li>I received this on time and would highly recommend it to my friend.</li>
            <li>Last week my hands were chapped and even hurt, but now its clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Best hand cream I have found for badly chapped body parts.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t penetrate the skin much and it certainly doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I recommend Aveeno, just the regular, general purpose tube (got a big tube for $8).</li>
            <li>The new scent smells to me like Crew?</li>
            <li>Why did they get rid of the old classic scent?  </li>
            <li>This is the only product (and I have tried many) that softens and removes rough, calloused skin on my feet.</li>
            <li>I really wish they&#x27;d go back to the old scent.</li>
            <li>This is most definitely scented, but while the old scent was lovely, this one just stinks.</li>
            <li>I work in Afghanistan in \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; weather and this product keeps my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>so my hands don&#x27;t end up looking like an old lady.</li>
            <li>My dad (who is no longer alive) had some of this that I tried, and could never figure out who sells it.  </li>
            <li>But even just using it at night is enough to relieve much of the dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day, and my hands are back to normal after a week!</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t help that I moved to dry Arizona.</li>
            <li>If my hands are starting to crack and bleed, this is instant relief and used on a daily basis, like right before bed, it prevents the dreaded dishpan hand syndrome.</li>
            <li>It is completely absorbed in less than a minute so no stickiness to worry about.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff that really moisturizes my hand completely when they are really dry.  </li>
            <li>The tube is small enough to fit into my purse.</li>
            <li>I now constantly get compliments on how soft my hands always feel.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and you only need a little</li>
            <li>It works so well that in warmer months of the year, I only use it at bedtime, and that&#x27;s enough to keep my hands moisturized and soft all day.  </li>
            <li>WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE W/ DRY SKIN PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY THE ONES</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition.</li>

            <li> My dad (who is no longer alive) had some of this that I tried, and could never figure out who sells it.  </li>
            <li> But even just using it at night is enough to relieve much of the dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day, and my hands are back to normal after a week!</li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t help that I moved to dry Arizona.</li>
            <li> If my hands are starting to crack and bleed, this is instant relief and used on a daily basis, like right before bed, it prevents the dreaded dishpan hand syndrome.</li>
            <li> It is completely absorbed in less than a minute so no stickiness to worry about.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that really moisturizes my hand completely when they are really dry.  </li>
            <li> The tube is small enough to fit into my purse.</li>
            <li> I now constantly get compliments on how soft my hands always feel.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and you only need a little</li>
            <li> It works so well that in warmer months of the year, I only use it at bedtime, and that&#x27;s enough to keep my hands moisturized and soft all day.  </li>
            <li> WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE W/ DRY SKIN PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY THE ONES</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition.</li>
            <li> you would be SHOCKED, seriously how much cream is in, while I was searching, we did this for my mother &amp; she literally got 8 more days worth of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other hand lotions from L&#x27;occitane, Lush, Vaseline, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but if your hands are severely dry, Aveeno may work better for you than this product.</li>
            <li> Just a small dose of this hand cream really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> The tubes are small, but you don&#x27;t need to use much at a time.</li>
            <li> It is a long lasting moisturizer that can be used as lip balm or eye cream, as well.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit to rub into the cuticles to keep them soft.</li>
            <li> were I work/ because I live in Michigan and the winter can be extremely harsh on my hands.</li>
            <li> When the bottle is almost empty, it is hard to get out of the tube because it is thick and doesn&#x27;t flow toward the opening, so I have sometimes cut it open to make sure I get every last bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This cream was actually a recommendation from my doctor after my hands had a dry reaction from rash cream.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I suffer from dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and soothes dry skin, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has very dry skin &amp; has tried numerous products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it has any bad reviews because it is SO amazing.</li>
            <li> Love using it in the cold Chicago winter months.</li>
            <li> I was suprised to find out they have a different scent than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena hand cream for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Being the dishwasher in the family, my poor paws are exposed to hot water and detergents on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> She has extremely dry skin and gets some minor abrasion type sores on her elbows.</li>
            <li> My hands get so dry and chapped that they bleed.  </li>
            <li> I have dry itchy eyelids</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li> Her nurse brought her this cream to try &amp; see if it would help w/ her elbows &amp; her dry skin since NOTHING else was working &amp;</li>
            <li> and she uses it on her dry skin areas &amp; it works like a miracle.</li>
            <li> NEVER wake up with dry hands.</li>
            <li> I use it in dry hands or a tad damp for faster coverage.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena has come up with a way to heal that dry, cracked winter skin . . .</li>
            <li> I am a germaphobe so my hands are always dry from all the washing and hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long</li>
            <li> This new formula, scented and unscented, is really not effective at healing my severely chapped/dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have always had very dry skin that caused cracked skin.</li>
            <li> and they get very dry.  </li>
            <li> Some creams work a little, but nothing compares to Neutrogena Norwegian formula.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the item pictures is not what I received the second time.  </li>
            <li> Its quite thick and balmy, but not oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> my hands and arms and legs usually get incredibly dry, especially during winter time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and, before finding it, had tried dozens of other hand creams.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if all people smell it the same way.</li>
            <li> Every other lotion she has ever used just seems to &#x27;float&#x27; on the surface and doesn&#x27;t penetrate.</li>
            <li> Small tube - big results.</li>
            <li> If you handle a lot of paper or just plain have dry skin, this is the cure.</li>
            <li> My hands get pretty chapped after a few days in the cold, dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin, and every winter I have trouble with my extremely dried and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slightly greasy feeling, so I tend to use it at night.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> A little tip for everyone.....when you think you are out of this cream...cut the end of the tube &amp; down one side...</li>
            <li> A little like vaseline so be warned, its tacky..</li>
            <li> On a few occasions I&#x27;ve literally been woke up out of my sleep because of it.</li>
            <li> I like to use a heavy hand cream on my hands in the winter at night when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it soaks in after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Then they changed the scent a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm even I&#x27;m the dead of Colorado winter when the heat is cranked.</li>
            <li> smells like fowers icky, not original scent</li>
            <li> It lasts a lot longer than you might think since the tube seems a bit small</li>
            <li> No matter how bad and bloody my hands are - if I use Neutrogena Norwegian Formula hand cream only one time before bed two or three nights in a row, my hands will be healed and as soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> Thick.  </li>
            <li> I mean it.</li>
            <li> I used to use expensive hand creams from the Body Shop and other pricey stores.</li>
            <li> Especially in winter, my hands can get very uncomfortable and irritated.  </li>
            <li> This hand cream keeps my hands from cracking in the cold, dry Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> Just a small dab is needed to moisturize hands and protect from cold winter weather.</li>
            <li> And the new smell is awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and i have terrible skin.</li>
            <li> Probably, I am wrong but I feel the sample for this cream &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; maybe softer than the 2 ounce container.</li>
            <li> My work switched to the cheapest hand soap and it drys my hands so bad.  </li>
            <li> It was painful and downright horrid to walk around with cracked, bleeding hands.</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I mean NOTHING!!!!</li>
            <li> I hate lotion.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is great hand cream, but they changed the scent.</li>
            <li> Absolute wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I have found to keep dry hands from cracking and bleeding!</li>
            <li> Wish I could afford to purchase more right now....it is totally worth the price.  Hoping someone buys me some more for Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream for Dry Chapped Hands is wonderful.  I work in Afghanistan in \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; weather and this product keeps my hands soft.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> very good.  Thick.  Lasts</li>
            <li> The picture shows a flip-top cap--which is what I wanted.  That is not what I got.  I don&#x27;t notice much of a scent, but I am sure unscented would be better for the skin.</li>
            <li> My hands get so dry and chapped that they bleed.  I have tried many different lotions, which only irritate them more.  No matter how bad and bloody my hands are - if I use Neutrogena Norwegian Formula hand cream only one time before bed two or three nights in a row, my hands will be healed and as soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.  I am not joking.  This is like a miracle product.  I can&#x27;t believe it has any bad reviews because it is SO amazing.</li>
            <li> This item was pricey, but well worth every penny. First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition. I found that it is best used at nighttime. I&#x27;ve tried using it with nighttime gloves, and that works well too. I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves so you don&#x27;t chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries. I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this takes longer to absorb, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily, and because it&#x27;s so concentrated, that&#x27;s all I need to maintain smoother skin. It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague. For every diaper change, sneeze, runny nose and shared food, I am washing my hands A LOT! This product works as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works wonders on cracked elbows, heels and is soothing for skin conditions like Eczema.</li>
            <li> This cream was actually a recommendation from my doctor after my hands had a dry reaction from rash cream. This cream I have only used for 4 days and already I can see the difference in healing the dryness on my hands. The doctor also told me to use the material gloves at night for extra absorption.</li>
            <li> not greasy at all. great moisturizer</li>
            <li> This new scent smells like Glad Mountain Spring air freshner.  Why did they get rid of the old classic scent?  There is nothing to distinguish this cream anymore.  It smells like so many other inferior hand creams.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> This is the only product (and I have tried many) that softens and removes rough, calloused skin on my feet. My feet are softer than they have been in years! Wonderful product; excellent on my hands, elbows, and yes feet. Love it!</li>
            <li> Occasionally I suffer from dry chapped hands. On a few occasions I&#x27;ve literally been woke up out of my sleep because of it. Luckily I can across this product as a sampler for another I made. I must say I enjoyed this more than the initial purchase I received this for! It is very well consentrated, pleasant and not over powering scent. I now constantly get compliments on how soft my hands always feel. Neutrogena continues to deliver great products with this being added to the list!</li>
            <li> This hand cream provides a luxurious way to keep your hands smooth and soft. The cream absorbs quickly into the skin and has a neutral scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hand creme for years. I like to use a heavy hand cream on my hands in the winter at night when I go to bed. By morning, all chapped skin is healed. The smell is slight and pleasant. I received this on time and would highly recommend it to my friend.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, you are receiving a high quality for a low price. I got it in a very good conditions</li>
            <li> I have always had very dry skin that caused cracked skin. It certainly didn&#x27;t help that I moved to dry Arizona. This hand cream is the only product that helps my hands and stops the cracking.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and, before finding it, had tried dozens of other hand creams.  This is the only hand cream I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> This hand cream saves my hands during winter. I also use it for my feet and elbows before bed. The tube is small enough to fit into my purse. My first one had a flip top but now I can&#x27;t find the flip tops anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream! It only takes a little bit to rub into the cuticles to keep them soft.</li>
            <li> Finally found a lotion that works!</li>
            <li> unexpensive and good quality. This is my third one.</li>
            <li> smells like fowers icky, not original scent</li>
            <li> GREAT lotion - just wish the container was larger.  Will go through this in no time.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different hand creams because I wash my hands a lot and they get very dry.  Especially in winter, my hands can get very uncomfortable and irritated.  Some creams work a little, but nothing compares to Neutrogena Norwegian formula.  It&#x27;s true that you need only a dab for it to work.  It works so well that in warmer months of the year, I only use it at bedtime, and that&#x27;s enough to keep my hands moisturized and soft all day.  This is the only hand cream I will ever use now and I found a tube to last quite a while.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry and cracked hands.  My only complaint is the item pictures is not what I received the second time.  The item pictured has a flip top which makes dispensing the lotion easy and quick.  What I received after the first order was a screw type top.  You have to screw the entire top off, dispense lotion, screw top back on, and apply lotion.  I had thoughts of taking the flip top from my first tube and installing it on my second but the flip top seems fused on.  Still a great product but needs work on the delivery system.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for dry, chapped hands.  Would definitely recommend!!  I prefer the scented versus the unscented, but both work well!!</li>
            <li> My hands get pretty chapped after a few days in the cold, dry winter weather.  This creme works very well.  Its quite thick and balmy, but not oily feeling.  I like to use it at night with moisturizing gloves.  The two-pack is a great deal, so I have some handy (ha!) in various bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and i have terrible skin. my hands and arms and legs usually get incredibly dry, especially during winter time. this cream is the only cream so far that helps keep my hands from becoming chapped.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It is a long lasting moisturizer that can be used as lip balm or eye cream, as well. There aren&#x27;t any perfumes to irritate your skin or bother those around you, like office mates, family members or fellow subway riders.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry hands, and this hand cream is the only kind that works for him. It stays on for quite a while after applying it. We would definitely recommend it to anyone who has the same problem.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it soaks in after a few minutes. I was suprised to find out they have a different scent than I expected. The last tube I bought from a CVS store 2 years ago smelled like Este Lauder perfume? Which even though I am a man, it was not offensive to women; when I put it on. The new scent smells to me like Crew? I am not sure if all people smell it the same way. I thought that original formula meant original scent but the box actually says new scent! This is not noted on the web page describing the product. The scent seems more subtl and wears off faster than the other scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena hand cream for a long time.  I know you are not supposed to wear hand cream on your face, but I do use this. I have dry itchy eyelids and I even apply it there. Feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Regular Neutrogena quality. If you are not looking for a water based moisturizer specifically, this can be your product choice,</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that really moisturizes my hand completely when they are really dry.  It lasts a lot longer than you might think since the tube seems a bit small</li>
            <li> Best hand cream I have found for badly chapped body parts. A little like vaseline so be warned, its tacky..</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and soothes dry skin, especially in winter. The smaller tube size makes it perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products deliver! This is the best stuff for dry chapped skin, even for your feet. It&#x27;s not greasy and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quick. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Being the dishwasher in the family, my poor paws are exposed to hot water and detergents on a daily basis. And as a frequent user of bleach, I have stripped the natural oils from my skin more times than I care to remember. It was painful and downright horrid to walk around with cracked, bleeding hands. When I ran out of this stuff, I used a regular hand cream and hoped for the best  Not even Aveeno could repair the damage. But this is a lifesaver. I mean it. I don&#x27;t use anything else. If my hands are starting to crack and bleed, this is instant relief and used on a daily basis, like right before bed, it prevents the dreaded dishpan hand syndrome. So my hands may not be perfect, but in the morning, they are smooth and nice. You can&#x27;t even tell I labor at the sink all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone who toils with their hands. I really need to start buying this stuff in bulk!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also useful on elbows and face.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands. This did not work for me.</li>
            <li> During winter months Neutrogena Hand Cream is the best. Just a small dab is needed to moisturize hands and protect from cold winter weather.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever. It is not greasy and it lasts for hours.  Love using it in the cold Chicago winter months.</li>
            <li> This product is labeled &amp;#34;Original&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is heavy and stinky not like the REAL original. The company, when asked, can&#x27;t explain what&#x27;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;Only buy the Fragrance free version or else you will be disappointed. I think it&#x27;s still the same.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who is in hospice. She has extremely dry skin and gets some minor abrasion type sores on her elbows. Her nurse brought her this cream to try &amp; see if it would help w/ her elbows &amp; her dry skin since NOTHING else was working &amp; I mean NOTHING!!!! Not even the cream that hospice provided helped! Literally in 2 days her elbow was cleared up and she uses it on her dry skin areas &amp; it works like a miracle. I would recommend this to anyone who has very dry skin &amp; has tried numerous products. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in the winter on my hands, they crack, bleed, etc....I have every confidence that this winter my hands will be pain free for once! You cannot beat the price for the 2 tube package! I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere and decided to try on here. My local drug stores told me to try Macy&#x27;s, knowing that I would probably be ripped off if I went there of course I turned to Amazon...who else would you turn to when in such need? &#x3D;) Sure enough they had in stock &amp; in 2 days I had it for my mother. A little tip for everyone.....when you think you are out of this cream...cut the end of the tube &amp; down one side...you would be SHOCKED, seriously how much cream is in, while I was searching, we did this for my mother &amp; she literally got 8 more days worth of use. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE W/ DRY SKIN PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY THE ONES, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, WHO HAVE TRIED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. Amazon also offers automatic delivery every so many days on this item if you choose to do this!</li>
            <li> This used to be the best hand cream out there, but they changed the formula in 2009. This new formula, scented and unscented, is really not effective at healing my severely chapped/dry skin in the winter. It doesn&#x27;t penetrate the skin much and it certainly doesn&#x27;t last. I recommend Aveeno, just the regular, general purpose tube (got a big tube for $8). Aveeno actually moisturizes my skin, lasts to some extent, and wicks water to some extent. It&#x27;s not perfect, but if your hands are severely dry, Aveeno may work better for you than this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I have to wash my hands a lot were I work/ because I live in Michigan and the winter can be extremely harsh on my hands. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other hand lotions from L&#x27;occitane, Lush, Vaseline, etc. and found the ones from L&#x27;occitane and Lush to be great creams, but were too rich and made my hands a little bit to oily to do anything without wiping them dry. While this doesn&#x27;t have the same richness as those hand creams it does a great job of sealing your hands without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I used to use expensive hand creams from the Body Shop and other pricey stores. Now I have found this hand cream on Amazon after trying and loving the Neutrogena foot cream. This hand cream keeps my hands from cracking in the cold, dry Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> I have always used this hand cream as I feel it is the best for dry or chapped hands. And the 2 pack at a great price cannot be beaten.</li>
            <li> My mom uses this hand cream and so I use this hand cream. I love it. It saved my hands winter after winter in the Midwest. And the smell reminds me of my mom and makes me feel happy. Well... it DID. Then they changed the scent a few years ago. And the new smell is awful. Overly sweet and cloying and it gives me a headache. I really wish they&#x27;d go back to the old scent.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and you only need a little so it lasts forever. Worth the extra money because it REALLY works.</li>
            <li> I have used several hand creams, this one is really great, wish i could get discount if i order more than one</li>
            <li> My wife uses lotion every day.  My skin is a grease factory.  I hate lotion.  She however says this stuff seems to just heal her skin and sink in.  Every other lotion she has ever used just seems to &#x27;float&#x27; on the surface and doesn&#x27;t penetrate. Something about this stuff just works.  She is sold!</li>
            <li> I loved the old scent, and was amazed to find it replaced by something like bathroom deodorizer. The description said original or unscented. This is most definitely scented, but while the old scent was lovely, this one just stinks. Still the same great hand cream underneath, but so not the same. YUCK.</li>
            <li> The product is ok. Probably, I am wrong but I feel the sample for this cream &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; maybe softer than the 2 ounce container.</li>
            <li> What smell are ppl talking about?  I use this every night. Sits at my bedside. I use it thru all seasons every night. NEVER wake up with dry hands. This is NOT a cream. It&#x27;s an ointment consistency which I prefer. I use it in dry hands or a tad damp for faster coverage. Works like a charm even I&#x27;m the dead of Colorado winter when the heat is cranked.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have always loved how well it moisturizes my hands.  I work in an office environment, and this is the only lotion I have found that heals paper cuts.  I always keep a bottle in my desk at work, in both of our cars, and in all bathrooms at home.</li>
            <li> My work switched to the cheapest hand soap and it drys my hands so bad.  I bought this to take to work so my hands don&#x27;t end up looking like an old lady.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream not just for hand, I use it this winter all over my face at night too.  As a matter of fact, I bought 8 more, great product that won&#x27;t need big bucks to achieve better skin.  Especially when you&#x27;re over 30, 40 or 50.  Comes 60 you definitely need this!</li>
            <li> Starts off just slightly greasy, but once absorbed is a perfect healing lotion for my hands.  I prefer this to many more expensive selections.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hand cream I have ever used.  My dad (who is no longer alive) had some of this that I tried, and could never figure out who sells it.  Then I found it on Amazon.  Neutrogena has come up with a way to heal that dry, cracked winter skin . . . maybe that&#x27;s why its called \\&quot;Norwegian formula\\&quot;  do they use it in Norway??</li>
            <li> Really good product, softens skin when no other cream will - American version (which this is) is so far superior to the Korean product I can get locally and is cheaper! WIll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Just a small dose of this hand cream really moisturizes well. It is completely absorbed in less than a minute so no stickiness to worry about. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is hand cream is the best I have found for healing my chapped hands in the winter.  I have also used it on my lips. It does leave a slightly greasy feeling, so I tend to use it at night. But even just using it at night is enough to relieve much of the dryness. I appreciate that it also is free of fragrance and dyes. The tubes are small, but you don&#x27;t need to use much at a time. When the bottle is almost empty, it is hard to get out of the tube because it is thick and doesn&#x27;t flow toward the opening, so I have sometimes cut it open to make sure I get every last bit.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Life saver during winter months - I keep a tube at home and a tube at work! Got all of my friends hooked after they saw the cream work its magic on my severely dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin, and every winter I have trouble with my extremely dried and chapped hands. However, this hand cream saved me from the pain! I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day, and my hands are back to normal after a week! Last week my hands were chapped and even hurt, but now its clean and soft. I will use this product forever.</li>
            <li> I am a germaphobe so my hands are always dry from all the washing and hand sanitizer. This stuff really works to repair the damage plus it soaks in fast!</li>
            <li> Intense. Small tube - big results. My cuticles couldn&#x27;t survive without this stuff. If you handle a lot of paper or just plain have dry skin, this is the cure.</li>
