            <li>Why should I use their products on my hair if my hair will not wind up beautiful, as it should be?</li>
            <li>Gone is everything that made this mousse great.</li>
            <li>It worked great for me.</li>
            <li>This mousse used to be great until the formula of it was changed.  </li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t think of anything good about this mousse.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>skip this if you know what&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this mousse more than chocolate, ice cream, cookies, kittens, diamonds and massages combined.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>My best suggestion is to stear clear of this one!!!  </li>
            <li>I liked this mousse better before the ingredients were changed.  </li>
            <li>This should be able to stand on</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found my mousse here.</li>
            <li>I theorize that this is because there were too many moisturizers or emollients in the mousse.  </li>
            <li>(To summarize, the mousse seemed to have too many moisturizers in it which didn&#x27;t let my hair curl, made my hair feel oily and lengthened the drying time of my hair.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had more than when I used this.&lt;BR&gt;7.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve used many products).  </li>
            <li>most was the control.  </li>
            <li>I wanted alot more hold.  </li>
            <li>I would have preferred a mousse better at shaping curls, better at holding curls and better at controlling curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a cabinet full of JUNK that will never get used.</li>
            <li>Springing Curls Mousse by L&#x27;Oreal has got to be the most foul hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried - and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried some real stinkers.  </li>
            <li>And in humidity the style disappears quickly.   </li>
            <li>it was easy to use and reasonable priced but aside from that it has nothing going for it.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>If they can&#x27;t treat me right, why should I give them my money.  </li>
            <li>Since then, however, the sparkle has gone right out of this mousse.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pump up curls, it doesn&#x27;t hold and it certainly doesn&#x27;t give the amount of control that we curly-haired girls (and guys!) require.  </li>
            <li>At best you get pseudo-curls and they definitely aren&#x27;t springing (they hang there like limp pieces of spaghetti and look about as appetizing).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>when before the change it was the first thing I reached for.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much this mousse stank!  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t hold enough so my hair poofed even more as the day went on.  </li>
            <li>In the rain my hair frizzed up so fast!  </li>
            <li>this mousse should ideally get only half a star.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t volumize, it certainly doesn&#x27;t add body.  </li>
            <li>This styling aid is pure torture for your hair.  </li>
            <li>&lt;BR&gt;A minor points that irritated me about this mousse were that it had a strong smell (usually i don&#x27;t mind a strong smell as long as it goes away, because most products are strong, but this smell stayed on my fingers even after i washed them).</li>
            <li>I do not think this mousse is capable of working.  </li>
            <li>Plus, when I tried to use a curling iron on the wavy parts in order to creat some real curl, my hair just didn&#x27;t take to the iron.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair really &amp;quot;blah.&amp;quot;  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t really explain it except to say that it felt the slightest bit like it was coated with styrofoam or something.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the curls you do get do not have much staying power.  </li>
            <li>And even if I mix it with other products, I&#x27;d still give it one star because the results aren&#x27;t much better.  </li>
            <li>But if my dreams come true and they change the mousse back to the way it used to be, they BUY it, USE it, WORSHIP it.</li>
            <li>hold level on this mousse was not as high as Loreal would like you to believe.  </li>
            <li>This mousse doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, spend your dollars elsewhere on products that really work and aren&#x27;t ruined by corporate tampering.</li>
            <li>My naturally curly had seemed to be hampered by this mousse (a thing that has NEVER happened with a styling aid).  </li>
            <li>The texture of this mousse was very strange and it made my hair strange: my curls didn&#x27;t spring up as they normally do but instead felt kind of slick, as if I had put too much  product on (although I used a tiny amount of mousse).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I&#x27;m willing to forgive and forget if only they will change the mousse back.</li>
            <li>I also had real problem in that after using this mousse the ends of my hair curled slightly but the hairs on the top half of my head seemed to dry together so that my hair didn&#x27;t really curl up there.  </li>
            <li>I never like to write an entirely bad review on anything, so I&#x27;ll start with a positive: this mousse was user-friendly because the dispenser was real easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I attribute this directly to the mousse because Ive never had such a thing happen to my hair</li>
            <li>bottom line here is that as long as L&#x27;Oreal is producing the mousse as it is right now then I advise consumers to find other products to use.  </li>
            <li>The quality is very low on this mousse, as it is with this company&#x27;s products in general.</li>
            <li>The curls didn&#x27;t hold and my hair wasn&#x27;t controled enough in general after using this mousse.  </li>

            <li> Hair still does not turn out nicely but merely tolerable; this mousse has to use the support of other products in order to work in the slightest bit.  </li>
            <li> This mousse made my hair an absolute mess!  </li>
            <li> i also didn&#x27;t like this mousse because my hair stayed damp for much longer than usual.  </li>
            <li> I get flat wavey things.  </li>
            <li> Also, the mousse didn&#x27;t offer much in the way of staying power so my hair became loose and what little curl I got did not stay around for long.  </li>
            <li> My curls were all tangled and my hair turned out oily and took a long time to dry after I used this product.</li>
            <li> The only way this mousse stands a chance is to combine it with a multitude of other products.  </li>
            <li> plus, my hair felt very strange; the texture was &#x27;off&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold and it doesn&#x27;t enhance curl and it takes hours for my hair to dry fully after using it.  </li>
            <li> it felt greasy and when my hair was dry</li>
            <li> This mousse takes a very long time to dry on your hair!  </li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t even stay put for very long!</li>
            <li> Some places had individual curls but other places had big messy clumpy curls that were stuck together.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t in the slightest do what a traditional mousse should do, much less do what you&#x27;d expect a mousse named &amp;quot;springing curls&amp;quot; to do.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed to give me less curl.</li>
            <li> i was left with less than curly hair and the sorts</li>
            <li> After my hair dried it was rather frizzy and once I went outside my hair frizzed up even worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The last few inches of my hair curled while the rest of my hair was turned into kinky waves that stuck together.  </li>
            <li> i recently tried this product because i thought i might be missing on something</li>
            <li> When my hair was wet</li>
            <li> After using, my curls were too big and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t deliver - plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get curls in the true sense of the word, you get twisted strands of hair in some places and matted down waves in other places.  </li>
            <li> Another complaint I have of this mousse include the fact that the mousse didn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s style for very long (in order to get the curl to hold I needed to use a lot of hair spray, I don&#x27;t like doing this because it means putting extra products on my hair).  </li>
            <li> This was due to the fact that this mousse did nothing to stop frizz</li>
            <li> The end result is not pretty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mixing it with other products, but what&#x27;s the point in that?  </li>
            <li> In other words, the mousse was too oily.  </li>
            <li> This mousse practically reduces curl.&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of other products out there, so I would recommend that you explore them and stay away from this one.  </li>
            <li> This mousse loses its hold after a short time!  </li>
            <li> and, I believe, was the reason why my took longer than usual to air dry.  </li>
            <li> Worse yet, the layering of products makes hair dirty and damaged; it is time comsuming and inefficient to use so many product, not to mention costly.   </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to do normal things that a mousse does, like give control or curl, then you&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree.</li>
            <li> It turned my hair into a gloppy mess whenever I used it.  </li>
            <li> Greasy hair &#x3D; little control, frizz-prone strands and is not voluminous.</li>
            <li> This mousse gets two thumbs down!  </li>
            <li> The curls it makes are sallow, few and do not hold.  </li>
            <li> Adds body: The sky will turn green before this happens.  </li>
            <li> I used to use this mousse everyday</li>
            <li> my curls were way too limp....</li>
            <li> This mousse made my hair look SO VERY BAD that I would have been better off styling it with MOTOR OIL.  </li>
            <li> This mousse is not worthy!  </li>
            <li> My hair got even puffier than usual.  </li>
            <li> The curls I got were twisted together and not defined: my hair looked as though I had one big curl.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> When i usually style my hair</li>
            <li> This made it virtually impossible for me to create any curly tendrils either naturally or with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> ...didn&#x27;t like this one in the least....</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly/wavy, (sometimes frizzy) hair.  </li>
            <li> It would be a hard challenge to find a worse mousse than L&#x27;OReal Paris Studio Line</li>
            <li> This mousse is forgettable.  </li>
            <li> : This is laughable.  </li>
            <li> (but boy was i wrong).  </li>
            <li> i had were these weird spiral things that were way too wispy.  </li>
            <li> This mousse failed in all.  </li>
            <li> bottom line is that this product made my hair look REALLY BAD</li>
            <li> My advice to people thinking about trying this mousse is to resist the urge and NOT to try it: this mousse was so bad that I had to spread the word about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviwed a product before, but this one was so bad I just had to warn people.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Springing Curls Mousse gave me ugly hair.  </li>
            <li> I was horribly disappointed when I could no longer find this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that bad!  </li>
            <li> Change is bad!  </li>
            <li> This mousse smells bad and the stink won&#x27;t go away!  </li>
            <li> I HATED the texture of my hair after using this.  </li>
            <li> I HATED how frizzy my hair was from this mousse.  </li>
            <li> What I HATED</li>
            <li> I HATED the curl this mousse gave.  </li>
            <li> Every thing else I have tried was awful.</li>
            <li> This mousse has got to be the worst mousse ever.  </li>
            <li> These awful reviews articulated my feelings after using this awful mousse myself.  </li>
            <li> THIS MOUSSE IS TOTALLY TERRIBLE!!!  </li>
            <li> The worst thing about this mousse was that it didn&#x27;t help my curly hair at all.  </li>
            <li> it made my hair feel nasty</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have thick, curly/wavy, (sometimes frizzy) hair.  However, whenever I use a styling aid all of these problems vanish.  With the springing curls mousse, though, it seemed to heighten the problems I have with my hair.  My hair got even puffier than usual.  This was due to the fact that this mousse did nothing to stop frizz and it did nothing to improve my curls so they went in every direction possible which has never happened to me with anything else.  This mousse says it has medium hold but I do not believe that.  It did not hold my curls at all: it left them go everywhere and it also did not hold the curl so that by the end of the day my curls were sagging.  If you have curly/wavy hair and are looking for something to give even the slightest bit of control then KEEP ON LOOKING because this is not the mousse to help you!</li>
            <li> I LOVED this mousse more than chocolate, ice cream, cookies, kittens, diamonds and massages combined.  I used it daily and was flattered repeatedly about my hairstyle.  Then, L&#x27;Oreal, in its infinite wisdom, change the product but kept the same name.  Without warning.  Without advertising.  Without REASON! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now the mousse is a shadow of its former self.  Gone are the anti-frizz components.  Gone are the bouncy curls.  Gone is the hold.  Gone is everything that made this mousse great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This mousse does not get results any longer.  The curls it makes are sallow, few and do not hold.  The only way this mousse stands a chance is to combine it with a multitude of other products.  The end result is not pretty.  Hair still does not turn out nicely but merely tolerable; this mousse has to use the support of other products in order to work in the slightest bit.  Worse yet, the layering of products makes hair dirty and damaged; it is time comsuming and inefficient to use so many product, not to mention costly.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With all of these problems, one must wonder why the mousse was changed.  I do not have an answer.  All I can say is that each night I hope upon hope that L&#x27;Oreal will come to their senses and make the mousse as it should be made. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&#x27;ve stopped being a consumer of theirs.  If they can&#x27;t treat me right, why should I give them my money.  Why should I use their products on my hair if my hair will not wind up beautiful, as it should be? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;m willing to forgive and forget if only they will change the mousse back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line here is that as long as L&#x27;Oreal is producing the mousse as it is right now then I advise consumers to find other products to use.  But if my dreams come true and they change the mousse back to the way it used to be, they BUY it, USE it, WORSHIP it.</li>
            <li> Springing curls mousse just doesn&#x27;t make the grade at all anymore.  It seems like all the benefits of this mousse were changed when the ingredients were changed.  Now it can&#x27;t enhance or create curl, it doesn&#x27;t hold at all and it feels greasy to the touch which translates to hair texture as well.  I&#x27;ve had to stop using the product all together when before the change it was the first thing I reached for.  I do not think this mousse is capable of working.  I&#x27;ve tried mixing it with other products, but what&#x27;s the point in that?  This should be able to stand on it&#x27;s own.  And even if I mix it with other products, I&#x27;d still give it one star because the results aren&#x27;t much better.  I don&#x27;t know why companies change their products but I think that 9 times out of 10 it is a mistake and this is one of those 9 times.  Don&#x27;t bother trying springing curls mousse until L&#x27;Oreal changed the product back.  It isn&#x27;t worth it.  In the meantime, spend your dollars elsewhere on products that really work and aren&#x27;t ruined by corporate tampering.</li>
            <li> I was horribly disappointed when I could no longer find this product. It worked great for me. Every thing else I have tried was awful. I have a cabinet full of JUNK that will never get used. I am so glad to have found my mousse here.</li>
            <li> I never like to write an entirely bad review on anything, so I&#x27;ll start with a positive: this mousse was user-friendly because the dispenser was real easy to use.  &lt;br /&gt;Other than that point, I can&#x27;t think of anything good about this mousse.&lt;br /&gt;The hold level on this mousse was not as high as Loreal would like you to believe.  I thought it had a minimum of hold whether I used it with or without hairspray.  This mousse didn&#x27;t inhibit frizz as well as the bottle insinuated either.  AS for volumizing or adding body, this mousse fell short again.</li>
            <li> This mousse totally bites!  It doesn&#x27;t deliver - plain and simple.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to do normal things that a mousse does, like give control or curl, then you&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree.</li>
            <li> This mousse has got to be the worst mousse ever.  I used it in order to get some control on my curls and to enhance my curls.  I did not get either.  This mousse made my hair an absolute mess!  The curls I got were twisted together and not defined: my hair looked as though I had one big curl.  Also, the mousse didn&#x27;t offer much in the way of staying power so my hair became loose and what little curl I got did not stay around for long.  Finally, this mousse does nothing to prevent frizz.  After my hair dried it was rather frizzy and once I went outside my hair frizzed up even worse.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this product made my hair look REALLY BAD and it did not do one tenth of what it advertised.</li>
            <li> This mousse used to be great until the formula of it was changed.  Since then, however, the sparkle has gone right out of this mousse.  It doesn&#x27;t pump up curls, it doesn&#x27;t hold and it certainly doesn&#x27;t give the amount of control that we curly-haired girls (and guys!) require.  My best suggestion is to stear clear of this one!!!  (And wish on a shooting star that the formula is changed back.)</li>
            <li> This mousse is forgettable.  It smoothed out my curls a bit but it did not enhance them.  It held for only a short time.  And in the humidity it made my hair frizzy and just a bit slimy to the touch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I just HAD to write one for this so-called mousse.  This mousse made my hair look SO VERY BAD that I would have been better off styling it with MOTOR OIL.  My naturally curly had seemed to be hampered by this mousse (a thing that has NEVER happened with a styling aid).  The last few inches of my hair curled while the rest of my hair was turned into kinky waves that stuck together.  Plus, when I tried to use a curling iron on the wavy parts in order to creat some real curl, my hair just didn&#x27;t take to the iron.  I theorize that this is because there were too many moisturizers or emollients in the mousse.  In other words, the mousse was too oily.  The oily-ness was also a problem because it gave my hair a oily feel and, I believe, was the reason why my took longer than usual to air dry.  (To summarize, the mousse seemed to have too many moisturizers in it which didn&#x27;t let my hair curl, made my hair feel oily and lengthened the drying time of my hair.)  Another complaint I have of this mousse include the fact that the mousse didn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s style for very long (in order to get the curl to hold I needed to use a lot of hair spray, I don&#x27;t like doing this because it means putting extra products on my hair).  My advice to people thinking about trying this mousse is to resist the urge and NOT to try it: this mousse was so bad that I had to spread the word about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this company was thinking when they made this product.  I threw the one I bought in the trash!  I wouldn&#x27;t use this mousse on my dog&#x27;s hair &gt;&gt;&gt; it&#x27;s that bad!  When I used it, I got waves isntead of curls and my hair was way too coated with product and the mousse didn&#x27;t hold the hair style.  There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m ever using this again and I don&#x27;t advise anyone else to, either.  The quality is very low on this mousse, as it is with this company&#x27;s products in general.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the one star reviews - this mousse should be placed in the HALL OF SHAME!  These awful reviews articulated my feelings after using this awful mousse myself.  However, I will make a point to say that literally everything this mousse claims to be is PHONY ADVERTISING!  Here&#x27;s a brief run-down:&lt;br /&gt;1. Springing Curls: This name is a joke.  At best you get pseudo-curls and they definitely aren&#x27;t springing (they hang there like limp pieces of spaghetti and look about as appetizing).&lt;br /&gt;2. Curl Volumizing: Fat chance.  Like I said, there are next to no curls.  As for volumizing, I can&#x27;t phathom how this can be claimed.  The hair get clumped together.&lt;BR&gt;3. Frizz control: This is laughable.  Frizz abounds when using this.  And when it&#x27;s humid out?  Forget it - you look like a tumbleweed.&lt;BR&gt;4. Medium hold: The overstatement of the millennium!  In fact, minimum hold for this mousse would be an overstatement.&lt;BR&gt;5. Adds body: The sky will turn green before this happens.  If it doesn&#x27;t volumize, it certainly doesn&#x27;t add body.  The hair has no shape.&lt;BR&gt;6.Reduces flyaways: Lies!  I&#x27;ve never had more than when I used this.&lt;BR&gt;7. Curl enhancing: The biggest lie of them all.  This mousse practically reduces curl.&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of other products out there, so I would recommend that you explore them and stay away from this one.  It&#x27;s a disaster from start to finish.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it and don&#x27;t use it!!  It would be a hard challenge to find a worse mousse than L&#x27;OReal Paris Studio Line Springing CUrls Mousse.  Yours curls won&#x27;t get volumized, your frizz won&#x27;t be controled and the hold will be nominal.  I could not be payed to use this mousse again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much this mousse stank!  It made my hair really &amp;quot;blah.&amp;quot;  The texture of this mousse was very strange and it made my hair strange: my curls didn&#x27;t spring up as they normally do but instead felt kind of slick, as if I had put too much  product on (although I used a tiny amount of mousse).  I also had real problem in that after using this mousse the ends of my hair curled slightly but the hairs on the top half of my head seemed to dry together so that my hair didn&#x27;t really curl up there.  I attribute this directly to the mousse because Ive never had such a thing happen to my hair (and I&#x27;ve used many products).  &lt;br /&gt;I recommend staying away from this mousse!  Not only does it not deliver what it says it will, I don&#x27;t even think this product should be on the market at all.  It doesn&#x27;t in the slightest do what a traditional mousse should do, much less do what you&#x27;d expect a mousse named &amp;quot;springing curls&amp;quot; to do.</li>
            <li> This mousse doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s name.  I used it and I didn&#x27;t get springing curls.  My curls were all tangled and my hair turned out oily and took a long time to dry after I used this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this mousse better before the ingredients were changed.  I used to use this mousse everyday but now I can&#x27;t use it at all.  It doesn&#x27;t hold and it doesn&#x27;t enhance curl and it takes hours for my hair to dry fully after using it.  Change is bad!  L&#x27;Oreal took one step backward by changing it.</li>
            <li> This mousse is not worthy!  I don&#x27;t get curls when using it.  I get flat wavey things.  And they don&#x27;t even stay put for very long! And in humidity the style disappears quickly.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    What I want is for the company that makes this mousse to realize that it made an error when it changed the formula of this mousse.  I want the alcohol put back in this mousse.  When it had alcohol, curls were plentiful, there was hold and there was resistance to humidity.</li>
            <li> THIS MOUSSE IS TOTALLY TERRIBLE!!!  I wouldn&#x27;t use it if it were the LAST MOUSSE ON EARTH!!!!  It didn&#x27;t give my curls volume, it didn&#x27;t do anything to stop frizz, it didn&#x27;t hold and it did NOT enhance my curls.  The worst thing about this mousse was that it didn&#x27;t help my curly hair at all.  It actually seemed to give me less curl.</li>
            <li> Want rockin&#x27; curls?  Then DON&#x27;T use this mousse!  You don&#x27;t get curls in the true sense of the word, you get twisted strands of hair in some places and matted down waves in other places.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting my hair to curl pefectly until I tried this mousse.  It was greasy and that was reflected on how my hair looked.  Greasy hair &#x3D; little control, frizz-prone strands and is not voluminous.</li>
            <li> i just had to write about this mousse!!!  Giving it one star is being way too generous!!!  When i usually style my hair i get curly hair that is in proportion, curls that can last for days at a time and i never even have to think about frizz.  i recently tried this product because i thought i might be missing on something (but boy was i wrong).  my hair turned out so messed up!  i was left with less than curly hair and the sorts curly hair i had were these weird spiral things that were way too wispy.  i felt like the mousse wasn&#x27;t holding the curl in place.  plus, my hair felt very strange; the texture was &#x27;off&#x27;.  i can&#x27;t really explain it except to say that it felt the slightest bit like it was coated with styrofoam or something.  i also didn&#x27;t like this mousse because my hair stayed damp for much longer than usual.  &lt;BR&gt;A minor points that irritated me about this mousse were that it had a strong smell (usually i don&#x27;t mind a strong smell as long as it goes away, because most products are strong, but this smell stayed on my fingers even after i washed them).</li>
            <li> this mousse should ideally get only half a star.  it was easy to use and reasonable priced but aside from that it has nothing going for it.  it didn&#x27;t tame my curly hair enough and made it poof out way too much.  it didn&#x27;t hold enough so my hair poofed even more as the day went on.  it made my hair feel nasty (it feels like it has been loaded up with moisturizers).  skip this if you know what&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li> ...didn&#x27;t like this one in the least....my curls were way too limp....my hair stuck out all over the place because this didn&#x27;t have enough control.....had issues with frizz....</li>
            <li> Springing Curls Mousse by L&#x27;Oreal has got to be the most foul hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried - and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried some real stinkers.  I have four categories by which I judge hair products: style, control, frizz and hair texture.  This mousse failed in all.  I HATED the texture of my hair after using this.  When my hair was wet it felt greasy and when my hair was dry the greasiness was still there.  I HATED how frizzy my hair was from this mousse.  In the rain my hair frizzed up so fast!  And even when it wasn&#x27;t raining my hair still has frizz in some places.  What I HATED most was the control.  The curls didn&#x27;t hold and my hair wasn&#x27;t controled enough in general after using this mousse.  I wanted alot more hold.  I HATED the curl this mousse gave.  Curls were in some place but not others.  Some places had individual curls but other places had big messy clumpy curls that were stuck together.</li>
            <li> This mousse gets two thumbs down!  It gives matted cown curls - not &amp;quot;springing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bouncy&amp;quot; curls.  In addition, the curls you do get do not have much staying power.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this mousse to anyone.</li>
            <li> This mousse smells bad and the stink won&#x27;t go away!  This mousse takes a very long time to dry on your hair!  This mousse allows your hair to frizz!  This mousse gives clumpy, lopsided curls!  This mousse loses its hold after a short time!  Get the hint?  This mousse is a piece of junk and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!  I&#x27;ve never reviwed a product before, but this one was so bad I just had to warn people.</li>
            <li> This styling aid is pure torture for your hair.  It turned my hair into a gloppy mess whenever I used it.  This made it virtually impossible for me to create any curly tendrils either naturally or with a curling iron.  JUST SAY NO to this!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Springing Curls Mousse gave me ugly hair.  After using, my curls were too big and heavy.  I would have preferred a mousse better at shaping curls, better at holding curls and better at controlling curly hair.  This mousse didn&#x27;t cut it, not by a mile.</li>
