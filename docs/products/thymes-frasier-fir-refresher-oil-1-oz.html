            <li>Thank you Thymes for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This is the best refresher oil that I have found for the clay ornament.</li>
            <li>Thymes Frasier Fir has to be the best holiday scent ever!  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very bright woody scent.</li>
            <li>This is the best scent I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>The woods up here don&#x27;t even smell this good!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>The best &#x27;Christmas&#x27; scent ever :)</li>
            <li>Its all over my house.&lt;br /&gt;The most perfect fragrance for home</li>
            <li>Oh my god is this smell good.</li>
            <li>It smells so good in the bottle</li>
            <li>I have always loved the smell of pine trees and this Oil</li>
            <li>This is good, but I prefer and even stronger scent.</li>
            <li>This needs heat, and if I remember to put it on my lamp&#x27;s light bulbs, it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>The air freshener is good too.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully with my cool mist diffuser.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it makes my house smell like winter!  </li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>My housecleaner turned me on to this amazing scent.</li>
            <li>It makes my room smell like a forest, gives it that warm and comfy feeling.</li>
            <li>I put it in a pan of warm water and set on my warming plate on my oven.</li>
            <li>It had a nice scent</li>
            <li>Maybe the best way to describe them is that, to me,  they smell more like  a real evergreen than many of the brands I tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>so I have to choose scents that are natural, and this is the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years and LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this clean, citrus, woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this stuff! :)</li>
            <li>both her and my dad love</li>
            <li>but I found that as it interacts with the Frasier Fir potpourri, the smell does change a bit (not for the better).</li>
            <li>I love the smell of fir.&lt;br /&gt;Regrettably, this bottle did not have the scent I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole house smells great all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love love love the scent.</li>
            <li>Favorite scent for my home.</li>
            <li>I also love the diffuser oil and sticks.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT  </li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>I love the Thymes Frasier Fir candle</li>
            <li>I love it during the holiday season</li>
            <li>I have posted on this Oil before - nothing I can say more  than I love it - it does the job no matter where &amp; how I use it.</li>
            <li>but I really love it.</li>
            <li>my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a special treat!</li>
            <li>Thymes does it best- don&#x27;t even try any other brand.</li>
            <li>Great price with free shipping and arrive early.</li>
            <li>fills a large room with the very authentic fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is refreshing yet sweet.  </li>
            <li>and I intend to keep them there all year with this fabulous oil in them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Christmas memory-evoking, but it also is reminiscent of the great Northwest with all the fragrant firs.</li>
            <li>She puts a dab on the light bulbs and when it heats up the room smells great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also put it on my bathroom light bulbs.  </li>
            <li>It is not overwhelming and is a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>Of the many varieties of frasier fir candles, diffusers, room scents, and refresher oils, Thymes Frasier Fir products are by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I tried it because I love the Thymes Frasier Fir dishwashing liquid (which I use as hand soap) and has a very pleasing, fresh (and strong) fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is clean, crisp and fills the air with \\&quot;mountain woods</li>
            <li>It is not a extremely strong scent, but a light and pleasant one.  </li>
            <li>My order was shipped so fast!</li>
            <li>It really smells like a fir tree is in the room!</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is also a better  value than I have found locally.</li>
            <li>I purchased several of the scent diffusers for many rooms of the house</li>
            <li>This actually helps me breathe better.</li>
            <li>I spend a small fortune annually on Yankee Candles Balsam scent and this is just as wonderful and will be cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li>I put a drop on top of water in my little oil diffuser (just the one powered by a tiny candle, nothing fancy), and it makes my whole room smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Use this in reed diffuser in large walk in closet.  </li>
            <li>will certainly order this product again and use this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have been known to break it out even when it&#x27;s not near the holidays, smells so clean!</li>
            <li>I bought this after I bought the candle, and realized I was burning that way too fast for the price.</li>
            <li>some undertone that just does not smell real.</li>
            <li>Is that a real tree??</li>
            <li>Was looking for an oil to have my house smell like a real Christmas tree, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller very promptly refunded my money when we discussed</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>She said it really beats the \\&quot;cinnamon simmer</li>
            <li>It fills my house with the scent of real fir trees.</li>
            <li>It gives me the feeling of winter&#x27;s holiday, warm and cozy inside by a fire.</li>
            <li>I can use it in one section of my house and it permeates into the whole apartment.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but very strong.</li>
            <li>Oh, I also use many other Frasier Fir products.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with this fragrance for two and a half years.  </li>
            <li>what a refreshing scent, it feels like Xmas everyday of the week just how i like it...</li>
            <li>The scent brings back memories of fresh cut Christmas trees,  and the boughs used to decorate mantles and door ways.</li>
            <li>live in a ski resort town on a mountain.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really expensive, but it&#x27;s so amazing that it&#x27;s worth it, if you are a Fir fan.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I occasionally just add to a light bulb for some instant aroma.</li>
            <li>I love to smell Frasier Fir all year round!</li>
            <li>Since purchasing this I have noticed many other of my friends and families homes smelling of the same aroma</li>
            <li>but I prefer to burn the oils in an old fashion oil warmer.  </li>
            <li>only concern is that, while my first order came in a bubble wrapped, well protected package, second order was sort of just placed in a box.  </li>
            <li>I put it in a pink salt oil diffuser and it makes my whole apartment smell like Christmas!</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent - really refreshes my bathroom - like this so much that I have brought several bottles of Frasier Fir for friends and family - reminds me of driving through the Maine woods</li>
            <li>Alas, most years I cannot find this smell.  </li>
            <li>One ounce doesn&#x27;t seem like very much, but when you only need to use a few drops at a time, it does last quite a long time.</li>

            <li> I use the refresher oil in my potpourri, in the clay diffuser ornament on my tree, and on a cotton ball in my vacuum bag.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews that it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I have tried to use this on potpourri but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long using it that way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing a small eye dropper as you do not need much and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this less expensive oil to the more costly reed diffuser.</li>
            <li> This one did not deliver as I had expected for the price.</li>
            <li> and I drop a few drips on the car freshener to bring it back to life.</li>
            <li> A few drops in a diffuser lasts for several weeks.</li>
            <li> last but not least, I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Put this into a \\&quot;spa room aromafier\\&quot;  (or any other diffuser), and also bring a Frasier Fir tree into your home.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the soy candles and other diffuser oils, and they make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> The diffuser, on the other hand, is AMAAAAAAAAAZING!  </li>
            <li> There is no dropper so you waste a lot of product.</li>
            <li> use it year round.</li>
            <li> I like very few fragrance oils, but this is one of them.</li>
            <li> Unlike the diswashing liquid, the scent of the refresher oil is weak and cannot be used by itself.</li>
            <li> smells fake.</li>
            <li> (my tree is fake so this helps)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
            <li> This stuff smells heavenly &amp; I hate artificial smells.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the refresher oil.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in the fragrance&#x27;s longevity.  </li>
            <li> ( I hate the pinesol smell)  </li>

            <li> Oh my god is this smell good. It makes my room smell like a forest, gives it that warm and comfy feeling.

I bought this after I bought the candle, and realized I was burning that way too fast for the price. I think this should last quite a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my boyfriend a candle with this scent, he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my sister a candle with this scent, she LOVES it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my mom a candle with this scent, both her and my dad love it.&lt;br /&gt;And last but not least, I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> It smells so good in the bottle but I found that as it interacts with the Frasier Fir potpourri, the smell does change a bit (not for the better).</li>

            <li> Great purchase! Works wonderfully with my cool mist diffuser. I prefer this less expensive oil to the more costly reed diffuser.</li>
            <li> smells fake. it some undertone that just does not smell real. my house smelled like a gas station bathroom</li>
            <li> i use this to freshen up the ornament and the wax in my potpourri burners.</li>
            <li> what a refreshing scent, it feels like Xmas everyday of the week just how i like it...</li>
            <li> fills a large room with the very authentic fragrance. Great product. Pricey but head and shoulders above others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Is that a real tree??</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! My order was shipped so fast! I was very impressed.I have always loved the smell of pine trees and this Oil is the perfect one..Love, Love, Love this stuff! :)</li>
            <li> Every year I search for a Christmas tree with the fragrance of balsam fir.  Alas, most years I cannot find this smell.  Until now.  Now, this fragrance is in a bottle.  Wow!!!  This stuff is really expensive, but it&#x27;s so amazing that it&#x27;s worth it, if you are a Fir fan.  I like very few fragrance oils, but this is one of them.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an oil to have my house smell like a real Christmas tree, this does the trick. A little pricey but very strong.</li>
            <li> Great product. It really smells like a fir tree is in the room!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the refresher oil. I tried it because I love the Thymes Frasier Fir dishwashing liquid (which I use as hand soap) and has a very pleasing, fresh (and strong) fragrance. Unlike the diswashing liquid, the scent of the refresher oil is weak and cannot be used by itself. I get no scent out of it at all after about 20 seconds. Another reviewer said you have to heat it to release the fragrance, which I don&#x27;t want to do.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of fir.&lt;br /&gt;Regrettably, this bottle did not have the scent I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The seller very promptly refunded my money when we discussed the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly order this product again and use this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;But when I order this &amp;#34;Christmas&amp;#34; product I might wait until this fall.</li>
            <li> Well, I have already used the bottle of this wonderful oil. I put it in a pan of warm water and set on my warming plate on my oven. The whole house smells great all day. Thank you Thymes for a wonderful product. Oh, I also use many other Frasier Fir products.</li>
            <li> I am using this to refresh some potpourri I got last year.  Additionally, I occasionally just add to a light bulb for some instant aroma.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent - really refreshes my bathroom - like this so much that I have brought several bottles of Frasier Fir for friends and family - reminds me of driving through the Maine woods</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. There is no dropper so you waste a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this clean, citrus, woodsy scent. Thymes does it best- don&#x27;t even try any other brand. I have &amp; regretted it every time.  I can&#x27;t always afford Thymes, but when I do- it&#x27;s a special treat! Like heaven, walking into any room w/this smell.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  The best &#x27;Christmas&#x27; scent ever :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love the scent. It smells just like the Frasier fir trees we have outside of our house.  I spend a small fortune annually on Yankee Candles Balsam scent and this is just as wonderful and will be cheaper in the long run.  I would recommend purchasing a small eye dropper as you do not need much and it goes a long way.  I am using it in the Quooz Lull Ultrasonic Aroma diffuser on my desk</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in the fragrance&#x27;s longevity.  It had a nice scent but I judge refreshers by the pungent smell and how long it lasts.  I always put potpourri in a bag, add plenty of refresher, and let it sit for a number of days.  This one did not deliver as I had expected for the price.</li>
            <li> This is good, but I prefer and even stronger scent.</li>
            <li> Great price with free shipping and arrive early. Thanks</li>
            <li> Of the many varieties of frasier fir candles, diffusers, room scents, and refresher oils, Thymes Frasier Fir products are by far my favorite.  Maybe the best way to describe them is that, to me,  they smell more like  a real evergreen than many of the brands I tried over the years.  I have used each of these Thyme items (candles, diffuser oil, room spray, refresher oil) .  The scent brings back memories of fresh cut Christmas trees,  and the boughs used to decorate mantles and door ways. I use the refresher oil in my potpourri, in the clay diffuser ornament on my tree, and on a cotton ball in my vacuum bag.  This is the best refresher oil that I have found for the clay ornament. The Amazon price is also a better  value than I have found locally.</li>
            <li> Smells like xmas !!&lt;br /&gt;which is what I was looking for..&lt;br /&gt;nice size as well.&lt;br /&gt;perfect !</li>
            <li> It smells like a fir tree!  I love that it makes my house smell like winter!  I will be purchasing this product again</li>
            <li> Favorite scent for my home.</li>
            <li> Thymes Frasier Fir has to be the best holiday scent ever!  I have been known to break it out even when it&#x27;s not near the holidays, smells so clean!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. I bought this to put on my car freshener sachet. I read reviews that it didn&#x27;t last long so I bought the oil and I drop a few drips on the car freshener to bring it back to life.</li>
            <li> I love to smell Frasier Fir all year round! The oil is not overpowering. I also love the diffuser oil and sticks.</li>
            <li> Put this into a \\&quot;spa room aromafier\\&quot;  (or any other diffuser), and also bring a Frasier Fir tree into your home.  Blindfold someone and I&#x27;ll  bet they can&#x27;t tell which is the tree and which is the diffuser.  This is the best scent I have ever experienced. I purchased several of the scent diffusers for many rooms of the house and I intend to keep them there all year with this fabulous oil in them. [[ASIN:B00I5W7NJ6 Unitrex - Aromafier Portable Fragrance Diffuser, 1 diffuser]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a ski resort town on a mountain. The woods up here don&#x27;t even smell this good! I have tried to use this on potpourri but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long using it that way. A few drops in a diffuser lasts for several weeks. I have tried the soy candles and other diffuser oils, and they make me sneeze. This actually helps me breathe better. It is clean, crisp and fills the air with \\&quot;mountain woods freshness\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My friend, a realtor, is now using this in every home she is selling. She said it really beats the \\&quot;cinnamon simmer pot\\&quot; for getting people in the mood to purchase a mountain cabin! One ounce doesn&#x27;t seem like very much, but when you only need to use a few drops at a time, it does last quite a long time. Get this! You will love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT  This stuff smells heavenly &amp; I hate artificial smells.</li>
            <li> Love love love this. Its all over my house.&lt;br /&gt;The most perfect fragrance for home</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this fragrance for two and a half years.  It&#x27;s Christmas memory-evoking, but it also is reminiscent of the great Northwest with all the fragrant firs.</li>
            <li> I love the Thymes Frasier Fir candle but I prefer to burn the oils in an old fashion oil warmer.  I&#x27;ve purchased this item twice and I am very pleased with it.  This smell is not overpowering, nor it is too piney. ( I hate the pinesol smell)  This is refreshing yet sweet.  I love it during the holiday season (my tree is fake so this helps) but I use it all year around and I receive compliments from everyone.&lt;br /&gt;The only concern is that, while my first order came in a bubble wrapped, well protected package, second order was sort of just placed in a box.  (nothing spilled).  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have posted on this Oil before - nothing I can say more  than I love it - it does the job no matter where &amp; how I use it.</li>
            <li> My housecleaner turned me on to this amazing scent. She puts a dab on the light bulbs and when it heats up the room smells great!&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a bit expensive but I really love it. It&#x27;s a very bright woody scent. I use it daily in my home.</li>
            <li> It fills my house with the scent of real fir trees. I&#x27;m allergic to perfume so I have to choose scents that are natural, and this is the best I&#x27;ve come across. It gives me the feeling of winter&#x27;s holiday, warm and cozy inside by a fire.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Nothing comes close to the fragrance of a freshy cut Christmas tree!!! And this product provides just that.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent.  people are always commenting.  use it year round.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! I can use it in one section of my house and it permeates into the whole apartment.  It is not a extremely strong scent, but a light and pleasant one.  Since purchasing this I have noticed many other of my friends and families homes smelling of the same aroma</li>
            <li> Fav scent during the holidays.</li>
            <li> This needs heat, and if I remember to put it on my lamp&#x27;s light bulbs, it works wonderfully.  I also put it on my bathroom light bulbs.  Again, I have to remember.  The diffuser, on the other hand, is AMAAAAAAAAAZING!  The air freshener is good too.</li>
            <li> I put it in a pink salt oil diffuser and it makes my whole apartment smell like Christmas!</li>
