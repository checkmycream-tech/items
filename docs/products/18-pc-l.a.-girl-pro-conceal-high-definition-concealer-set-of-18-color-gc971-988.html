            <li>I was in a bind and ended up using it as a foundation on one of my clients and it served that purpose very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many concealers- the drugstore to some of the most expensive</li>
            <li>I am a professional Makeup artist and I use these in my kit as foundations.</li>
            <li>Squeeze it out on a palette or the back of your hand for personal use, in order to avoid contaminating the brush and therefore the product, as well as to avoid squeezing out too much product.</li>
            <li>and they there&#x27;s barely any color especially the toast concealer.</li>

            <li> amazing set. i really liked how they looked on face. it covers really well. and i really liked the brush that comes with it. i use this kit as a contour and a highlight too. it arrived on time and in a great condition. i would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love these concealers!!!!! Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> You need to blend with a sponge not a brush</li>
            <li> Best everrr Covers perfectly on my clients I used flash on the makeup that&#x27;s y it&#x27;s so bright feel free to look at my Instagram @babydollbeautii</li>
            <li> Bought this as an addition to my MUA kit, i wanted something that works wonders and this had great reviews!  Has used it multiple times on cilents and i love it! Consistency is creamy, but not to the point where it settles in your fine lines.  A MUST HAVE FOR MUA&#x27;S. Seller sent super fast too! I got it right before an event i had, 3 days tops!</li>
            <li> Great product... nice and sturdy and easy to transport between jobs.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this concealer.. It is the bomb!!!</li>
            <li> Product came faster than expected!! It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It was alright! Didn&#x27;t work too well with my skin</li>
            <li> These concealers are wonderful if you&#x27;re a makeup artist. To the people saying water is coming out when you squeeze them, try shaking them before each use.</li>
            <li> Great concealer! Could also be used as foundation if you thin it out.</li>
            <li> Just like the reviews I&#x27;ve seen on Youtube by beauty bloggers and MUA&#x27;s, these are the truth. They arrived very well packaged. All 18 concealors arrived. Perfect for my kit, and cannnot wait to use them.</li>
            <li> It came on time and product is great for a beginner MUA. They can also be used as foundation, just mix with a little bit of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!  I decided to purchase this set to add to my MUA kit.  They are very cost friendly and go on smooth.  I was in a bind and ended up using it as a foundation on one of my clients and it served that purpose very well.  I am happy with my purchase and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This would be a great deal except for the fact that a good third of the tubes squirted out a ton of water. I can only assume those tunes were old and the concealer had seperated; doubtful I can use them in my kit. Very disappointed I can&#x27;t use so many.</li>
            <li> Loving these concealers!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these concealers. I like the price and all of the varieties of colors.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and product is absolutely fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product in a easy to used tube that has a built in brush so no need for application brushes. I use this for contouring which offers the perfect color ranges for multiple complexion ranges.</li>
            <li> Pros: Excellent and more than I could need!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the set should have more light colors.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;ve found they aren&#x27;t fully filled.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Shipping took too long.</li>
            <li> I Love these products. They all come together in a safe package best product I ever bought, however, there were two of the concealers Chestnut and Toast whenever i squeeze to contour my face, i will get water coming out and they there&#x27;s barely any color especially the toast concealer. But apart from that they are great products and that is why i made another purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a professional Makeup artist and I use these in my kit as foundations. They can be thinned out if necessary with face lotion, but I use them as is with a buffing brush, and a tiny bit goes a very long way. I&#x27;ve used them on brides, for photoshoots, and for performers on stage. They are excellent. They come in a huge range of warm and cool colours, they don&#x27;t look cakey and they last forever. Also great on oily skin! I recommend these to everyone. I haven&#x27;t had on client in two years have a problem with sensitivity to these either. My only advice: Don&#x27;t apply it to your skin with the brush. Squeeze it out on a palette or the back of your hand for personal use, in order to avoid contaminating the brush and therefore the product, as well as to avoid squeezing out too much product. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> These came very fast and are great for my kit i got all 18 individually wrapped and they work great  i couldnt be happier i have no complaints</li>
