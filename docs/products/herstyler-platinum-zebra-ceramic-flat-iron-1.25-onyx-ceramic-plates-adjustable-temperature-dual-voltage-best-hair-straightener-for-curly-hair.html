            <li>other than that this item is awesome.</li>
            <li>So cheap and worth it !!</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>Got this a year ago still works good, didn&#x27;t have to pay high price mall</li>
            <li>I liked it at first.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron and it was at a great price for this product.</li>
            <li>i have think but fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li>Very pretty , great  packaging , i love it overall .</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t care and simply want a great styler that will work go for it.</li>
            <li>Thank god it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I got it in three days on really cheap too</li>
            <li>This is  the second one I have owned and It works great.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to women in all races, it smooth&#x27;s out</li>
            <li>I keep the cord away from the carpet and on a flat surface, its a great buy, it has a warranty</li>
            <li>Great flat iron.</li>
            <li>I used this today (daughters) and I will be placing a new iron at the top of her Christmas list!</li>
            <li>heats up real quick though, but i have no clue how hot</li>
            <li>She was really excited.  </li>
            <li>My girl loved this and now the other girls are fighting over it and now I have to buy two more.</li>
            <li>Well the little woman seems pleased with it and her hair looks good.</li>
            <li>It heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, and made of quality materials.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly, and it straightens and curls well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a lot of flat irons and this one is by far the best and it shipped fast</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener, because i love my previous Herstyler, but it doesn&#x27;t get warm and doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron and it heats up very quickly</li>
            <li>First of all, this flat iron is the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair, and use my iron to smooth and remove any bumps caused by ponytails or sleeping.</li>
            <li>Its fun color and style.</li>
            <li>to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li>For the price I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up very quickly and to high temperature.</li>
            <li>The setup: I had originally purchased an inexpensive (but very &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>flat iron at Target for around $20 when my daughter first started to style her own hair.  </li>
            <li>Although I was skeptical when I first got it as there is no temperature gauge of any kind, just an on off switch, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product for less$ , than the ones at the mall!&lt;br /&gt;dont get your self caught in the ridiculness high price of those in the mall.</li>
            <li>The shipping was VERY fast.</li>
            <li>They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, you won&#x27;t regret buying this product!</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this straightener!</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s up in second s from plunging it in I would recommend this to anyone buy buy buy :)</li>
            <li>you are married to the product because of the design, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>no matter if it&#x27;s too hot or not.....</li>
            <li>&amp; Still works since the first day.</li>
            <li>This product does get extremely hot.</li>
            <li>Heats really fast and does a great job, my hair is not thick and curly, just more thin and wavy.</li>
            <li>And no indicator letting you know when it is hot.</li>
            <li>i would most definitely reccomend this to someone.</li>
            <li>Good buy, for my 13 year old, with very long hair</li>
            <li>The quality of the flat iron was exactly what I paid for: cheap!  </li>
            <li>but sometimes it has a burning smell which most flat irons have anyway</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Cheap too for a herstyler this same one goes for $250 on the website.</li>
            <li>STRAIGHT MY HAIR</li>
            <li>For a HerStyler I expected a bit better quality.</li>
            <li>One swipe per section and straight.</li>
            <li>This joint heats up sooooo fast too .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am very disappointted in this product.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin/</li>
            <li>But other than that I love the design on it</li>
            <li>The other one was dropped to many times and broke.</li>
            <li>Like literally within 2 minutes its ready &amp; the high heat straightens her curly hair really fast.</li>
            <li>and i have run it over my hair several times for a full straight effect.</li>
            <li>But doesn heat up to as high as id want .</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend as it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have also used it a few times and love it myself.</li>
            <li>I am not hard on this straightener.</li>
            <li>and it was new thank</li>
            <li>The emblem &amp;#34;HS&amp;#34; melted off after the first use, which is not at all what my actual Herstlyer even comes close too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s just that it only worked as well as the cheap Target flat iron she already owned.  </li>
            <li>So for my daughter&#x27;s 12th birthday I decided to buy a more expensive flat iron, that would still have the cute</li>
            <li>Unlike other straighteners it leaves my hair really soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li>The solid color ones are not painted and hold up much</li>
            <li>This was a purchase for my 20-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>I am trying to go natural</li>
            <li>For the price, and based off of the other reviews, I expected a much better product.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron gets my hair really straight</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing the same Chi flat iron that I had gotten for my older daughter at Christmas, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my last one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my second tome buying them because my first ones fell in the toilet</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new flat iron and based on the reviews I bought it.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s not like my other flat iron that has a temp gauge on it to be able to adjust the temp when you want to turn it down but other than that it does do the job and straightens much better than my other flat iron.</li>
            <li>but I just wished they would&#x27;ve put a temp gauge on it so that if it gets too hot you can turn it down.</li>
            <li>Totally would recommend getting for a teen or adult.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and with this flat iron and the hair serum, it only takes one pass with to fully straighten my hair.</li>

            <li> I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li> Got this a year ago still works good, didn&#x27;t have to pay high price mall</li>
            <li> I liked it at first.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron and it was at a great price for this product.</li>
            <li> i have think but fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>

            <li> you don&#x27;t care and simply want a great styler that will work go for it.</li>
            <li> Thank god it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I got it in three days on really cheap too</li>
            <li> This is  the second one I have owned and It works great.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to women in all races, it smooth&#x27;s out</li>
            <li> I keep the cord away from the carpet and on a flat surface, its a great buy, it has a warranty</li>
            <li> Great flat iron.</li>
            <li> I used this today (daughters) and I will be placing a new iron at the top of her Christmas list!</li>
            <li> heats up real quick though, but i have no clue how hot</li>
            <li> She was really excited.  </li>
            <li> My girl loved this and now the other girls are fighting over it and now I have to buy two more.</li>
            <li> Well the little woman seems pleased with it and her hair looks good.</li>
            <li> It heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, and made of quality materials.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly, and it straightens and curls well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of flat irons and this one is by far the best and it shipped fast</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener, because i love my previous Herstyler, but it doesn&#x27;t get warm and doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron and it heats up very quickly</li>
            <li> First of all, this flat iron is the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, and use my iron to smooth and remove any bumps caused by ponytails or sleeping.</li>
            <li> Its fun color and style.</li>
            <li> to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li> For the price I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up very quickly and to high temperature.</li>
            <li> The setup: I had originally purchased an inexpensive (but very &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> flat iron at Target for around $20 when my daughter first started to style her own hair.  </li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical when I first got it as there is no temperature gauge of any kind, just an on off switch, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product for less$ , than the ones at the mall!&lt;br /&gt;dont get your self caught in the ridiculness high price of those in the mall.</li>
            <li> The shipping was VERY fast.</li>
            <li> They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, you won&#x27;t regret buying this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this straightener!</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s up in second s from plunging it in I would recommend this to anyone buy buy buy :)</li>
            <li> you are married to the product because of the design, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> no matter if it&#x27;s too hot or not.....</li>
            <li> &amp; Still works since the first day.</li>
            <li> This product does get extremely hot.</li>
            <li> Heats really fast and does a great job, my hair is not thick and curly, just more thin and wavy.</li>
            <li> And no indicator letting you know when it is hot.</li>
            <li> i would most definitely reccomend this to someone.</li>
            <li> Good buy, for my 13 year old, with very long hair</li>
            <li> The quality of the flat iron was exactly what I paid for: cheap!  </li>
            <li> but sometimes it has a burning smell which most flat irons have anyway</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Cheap too for a herstyler this same one goes for $250 on the website.</li>
            <li> STRAIGHT MY HAIR</li>
            <li> For a HerStyler I expected a bit better quality.</li>
            <li> One swipe per section and straight.</li>
            <li> This joint heats up sooooo fast too .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointted in this product.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin/</li>
            <li> But other than that I love the design on it</li>
            <li> The other one was dropped to many times and broke.</li>
            <li> Like literally within 2 minutes its ready &amp; the high heat straightens her curly hair really fast.</li>
            <li> and i have run it over my hair several times for a full straight effect.</li>
            <li> But doesn heat up to as high as id want .</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend as it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have also used it a few times and love it myself.</li>
            <li> I am not hard on this straightener.</li>
            <li> and it was new thank</li>
            <li> The emblem &amp;#34;HS&amp;#34; melted off after the first use, which is not at all what my actual Herstlyer even comes close too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s just that it only worked as well as the cheap Target flat iron she already owned.  </li>
            <li> So for my daughter&#x27;s 12th birthday I decided to buy a more expensive flat iron, that would still have the cute</li>
            <li> Unlike other straighteners it leaves my hair really soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li> The solid color ones are not painted and hold up much</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my 20-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li> I am trying to go natural</li>
            <li> For the price, and based off of the other reviews, I expected a much better product.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron gets my hair really straight</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing the same Chi flat iron that I had gotten for my older daughter at Christmas, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my last one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my second tome buying them because my first ones fell in the toilet</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new flat iron and based on the reviews I bought it.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s not like my other flat iron that has a temp gauge on it to be able to adjust the temp when you want to turn it down but other than that it does do the job and straightens much better than my other flat iron.</li>
            <li> but I just wished they would&#x27;ve put a temp gauge on it so that if it gets too hot you can turn it down.</li>
            <li> Totally would recommend getting for a teen or adult.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and with this flat iron and the hair serum, it only takes one pass with to fully straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> (African American) and use the flat irons to straighten my roots.</li>
            <li> The flat iron had been previously used after the posting had said it was brand new.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is automatically set at 460 degrees of heat so that you can get done quicker with straightening.</li>
            <li> Gets hotter than any flat iron I have used including the chi.  </li>
            <li> I have owned it for 6 moths and there are several places where the zebra finish has worn completely down to the bare white plastic under the paint.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is NOT a Herstyler!</li>
            <li> My eleven year old wanted a flat iron for Christmas, and she is obsessed with zebra right now.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for all ago use a flat iron!!</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair and makes her hair completely straight.</li>
            <li> Not really getting the results that I was hoping for</li>
            <li> (I have a lot of thick hair that is naturally wavy/straight).</li>
            <li> so now my other friends want me to order them one as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> I bought my other daughter one as well.</li>
            <li> Average.</li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> all my frizzes, even on ethnic black hair</li>
            <li> But it can straighten the mess out of some hair.</li>
            <li> wish it got a little hotter.</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money .</li>
            <li> I bought two for way less than the price of one at a mall kiosk!</li>
            <li> after first use the sides turned yellow and it snags hair very badly ...</li>
            <li> Usually straightening her hair takes hours.</li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> It is located at the base of the ceramic plate that is hot.</li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was that the on/off button is in an awkward spot.</li>
            <li> Was not told that this was a cheap and horrible replica</li>
            <li> I do like it since I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> However, when it came time to use it, the results were not great.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the actual product!</li>
            <li> have very thick hair and this straightener does the job I need it too!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This item was, what I believe, to be a fake.  </li>
            <li> Buy it you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> so i can set the temp. :(</li>
            <li> This company is CRAP!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The flat iron gets my hair really straight but sometimes it has a burning smell which most flat irons have anyway, just use spray or oil that smells good.</li>
            <li> Straightens hair great. Heats up fast. Cute design, I love it a lot. Fast shipping, you won&#x27;t regret buying this product! :) Cheap too for a herstyler this same one goes for $250 on the website.</li>
            <li> These flat iron is the best it&#x27;s my second tome buying them because my first ones fell in the toilet</li>
            <li> Love love love. .....oh did I forget to say I LOVE THESE! !!!! GREAT BUY</li>
            <li> great product for less$ , than the ones at the mall!&lt;br /&gt;dont get your self caught in the ridiculness high price of those in the mall.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, WORTH EACH DOLLAR, I HAVE CURLY HAIR AND THE IRON STRAIGHT MY HAIR SO PERFECTLY. GOOD PRODUCT TO BUY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;m in love with this flat iron, it make my hair so beautiful..it&#x27;s the best flat iron I ever had</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this straightener! It was her second Herstyler and she says they are the best straighteners she&#x27;s ever owned.</li>
            <li> Great fit. Great shipping</li>
            <li> Printed herstylers never work like the solid colored ones</li>
            <li> 2 yrs later and it works superb I love this flat iron and it heats up very quickly</li>
            <li> Cute straightener. Its fun color and style. it works well. wish it got a little hotter. i have think but fine hair and i have run it over my hair several times for a full straight effect.</li>
            <li> Love the design and works really good what&#x27;s up in second s from plunging it in I would recommend this to anyone buy buy buy :)</li>
            <li> First of all, this flat iron is the best flat iron I have ever owned. I have naturally curly hair and with this flat iron and the hair serum, it only takes one pass with to fully straighten my hair. Unlike other straighteners it leaves my hair really soft and super shiny. 5 stars for effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is with the finish. I bought this because I love the zebra print. I have owned it for 6 moths and there are several places where the zebra finish has worn completely down to the bare white plastic under the paint. For a HerStyler I expected a bit better quality. Not only that but the HerStyler branding was painted on the joint and that has all worn off as well. I am not hard on this straightener. In fact I keep it in the packaging that it comes with to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are married to the product because of the design, don&#x27;t. The solid color ones are not painted and hold up much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care and simply want a great styler that will work go for it. I do not regret this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my fiancé.... Usually straightening her hair takes hours. One swipe per section and straight. She has the most thickest curly hair EVER!</li>
            <li> I havent received mine yet but I used my niece&#x27;s and it is just fabulous! Had to get one for myself!</li>
            <li> I liked it at first. It heat up quickly. It&#x27;s pretty light. Straightens my hair so it does what it was meant to. BUT, there&#x27;s already a chip in the iron. I&#x27;ve thrown around my conair for YEARS and it has scratches but not CHIPS. Thank god it was so cheap. I would not recommend this since it doesn&#x27;t seem durable what so ever.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new flat iron and based on the reviews I bought it. The shipping was VERY fast. This has to be the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had, HONESTLY! Buy it you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron and it was at a great price for this product. But there is one thing I don&#x27;t like about it that it&#x27;s not like my other flat iron that has a temp gauge on it to be able to adjust the temp when you want to turn it down but other than that it does do the job and straightens much better than my other flat iron. So I can&#x27;t complain about that part but I just wished they would&#x27;ve put a temp gauge on it so that if it gets too hot you can turn it down. This flat iron is automatically set at 460 degrees of heat so that you can get done quicker with straightening. But other than that I love the design on it and it&#x27;s very different. So I gave this product four stars instead of five because of the temp gauge problem that was a no no always have a temp knob on it so that people can adjust their temps to their likings no matter if it&#x27;s too hot or not.....</li>
            <li> I have this zebra straightener for over two years. &amp; Still works since the first day.</li>
            <li> This product does get extremely hot. I do like it since I have very thick hair. The only thing I dislike is that it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control. But it can straighten the mess out of some hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas 2013 and she loves it! The design is great with the stylish zebra print and the function is excellent.  Heats up quickly, and made of quality materials.  Very easy to use, my 11 year old straightened her own hair and loves it! My wife has owned three beauty salons and she says this is a great product.  Definitely recommend as it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My eleven year old wanted a flat iron for Christmas, and she is obsessed with zebra right now. This was the perfect choice for her. It heats quickly, and it straightens and curls well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was that the on/off button is in an awkward spot. It is located at the base of the ceramic plate that is hot. It could pose a burning hazard so we unplug it and then flip the switch to off.</li>
            <li> The flat iron had been previously used after the posting had said it was brand new. I&#x27;m disappointed. Not trustworthy.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and uses it maybe 2-3 times per month.  Heats up good and good quality.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter is very happy with this Christmas gift. She would like to know if u have matching sleep footed pajamas to match.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my 20-year old daughter.  She used a friend&#x27;s Herstyler straightener and wanted one of her own.  She loves it.  She likes zebra patterns so she loves how it looks.  More important, she loves how it works.</li>
            <li> Great nice and hot hair straightener! Heats really fast and does a great job, my hair is not thick and curly, just more thin and wavy. Nice and smooth on my hair, doesn&#x27;t snag or pull or burn my hair at all! Only com is it has no auto shut off and a couple times forgot and left it on.</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> Girls are so into zebra print now so it works great for gifts. Got my friend one for her birthday and she fell in love with it so now my other friends want me to order them one as we&#x27;ll. she says it works great. She has long thick hair and makes her hair completely straight. Totally would recommend getting for a teen or adult.</li>
            <li> I had bought one before and it works great and it was new thank you so much I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas who loved it! Loves the way it works and how it looks. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This thing is a joke... It did not heat up, there is not temperature control. And no indicator letting you know when it is hot. I have straight hair, and use my iron to smooth and remove any bumps caused by ponytails or sleeping. This iron couldn&#x27;t even handle that...</li>
            <li> Well the little woman seems pleased with it and her hair looks good. If she&#x27;s happy,we&#x27;re all happy. Lol...... .</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and I&#x27;m in love amazing. I&#x27;ve bought a lot of flat irons and this one is by far the best and it shipped fast I got it in three days on really cheap too</li>
            <li> This is  the second one I have owned and It works great.  The other one was dropped to many times and broke. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It made a great gift!! My girl loved this and now the other girls are fighting over it and now I have to buy two more.</li>
            <li> So cheap and worth it !! Got this for my friends 20th bday &amp; used it on her hair. This joint heats up sooooo fast too . Like literally within 2 minutes its ready &amp; the high heat straightens her curly hair really fast. Not to mention the zebra print is nice ! I do reccommend .</li>
            <li> awesome straightener for the price. I had one similar to this that cost 3 times the amount!!! Good buy, for my 13 year old, with very long hair</li>
            <li> This thing sells for much more in stores and at the mall kiosks. Although I was skeptical when I first got it as there is no temperature gauge of any kind, just an on off switch, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very quickly and to high temperature. Performs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and she loves it. I have also used it a few times and love it myself. We both had a herstyler brand straightener but not the platinum and her&#x27;s was worn out from years of use. For the price, you cannot beat this straightener. My sister who has a Chi likes my Herstyler better. Although these are sold by vendors in the mall the price on Amazon is hundreds cheaper. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Was not told that this was a cheap and horrible replica 😞 after first use the sides turned yellow and it snags hair very badly ...this was a waste of money .</li>
            <li> Wonderful. I bought this many months ago and it still works fabulously :)</li>
            <li> Got this a year ago still works good, didn&#x27;t have to pay high price mall was selling them for! Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Gets hotter than any flat iron I have used including the chi.  Heats up in seconds. I saw the same one at the mall for $300 and paid around 30 for this one. I bought my other daughter one as well.</li>
            <li> The Herstyler lived up to my expectations. This product is a must have for all ago use a flat iron!!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener, because i love my previous Herstyler, but it doesn&#x27;t get warm and doesn&#x27;t do the job. I am very disappointted in this product.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Very pretty , great  packaging , i love it overall . But doesn heat up to as high as id want . But still works n i love it!</li>
            <li> its awesome but i wish there was a dial so i can set the temp. :( heats up real quick though, but i have no clue how hot</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and great price for this hair straightener.  Works great!</li>
            <li> just as expected great item!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed. I have a Chi and I don&#x27;t see much difference. I am trying to go natural (African American) and use the flat irons to straighten my roots. For the price I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my oldest grand daughter for Christmas.  Was very impressed with the quality and design of this Flat iron.  And she LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this straightener retails on herstyler.com for $250!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and this straightener does the job I need it too! It was an absolutely perfect purchase!&lt;br /&gt;A $250 straightener for $25... what could be better?!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to women in all races, it smooth&#x27;s out all my frizzes, even on ethnic black hair it is protective and resourceful, I love this product. I keep the cord away from the carpet and on a flat surface, its a great buy, it has a warranty and I am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This item was, what I believe, to be a fake.  and it was NOT 1.5 inches, it was 1 inch.  I measured it.  I promptly returned it to Amazon, whose customer service was great and efficient.  Happy with Amazon, not with the Product.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener and the price is fantastic.  All my friends want to buy one.  good good good</li>
            <li> I bought this for christmas of 2013. Still works great &amp; I still LOVE it. Bought my bestfriend one also. I bought two for way less than the price of one at a mall kiosk!</li>
            <li> cheap...accidentally dropped it..possibly 2 feet from floor and both plates came off...on BOTH that I purchased. Tried to replace it, but CS would not replace it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is NOT a Herstyler! The emblem &amp;#34;HS&amp;#34; melted off after the first use, which is not at all what my actual Herstlyer even comes close too. It didn&#x27;t work on my hair (I have a lot of thick hair that is naturally wavy/straight). Very disappointed with the actual product!</li>
            <li> Straightens very fast, works absolutely great, it is the best straightener I have ever boughten from all the others I have.</li>
            <li> Not really getting the results that I was hoping for but I guess quality comes with the price. It does its job okay.</li>
            <li> I had another HerStyler before, but the plates cracked because I dropped it so I ordered another one. I love the way it looks and everything. Great flat iron. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my last one.</li>
            <li> I love it! work great &amp; warm up quick!</li>
            <li> Average. Must make several passes to get the same effect as my Paul Mitchell. Mine broke so I used this today (daughters) and I will be placing a new iron at the top of her Christmas list!</li>
            <li> The setup: I had originally purchased an inexpensive (but very &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;) flat iron at Target for around $20 when my daughter first started to style her own hair.  The quality of the flat iron was exactly what I paid for: cheap!  So for my daughter&#x27;s 12th birthday I decided to buy a more expensive flat iron, that would still have the cute factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality/Results: She absolutely loved the look of this product.  She got the anticipated &amp;#34;ooh&#x27;s&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ahhh&#x27;s&amp;#34; from her friends when she opened it.  She was really excited.  However, when it came time to use it, the results were not great.  It&#x27;s not that it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s just that it only worked as well as the cheap Target flat iron she already owned.  It takes several sweeps to truly &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; the hair.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin/fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: For the price, and based off of the other reviews, I expected a much better product.  I ended up purchasing the same Chi flat iron that I had gotten for my older daughter at Christmas, and she absolutely loves it. (but at twice the cost)</li>
            <li> would&#x27;ve been 5 stars, but it didn&#x27;t havee temp. control. other than that this item is awesome. i would most definitely reccomend this to someone.</li>
