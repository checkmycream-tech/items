    <ol>
            <li>The reviews were impressive.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a happy consumer with this product!</li>
            <li>I had heard this was the best product for removal of fungus -  </li>
            <li>The price was great!  </li>
            <li>very good product i have been useing it</li>

            <li>Good luck to all of you sufferers of toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E Oil - Good for lots of things.</li>
            <li>The product is not that good anyway</li>
            <li>I purchased this years ago but it works good.  </li>
            <li>Took a couple weeks but amazing results.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the Good Lord steered me correctly.</li>
            <li>Clove Oil - smells nice.</li>
            <li>Lemongrass Oil - Smells nice on Thai food.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Super Remedy for Nail Fungus Problems!!</li>
            <li>I saved about 50 dollars from this unreliable source but the liability was much greater.</li>
            <li>That product, I found out from my M.D. is not at all safe to consume.</li>
            <li>Read more by searching Lee dot org for \\&quot;Zetaclear\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>Had discoloration for many years.</li>
            <li>Zeta took the discoloration away and make my nails look healthy.  </li>
            <li>Guess I need to get better glasses</li>
            <li>I love Amazon because reviews are not tampered with by companies.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Lamisil - awesome on itchy foot but does nothing for nail fungus ( it actually is not meant to be used on the nail fungus part at all but just on the skin with the itchy part)&lt;br /&gt;ciclopirox</li>
            <li>but my baby toe is still infected ( now 12 years) and is not getting better...</li>
            <li>happily so far so good!  </li>
            <li>Very effective,toenails looking much better!</li>
            <li>My doubts were confirmed after about 2 months of use.  </li>
            <li>so i cant give a detailed review</li>
            <li>but so far its good.</li>
            <li>careful because then you can get infections easily!!!</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my infection to the extent where the re-growth is clean nail.</li>
            <li>I found out the hard way, but the results are excellent!</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s a pretty good natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.</li>
            <li>Honestly this will clear your nails and you&#x27;ll be astonished.  </li>
            <li>Undecylenic Acid - a good topical antifungal.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li>Hi, so it is true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, what they say is true: it ain&#x27;t going to happen right away, but it works, but I had to buy a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and i am hoping to have it clear and healthy by summer.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>worth the $.</li>
            <li>Almond Oil - nice oil for back rubs...    </li>
            <li>Although more expenise at the Zeta Clear site, I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Takes 3 months to get better, and 6 months to be completely gone.</li>
            <li>That is right there suspicious.</li>
            <li>By December, the nail was mostly a normal color and had grown out significantly.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon for carrying it!  </li>
            <li>On the first day of using this fungus treatment - I noticed a difference,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for over 20 years &amp; this is the ONLY one that REALLY works !  </li>
            <li>This product takes awhile to start seeing results,but it really works!</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering it at a lower price that the Zeta website!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Will need to purchase more shortly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this product to be that effective like other reviews suggested.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work ok, i havent used it very long</li>
            <li>It certainly did not kill the fungus, as after that six week point, it stopped improving.  </li>
            <li>I really hope my review helps you decide.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very affective because it helps prevent the regrouth of the fungus.</li>
            <li>it all depends how much you have</li>
            <li>Not so much.    </li>
            <li>Not so much help with fungus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really leary of statements about things that supposedly perform &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; so I was cautiously optimistic when I read the reviews and ordered Zetaclear.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>I can really see improvements.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery was appreciated</li>
            <li>I tried this product after reading about it online, and it really does work.</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles at 30 bucks a pop and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Very unethical when on their website they use the phrase \\&quot;satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>had any real impact on my nail fungus.</li>
            <li>Because I dance and love wearing open toe shoes, I was adamant in taking care of this problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT a fungus but cellular damage and the product is not appropriate for that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>enough, after about 2 1/2 months, I see my nail is getting nice, pink, &amp; clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a couple of months of steady use the oil took care of my nails.  </li>
            <li>I ordered ZetaClear because of the positive reviews that I read about it to clear up toe nail fungus.</li>
            <li>had high hope&#x27;s  for this product, but not for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>But Zeta Clear applied for a few months did work and was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I think it will be cured completely after I used the whole bottle...</li>
            <li>clear - helps with the itchy part of your skin on your toes, does absolutely nothing for your nail fungus.</li>
            <li>I have 2 toenails that I have been working on to look normal again.</li>
            <li>Product worked as described, and appears to be a real miracle following even the first application.</li>
            <li>Within 3 months, I began to see a normal nail appearing from the cuticle up, about 1/8 of an inch.</li>
            <li>Zeta lasts  a long time and my nails all look healthy and white.</li>
            <li>You do have to use it frequently as many times a day as possible and try to keep your hand dry.</li>
            <li>My toenails are completely clear now thanks to Zeta Clear.</li>
            <li>I was doing everything required (using both oral and external application multiple times per day), but all that it did was to make things only look slightly better.  </li>
            <li>Previously I had tried every product for nail fungus that was available in the drug store and even prescription pills.  </li>
            <li>and you only find positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Zeta Clear does weirdly dominate the internet and fakes their own positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Used 12 bottles (15 ml, 0.5 Oz) of Zeta Clear clear nail solution over a period of 1 year.</li>
            <li>Clear toenails did not regrow.</li>
            <li>I did not want to take the drugs, so I was doing some research online when I stumbled across Zeta Clear.</li>
            <li>This is the beginning of April, and I am still using the Zeta Clear.</li>
            <li>I have only bought 3-4 bottles all together and it was very affordable and completely natural.</li>
            <li>To start with, just look at the ingredients in ZetaClear Clear Nails Solution  as mentioned on their website (in order of prevelance).    </li>
            <li>I have rave reviews for Zeta Clear.  </li>
            <li>Zeta Clear works.</li>
            <li>My nail is clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles of this stuff (and one bottle of the /Zeta Clear oral spray) using it every morning</li>
            <li>and while it seems to have had something of an impact, it doesn&#x27;t clear the fungus as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Zeta Clear works for me.</li>
            <li>Whatever I have is helped trememdously by Zeta Clear.</li>
            <li>Use Lamisil or Zeta clear for controlling itchy parts of foot, but not fungus on nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clear</li>
            <li>However, the ZetaClear, applied three times a day, has nearly cleared up the infection</li>
            <li>It takes about 4 mos for it to be gone completely.  </li>
            <li>so far, not so...  </li>
            <li>So far I have spend quite a lot of money on a product that, from the effect it has had on my toenail fungus, could have come from Walmart.</li>
            <li>bean oil undecenoic acid - works when used on nail fungus but takes like 1 year to completely kill off fungus&lt;</li>
            <li>I cured my big toe and second toe with the above remedy and have been fungus free since...</li>
            <li>and it slowly does help it get better.</li>
            <li>to take care of how thick &amp; nasty that nail has gotten(just kidding, but I did have to take some fine sandpaper to it to make it thin enough to get my Revlon Sure Grip Nail Clip over it(they don&#x27;t make those any more, but they&#x27;re the BEST)</li>
            <li>No more since using the ZetaClear and my toes are starting to look a lot more normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant in purchasing the product because it was just too much money for me to throw down the drain.</li>
            <li>and my nail has almost grown back completely normal.  </li>
            <li>However, the product doesn&#x27;t work the same as the others I&#x27;ve purchased from the Zeta Clear Site.</li>
            <li>Zeta Clear appears to be the only \\&quot;across the counter\\&quot; product that works for my toenail issues.  </li>
            <li>I cured my nail fungus by clipping the nails back as far as they could go and using a q-tip to put Clorox bleach on my toenails about 3 times a day for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>If, in the near future the product does do what it is advertised to do, I will amend this review.</li>
            <li>I tired many over the counter stuff and nothing works.  </li>
            <li>This is a matter of staying with it over the long haul of growing a new nail.  </li>
            <li>I guess the fungus just became too annoying for me, but I&#x27;m glad I did because I&#x27;m free now of toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>It has made the yellow discoloration go down a little each day and the area of inflammation is slowly retreating - overall a great product.</li>
            <li>yup, expose the nail bed if you really want to kill the fungus), wear loose airy leather shoes or open toe shoes, and prepare for a long battle ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used ZetaClear before and loved it, but I decided to purchase from this vendor because it was less expensive.</li>

            <li> I have rave reviews for Zeta Clear.  </li>
            <li> Zeta Clear works.</li>
            <li> My nail is clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles of this stuff (and one bottle of the /Zeta Clear oral spray) using it every morning</li>
            <li> and while it seems to have had something of an impact, it doesn&#x27;t clear the fungus as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Zeta Clear works for me.</li>
            <li> Whatever I have is helped trememdously by Zeta Clear.</li>
            <li> Use Lamisil or Zeta clear for controlling itchy parts of foot, but not fungus on nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clear</li>
            <li> However, the ZetaClear, applied three times a day, has nearly cleared up the infection</li>
            <li> It takes about 4 mos for it to be gone completely.  </li>
            <li> so far, not so...  </li>
            <li> So far I have spend quite a lot of money on a product that, from the effect it has had on my toenail fungus, could have come from Walmart.</li>
            <li> bean oil undecenoic acid - works when used on nail fungus but takes like 1 year to completely kill off fungus&lt;</li>
            <li> I cured my big toe and second toe with the above remedy and have been fungus free since...</li>
            <li> and it slowly does help it get better.</li>
            <li> to take care of how thick &amp; nasty that nail has gotten(just kidding, but I did have to take some fine sandpaper to it to make it thin enough to get my Revlon Sure Grip Nail Clip over it(they don&#x27;t make those any more, but they&#x27;re the BEST)</li>
            <li> No more since using the ZetaClear and my toes are starting to look a lot more normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant in purchasing the product because it was just too much money for me to throw down the drain.</li>
            <li> and my nail has almost grown back completely normal.  </li>
            <li> However, the product doesn&#x27;t work the same as the others I&#x27;ve purchased from the Zeta Clear Site.</li>
            <li> Zeta Clear appears to be the only \\&quot;across the counter\\&quot; product that works for my toenail issues.  </li>
            <li> I cured my nail fungus by clipping the nails back as far as they could go and using a q-tip to put Clorox bleach on my toenails about 3 times a day for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> If, in the near future the product does do what it is advertised to do, I will amend this review.</li>
            <li> I tired many over the counter stuff and nothing works.  </li>
            <li> This is a matter of staying with it over the long haul of growing a new nail.  </li>
            <li> I guess the fungus just became too annoying for me, but I&#x27;m glad I did because I&#x27;m free now of toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> It has made the yellow discoloration go down a little each day and the area of inflammation is slowly retreating - overall a great product.</li>
            <li> yup, expose the nail bed if you really want to kill the fungus), wear loose airy leather shoes or open toe shoes, and prepare for a long battle ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used ZetaClear before and loved it, but I decided to purchase from this vendor because it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> You must file down the nail (like right down so the nail bed is almost exposed and almost bleeding...</li>
            <li> I just read some other peoples reviews that state that zeta clear does not take returns unless the bottle is unopened and there is a 10 dollar restocking fee per bottle.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that really does anything.  </li>
            <li> Yes, its harsh but it got rid of the fungus and my toes are normal again.</li>
            <li> have since tried for nail fungus a few different products, and I am in no way affiliated with these companies, at the very bottom I am leaving my on personal experience with a cure that did work - filing down the nail and using a combo of tea tree oil, Gehwol Med foot spray, and castor oil acid - aka undecenoic acid.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely clear up the fungus on my toenail, but did shrink it a lot so that there&#x27;s only a small amount left.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews on the internet about Zetaclear and you will see many people are unhappy with its results and side effects.</li>
            <li> You have to be diligent with the application &amp; patient  as it takes a long time to work.</li>
            <li> As long as that toe was infected I would continue to get the itching and burning of athlete&#x27;s foot.  </li>
            <li> based on other reviewers : only laser works, or Gehwol, or castor bean oil aka undecenoic acid ...</li>
            <li> Had very minor improvement.</li>
            <li> but only if you keep filing your nail down to the nail bed...</li>
            <li> but it does take at least 6 months to complete.</li>
            <li> Used this for a few months and my toe nail looks back to normal....unbelievable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grapefruit seed extract - minimally helped control itch, did nothing for nails&lt;</li>
            <li> on my review and my use: only product containing undecenoic acid and gehwol med foot spray, and filing the nail down obsessively to bottom of nail bed ( like 2 times a week!!)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the reviews and &amp;#34;Google&amp;#34; recommendation(s).  </li>
            <li> toes of my feet, big finger and small finger...</li>
            <li> the doctor didn&#x27;t want to give me oral medication due to the side effects.  </li>
            <li> I also read other reviews that say laser works.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Using bleach OR hydrogen peroxide on nail - use one or the other</li>
            <li> The product did help to make my worst nail look a little better, but it was obvious after about 6 weeks that it wasn&#x27;t going to totally eliminate the problem.  </li>
            <li> And can be found in other products for much less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got one big toe that has had a fungus for at least 10 years</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t buy the product from an unreliable source because I&#x27;ve discovered too that some retailers sell a water down version of this product which is not at all efficient.</li>
            <li> Get a Vogue rechargeable nail filer so you can text with one hand while filing with the other ( just kidding about the texting!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about seven months and have seen a slight improvement in my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Not one slight or teeny difference.</li>
            <li> For example: FungiCure, Fungi-Nail, Tinecide (I had previously said in this review this was \\&quot;a fancy word for vinegar\\&quot; but was mistaken)</li>
            <li> Not better, not worse and NOT impressed.  </li>
            <li> I still have a little breakage, but I got Giro nail scissors which help also.</li>
            <li> and I have no more athlete&#x27;s foot infections due to the fungus.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks now and have not seen any difference on my nails.</li>
            <li> I do not know what the time frame is for the product to work, but so far, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this a few days.</li>
            <li> Buy a lifetime supply for a few bucks at a health food store.</li>
            <li> I did notice a change in color of my nail within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t bought this, but I did buy Uncle Harry&#x27;s Toenail &amp; Fungal Relief, which is not available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It works well, just a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the oral spray...</li>
            <li> By June of 2010, the nail had become much worse and the entire nail was thick and discolored.</li>
            <li> However, after trying numerous fungus treatments and given up on wearing open toe shoes :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the treatments are nonstop; otherwise, the fungus will come back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Zetaclear sells it without the spray</li>
            <li> This product does not work and the company unethically deletes negative reviews off the internet.</li>
            <li> I still have the nail fungus and thick toenails.</li>
            <li> I have another nail that was damaged in a motorcycle accident and that nail is thick but not with fungus...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is helping!</li>
            <li> no matter what I do so far :(</li>
            <li> i only had like two bad nails</li>
            <li> My experience with all of the treatments I had used in the past were not successful and I was not about to spend 75.00!</li>
            <li> The fungus came back! :(</li>
            <li> dumb</li>
            <li> I had tried topical treatments before but knew that the oral medications for fungus were very expensive and dangerous because they can cause liver failure.</li>
            <li> but my hopes have decreased.  </li>
            <li> Also, the oral prescribed crazy antibiotic dosage works based on other people&#x27;s reviews but careful, this is also a very dangerous remedy...</li>
            <li> but desperate times lead to dumb and desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - some nurses swear by this dangerous remedy of EITHER bleach or EITHER hydrogen peroxide 10% ( put it with q-tip on their nail</li>
            <li> but be carefull - dangerous, toxic, and can damage integrity of your skin temporarily ...</li>
            <li> Plus, the mouth spray that comes with is upset my stomach badly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I paid 25.99 for this crap.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this faithfully since February and to no avail! I have 2 toenails that I have been working on to look normal again. Will try another product. It seems to have worked for some people, but not everyone-darn!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nail fungus for over 6 years after some woman stepped on me when Salsa dancing. Because I dance and love wearing open toe shoes, I was adamant in taking care of this problem. However, after trying numerous fungus treatments and given up on wearing open toe shoes :( I bumped into Zetaclear&#x27;s Site. I was very hesitant in purchasing the product because it was just too much money for me to throw down the drain. My experience with all of the treatments I had used in the past were not successful and I was not about to spend 75.00! on another unsuccessful attempt. For some reason though, I bought it anyway. I guess the fungus just became too annoying for me, but I&#x27;m glad I did because I&#x27;m free now of toenail fungus. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the treatments are nonstop; otherwise, the fungus will come back. I found out the hard way, but the results are excellent! Also, don&#x27;t buy the product from an unreliable source because I&#x27;ve discovered too that some retailers sell a water down version of this product which is not at all efficient. I saved about 50 dollars from this unreliable source but the liability was much greater. The fungus came back! :( I&#x27;m going back to Zetaclear&#x27;s Site again but don&#x27;t get the spray. That product, I found out from my M.D. is not at all safe to consume. I&#x27;m not sure if Zetaclear sells it without the spray but I&#x27;ll try to contact customer service and find out if I can buy it without the spray. Good luck to all of you sufferers of toenail fungus. I really hope my review helps you decide.</li>
            <li> I ordered ZetaClear because of the positive reviews that I read about it to clear up toe nail fungus. I&#x27;ve been using it for about seven months and have seen a slight improvement in my toe nails. Everything I&#x27;ve read says this can take even a year so I&#x27;ll stay with it for awhile longer.</li>
            <li> Product worked as described, and appears to be a real miracle following even the first application. It&#x27;s a Super Remedy for Nail Fungus Problems!!</li>
            <li> Honestly this will clear your nails and you&#x27;ll be astonished.  Used this for a few months and my toe nail looks back to normal....unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Used 12 bottles (15 ml, 0.5 Oz) of Zeta Clear clear nail solution over a period of 1 year. Applied solution to nails as directed 2 or 3 times each day. Had very minor improvement. Solution did make the nails appear clearer but this was the affect of the oil seeping into the nail (same results can be achieved with Teatree oil). As soon as oil disappeared, the toenail returned to its former appearance. I still have the nail fungus and thick toenails. Clear toenails did not regrow. Zeta Clear was a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, had my doubts, but I had to try it.  My doubts were confirmed after about 2 months of use.  The product did help to make my worst nail look a little better, but it was obvious after about 6 weeks that it wasn&#x27;t going to totally eliminate the problem.  I was doing everything required (using both oral and external application multiple times per day), but all that it did was to make things only look slightly better.  It certainly did not kill the fungus, as after that six week point, it stopped improving.  I&#x27;m back to square 1 and out [...] bucks.</li>
            <li> After 30 days I dont see any difference at all. I&#x27;m beginning to think it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is agreat product when used in combination whith the Homeopathic oral spray, and being constant, it take along time but it&#x27;s very affective because it helps prevent the regrouth of the fungus.</li>
            <li> i have had foot nail problems for over 28 years..and have tried everything!  so this was a last ditch effort to once again try and rid myself of the fungus.  happily so far so good!  it has improved the appearance,. and i am hoping to have it clear and healthy by summer.  ZetaClear seems to be doing the job..thanks amazon for carrying it!  [[ASIN:B003KK0ETO Zetaclear Nail Fungus Treatment - Oral Homeopathic Spray and Topical Solution]]</li>
            <li> This product done nothing I had no results and I used this product as directed for a month. I am totally dissatisfied. I should receive a refund because your product does not work.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the reviews and &amp;#34;Google&amp;#34; recommendation(s).  Not one slight or teeny difference. Not better, not worse and NOT impressed.  Save your money. I would NOT recommend this product for purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a nail fungus on my left big toe for 7 years. I had tried topical treatments before but knew that the oral medications for fungus were very expensive and dangerous because they can cause liver failure. This is not a rumour. It&#x27;s a well known fact, that&#x27;s why you have to get a liver profile done before and during treatments. By June of 2010, the nail had become much worse and the entire nail was thick and discolored. I had made an appointment with a podiatrist. I did not want to take the drugs, so I was doing some research online when I stumbled across Zeta Clear. The reviews were impressive. I thought it was worth a shot. I got the brush-on solution and began using it in June of 2010, applying it 2-3 times daily. Within 3 months, I began to see a normal nail appearing from the cuticle up, about 1/8 of an inch. By December, the nail was mostly a normal color and had grown out significantly. I went to get a pedicure and all of the discolored nail was removed. This is the beginning of April, and I am still using the Zeta Clear. I have only bought 3-4 bottles all together and it was very affordable and completely natural. I hope to be wearing sandals this summer.</li>
            <li> On the first day of using this fungus treatment - I noticed a difference,  It has made the yellow discoloration go down a little each day and the area of inflammation is slowly retreating - overall a great product.</li>
            <li> used this for months not weeks....but it seems to have worked.  now the test is to see if it stays away or comes back.  worth the $.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I used it for a month as directed, mouth spray and all, and nothing happened. Plus, the mouth spray that comes with is upset my stomach badly. I cured my nail fungus by clipping the nails back as far as they could go and using a q-tip to put Clorox bleach on my toenails about 3 times a day for about 3 weeks. Yes, its harsh but it got rid of the fungus and my toes are normal again.</li>
            <li> very good product i have been useing it and it is working great i stilll haven&#x27;t finished it and its been months it all depends how much you have i only had like two bad nails so its still working out great</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks now and have not seen any difference on my nails. I do not know what the time frame is for the product to work, but so far, I am not impressed. If, in the near future the product does do what it is advertised to do, I will amend this review.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this a few days. I noticed my nails cleared up a lot. I still have a little breakage, but I got Giro nail scissors which help also. I think this plan has made an improvement.  I&#x27;m glad the Good Lord steered me correctly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use Zetaclear to treat nail fungus. It&#x27;s a scam.    To start with, just look at the ingredients in ZetaClear Clear Nails Solution  as mentioned on their website (in order of prevelance).    Undecylenic Acid - a good topical antifungal. Buy a lifetime supply for a few bucks at a health food store. And can be found in other products for much less. For example: FungiCure, Fungi-Nail, Tinecide (I had previously said in this review this was \\&quot;a fancy word for vinegar\\&quot; but was mistaken) Read more by searching Lee dot org for \\&quot;Zetaclear\\&quot;.    Tea Tree Oil - It&#x27;s a pretty good natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. It might help with your nail fungus but it costs $5 for 8 oz, not $30 for 0.5 oz plus shipping!    Clove Oil - smells nice. Kills fungus? Not so much.    Almond Oil - nice oil for back rubs...    Jojoba Oil - wha?    Vitamin E Oil - Good for lots of things. But not for fungus.    Lemongrass Oil - Smells nice on Thai food. Not so much help with fungus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really leary of statements about things that supposedly perform &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; so I was cautiously optimistic when I read the reviews and ordered Zetaclear.  I&#x27;ve got one big toe that has had a fungus for at least 10 years and I&#x27;ve tried whatever I can to rid myself of it.  I refuse to take anything internally.  I&#x27;ve been using Zetaclear for about 4 months now and using it two to three times a day.  I have used the mouth spray as well but I&#x27;m not sure that really does anything.  I stopped using it and am just using the oil and my nail has almost grown back completely normal.  I probably still have a month or two to go.  I did notice a change in color of my nail within a few days.  This is a matter of staying with it over the long haul of growing a new nail.  I have another nail that was damaged in a motorcycle accident and that nail is thick but not with fungus...it was just damaged in the accident and Zeta will not help it.  It&#x27;s NOT a fungus but cellular damage and the product is not appropriate for that kind of thing.  If it&#x27;s a fungus, it should work.  Just stay with it, people!!!</li>
            <li> Product look like it was working in the begining but, for some reason did&#x27;nt work for me sorry to say, I follow all insturction an even order more to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hope&#x27;s  for this product, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product so &amp;#34; how would I know if it works or not&amp;#34;. For you information please do not place a order for this product because you will never get it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used a load of products and have found this one to be one of the best. You do have to use it frequently as many times a day as possible and try to keep your hand dry. It has cleared up my infection to the extent where the re-growth is clean nail.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and I only have one tow that is just starting to turn.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working. You have to be diligent with the application &amp; patient  as it takes a long time to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for over 20 years &amp; this is the ONLY one that REALLY works !  Took a couple weeks but amazing results.</li>
            <li> I have rave reviews for Zeta Clear.  Previously I had tried every product for nail fungus that was available in the drug store and even prescription pills.  None of these worked.  But Zeta Clear applied for a few months did work and was very easy to use.  My toenails are completely clear now thanks to Zeta Clear.</li>
            <li> I have used ZetaClear before and loved it, but I decided to purchase from this vendor because it was less expensive. However, the product doesn&#x27;t work the same as the others I&#x27;ve purchased from the Zeta Clear Site. Although more expenise at the Zeta Clear site, I think it&#x27;s worth the price. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t bought this, but I did buy Uncle Harry&#x27;s Toenail &amp; Fungal Relief, which is not available on Amazon. It cost me about $6 for 1/2 oz, and everywhere, everything I read said \\&quot;don&#x27;t be in a hurry, it takes a while\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, after about 2 1/2 months, I see my nail is getting nice, pink, &amp; clear.&lt;br /&gt;So, what they say is true: it ain&#x27;t going to happen right away, but it works, but I had to buy a [[ASIN:B0000CCXU0 DEWALT DW433K Heavy-Duty 8 Amp 3-Inch-by-21-Inch Variable Speed Belt Sander Kit with Dust Canister and Case]] to take care of how thick &amp; nasty that nail has gotten(just kidding, but I did have to take some fine sandpaper to it to make it thin enough to get my Revlon Sure Grip Nail Clip over it(they don&#x27;t make those any more, but they&#x27;re the BEST)</li>
            <li> I have not finished using the solution yet, it&#x27;s still halful but I already see and improvement on my infected nails... toes of my feet, big finger and small finger... I think it will be cured completely after I used the whole bottle...</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I&#x27;ve had a fungal infection on one toe that spread to others and the doctor didn&#x27;t want to give me oral medication due to the side effects.  The only thing that seemed to start working before I got ZetaClear was coconut oil and it slowly does help it get better. However, the ZetaClear, applied three times a day, has nearly cleared up the infection and I have no more athlete&#x27;s foot infections due to the fungus.  As long as that toe was infected I would continue to get the itching and burning of athlete&#x27;s foot.  No more since using the ZetaClear and my toes are starting to look a lot more normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy consumer with this product!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> This product takes awhile to start seeing results,but it really works! I can really see improvements.It worked for me! I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Everything I tried including medication that I got from the doctor did not work. Zeta Clear works. My nail is clear. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It works well, just a bit messy.  Overall a good product.  I would purchase this again to maintain my nails.</li>
            <li> This seems to work ok, i havent used it very long so i cant give a detailed review but so far its good.</li>
            <li> Very effective,toenails looking much better!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is helping! i think I need an act of God!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be that effective like other reviews suggested.  Prescription medication for this problem was the only thing that worked for me.</li>
            <li> Zeta Clear appears to be the only \\&quot;across the counter\\&quot; product that works for my toenail issues.  Highly recommend but it does take at least 6 months to complete.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Had discoloration for many years. I tired many over the counter stuff and nothing works.  I was always embarrassed to go to get a pedicure.  Zeta took the discoloration away and make my nails look healthy.  It takes about 4 mos for it to be gone completely.  Now I use it after every shower.  Zeta lasts  a long time and my nails all look healthy and white.</li>
            <li> With a couple of months of steady use the oil took care of my nails.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the oral spray...it&#x27;s homeopathic garbage.  You might as well spritz your mouth with water.</li>
            <li> I had heard this was the best product for removal of fungus -  so far, not so...  I will continue to use but my hopes have decreased.  Fast delivery was appreciated</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading about it online, and it really does work. It didn&#x27;t completely clear up the fungus on my toenail, but did shrink it a lot so that there&#x27;s only a small amount left.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I paid 25.99 for this crap. I thought I was getting 5oz. Because I had already bought the .5 oz with the 1oz mouth spray for 15.99  Guess I need to get better glasses I did not see the .  Think I will return it. The product is not that good anyway</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles of this stuff (and one bottle of the /Zeta Clear oral spray) using it every morning and every night after I shower and while it seems to have had something of an impact, it doesn&#x27;t clear the fungus as well as I had hoped. So far I have spend quite a lot of money on a product that, from the effect it has had on my toenail fungus, could have come from Walmart.</li>
            <li> The price was great!  This product really works!  Thanks for offering it at a lower price that the Zeta website!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Zeta Clear works for me. My finger nails deteriorate with out it. Air bubbles, cracking, dryness. These aren&#x27;t fungus symtoms necessarily. A doctor told me that, but he didn&#x27;t know what it was. Whatever I have is helped trememdously by Zeta Clear. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 or 4 years.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me...ended up I had to go to a Dr. to get treatment that worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this years ago but it works good.  Will need to purchase more shortly.</li>
            <li> It does show some improvement after weeks of use but it all returns after you stop using it., You decide?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use Zetaclear for toe nail fungus.  It does not work.  Read all the reviews on the internet about Zetaclear and you will see many people are unhappy with its results and side effects.</li>
            <li> Hi, so it is true. Zeta Clear does weirdly dominate the internet and fakes their own positive reviews. This product does not work and the company unethically deletes negative reviews off the internet. Test this out. Put into google search \\&quot; Zeta Clear\\&quot; and you only find positive reviews. That is right there suspicious. I bought two bottles at 30 bucks a pop and it did absolutely nothing. I love Amazon because reviews are not tampered with by companies. I just read some other peoples reviews that state that zeta clear does not take returns unless the bottle is unopened and there is a 10 dollar restocking fee per bottle. Very unethical when on their website they use the phrase \\&quot;satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot;. I also read other reviews that say laser works. I have not used that yet.&lt;br /&gt;I have since tried for nail fungus a few different products, and I am in no way affiliated with these companies, at the very bottom I am leaving my on personal experience with a cure that did work - filing down the nail and using a combo of tea tree oil, Gehwol Med foot spray, and castor oil acid - aka undecenoic acid. You must file down the nail (like right down so the nail bed is almost exposed and almost bleeding...yup, expose the nail bed if you really want to kill the fungus), wear loose airy leather shoes or open toe shoes, and prepare for a long battle ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit seed extract - minimally helped control itch, did nothing for nails&lt;br /&gt;coffe grinds - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;gehwol med foot spray - worked but takes forever and you have to file your nail down&lt;br /&gt;blue goo nail fungus - junk - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;Lamisil - awesome on itchy foot but does nothing for nail fungus ( it actually is not meant to be used on the nail fungus part at all but just on the skin with the itchy part)&lt;br /&gt;ciclopirox ( doctor prescribed it to me) - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;Zeta clear - helps with the itchy part of your skin on your toes, does absolutely nothing for your nail fungus. booo.&lt;br /&gt;castor bean oil undecenoic acid - works when used on nail fungus but takes like 1 year to completely kill off fungus&lt;br /&gt;Using bleach OR hydrogen peroxide on nail - use one or the other NOT BOTH TOGETHER!!!!  - some nurses swear by this dangerous remedy of EITHER bleach or EITHER hydrogen peroxide 10% ( put it with q-tip on their nail and this kills EVERYTHING), because it eats away the nail, exposing the nail bed, and eventually kills the fungus. but be carefull - dangerous, toxic, and can damage integrity of your skin temporarily ...err I tried it...yeah dumb I know...but desperate times lead to dumb and desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in conclusion. based on other reviewers : only laser works, or Gehwol, or castor bean oil aka undecenoic acid ...but only if you keep filing your nail down to the nail bed...careful because then you can get infections easily!!! Also, the oral prescribed crazy antibiotic dosage works based on other people&#x27;s reviews but careful, this is also a very dangerous remedy...lots of side effects.&lt;br /&gt;based on my review and my use: only product containing undecenoic acid and gehwol med foot spray, and filing the nail down obsessively to bottom of nail bed ( like 2 times a week!!) had any real impact on my nail fungus. Get a Vogue rechargeable nail filer so you can text with one hand while filing with the other ( just kidding about the texting!) Use Castor oil acid ( undecenoic acid) and tea tree in conjunction with gehwol med foot spray.  Takes 3 months to get better, and 6 months to be completely gone. Use Lamisil or Zeta clear for controlling itchy parts of foot, but not fungus on nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I cured my big toe and second toe with the above remedy and have been fungus free since...but my baby toe is still infected ( now 12 years) and is not getting better...no matter what I do so far :( I am going to post this under every zeta clear so people aren&#x27;t scammed and get proper info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click on this review if it was helpful!</li>
