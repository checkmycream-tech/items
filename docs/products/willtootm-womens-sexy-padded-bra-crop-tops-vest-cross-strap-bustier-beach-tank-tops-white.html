            <li> Cheap and poor quality</li>
            <li> The band isn&#x27;t tight enough under your boobs, so if you lift your arms it will rise up</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Poor stitching. Pads in off center placement. A pull in the fabric on the front of the breast area. Not worth it. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Too big. Padding in bra is uneven/lumpy.</li>
            <li> Not as long on the back/shoulder as expected; no ability to adjust :( Returning for refund</li>
