    <ol>
            <li>The cream is best for hairlines but they have a lotion for denser hair areas .You can read about it at [...].</li>
            <li>The author had tried it for her thinning hairline &amp; gotten very good results</li>
            <li>I had been using the Emu and while it was working great</li>
            <li>it was good to help grow eye lashes,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen good results on my eyebrows...</li>
            <li>So I am very pleased with Folligen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that my results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I can see a great improvement in volume and specially on lenght.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m of the mindset that if some is good, more is better.</li>
            <li>The hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>After doing some research on products that help regrow eye lashes, I decided to try the Folligen cream because it was much more affordable than the Lilash eyelash cream.  </li>
            <li>I heard about Folligen cream from an article in this June 2009 issue of More magazine ([...]).</li>

            <li>but I got my hair loss to stop by getting rid of a lot of stress in my life, eating healthier, and taking better care of my scalp.</li>
            <li>I decided my vision was more important than having eye lashes</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!Im very pleased:)</li>
            <li>I have never had a migraine in my life before (being 34 and healthy) and I was vomiting with the severity of the headache, along with sound, light and smell hypersensitivity.</li>
            <li>From my experience, I didn&#x27;t need to apply huge amounts of this product to see results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month and have not noticed any significant change whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I read about the folligen spray and found that the product had a greater positive review and decided to try it.    </li>
            <li>I suspect it will take a year or so for other people to notice the results, but I&#x27;m happy at this</li>
            <li>While I found Latisse to be a great product, shelling out $160 every other month was not so much fun.     </li>
            <li>This works for new hair growth and to promote healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li>My father is a Norwood 7 (basically completely bald on top), but all the men on my mother&#x27;s side have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>haha!!</li>
            <li>You can read about how the copper peptides in this formula help stimulate hair growth in a most natural way.</li>
            <li>You can read about how the copper peptides in this formula help stimulate hair growth in a most natural way.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have a beautiful thick head of hair, I can style my hair again.</li>
            <li>Had this item looked more professional &amp; contained thorough instructions, I certainly would have given it a try.</li>
            <li>(I tried it more than once and the same thing happened).  </li>
            <li>I use the cream and the Emu S oil -- cream first, then oil.</li>
            <li>At first, there was an itching like an ingrown hair, but not too bothersome.   </li>
            <li>I personally would recommend this product if you were looking for a fairly safe way to improve your lash length.</li>
            <li>This creme is a bright blue that stays blue after application.</li>
            <li>Bright turquoise blue cream allows this for only night application.  </li>
            <li>The first night i used it my granddaughter told me i had used wayyyy too much eye shadow.....haha</li>
            <li>A little drop of each to the eyelashes (with an emphasis on the top lashes) is all you need!</li>
            <li>Mostly, where there were lashes missing, new ones grew and filled in.</li>
            <li>I tried it for 4 nights straight but found the itching was too much for me.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I did get an rx for the real latisse and am using that now.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve allowed both to really soak in.</li>
            <li>After 12 weeks, I could really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Two years ago, I was about ready to start wearing wigs.</li>
            <li>But as I had read on [...] that this worked well to enhance and grow lashes, I didnt really care and I tried it anyways.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lashes have grown longer than they did with Lilash (another lash stimulator that has some cautionary ingredients) and they are much fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>How much?</li>
            <li>A little stinging at first but other wise no bad side effect at this time.</li>
            <li>I bought Folligen because I&#x27;d recently noticed excessive hair fall and thought to counteract it before the damage was too great.    </li>
            <li>The price alone is amazing, considering that Ive been using it everyday for almost a month and my tube is still almost completely full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair I got with Folligen is normal head hair.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the lashes became longer and a new ones started to grow.</li>
            <li>This particular cream does not have prostaglandin which is a controversial drug that is used in the treatment of glaucoma and has some serious side effects which include blindness.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>with most products, every individual reacts to chemicals differently and one cannot always expect the same results as everyone else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I wanted to say, another reviewer mentioned getting headaches when first starting to use this product, and I did as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this only a handful of times, and the first time (that too, with a sparse application on my head) triggered a migraine of epic proportions.</li>
            <li>My hair loss problem started in my early twenties and continuing till date - am 28 now.    </li>
            <li>Purchased this product several weeks ago &amp; looked very forward to receiving it.</li>
            <li>So far no change in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Folligen with Minoxidil and a decent moisturizing shampoo must help your hair fall if you are in the initial stages of hair loss.</li>
            <li>I wish they come out with a special applicator for those who wan to use it for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to find out if it works, but this makes me very suspicious.</li>
            <li>, amd apply a light mix of essential oils and a small amount of Folligen to the bald areas twice a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American &amp; had decided in February to go natural because of some thinning at my temples &amp; nape after 28 years of curly perms.</li>
            <li>about 2 months in, and now, 5 months in, I have 6 or so fully mature hairs back in my bald areas with numerous vellus hairs growing in.</li>
            <li>I am not affiliated with them by any means, I happened upon this product after dissatisfaction with other lash stimulators and had read about Folligen from another non affiliated website.it everyday for almost a month and my tube is still almost completely full.     </li>

            <li> Let me first start off by saying that the causes for hair loss are fairly complex, and people can experience hair loss for a variety of different reasons.</li>
            <li> It was a complete disaster and made what little hair I have left fall out.  </li>
            <li> It is too hard to rub into the scalp area, the spray is much easier for this.</li>
            <li> It is a bright blue color and although Ive been using it for about a month, it still can cause my upper eyelids to itch, but its usually fleeting and isnt really painful.</li>
            <li> I did not like the cream for my long hair.</li>
            <li> But since my eyes are not near my breasts</li>
            <li> I have to note that headaches are rare for me, and in general, I never get weird reactions to products I try or use.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t anything intense, but I started out with a very small amount once a day and gradually worked up to twice a day.</li>
            <li> For me, I started losing my hair in college and have slowly progressed to a Norwood 2 (really high Widow&#x27;s peak) over the years.</li>
            <li> I havent grown new hair and any progress of hair growth is slow, but I will recommend it to anyone with itching,flaking and inflammation in the scalp.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use a little longer,maybe it take a while to actually see any improvement.</li>
            <li> If you have blond hair you may see a slight blue green tint to it after using this product.</li>
            <li> Due to the product&#x27;s blue color I usually use it at night.</li>
            <li> I am not affiliated with them by any means, I happened upon this product after dissatisfaction with other lash stimulators and had read about Folligen from another non affiliated website.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is a little messy to apply, I had to purchase an eyeliner wand to use it, but after using it for several days, I had become a pro at applying it correctly.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is copper peptides &amp; there is a lot of information about it on the website.</li>
            <li> I got them both from Amazon and the price was much less than other hair loss products out there.</li>
            <li> I very carefully put a small amount at my eye lash line being careful not to get any in my eye.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for lash and brow growth, after less than one month</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical, given the majority of negative reviews and the fact that the price was so low compared with other hair growth stimulators (I was looking only for something to help with my eyelash growth, not hair on my scalp).</li>
            <li> It works pretty slowly because hair grows slowly - especially when one has been dealt a bad genetic hair</li>
            <li> I knew from reviews that the cream was green so it needs to be used at night and washed off in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Folligen Cream and Spray a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a white plastic bottle with a self-adhesive label that was poorly centered.</li>
            <li> How in the world did it ever get to the mass market stage with such poor packaging &amp; nonexistant instructions?</li>
            <li> I exfoliate my scalp once a week, rinse my scalp with apple cider vinegar a few times a week (supposedly helps to break up clogged folicles)</li>
            <li> I still noticed headaches, centered behind my left eye, within 15 minutes of application, though not as bad as the first time (never got the nerve to put the stuff on my head again).</li>
            <li> Three of the hairs are getting to be as long as my haircut is (which is fairly short, and they look a bit silly hanging out there by themselves, but no complaints here!)</li>
            <li> Plus, I worry that if I used them in the morning before I put on makeup, my lashes would be a little too greasy to curl!</li>
            <li> As it is, I am afraid to use it &amp; will be returning the product for a complete refund.</li>
            <li> I started seeing small vellus hairs</li>
            <li> but because I have blue eyes, I am afraid to use Latisse and change my eye color.</li>
            <li> After a lot of additional experimentation, I&#x27;ve found a routine that is slowly working for me, and Folligen is part of that.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!    </li>
            <li> It is also difficult to wash your hair every day when I am used to washing it every other day.</li>
            <li> Hi, I tried this because my eyelashes and eyebrows have become thin over the years.</li>
            <li> Ill try not to worry about it.</li>
            <li> I was totally shocked.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>

            <li> Hi, I tried this because my eyelashes and eyebrows have become thin over the years. I put this on, yes it&#x27;s blue, at night. All it did was irritate my eyes and did not make any hair grow. I tried it for 4 nights straight but found the itching was too much for me. In the meantime, I did get an rx for the real latisse and am using that now.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on products that help regrow eye lashes, I decided to try the Folligen cream because it was much more affordable than the Lilash eyelash cream.  The bottle did not have directions and there were no ingredients listed. I knew from reviews that the cream was green so it needs to be used at night and washed off in the morning.  I very carefully put a small amount at my eye lash line being careful not to get any in my eye.  My vision blurred after using it (I tried it more than once and the same thing happened).  I decided my vision was more important than having eye lashes so I stopped using it on my eye lashes.  I did try it on my eyebrows just to test it to see if it actually worked, but I stopped using it after several days when I finally identified the smell--it smelled like the chemicals used in porta-potties!  I don&#x27;t know if it workes or not, but I don&#x27;t recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I heard about Folligen cream from an article in this June 2009 issue of More magazine ([...]). The author had tried it for her thinning hairline &amp; gotten very good results so I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it since July 8th.I&#x27;m African American &amp; had decided in February to go natural because of some thinning at my temples &amp; nape after 28 years of curly perms.Since using the Folligen along with emu oil,I&#x27;ve noticed the areas filling in. I&#x27;d also been using Dabur amla oil &amp; vatika oil since June but I can see the regrowth has increased since I started Folligen, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it. The cream is best for hairlines but they have a lotion for denser hair areas .You can read about it at [...]. The active ingredient is copper peptides &amp; there is a lot of information about it on the website.</li>
            <li> While I found Latisse to be a great product, shelling out $160 every other month was not so much fun.     I use the cream and the Emu S oil -- cream first, then oil. A little drop of each to the eyelashes (with an emphasis on the top lashes) is all you need! I use them at night. I figure that way, I&#x27;ve allowed both to really soak in. Plus, I worry that if I used them in the morning before I put on makeup, my lashes would be a little too greasy to curl!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Folligen Cream and Spray a few weeks ago. I did not like the cream for my long hair. It is too hard to rub into the scalp area, the spray is much easier for this. I do like this cream for my eyebrows which had thinned out because of a thyroid condition. I have seen a difference in growth in just a short time. If you have blond hair you may see a slight blue green tint to it after using this product. It is probably from the copper that is in it. I have seen a reduction of hair loss from the spray as well. I was losing ALOT of hair over the last several months and this has been slowed substantially. I got them both from Amazon and the price was much less than other hair loss products out there.</li>
            <li> Wow! I bought this product for lash and brow growth, after less than one month I can see a great improvement in volume and specially on lenght. I wish they come out with a special applicator for those who wan to use it for this purpose. Highly recommended!!!!Im very pleased:)</li>
            <li> Hi All,    I am an Indian Male with pattern baldness. My hair loss problem started in my early twenties and continuing till date - am 28 now.    I read about the folligen spray and found that the product had a greater positive review and decided to try it.    I use it every alternate night and shampoo it off in the morning. With the use of folligen, the itching, flaking and the skin inflammation I have been suffering from disappeared. I havent grown new hair and any progress of hair growth is slow, but I will recommend it to anyone with itching,flaking and inflammation in the scalp. Folligen has definitely relieved me of those symptoms.    I am continuing the use of it to keep the results. Folligen with Minoxidil and a decent moisturizing shampoo must help your hair fall if you are in the initial stages of hair loss.</li>
            <li> I bought Folligen because I&#x27;d recently noticed excessive hair fall and thought to counteract it before the damage was too great.    I&#x27;ve used this only a handful of times, and the first time (that too, with a sparse application on my head) triggered a migraine of epic proportions. I have never had a migraine in my life before (being 34 and healthy) and I was vomiting with the severity of the headache, along with sound, light and smell hypersensitivity. Still, I hesitated that it could be this product, so I continued to use it sparingly on my eyebrows and eyelashes. I still noticed headaches, centered behind my left eye, within 15 minutes of application, though not as bad as the first time (never got the nerve to put the stuff on my head again). So no, this product is not going to be used anywhere on me and I would caution others to do so too. I have to note that headaches are rare for me, and in general, I never get weird reactions to products I try or use.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with no ingredient list, no directions, and no information regarding intended use or allergy warnings. When I called the distributer, they just apologized and said they received it from the manufacturer that way and told me how to use it.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to find out if it works, but this makes me very suspicious.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product several weeks ago &amp; looked very forward to receiving it. However, when the pkg. arrived I was totally shocked. This product looked like a bootlegged item! There was NO BOX &amp; NO INSTRUCTIONS WHATSOEVER. The packaging was a white plastic bottle with a self-adhesive label that was poorly centered. There was NOTHING on the back but another skewed, self-adhesive label that gave a lot # &amp; a date of manufacture. Unbelievable!    This product looks like something that came out of someone&#x27;s in-home operation. How in the world did it ever get to the mass market stage with such poor packaging &amp; nonexistant instructions? Are there no government or marketing guidelines that have to be met with a beauty product?????     Had this item looked more professional &amp; contained thorough instructions, I certainly would have given it a try. As it is, I am afraid to use it &amp; will be returning the product for a complete refund.</li>
            <li> It does work. Just have to give it time and have to apply it every night.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, along with emu oil, to promote eyelash growth. After 12 weeks, I could really tell a difference. Mostly, where there were lashes missing, new ones grew and filled in. I also noticed that the lashes became longer and a new ones started to grow. At first, there was an itching like an ingrown hair, but not too bothersome.   I applied the formula with a eye liner brush and applied emu oil with a mascara wand from Sally Beauty Supply. My friends who use Latisse have bolder effects with Latisse but because I have blue eyes, I am afraid to use Latisse and change my eye color. My eye color has not changed with Folligen. If I have ever gotten any in my eye, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I read about this product and decided to try it on my hairline. Due to the product&#x27;s blue color I usually use it at night. After I applied it my skin tingled.I see some regrowth.  The hair is very fine. I hope that I see improved results upon continued use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month and have not noticed any significant change whatsoever. It is also difficult to wash your hair every day when I am used to washing it every other day. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but it worked for me. I&#x27;m a female with male pattern inherited hair loss. I took before and after photos at 3 months and six months to discern any improvement. It works pretty slowly because hair grows slowly - especially when one has been dealt a bad genetic hair card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now used Folligen cream for 2 years. While I don&#x27;t have a beautiful thick head of hair, I can style my hair again. Two years ago, I was about ready to start wearing wigs. So I am very pleased with Folligen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I tried Minoxidil and all that grew was vellus (peach fuzz) hair which fell out as soon as I stopped. The hair I got with Folligen is normal head hair.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is amazing. I was highly skeptical, given the majority of negative reviews and the fact that the price was so low compared with other hair growth stimulators (I was looking only for something to help with my eyelash growth, not hair on my scalp). Upon receiving this cream, I too was disheartened by the lack of packaging and instructions and ingredient list. But as I had read on [...] that this worked well to enhance and grow lashes, I didnt really care and I tried it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is a little messy to apply, I had to purchase an eyeliner wand to use it, but after using it for several days, I had become a pro at applying it correctly. It is a bright blue color and although Ive been using it for about a month, it still can cause my upper eyelids to itch, but its usually fleeting and isnt really painful. If you go to the website where this is actually from, they recommend using it with Emu Oil. I have been using them both and I have to say that my results are amazing. My lashes have grown longer than they did with Lilash (another lash stimulator that has some cautionary ingredients) and they are much fuller and thicker. I look like I am wearing mascara when I am not and my lashes curl outward at the ends, giving me a &#x27;glamorous&#x27; look that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most products, every individual reacts to chemicals differently and one cannot always expect the same results as everyone else. I personally would recommend this product if you were looking for a fairly safe way to improve your lash length. This particular cream does not have prostaglandin which is a controversial drug that is used in the treatment of glaucoma and has some serious side effects which include blindness. It does contain some types of parabens which may have been linked to some forms of breast cancer when used in underarm deodorant. But since my eyes are not near my breasts Ill try not to worry about it. The price alone is amazing, considering that Ive been using it everyday for almost a month and my tube is still almost completely full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the Skin Biology website, you will find out more information on this product plus its ingredients. You can read about how the copper peptides in this formula help stimulate hair growth in a most natural way. I am not affiliated with them by any means, I happened upon this product after dissatisfaction with other lash stimulators and had read about Folligen from another non affiliated website.it everyday for almost a month and my tube is still almost completely full.

            <li> This product di NOT work for me. It was a complete disaster and made what little hair I have left fall out.  Use at your risk!!!!  I threw it out!</li>
            <li> I was researching Emu oil for hair growth for my eyelashes and stumbled upon a blog that suggested adding this. I had been using the Emu and while it was working great i&#x27;m of the mindset that if some is good, more is better. I added this to the mix. My eyelashes are still growing and the hair i lost in my brows with the permanent tattoo is still coming in. I have no idea if this works or not..haha!! If you are thinking of using this on your head you must be a person who washes their hair daily. This creme is a bright blue that stays blue after application. The first night i used it my granddaughter told me i had used wayyyy too much eye shadow.....haha</li>
            <li> Have been using this product now for about a month. So far no change in my eyebrows. A little stinging at first but other wise no bad side effect at this time. Will continue to use a little longer,maybe it take a while to actually see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I brought this as I read it was good to help grow eye lashes, well it has helped mine paired with Emu oil. I use an eye liner brush to apply it along my eye lash line at night and rub it in with my finger, then I rub Emu Oil in. I noticed the difference in 2 weeks and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Used on my thinning eyebrows and saw results in about a week.  They have grown back!  Who knew this could happen?  Bright turquoise blue cream allows this for only night application.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for eyelashes and eyebrows.  I&#x27;ve seen good results on my eyebrows...</li>
            <li> This product arrived without any instructions whatsoever.  I haven&#x27;t even used it.  How do I know how often?  How much? Do I wash it out?  Leave it in?????  A mystery.  Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Edges of hair seem to he filling in but I an also using asht blocker I also bought com.Amazon . So I use in conjunction.with this</li>
            <li> This works for new hair growth and to promote healthy looking hair.  I have been using nightly for two weeks now and see noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying that the causes for hair loss are fairly complex, and people can experience hair loss for a variety of different reasons. For me, I started losing my hair in college and have slowly progressed to a Norwood 2 (really high Widow&#x27;s peak) over the years. My father is a Norwood 7 (basically completely bald on top), but all the men on my mother&#x27;s side have a full head of hair. It took me a while to figure it out but I got my hair loss to stop by getting rid of a lot of stress in my life, eating healthier, and taking better care of my scalp. One problem though, my hair wasn&#x27;t growing back. After a lot of additional experimentation, I&#x27;ve found a routine that is slowly working for me, and Folligen is part of that. I exfoliate my scalp once a week, rinse my scalp with apple cider vinegar a few times a week (supposedly helps to break up clogged folicles), amd apply a light mix of essential oils and a small amount of Folligen to the bald areas twice a day. I started seeing small vellus hairs about 2 months in, and now, 5 months in, I have 6 or so fully mature hairs back in my bald areas with numerous vellus hairs growing in. Three of the hairs are getting to be as long as my haircut is (which is fairly short, and they look a bit silly hanging out there by themselves, but no complaints here!) I suspect it will take a year or so for other people to notice the results, but I&#x27;m happy at this point.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I wanted to say, another reviewer mentioned getting headaches when first starting to use this product, and I did as well. They weren&#x27;t anything intense, but I started out with a very small amount once a day and gradually worked up to twice a day. From my experience, I didn&#x27;t need to apply huge amounts of this product to see results. I use an amount about the size of a grain of rice twice a day.</li>
