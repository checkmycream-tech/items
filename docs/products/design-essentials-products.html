            <li> This product is terrible!  Each time I&#x27;ve used it, it has left my scalp covered in dry patches that turn into sores/scabs. This has never happened until the morning after I&#x27;ve used this product all 3 times. Will never use it again.</li>

            <li> I have purchased MANY AND LET ME SAY MANY hair care products claiming to be Herbal huh, do these company&#x27;s think that this market of consumers are naive to the fact that we don&#x27;t know what herbal means??????? This product has mineral oil is that are HERBAL? ? Mineral oil does not absorb to the scalp it just sits there that&#x27;s not natural it also contains myristyl  myristote can someone out there tell me does that sound natural what is that and there&#x27;s other ingredients that I cannot pronounce SO..... Shame on these companies the Do Not state these important ingredients that could potentially harm someone thats looking for a natural product shame on you is that why you don&#x27;t state the ingredients on your description website??</li>
            <li> Received product really fast.  Wonderful product. Holds hair style and gives hair a natural sheen and has helped to eliminate dry patches on my scalp.  Highly recommend this product and vendor.</li>
            <li> Light weight and lightly scented</li>
            <li> I bought three jars and can&#x27;t wait to use in my hair.  It smells so good</li>
            <li> I purchased this when mu stylist said recommended it and have been using it ever since. it has helped my hair to grow back after the anesthesia from surgery broke it off. I will most def buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Yes it is Worth it!! My Hair dresser used this product twice on my hair and I loved it.  I asked her for the name and I came on Amazon and searched it right away.  As soon as I saw it I purchased it.  This product is my Favorite,  And the fact that you can use a Little and not alot makes it even better, that makes it long Lasting. I have VERY COARSE hair and I use this product to flat iron my hair and it makes it Very very straight and softer than It has ever been.  If you are hesitant about buying this product,  dont be,  it is worth the money and the results are very satisfying. When it is finished (probably next 3 months)  I will buy another and another. Sorry this is long but I just Love this Product ❤💆🙌</li>

            <li> Received as promised.</li>
            <li> Very lite on the scalp.</li>
