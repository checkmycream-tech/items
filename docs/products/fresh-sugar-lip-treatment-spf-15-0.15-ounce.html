            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the best tinted balm-type products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Best lip treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best lip balm in the market.</li>
            <li>Great hydrating balm that gives you color.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it feels like a really nice lip balm, and he said, ugh, it feels like wax on your lips!</li>
            <li>Good vendor, thank you.</li>
            <li>Good tint</li>
            <li>The tint is lovely and lasts for a while, and the balm keeps the dryness away!</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick!  </li>
            <li>I just learned about this product, and I am IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because of these:  great color, smooth, not too dense, nice shine.</li>
            <li>great shade and soooo smooth on the lips.  </li>
            <li>Nice feel and taste</li>
            <li>the color is very light; plum would be better but its still nice.</li>
            <li>Yes, the color does show and it is very light</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lip treatments.</li>
            <li>I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and moisturization.</li>
            <li>That said, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the velvety texture of this product.</li>
            <li>This is the creamiest, most hydrating lip balm I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It has a lemon/lime smell, which I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it more than once.  </li>
            <li>love it  love it  </li>
            <li>love the color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I tried this.  </li>
            <li>this color is better suited for olive / Mediterranean skin.  </li>
            <li>Like it better than the cherry</li>
            <li>cuz it melts really easily and the point of it is to carry around when you are out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Smooth to apply and leaves lips feeling moist.</li>
            <li>Keep in cool areas however as lipstick easily smears.</li>
            <li>It may be too dark for very fair skin tones.</li>
            <li>Wonderful and moisturizing without being too slick.</li>
            <li>This is a great tinted lipstick however I have to minus a star</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice berry shade, pretty much just like the photo here.  </li>
            <li>If the formula has more wax and stays on the lip longer then maybe it can really keep lips moist.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I&#x27;m willing to take that extra care - it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Lightly dotted on is more than enough to saturate your lips with color.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the grape color - looks like stained cool-aid on me, will stick with Fresh honey.  </li>
            <li>it is a rich color and really moist.</li>
            <li>The texture is amazing and the color is rich but without being too dark.  </li>
            <li>and it looks really pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of these and love them all!</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Layering it can make it look straight up purple.</li>
            <li>The colors are not that noticeable on darker skin complexions, but I&#x27;m not using it for color as much as moisture.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice the waxiness as much as the watery, nourishing feel.</li>
            <li>With this product, less is more.</li>
            <li>It is the most long lasting lip balm I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>The SPF is a nice bonus, and I&#x27;m particularly happy that the formulation is working for me and not causing any reactions (because I&#x27;ve used some other SPF lip products with bad results -- but this is working</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as bold as a standard lipstick, but you can still definitely see it.  </li>
            <li>Feels soft and nourishing on your lips</li>
            <li>The color is like a wet lipstick, dark plum, but more sheer.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I guess which I put a pink lipgloss over</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s one of only a very few lip colors I&#x27;ve tried lately</li>
            <li> Yes, a little bit rubs off if you&#x27;re drinking tea or coffee out of a mug, but you can still feel the product on your lips, even after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I forced my husband as a joke to put it on saying</li>

            <li> the color is very light; plum would be better but its still nice. I&#x27;ll order plum next time. Good vendor, thank you.</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  The only negative is that it is very soft and care must be taken not to damage it.  One tube&lt;br /&gt;actually melted a bit in my purse.  Nevertheless I&#x27;m willing to take that extra care - it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and moisturization. The color is like a wet lipstick, dark plum, but more sheer. I use it as lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick!  Smooth to apply and leaves lips feeling moist. Keep in cool areas however as lipstick easily smears.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm. With this product, less is more. Layering it can make it look straight up purple. Lightly dotted on is more than enough to saturate your lips with color. That said, I love it. It&#x27;s the perfect shade of berry. I like that I don&#x27;t have to choose between a lipstick and a moisturizer. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I have these everywhere, the car, the office and one in my purse. Great hydrating balm that gives you color. Stays on all day and you only need to reapply a few times. I love the velvety texture of this product.</li>
            <li> I just learned about this product, and I am IN LOVE! This is the creamiest, most hydrating lip balm I&#x27;ve ever had. It has a lemon/lime smell, which I love. And my lips stay moisturized ALL DAY (unless I eat or rub it off in some way). It is the most long lasting lip balm I&#x27;ve ever encountered. The colors are not that noticeable on darker skin complexions, but I&#x27;m not using it for color as much as moisture. Definitely recommending this to anyone tired of having dry lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it more than once.  I gave it 5 stars because of these:  great color, smooth, not too dense, nice shine.</li>
            <li> Feels soft and nourishing on your lips so I forced my husband as a joke to put it on saying&lt;br /&gt;it feels like a really nice lip balm, and he said, ugh, it feels like wax on your lips! But I still like the color and I don&#x27;t notice the waxiness as much as the watery, nourishing feel. Sort of of burgundy/rose color I guess which I put a pink lipgloss over and it looks really pretty.</li>
            <li> This is a great tinted lipstick however I have to minus a star cuz it melts really easily and the point of it is to carry around when you are out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Also I don&#x27;t like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;But it is a rich color and really moist.</li>
            <li> love it  love it  great shade and soooo smooth on the lips.  Yes, the color does show and it is very light</li>
            <li> This is tinted lip gloss that has been bumped up to luxurious!  It&#x27;s not your mother&#x27;s lip gloss!  But if she tries it, she will be hooked too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  It&#x27;s one of only a very few lip colors I&#x27;ve tried lately that is moisturizing AND that stays on through multiple meals.  Yes, a little bit rubs off if you&#x27;re drinking tea or coffee out of a mug, but you can still feel the product on your lips, even after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color.  It&#x27;s not as bold as a standard lipstick, but you can still definitely see it.  It&#x27;s a nice berry shade, pretty much just like the photo here.  The SPF is a nice bonus, and I&#x27;m particularly happy that the formulation is working for me and not causing any reactions (because I&#x27;ve used some other SPF lip products with bad results -- but this is working great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see the ingredients list on the product page, so here are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beeswax, Castor Seed Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Decyl Esters, Grape Seed Oil, Fragrance, Carnauba Wax, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Passiflora Incarnata Seed Oil, Black Currant Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Retinyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Avocado Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Vanillin, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Propyl Gallate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Ci 15850 (Red 7 Lake), Ci 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), Ci 42090 (Blue 1 Lake), Ci 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), Limonene, Citral, Linalool, Benzyl Alcohol, BHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I tried this.  It&#x27;s one of the best tinted balm-type products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Best lip treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The texture is amazing and the color is rich but without being too dark.  this color is better suited for olive / Mediterranean skin.  It may be too dark for very fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> Good tint but doesn&#x27;t last. Nice feel and taste but I don&#x27;t notice any improvement in the moisture of my lips.  If the formula has more wax and stays on the lip longer then maybe it can really keep lips moist.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the grape color - looks like stained cool-aid on me, will stick with Fresh honey.  Like it better than the cherry</li>
            <li> This product arrived melted in the tube.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm in the market. I&#x27;ve tried a few of these and love them all!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and moisturizing without being too slick.</li>
