            <li>please read my reviews - bottom line a great razor blade!</li>
            <li>I think these razors are the best bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of buying these when I bought my safety razor and the shave was not the best for me.</li>
            <li>Very happy with them.</li>
            <li>They are a wonderful value and in my comparison are on par with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>I am settled on these Derby blades as the best blade.  </li>
            <li>Feather is the best no doubt.</li>
            <li>Best blades for the money IMO</li>
            <li>This one is the VERY BEST.</li>
            <li>Great price too!  </li>

            <li>These are great!</li>
            <li>Happy shaving Gent&#x27;s !!</li>
            <li>Service from Amazon was excellent and has been every time I</li>
            <li>These blades seem to be the best for me, every person has their opinions but for me these seem to shave the best and they are some of the cheapest blades.</li>
            <li>and I was very happy with it</li>
            <li>The shave, however, was very good in spite of that.</li>
            <li>a very good price i think it was about .14 cents per blade</li>
            <li>The contrast between the two blades is incredible.  </li>
            <li>After switching though to these blades and the razor and using shave soap I get a great shave and my skin feels great!  </li>
            <li>The price point is excellent, and this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Get maybe 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade!</li>
            <li>They are good but not the best.</li>
            <li>These razors are a wonderful deal and I love them!</li>
            <li>These were a very good deal and seemed to be good</li>
            <li>25 blades for 3.99 is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great blades.</li>
            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>What a great idea.</li>
            <li>I dont know how this product works for men because well... ive never been one (and never will lol)</li>
            <li>This is my brand!Derby makes really great blades I use them in my merkur</li>
            <li>I get 5-6 great shaves out of this razor.</li>
            <li>Happy shaves.</li>
            <li>Great buy at this price too.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try it because of the attractive pricing.</li>
            <li>I ordered twenty five blades and they were packaged in 5&#x27;s which makes it great to share.  </li>
            <li>work great for my needs, and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li>They are a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>All things considered they are a great value.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for these razors.</li>
            <li>Irritation -- I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation from the blades.  </li>
            <li>and im a happy man.</li>
            <li>This blade is great.  </li>
            <li>I recommend these as a great value.</li>
            <li>I change the blade out once a week and never go without a great shave.</li>
            <li>however, on my neck its great.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re inexpensive, and they cut great.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a happy camper</li>
            <li>What can I say about these razor blades except that they shave my husband very nicely.</li>
            <li>Great Blades, as good as the pricier name brands.</li>
            <li>This is the best blade I have ever tried and it is also the most forgiving.</li>
            <li>In fact if I have anything good to say about the Derbys is that they made my technique better as I had to have the blade at the perfect angle to have any chance of trimming my whiskers</li>
            <li>These blades are good.</li>
            <li>it came with shark DE blades, they were good.</li>
            <li>They are a good all around blade for the beginner.</li>
            <li>Good blade.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s as good as the Merkur, just a lot cheaper.    </li>
            <li>Oil and lather seem to work really good together although I haven&#x27;t tried using just oil and doubt that I will.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a noticeably good difference using the oil with the lather though.  </li>
            <li>and I can never get a good shave on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Blades came swiftly as advertised, I can get a good shave with them.  </li>
            <li>These are good blades.</li>
            <li>If you just want some blades that you know will be good, Derby is not gonna disappoint.</li>
            <li>Good blades.  </li>
            <li>Good blades for the beginner or when returning to shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>How good was the shave?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for quite a while and managed to get my technique as good as I could to minimize the damage</li>
            <li>so I tried them and get a good shave with them.</li>
            <li>But they are good blades for the price.</li>
            <li>These are good razors and a good buy.  </li>
            <li>The razors give a good close shave.  </li>
            <li>The blades came quickly, fit nearly perfectly with my safety razor</li>
            <li>That seems a fair assessment, but I tried them anyways.</li>
            <li>Also good as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; blade t compare others against.</li>
            <li>For the price a good shave.  </li>
            <li>but it takes a couple of weeks to look good.</li>
            <li>These blades get the job done, but they are not as good as the Merkur blade that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li>Good value, though.</li>
            <li>blah blah blah etc... on a superior face :</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Astra Superior Platinum\\&quot; blade</li>
            <li>the Derby&#x27;s are superior.  </li>
            <li>These do a fairly good job and they are inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>My razor came with an Astra Superior Platinum blade</li>
            <li>Very good blades in my opinion ,gets the job done,for a smooth baby butt shave.</li>
            <li>Safety razor shaving as done a GREAT job at clearing most of those problems up.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with these razor blades.</li>
            <li>Good price for some nice blades.</li>
            <li>Again these may be the best for you, but before buying one brand in bulk you should buy a sample pack to find the right blade for your face.</li>
            <li>Safe to toss in the trash!</li>
            <li>Not the sharpest or the closest shave, but almost certainly the best value on the market.</li>
            <li>When it does its job, it does it AMAZINGLY well.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>but leave a lot of stubble still there, got to be honest</li>
            <li>They do have a used blades compartment which is nice.    </li>
            <li>though not quite perfectly on both sides - and holds the blades nice and straight while making it trivial to pop a blade in or out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will want an Alum block handy.</li>
            <li>Again, I think it has to do with what kind of beard you have, so you really have to feel it out and do what&#x27;s best for your own face.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to get 8-10 good shaves out of my Gillette Fusion, but those cartridges cost about $4 each, whereas a Derby blade is about $0.21 apiece.      </li>
            <li>but when I used a DE razor, I really liked this brand of blade.  </li>
            <li>It leaves me with a nice close shave</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t sit here and say my technique was perfect and it was all the blade, but I really do feel that way.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll take my own advice and look around for some blade sample packs now.  </li>
            <li>In fact,the rest of the blades were really nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent shave, both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>I get more _good_</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>As the first reviewer stated, those new to D/E shaving would be best served by purchasing a blade variety pack, to see which brand works best for them.</li>
            <li>Very good quality for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Great seller, Great product, Gotta buy a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>very pleased with purchase..will order a couple more derby razor blades... to stock up....</li>
            <li>This is the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>These blades are perfect for my beard type and give a super close shave that leaves my mug looking clean all day.</li>
            <li>great quality, shipped quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d try a pack yourself as it really a pretty good blade!.  </li>
            <li>very good quality containers also, certainly will but them again</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 on its best day would get almost everything but would still leave a bit of stubble on my chin, but right now it&#x27;s baby smooth.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be more honest, it&#x27;s either shipping or not.</li>
            <li>To be honest I was looking for something that worked a bit better?.  </li>
            <li>When I note controversial -</li>
            <li>, so far, it has really impressed me.</li>
            <li>So far very happy with change to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; style shaving.</li>
            <li>We bought these for a Merkur Razor and while they are not as awesome as the original, for the very low price, they work great.</li>
            <li>They were super cheap, which also makes them good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades are great, I can use one about six or seven times, clean up easy, and my irritation is all but gone.</li>
            <li>i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>so I currently switched to feather brand blades and  very happy there much more shaper than derby and give a close nice shave</li>
            <li>Cuts great, great price, overall love this product.</li>
            <li>The first one I used was great , I even got 6 or more shaves out of it.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, do your skin a huge favor and buy these blades!</li>
            <li>I just wish it cut my whiskers better.</li>
            <li>What more?</li>
            <li>I, like many others, have purchased a Merkur DE Razor.  </li>
            <li>I needed to use more pressure than I was used to with the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>All in all, a worthwhile upgrade to Gillette platinum.</li>
            <li>So many people raved about these blades that I thought I would give them a go</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I found a better shave with the wilkinson sword blades I got from walmart.</li>
            <li>Going by the reviews, Feather blades are the top of the line, super-sharp and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>You can get many shaves for this baby.</li>
            <li>just get it  its a wayy better deal</li>
            <li>and youll get alot more blades</li>
            <li>make sure that derby is one of the samples.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be saving money and enjoying the shave a lot more.</li>
            <li>I used Feathers mostly (with Merkurs here and there) for a couple of years before trying the Derby Extras after my barber recommended them.</li>
            <li>Better then others I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a Merkur 180 razor and aerosol shave creme which seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite blade.  </li>
            <li>I bought a sample pack of different blades and found the Feathers blades worked best on my face.</li>
            <li>If you use double edge blades for any reason, this brand is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, its somewhat OK.</li>
            <li>Better than disposables.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple brands, and these ones seems to work the best for my skin.  </li>
            <li>These seem to handle my skin better, cause no irritation</li>
            <li>Love the Derby Blades.  </li>
            <li>This blade is well made and provides a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still able to see a gray shadow.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need more practice...</li>
            <li>Theses blades are OK.</li>
            <li>and you are able to have nick-free shaves.</li>
            <li>Most blades in the pack work</li>
            <li>Have so many now i have to worry about degrading.</li>
            <li>and I reaaly like this one more</li>
            <li>But then again, I cut myself more with the feather brand.  </li>
            <li>In the end, you just have to try different blades to know which one is best for you.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>I was more prepared this time.  </li>
            <li>These are infinitely better than the 7AM blades that came with my razor.</li>
            <li>If you can find a variety pack to find which blades work best for you, and these are included, definitely go for it.</li>
            <li>I now use feathers, which cost more, but are a sharper blade</li>
            <li>Ok for camping-out.  </li>
            <li>Razor I shaved with for most of my life.  </li>
            <li>The Astra blades glide through my hairs noticeably easier than the Derby blades, which have bit more tugging/pulling no matter</li>
            <li>The razor came with a Merkur Platinum blade which is a better seller on Amazon</li>
            <li>no matter how many passes I took.</li>
            <li>I had 3 more shaves with this razor.</li>
            <li>Simply the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite one..</li>
            <li>I have been receiving more nicks and cuts from these than the shark blades.</li>
            <li>I use top of the line products when I shave, so</li>
            <li>What more do you need?</li>
            <li>i tried seeral including astra, wilkinson sword, feather, and several others, these seemed to give me the best and cleanest shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Dorco 301 blades which give me a BBS shave and still find myself using them more.</li>
            <li>I get an OK shave, but nothing like I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m no expert</li>
            <li>my skin feels so much smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better at all of it, and so my shaves are better.</li>
            <li>It ended up causing a lot of irritation as I had to make more passes over those areas.  </li>
            <li>I still have 20 more Derbys</li>
            <li>My face is spot free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly better than the Wilkerson blades I&#x27;ve been using</li>
            <li>I too read many of the reviews trying to decide which blades to buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still way better than a disposable cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best bang for your buck you can get.</li>
            <li>Better than the merkur blade that came with my razor.</li>
            <li>I found that some razors are better than others in the 5 blade package.</li>
            <li>after reading the never ending opus of I Love Derby/</li>
            <li>those who Love Derby Blades sing their praises &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t make up for it by doing a better job</li>
            <li>Just feel that Feather is the better product.</li>
            <li>(read: sharper, more forgiving) blades out there at this price point.</li>
            <li>I also have to do more passes over my face with these blades</li>
            <li>it was more akin to \\&quot;Hacking\\&quot; vs shaving.</li>
            <li>,these make me wanna shave twice a day :)</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>The razor blades were surprisingly better</li>
            <li>One more to go</li>
            <li>Close even  shave, better that what I used to get with the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; style multi bladed razors.</li>
            <li>rebuy when these are up :)</li>
            <li>You might love them and you&#x27;ll have to shave with them to find out.</li>
            <li>Priced right, and packaged in lots of five with a disposable slot in the plastic case to take used blades safely, these blades are able to deliver a fine shave with good technique being used by the shaver.  </li>
            <li>These work pretty good</li>
            <li>My razor is a Merkur 180 long handle, this is the best blade I have used in my life!</li>
            <li>But i have to admit that the derby is a pretty good blade</li>
            <li>Pretty good razor blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still fairly new to safety razor shaving, but these blades seemed great to me.</li>
            <li>I can say they were a great deal, plus the shipping was fast and free.</li>
            <li>They also seem to be fairly durable, as I&#x27;ve gotten several good shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>more than two shaves with a merkur blade, but these are trucking through just fine.</li>
            <li>; (2) my beard is not overly coarse, though I do need to shave every day -- it seems to me that a person&#x27;s choice in razors is unique according to what works best for them.  </li>
            <li>The Derbys were more forgiving and comfortable for</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The shave was smooth and I got that satisfying scritch noise during shaving when you know your razor is giving you a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love these blades, they are smooth, still cut well</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the best bladesfor my extremely coarse facial hair but have great performance for the price.  </li>
            <li>I like these blades, seem to fit my face better than the Merkur blades did.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Combined with good soap the Derby Extra is a good cheap blade and shave&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li>As it happens, it was good that I chose to use it that day, as it provided a close, comfortable shave that served as a perfect baseline for comparison when my new Derby blades arrived two days later.</li>
            <li>The first shave I suffered razor burn but after an adjustment received a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>My favorite blade so far is the Shark Super Chrome which I can easily get 5 great</li>
            <li>The blades are great, but I think I lack the patience of using the safety razor properly :)</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I know I will be probably be using Derbys in some of my more aggressive razors as they give a smooth, close and comfortable</li>
            <li>, easy shaves with Derby blades.</li>
            <li>I put DE shaving with this Derby blade in rotation with my remaining costly fusion multiblades and some Gillette Good News disposables (which is a nice shaver in itself in my opinion) and have been shaving every day rotating with a different razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still fairly new at all this, and someday I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll move up to the world of an expensive Merkur Futur adjustable razor and Feather&#x27;s legendary samurai blades, but for the time being, Derby is a wonderful razor for any experience level.</li>
            <li>my first impressions is for the money a really nice shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through my first 5 pack of these blades, and I have to say that I just didn&#x27;t find them to be effective for me.  </li>
            <li>Derby&#x27;s appear to be pretty popular, so they were on the list to try.</li>
            <li>The Derby was the first blade I used that I liked.</li>
            <li>Good blade to start with if you are new.</li>
            <li>Not as good as feather in my opinion, but I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>They are not as aggressive as some others which may be good for those who are new to the art of shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>they do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite blades but very good none the less.  </li>
            <li>I remember my dad&#x27;s butterfly top razor when I was young and how interesting it was to watch him use it!</li>
            <li>This is a huge savings over what the \\&quot;Big\\&quot; razor companies want you to believe you need.</li>
            <li>I like how Smooth the blade is on my skin,  </li>
            <li>; they did not feel at all comfortable on my face.    </li>
            <li>i got a pack of 100+ a free stick of Arko shaving soap for like 12 dollers  </li>
            <li>These things are just so smooth its like your not even shaving</li>
            <li>then do yourself a huge favor and buy the 100 blades box.you will spend approx 11 cents a blade plus get a free arko shaving soap.</li>
            <li>However, no cut happened and I was free to carry on with my manly ritual.</li>
            <li>I could feel every stroke of the razor because the blade did not run across my beard in a smooth manner.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy these as my primary brand.</li>
            <li>The primary reason for my selection was price.</li>
            <li>These are a great deal in larger quantities.</li>
            <li>I started to enjoy shaving with my safety</li>
            <li>However since the blades are so cheap I just replaced the blade.</li>
            <li>So smooth and comfortable, no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>everyone is different, but for me these are some great razor blades.</li>
            <li>These blades are cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Of cours the Derbys are diet cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap, yes.</li>
            <li>They dont fit the razor.</li>
            <li>If they did fit they would cut your face all to pieces.</li>
            <li>RiMei razor is also available on</li>
            <li>To start off with the price blades are extremely cheap compared to Merkur, feather, shark chrome etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But they are cheap</li>
            <li>I touched my baby smooth face.  </li>
            <li>It is more visible than slightly-visible, but I would say it is good enough as I can go 2-3 days tops without needing a shave.</li>
            <li>I am giving one star because I have gotten one good blade out of four so far</li>
            <li>As of right now I think Feathers have given me the closest most irritation free shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m getting better at this, and I think I didn&#x27;t have the technique of whipping up a good shaving lather down before either.</li>
            <li>Like many people here, my first double-edge razor came with a free Merkur blade.</li>
            <li>My problem is that my skin is far from perfect and the Feathers tend to cut me to shreds, particularly in the first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>I love the sound of the sharp blade going against the grain, I love the smoothness, and I of course love how CHEAP it all is!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve just tried Feather in a Feather razor and my first impression is that they are a better blade than Derby.</li>
            <li>At first i thought it was me, so i just kept using the blade for another 2 weeks until it was more work</li>
            <li>The whole point of buying these old-school double edged blades is because they offer a better shave at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with both brands and will probably choose based upon bulk pricing, and so far the Derbys are the winner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried the \\&quot;Feathers\\&quot;, the original Merkur blades, Wilkenson Swords etc...</li>
            <li>This is a decent razor blade for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>This was a good set of blades for a pretty decent price.  </li>
            <li>The blade pulled at my hair, took many, many swipes to clear, and irritated under my chin.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the old fashioned razors better than any disposable and is completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>And the Astra Superior Platinum has been a fantastic daily shaver in all of my safety razors.</li>
            <li>Now I have to figure out how to clean blood from between the keys of my laptop.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a pack with my EJ DE89 and had thought they were pretty good but was eager to try &amp;#34;Some New Stuff!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Ever since starting to use these: I have not nicked myself once, experienced no razor burn, and most importantly the ingrown hairs have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li>I get more easy, good shaves with Derby blades, despite a subjective feeling that the Feather blades are actually somewhat sharper when new.</li>
            <li>Great blades works as expected.</li>
            <li>I get one good shave out of each blade and that is the second time I use it.</li>
            <li>What can I say they are double edged razor blades at a fair price,  bought them to use in a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>and you have to throw it away and hope you get a good one with the next blade you pull.  </li>
            <li>have taken the feather blades out of my rotation, and when my costly fusion multiblades run out, I will be left with the Gillette Good News disposables and the Derby razors.  </li>
            <li>but one blade is good for about 4 shaves (I don&#x27;t grow that much facial hair but have to shave every morning)</li>
            <li>As to most modern shaving choices, they always outcut electric razors, period.  </li>
            <li>like many was thought I was liberated by three bladed, four bladed and now five bladed shavers now with vibration, before I found out I, much of it is not needed and the five blade made me break out from the additional friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, it was good enough that halfway through the shave I told myself I&#x27;d go on Amazon immediately after to write a rave review.</li>
            <li>Give me the Derbys and a good double edge razor any day.</li>
            <li>Good buy especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Arrived early, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>These were only good for one shave each.</li>
            <li>I get more nicks with these blades and the shave doesn&#x27;t seem quite as close, although still much closer than &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged blades, individually wrapped and easy to dispense.  </li>
            <li>Best blade for my Edwin jagger de89!super slick shave!</li>
            <li>sharp works great.  </li>
            <li>Some blades are great and give 5-8 good smooth shaves, others are dull out of the wrapper, and still others are good on one side and dull on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great razors, very sharp and cut clean.</li>
            <li>The Derby Extra Double Edge razors work great for me!      </li>
            <li>Know this, Derby blades are mild shave blades</li>
            <li>I used a 60&#x27;s super speed with these.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is make sure and get more than one type of blade unless you know they work for your beard type.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>These blades were great to learn on because they are not terribly sharp so less chance of you hurting yourself as you are getting accustomed to this kind of shaving.  </li>
            <li>The verdict: for me, Derby blades are as good as, if not better than, Mach 3 blades; they give a nice, clean shave that is close but extremely gentle on the face -- no nicks, and no shaved-off skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 because even though the shave is nice, smooth and out perform&#x27;s my Norelco electric shaver, Gillette Mach 3 and any other cheap plastic razor</li>
            <li>Many peopl live their Derbys.</li>
            <li>However if you are taking off a full beard change your blade right after that.</li>
            <li>I first used it with the included Merkur blade, which was okay; I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot because of the learning curve that comes along with DE safety razors.</li>
            <li>I have confidence that if I stick to these blades, pretty soon I&#x27;ll be groping my own face in public just to admire how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>As you will read in many of the reviews, blades are a personal preference first and for most so do yourself a favor and buy a sample pack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades are great if you are new to safety razor shaving, but they are definitely not the sharpest blades out there</li>
            <li>Being new to wet shaving, I have purchased many different brands of blades to see which is the best for my face.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am in the I Love Derby Camp with my other Favorite Blades being Polsilver Super Iridium and Bic Chrome</li>
            <li>I have been useing these for a few months now and they work great.</li>
            <li>The Dreby gives me a closer shave quicker and rarely a nick.</li>
            <li>There was a complimentary sample of oil in the razor</li>
            <li>then it was worth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll honestly say this was my only mistake in switching to a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Double edged blades give the best shave short of a straight razor, or barber&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something lesser than the Feathers I had been loving.</li>
            <li>I got a better shave with the blade that came with my razor (a cheap Uxcell $5 razor purchased at the same time as these blades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to nick myself a lot, now I rarely if ever do.</li>
            <li>man is it worth it at 4$ for 25.</li>
            <li>On the upside, the blade does give a nice shave initially.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>Fresh out of the package they cut as well as</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>recommend the following for that perfect shave: use these blades(or any other double edge name brand) for your face except the triangle(nose to chin) where electric razors ARE superior, much faster and safer.  </li>
            <li>The Shark Super Chrome replaced Derby the first time I used one.</li>
            <li>I formerly used Feather blades, which are rightly considered excellent and incredibly sharp.</li>
            <li>This blade is good, but not as sharp as the Feather brand.  </li>
            <li>So I cleaned them up, and bought Derby blades due to the good reviews I read for it as a starter blade.  </li>
            <li>I tried one or two other ones and decided on these for the good deal.</li>
            <li>going to go ahead and use these since they do a fair job, but I&#x27;m looking forward to trying some other blades out.</li>
            <li>Ima white dude, 54 years, average beard, nice badger brush, good shave cream...</li>
            <li>Priced right, too.</li>
            <li>Shipping came right on time and Derby&#x27;s are always great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how my chin feels right now.</li>
            <li>Will revisit this review after I find the right combination that works for me.</li>
            <li>really shouldn&#x27;t give this product such a low rating, as it might work great for people with a light beard</li>
            <li>For my second shave, I went back to my Neutrogena Daily Defense for a pre-shave wash and got a superb shave from the Derby blade: close and smooth; no blood; no razor burn.</li>
            <li>If you have fine facial hair, this blade is probably good enough.</li>
            <li>Each was progressively better in that I cut myself less and my form became better, but the stubble still remained.</li>
            <li>Blade choice depends on the individual&#x27;s beard and a number of personal preferences, so results can vary greatly from shaver to shaver, but for the price, they are worth a try.</li>
            <li>I do know that the blades seem fairly good and sharp and I have not had any pulling/nicks after 4 days of using the first one.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a Merkur HD Classic based on stellar reviews, and bought a pack of these Derby&#x27;s because I sensed that on many shaving message boards they seemed to be the most positively mentioned blade.</li>
            <li>Even when I do the two rounds of shaving; one time going down, rinsing, re-lathering and then shaving against the grain I still do not get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>My first shave was less than perfect only because I decided to try the sample packet of Anthony pre shave oil that came with my order.</li>
            <li>Considering I was getting half of a good shave with the Mach 3</li>
            <li>, i dont have to go over the same spot more than twice, for sensitive skin, these are good, price is right too for the pack, i like to use them only twice</li>
            <li>so with 25 im good to go for a long time its better than paying 2.35 roughly per blade</li>
            <li>This blade will be very good for people who don&#x27;t have tough beards.</li>
            <li>I like both Feather and Bic blades very much.</li>
            <li>They stay sharp for a good 6-8 shaves and really do the job well in terms of closeness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Merkur - perhaps it was just a matter of fit with the razor, but this is the only blade that consistently felt skittish, the one I consistently nicked myself with the easiest, and the only one I got razor bumps on the very.</li>
            <li>I think the Derby is a good mid-grade blade as its sharper than some of the trial or dollar store blades but not sharp enough to hack youself up .  </li>
            <li>Figured my technique needed tobe fine tuned, or my speed slowed down and to become more deliberate.  </li>
            <li>Have used om more than one occasion for hobbies and projects-they last forever.</li>
            <li>I did better buying blades at my local supermarket.</li>
            <li>if i want a first opinion on a razor, I use this blade.</li>
            <li>These came with the 91R Parker Razor I purchased from Amazon, and were the first blades I used as a D/E shaver.</li>
            <li>Merkurs are smoother and overall my favorite.</li>
            <li>I try many different blades.</li>
            <li>These Derby blades are my first \\&quot;Safety Razor\\&quot; blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the first blade for a couple weeks now, and have not even flipped it over yet to use the underneath side.</li>
            <li>These blades are what came with my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>I made the switch to a DE safety razor and am using these blades as my first attempt</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with DE Safety Razors.  </li>
            <li>first.</li>
            <li>However blades are different for every shaved face (for the most part).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even remember when I first purchased these.</li>
            <li>ordered these blades along with my first ever safety razor.</li>
            <li>I used Shark when I first started shaving and gave these a try.</li>
            <li>I started with my dads old cheap 3 piece Gillette tech take apart razor.  </li>
            <li>Wow, fabulous.  </li>
            <li>First shave with the Feather, and I was bleeding.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to try that out first.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure these are going to be my standard.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>On top of that, they last longer.</li>
            <li>I got these when I first began shaving with a double-sided single-blade razor, but I have since upgraded to the sharper Feather brand of blades.</li>
            <li>recently acquired a Fatip Piccolo a razor I love but even with a forgiving Bic Chrome I found it to be aggressive.</li>
            <li>It cuts pretty well</li>
            <li>using de&#x27;s about 8 years, over that time I&#x27;ve tried dozen + top brands from different sampler packs.</li>
            <li>I finished shaving with a (first time try)</li>
            <li>when I used these in my RiMei razor with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap as the shaving soap in hot water, they would shave fantastically!!They</li>
            <li>Incidentally that was the first one I tried from the pack.</li>
            <li>My First Safety Razor Blades..</li>
            <li>I thought maybe the first one was a dud</li>
            <li>I have a good few Derbys (25 were in the order) along with the Wilkinsons (5) and Feathers (5)</li>
            <li>Then, when you get more comfortable with less nicking, grab the Feather Platinum Coated blades and learn to use those.</li>
            <li>For them, it is mild and so it will give you a close effective shave without much irritation and less chance of cuts or degree of the cut if you make mistakes in your techniques.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried some of the other blades out there yet to contrast and compare, but these blades gave me a nice close shave</li>
            <li>it must be said, but compared to the DE blades I&#x27;ve been purchasing from a big discount store chain and a local supermarket chain, these Derby Extras seem pretty good.  </li>
            <li>and they are nice and sharp 5 stars</li>
            <li>If you are shopping for a new blade these are worthy of consideration.</li>
            <li>I am still perfecting my technique, but my face was feeling great, especially after Geo Trumpers pink skin food was put on.  </li>
            <li>on first use I didnt have a good lather like I usually do but that didnt matter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them for a week, but am loving them so far.  </li>
            <li>and I (who have a thick graying stubble) am more than pleased</li>
            <li>Love how Smooth it is for me (female hair) and it cuts my hair down fine.</li>
            <li>and it DOES NOT cut any better nor smoother nor closer than the double edge single blade Derby, but costs a hell of a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>The Feather gave me a couple of excellent, sharp shaves but it became harsh after that.    </li>
            <li>Compared to the strange exotic brands you find in multi-blade sampler packs -</li>
            <li>Maybe once I am more comfortable with them I will try some of the more expensive ones to see if there is a difference</li>
            <li>They are very good blade, but not as sharp as the other brands of blades I have purchased on line.</li>
            <li>Nice blades, very sharp.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how better to say that this product is worth buying, other than to feel my cheek a year after purchasing...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t post a review on my first purchase of these, I didn&#x27;t think it was appropriate being new to the whole double edge razor thing.  </li>
            <li>The cheaper ones I have bought at Wal Mart or Krogers etc., shaved just as good but didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>The blade drags on certain parts of my face causing me to bleed</li>
            <li>Derby does wonderfully on that count, and Derbys are forgiving enough that you can press down quite a bit or do multiple passes if you really need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but for this low cost blade they seem to be just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure when I&#x27;m done sampling other blades, I&#x27;ll be purchasing the Derby brand exclusively.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other than these two, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with them.</li>
            <li>that are much more consistent and sharp.</li>
            <li>Each one is wrapped in wax paper and come in a handy little storage box.</li>
            <li>a beginner, this blade is probably good enough if you&#x27;re willing to change out your blades every day or every other day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to rate these fairly when I have nothing else to compare them to</li>
            <li>Blades are so dull that I can do better with my kitchen knife.&lt;br /&gt;Nobody will like them even for free.</li>
            <li>After two shaves with that blade I switched to the Derby Extra blades and it makes a huge difference (even for a novice like myself).</li>
            <li>Ive been shaving w/it for several wks nw &amp; enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Still, the Feather are much sharper.</li>
            <li>but these blades rip up my face and made me yearn for the days of my modern razor.  </li>
            <li>They were however very forgiving</li>
            <li>There are blades that are sharper, but many wet shaving vets will recommend these to start with.</li>
            <li>I bought a pack of 10 after reading his review, and they made for a much smoother and easier shave.  </li>
            <li>Second to none, you can feel the difference after a couple of shaves when it stays smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull at your hair like the Feather does.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the whole DE-shaving thing a try.</li>
            <li>the razor is solid, with a comfortable heft.</li>
            <li>I really like these blades.  </li>
            <li>(With the astra, eh... not so much.</li>
            <li>It probably is as close as I will get without taking the plunge and purchasing a straight blade &amp; strop.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned that I would purchase the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; blades for my face.  </li>
            <li>Florida is very humid.</li>
            <li>They are much safer to use, too.  </li>
            <li>and he is very knowledgable since he is on shaving forums etc.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to change the blade and pop a Derby in there just to see if the brand of the blade really does make a difference or if these DE shaving enthusiasts are just nuts.</li>
            <li>I think they work really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a straight razor shaver anymore</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>The shave was effortless and the finished product is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I stuck with these because they are very merciful and provide a close shave.</li>
            <li>However, your milage may very if you have a softer beard.</li>
            <li>So far between these blades and the Merkur&#x27;s that came with my razor, I definitely like these a lot more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just starting out with DE shaving, or if you&#x27;re an old pro who was never quite satisfied with off-brand blades, step up to Derby.</li>
            <li>Blades are very much an individual thing and using a review to purchase blades is not going to be as effective as buying a sampler pack of blades and just trying different ones out.     </li>
            <li>After going through about 5 blades, I can say these are by far better than my prior blades.  </li>
            <li>I get at least two good shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>These are the third brand I&#x27;ve tried since I got my own double edge</li>
            <li>They are priced at a pretty average price point and there are better</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as others but very smooth.</li>
            <li>Such impression was confirmed when, having used some other brands, I again tried a 7 AM blade just to make sure.</li>
            <li>Many users feel the same way: Derby makes a shaving blade that&#x27;s sharp, but so smooth that you might not even know you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>As far as the Derby blades go- the price is right.</li>
            <li>Feather blades cut me more than any other blade I tried.</li>
            <li>I seem to have more irritation with Derbys than with some other blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which leads me to the Derby DE  Blades - probably the most controversial blade out there - you either Love Them or Hate Them.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t need to try other blades after many reviews..</li>
            <li>its expensive, but almost everything in life that is good and far superior to the competition is more expensive, right?</li>
            <li>The main issue I had is that they really tugged on my whiskers rather than cut them.  </li>
            <li>if you end up loving the blade (usually because it works as well as many other blades and the cost/cheap price)</li>
            <li>Sharp, but not so sharp that they take a layer of face with the hair!&lt;br /&gt;No pulls or tugs, just a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>This has brought me back to using a safety razors and cost less than disposable razors and works just as good.</li>
            <li>After I shaved with these blades for the first time my face was completely covered in blood.  </li>
            <li>I have a full and dense beard and these simply won&#x27;t do shave it.</li>
            <li>They work fine, but aren&#x27;t all that sharp when you compare them to most other blades out there.</li>
            <li>The main thing they seemed to lack for me was smoothness.  </li>
            <li>I have the type of face that gets the classic 5-o&#x27;clock shadow, but with these I get a noon shadow.  </li>
            <li>YMMV, as I&#x27;ve heard that different blades work better for different people.</li>
            <li>I bought them for, and provide a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>With that said, these gave me a decent cut.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend these blades</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting a sampler pack and trying a bunch of blades to find what works for you.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this item, but when it comes to razor blades I would suggest you go elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these blades</li>
            <li>Wish I could get more than a few shaves out of each blade, but most likely I am not caring for the blades or prepping properly.  </li>
            <li>- Nice, sharp, and I can get several shaves out of them before I start getting razor bumps, hair tugging, or \\&quot;slips\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades dull quickly and easily</li>
            <li>Yesterday I went back and looked in my stash of DE Blades and thought I would revisit some blades I had written off - either due to lack of knowledge or popular</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>The good news on these is that they were extremely inexpensive, and I haven&#x27;t had any major mishaps when using them (i.e. no major cuts.)</li>
            <li>You must be careful, but you&#x27;re rewarded with that smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>fit in my razor as expected.</li>
            <li>I usually try to try as many different brands as possible, but don&#x27;t believe it can get much better than this either.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll tought it out hoping for a few more \\&quot;good\\&quot; blades</li>
            <li>a few more to try out in order to a bulk and 200 of these are 15$..</li>
            <li>If you are taking of stubble every or every other day they stay sharp for a good while.</li>
            <li>Derby Extra blades are OK, especially for beginners whose beards are not especially tough.</li>
            <li>These are NOT dull blades like most people with heavy beards say.</li>
            <li>Derby blades were recommended to me as a good \\&quot;starter\\&quot; blade, sharp enough to get a decent shave, but forgiving enough for shavers who are new to double-edge razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed those rules and I haven&#x27;t experienced any razor bumps or other irritation, even around the crease of my neck where I usually got irritation from the Fusion.    </li>
            <li>The second shave for me is usually pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Man, these blades are really sharp and so smooth</li>
            <li>This is good for people with sensitive skin or those that don&#x27;t have tough beards.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all despite being relativity new to to safety razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I don&#x27;t have a frame of reference to judge the quality of these blades.  </li>
            <li>Oh my god, thought my face was being ripped off with a brand new blade</li>
            <li>I use one per week, switching out to a new one every Monday.</li>
            <li>The urge to get my Mach 3 out and get closer shaves in a fraction of the time with no cuts started to become irresistible - I still had a brand new cartridge sitting in the drawer (that I had paid a fortune for).    </li>
            <li>To me, a new DE user, these have been a bit too aggressive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and was trying out a range of blades.</li>
            <li>I have newly returned to the world of DE shaving, having grown up with the practice and switching to multi-blades for decades.</li>
            <li>I received a pack of 5 with my new Edwin Jager DE razor .</li>
            <li>The first couple of blades worked fine and then the third blade was very rough.</li>
            <li>actually ended up mentally rating the razors based on how many shaves before they started feeling like the \\&quot;new\\&quot; merkur blades - and were, IMO , unusable since I&#x27;d start getting the razor bumps from my cartridge days.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different for what works best for them but don&#x27;t be afraid to try these.</li>
            <li>expensive than some more advanced blades out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They may work better for guys without fast thick beard growth.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had issues with razor burn and irritation.</li>
            <li>These blades may be fine for some people, but with safety razors you need to try a few different blades to find the right one.</li>
            <li>In any event, the last time I used a Feather blade, my face was pretty sore.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as sharp as feathers, but my skin definitely seems to react better to these blades.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased my second 25 count set, it&#x27;s been a year since that first set.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;m still an amateur at DE shaving and could make many improvements to my form.</li>
            <li>The Derbys have done a great job for me with only one pass of the razor, but as I said before, my beard is not as thick and coarse as some others may be.    </li>
            <li>This was the first DE blade I tried, and I don&#x27;t think I will need to look further!</li>
            <li>The fourth one worked OK on one side and not the other.</li>
            <li>Only nicked myself once first time shaving.</li>
            <li>It is nice to get them in bulk, and there is nothing wrong with the product (no crazy, warped blades that I have found thus far).</li>
            <li>I have pretty coarse facial hair and pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, many reviewers advised that those new to D/E shaving should begin with other, more \\&quot;forgiving\\&quot; (i.e., less sharp) blades.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin and normal beards they are fine, if a little bit aggressive.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I bought these honestly for the prices over the merkurs because the merkurs are pretty expensive.</li>
            <li>The price of these blades is right on, but they are not sharp enough for my liking.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, hold their edge for shave after shave and the price is definitely right!   </li>
            <li>That may be the only positive thing about this product, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>These have proved to be a major improvement from the high costs of cartridge razors and discomfort of the ingrown hair caused by my electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I should start off by saying that i have a very thick beard and this blade might be good enough for people with less hair or a light beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Obviously razor blades are largely a matter of preference but these Derby blades have been a godsend for me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be fine if you used a new blade each day, but there is other blades that are similarly priced</li>
            <li>A good blade for a beginner in the world of DE razors; sharp enough to start out with but not so sharp as to do permanent damage!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that in the future I eventually did end up purchasing a straight blade though.</li>
            <li>Of the three, I felt this had the most pull/ least cut feel of them all.      </li>
            <li>That about sums it up as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremly sensitive</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin</li>
            <li>- just wow.</li>
            <li>May have bled 3 times in 4 months with these Derby blades and the old Gillette superspeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far out my sample pack of blades</li>
            <li>I have very curly coarse AA hair</li>
            <li>Very affordable when bought in bulk online, each blade is individually wrapped in wax paper.</li>
            <li>The old cartridges can be used as an old sharps container.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and these things took it for a spin around the block.</li>
            <li>I do keep a old pill bottle on the bathroom counter to put the old blades in.</li>
            <li>These blades dulled incredibly fast, with them already tugging by my third use.  </li>
            <li>For the value they are totally worth buying for any wet shaver</li>
            <li>time will tell, but it&#x27;s worth the cash I spent.</li>
            <li>I purchased these as my first razor blades to go along with my first safety razor a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>This is only the third type of blade I&#x27;ve tried, so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I am not impressed with Derby but they are good price.</li>
            <li>Other people absolutely love Derby blades and after using several different blades with wildly varying reviews, I can appreciate that.</li>
            <li>So overall I gave these 4/5 stars, will try out some other blades before settling on one, but these are currently on the top of my list.</li>
            <li>Thus, while I didn&#x27;t have a bad impression of them, I didn&#x27;t really remember if they were good or merely decent.</li>
            <li>, it takes several passes and I never get that smooth feeling I get with other blades.</li>
            <li>will probably review the astra once I get better at wet shaving, but these razors are the place to start wet shaving!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many DE blades and I been using these quite a bit lately, tho not the sharpest they do hold a edge for several shaves, I get maybe 3 good shaves out of them and usually squeak another one out of it but its rough.</li>
            <li>Have to laugh at these commercials where they one up each other by the number of blades in a razor -</li>
            <li>to drawbacks, you have to buy a double-edged razor; they are significantly more likely to cut you than the aforementioned multi-level razors, because you have a single edge and not multi-blade&#x27;s smaller blades.  </li>
            <li>I went from enjoying my shaves to serious panic every time I got in the shower.    </li>
            <li>Even with the occasional nick, the shaves have been consistently close (except for the Merkur, I&#x27;d wake up the NEXT morning with a closer shave than I&#x27;d gotten out of some</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are reasonably sharp and with the right lather/soap should give no cuts/</li>
            <li>I know I can do better though, as some areas have far lesser shadow especially on the sides of my face, but the trouble spots are the goatee area and chin.     </li>
            <li>I swap the razor out every other week, and about ready to buy another set… The only concern that I have is that some of the imprints (brand name stamps) are very light on some razors, and very dark on others.</li>
            <li>No irritation, no drag, and it still felt as sharp after shaving my legs as it did at the first stroke!</li>
            <li>I am a young female (relatively new to the double-edged razor.)</li>
            <li>My facial hair is the type that has to be shave everyday since it grows very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not sure why they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
            <li>leave my face feeling soft and bare.</li>
            <li>But for a night of intimate contact, I&#x27;ll use a Wilkinson Sword or Astra in my Merkur HD Long Handle.</li>
            <li>At first use, I found them unsatisfactory; they seemed to drag on my face.</li>
            <li>and I had no major cuts and razor burn only on the first shave as I tried to get too close.</li>
            <li>They are PLENTY sharp enough but don&#x27;t seem to wear out as quick as the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Of the 3 derby blades I&#x27;ve gone through so far, I&#x27;d say the only real downside of this blade, and why I may end up trying others is that it seems to get dull rather quickly (about 5-6 shaves per blade)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge blade, pick up some of these and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered a new Merkur razor from Amazon, and purchased these blades to use with it.</li>
            <li>I was new to DE shaving and ordered these and a 5-pack from Feather to replace the generic blade that came with my handle.</li>
            <li>New to double edge razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Other things I like about them: they have markings so that you can tell which side is which, they are very reasonably priced, and they come in packs of 5 rather than 10 (like my grandfather used to buy &#x27;em).</li>
            <li>Simply put, if you have coarse hairs, this product will PULL your hairs very often.</li>
            <li>Of course, Derby Extras are very forgiving if you are just starting out with a double edge</li>
            <li>but try other sample blades/packs first.</li>
            <li>Not so sharp that you get razor burn, but sharp enough to give you a satisfying shave every time.</li>
            <li>they will slice you to ribbons if you&#x27;re not careful while installing but a boot-camp close shave is guaranteed!</li>
            <li>... before I switched to D/E shaving three months ago, I read tons of reviews on both D/E razors and blades, and regarding the latter I found that opinions vary widely: some will swear that Derby blades exemplify perfectly the adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;; that Derby blades are only moderately sharp to begin with, dull quickly, and/or drag on the face and cause tons of little nicks.    </li>
            <li>As far as Derby blades are concerned, for me they last long and give a decent shave.</li>
            <li>Fed-up with the high price of multi-blade razor cartridges, I recently decided to go back to an old-fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li>I got a variety pack of blades, these were neither the best or the worst, I would put them on the high end.</li>
            <li>Smooth gliding with no catching to speak of.  </li>
            <li>least these were cheap</li>
            <li>So far the Derby, Wilkinson and Merkur blade seem to be about the same, although I did use the Derby before I recieved my shaving oil.  </li>
            <li>I am a complete newbie to the double edge razor and these blades were my entry level purchase.</li>
            <li>a couple of months ago I recently received, from my mom, all my dads old Gillette DE razors from the 50&#x27;s 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still very carefull, but I&#x27;m speeding up now and haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts like I expected.</li>
            <li>Only DE blades I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li>I tried these hopeing to get them to last longer, I havent completely given up on the &amp;#34;straight razor&amp;#34; shave but</li>
            <li>No regrets, though...</li>
            <li>Then you are an unofficial professional of the double edged razor shaving club of the world.</li>
            <li>But like many, I&#x27;m not happy until I get baby-face bare.</li>
            <li>I am sure my technique was poor.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I feel confident blaming the Derby blades for my poor shaves.  </li>
            <li>Not very sharp.  </li>
            <li>I use my blades 4-5 times before I throw away the blade -- not because the blade is dull, but because I don&#x27;t want to press my luck with a dull blade and these are cheap enough that a work-week&#x27;s worth of use out of a single blade seems about right.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend for someone with thin or very fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li>If you new you really should try a sample pack and rotate through a few to see what works for you.</li>
            <li>The one shortcoming that really stands out is when I let my stubble grow for 5-6 days -- this will destroy a new Derby in one use.  </li>
            <li>But they certainly weren&#x27;t as sharp as the feathers.  </li>
            <li>: They&#x27;re quite sharp, noticeably sharper than Merkur but not as much as the Feather.</li>
            <li>Very pleased...they may not be as sharp as Feather but these are a fraction of the price and</li>
            <li>but they were a little to harsh (still better than those 3 bladed pieces of junk though)</li>
            <li>Worked well, not a single nick or cut yet.</li>
            <li>I shave daily or every other day, and my beard is average; not course or fine; I can grow a beard</li>
            <li>and I mean fast I can tell the difference between first and 2nd shave.</li>
            <li>Compared to what disposable cartridges cost, it it still cheaper to get stuck with a few bad blades in order to find your perfect one.</li>
            <li>Because of this I&#x27;ll likely buy from a licensed vendor in the near future.</li>
            <li>These blades are worth every penny spent instead of every dollar spent on the 5 blades.</li>
            <li>They are sharp to begin with and retain their sharpness thru at least 1/2 dozen shaves and even more.  </li>
            <li>yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But due to how many of these you get for such a small price, and the fact that while I still see hairs sometimes and I have to make several passes and get nicked in the process...</li>
            <li>I recently ditched the electric razor, and went back to the old double edge razor.</li>
            <li>In total, I&#x27;ve only used two blades: When I first bought the sampler and tried these first, disliked it after 3 shaves and threw the blade away, and the second one just the other day to see if maybe they&#x27;ll work again.</li>
            <li>I have gotten a much closer shave, with less irritation, than I ever got using those.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only begun to shave my old grey beard the old-fashioned way.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a Merkur long handled safety razor and embarked on the old fashioned shaving experience.</li>
            <li>how many passes I took or how hard I pressed down, but the Derby blade sliced through like butter and left nothing in its path.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feeling a little cocky, I decided to (what I thought would be a step up) buy some Feather blades, reading about how sharp and good they are, and put in rotation with the other 3 shaving practices I was using.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s the only blade to ever give me little nicks and drags in certain areas on my face.</li>
            <li>Shaving with a safety razor is a different game than shaving with a multi-blade razor -- you have to use a good shave cream, you can&#x27;t press as hard, you have to take your time, and you have to keep an eye on what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>

            <li> I am settled on these Derby blades as the best blade.  </li>

            <li> Happy shaving Gent&#x27;s !!</li>
            <li> Service from Amazon was excellent and has been every time I</li>
            <li> These blades seem to be the best for me, every person has their opinions but for me these seem to shave the best and they are some of the cheapest blades.</li>
            <li> and I was very happy with it</li>
            <li> The shave, however, was very good in spite of that.</li>
            <li> a very good price i think it was about .14 cents per blade</li>
            <li> The contrast between the two blades is incredible.  </li>
            <li> After switching though to these blades and the razor and using shave soap I get a great shave and my skin feels great!  </li>
            <li> The price point is excellent, and this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Get maybe 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade!</li>
            <li> They are good but not the best.</li>
            <li> These razors are a wonderful deal and I love them!</li>
            <li> These were a very good deal and seemed to be good</li>
            <li> 25 blades for 3.99 is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great blades.</li>
            <li> Great shave.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> What a great idea.</li>
            <li> I dont know how this product works for men because well... ive never been one (and never will lol)</li>
            <li> This is my brand!Derby makes really great blades I use them in my merkur</li>
            <li> I get 5-6 great shaves out of this razor.</li>
            <li> Happy shaves.</li>
            <li> Great buy at this price too.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it because of the attractive pricing.</li>
            <li> I ordered twenty five blades and they were packaged in 5&#x27;s which makes it great to share.  </li>
            <li> work great for my needs, and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li> They are a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> All things considered they are a great value.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for these razors.</li>
            <li> Irritation -- I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation from the blades.  </li>
            <li> and im a happy man.</li>
            <li> This blade is great.  </li>
            <li> I recommend these as a great value.</li>
            <li> I change the blade out once a week and never go without a great shave.</li>
            <li> however, on my neck its great.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re inexpensive, and they cut great.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a happy camper</li>
            <li> What can I say about these razor blades except that they shave my husband very nicely.</li>
            <li> Great Blades, as good as the pricier name brands.</li>
            <li> This is the best blade I have ever tried and it is also the most forgiving.</li>
            <li> In fact if I have anything good to say about the Derbys is that they made my technique better as I had to have the blade at the perfect angle to have any chance of trimming my whiskers</li>
            <li> These blades are good.</li>
            <li> it came with shark DE blades, they were good.</li>
            <li> They are a good all around blade for the beginner.</li>
            <li> Good blade.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s as good as the Merkur, just a lot cheaper.    </li>
            <li> Oil and lather seem to work really good together although I haven&#x27;t tried using just oil and doubt that I will.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a noticeably good difference using the oil with the lather though.  </li>
            <li> and I can never get a good shave on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Blades came swiftly as advertised, I can get a good shave with them.  </li>
            <li> These are good blades.</li>
            <li> If you just want some blades that you know will be good, Derby is not gonna disappoint.</li>
            <li> Good blades.  </li>
            <li> Good blades for the beginner or when returning to shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> How good was the shave?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for quite a while and managed to get my technique as good as I could to minimize the damage</li>
            <li> so I tried them and get a good shave with them.</li>
            <li> But they are good blades for the price.</li>
            <li> These are good razors and a good buy.  </li>
            <li> The razors give a good close shave.  </li>
            <li> The blades came quickly, fit nearly perfectly with my safety razor</li>
            <li> That seems a fair assessment, but I tried them anyways.</li>
            <li> Also good as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; blade t compare others against.</li>
            <li> For the price a good shave.  </li>
            <li> but it takes a couple of weeks to look good.</li>
            <li> These blades get the job done, but they are not as good as the Merkur blade that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li> Good value, though.</li>
            <li> blah blah blah etc... on a superior face :</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Astra Superior Platinum\\&quot; blade</li>
            <li> the Derby&#x27;s are superior.  </li>
            <li> These do a fairly good job and they are inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> My razor came with an Astra Superior Platinum blade</li>
            <li> Very good blades in my opinion ,gets the job done,for a smooth baby butt shave.</li>
            <li> Safety razor shaving as done a GREAT job at clearing most of those problems up.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with these razor blades.</li>
            <li> Good price for some nice blades.</li>
            <li> Again these may be the best for you, but before buying one brand in bulk you should buy a sample pack to find the right blade for your face.</li>
            <li> Safe to toss in the trash!</li>
            <li> Not the sharpest or the closest shave, but almost certainly the best value on the market.</li>
            <li> When it does its job, it does it AMAZINGLY well.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> but leave a lot of stubble still there, got to be honest</li>
            <li> They do have a used blades compartment which is nice.    </li>
            <li> though not quite perfectly on both sides - and holds the blades nice and straight while making it trivial to pop a blade in or out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will want an Alum block handy.</li>
            <li> Again, I think it has to do with what kind of beard you have, so you really have to feel it out and do what&#x27;s best for your own face.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to get 8-10 good shaves out of my Gillette Fusion, but those cartridges cost about $4 each, whereas a Derby blade is about $0.21 apiece.      </li>
            <li> but when I used a DE razor, I really liked this brand of blade.  </li>
            <li> It leaves me with a nice close shave</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t sit here and say my technique was perfect and it was all the blade, but I really do feel that way.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll take my own advice and look around for some blade sample packs now.  </li>
            <li> In fact,the rest of the blades were really nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave, both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I get more _good_</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> As the first reviewer stated, those new to D/E shaving would be best served by purchasing a blade variety pack, to see which brand works best for them.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great seller, Great product, Gotta buy a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> very pleased with purchase..will order a couple more derby razor blades... to stock up....</li>
            <li> This is the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> These blades are perfect for my beard type and give a super close shave that leaves my mug looking clean all day.</li>
            <li> great quality, shipped quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d try a pack yourself as it really a pretty good blade!.  </li>
            <li> very good quality containers also, certainly will but them again</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 on its best day would get almost everything but would still leave a bit of stubble on my chin, but right now it&#x27;s baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be more honest, it&#x27;s either shipping or not.</li>
            <li> To be honest I was looking for something that worked a bit better?.  </li>
            <li> When I note controversial -</li>
            <li> , so far, it has really impressed me.</li>
            <li> So far very happy with change to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; style shaving.</li>
            <li> We bought these for a Merkur Razor and while they are not as awesome as the original, for the very low price, they work great.</li>
            <li> They were super cheap, which also makes them good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades are great, I can use one about six or seven times, clean up easy, and my irritation is all but gone.</li>
            <li> i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> so I currently switched to feather brand blades and  very happy there much more shaper than derby and give a close nice shave</li>
            <li> Cuts great, great price, overall love this product.</li>
            <li> The first one I used was great , I even got 6 or more shaves out of it.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, do your skin a huge favor and buy these blades!</li>
            <li> I just wish it cut my whiskers better.</li>
            <li> What more?</li>
            <li> I, like many others, have purchased a Merkur DE Razor.  </li>
            <li> I needed to use more pressure than I was used to with the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> All in all, a worthwhile upgrade to Gillette platinum.</li>
            <li> So many people raved about these blades that I thought I would give them a go</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I found a better shave with the wilkinson sword blades I got from walmart.</li>
            <li> Going by the reviews, Feather blades are the top of the line, super-sharp and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> You can get many shaves for this baby.</li>
            <li> just get it  its a wayy better deal</li>
            <li> and youll get alot more blades</li>
            <li> make sure that derby is one of the samples.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be saving money and enjoying the shave a lot more.</li>
            <li> I used Feathers mostly (with Merkurs here and there) for a couple of years before trying the Derby Extras after my barber recommended them.</li>
            <li> Better then others I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a Merkur 180 razor and aerosol shave creme which seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite blade.  </li>
            <li> I bought a sample pack of different blades and found the Feathers blades worked best on my face.</li>
            <li> If you use double edge blades for any reason, this brand is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, its somewhat OK.</li>
            <li> Better than disposables.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands, and these ones seems to work the best for my skin.  </li>
            <li> These seem to handle my skin better, cause no irritation</li>
            <li> Love the Derby Blades.  </li>
            <li> This blade is well made and provides a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still able to see a gray shadow.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need more practice...</li>
            <li> Theses blades are OK.</li>
            <li> and you are able to have nick-free shaves.</li>
            <li> Most blades in the pack work</li>
            <li> Have so many now i have to worry about degrading.</li>
            <li> and I reaaly like this one more</li>
            <li> But then again, I cut myself more with the feather brand.  </li>
            <li> In the end, you just have to try different blades to know which one is best for you.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li> I was more prepared this time.  </li>
            <li> These are infinitely better than the 7AM blades that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> If you can find a variety pack to find which blades work best for you, and these are included, definitely go for it.</li>
            <li> I now use feathers, which cost more, but are a sharper blade</li>
            <li> Ok for camping-out.  </li>
            <li> Razor I shaved with for most of my life.  </li>
            <li> The Astra blades glide through my hairs noticeably easier than the Derby blades, which have bit more tugging/pulling no matter</li>
            <li> The razor came with a Merkur Platinum blade which is a better seller on Amazon</li>
            <li> no matter how many passes I took.</li>
            <li> I had 3 more shaves with this razor.</li>
            <li> Simply the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite one..</li>
            <li> I have been receiving more nicks and cuts from these than the shark blades.</li>
            <li> I use top of the line products when I shave, so</li>
            <li> What more do you need?</li>
            <li> i tried seeral including astra, wilkinson sword, feather, and several others, these seemed to give me the best and cleanest shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dorco 301 blades which give me a BBS shave and still find myself using them more.</li>
            <li> I get an OK shave, but nothing like I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m no expert</li>
            <li> my skin feels so much smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better at all of it, and so my shaves are better.</li>
            <li> It ended up causing a lot of irritation as I had to make more passes over those areas.  </li>
            <li> I still have 20 more Derbys</li>
            <li> My face is spot free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly better than the Wilkerson blades I&#x27;ve been using</li>
            <li> I too read many of the reviews trying to decide which blades to buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still way better than a disposable cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the best bang for your buck you can get.</li>
            <li> Better than the merkur blade that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> I found that some razors are better than others in the 5 blade package.</li>
            <li> after reading the never ending opus of I Love Derby/</li>
            <li> those who Love Derby Blades sing their praises &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t make up for it by doing a better job</li>
            <li> Just feel that Feather is the better product.</li>
            <li> (read: sharper, more forgiving) blades out there at this price point.</li>
            <li> I also have to do more passes over my face with these blades</li>
            <li> it was more akin to \\&quot;Hacking\\&quot; vs shaving.</li>
            <li> ,these make me wanna shave twice a day :)</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> The razor blades were surprisingly better</li>
            <li> One more to go</li>
            <li> Close even  shave, better that what I used to get with the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; style multi bladed razors.</li>
            <li> rebuy when these are up :)</li>
            <li> You might love them and you&#x27;ll have to shave with them to find out.</li>
            <li> Priced right, and packaged in lots of five with a disposable slot in the plastic case to take used blades safely, these blades are able to deliver a fine shave with good technique being used by the shaver.  </li>
            <li> These work pretty good</li>
            <li> My razor is a Merkur 180 long handle, this is the best blade I have used in my life!</li>
            <li> But i have to admit that the derby is a pretty good blade</li>
            <li> Pretty good razor blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fairly new to safety razor shaving, but these blades seemed great to me.</li>
            <li> I can say they were a great deal, plus the shipping was fast and free.</li>
            <li> They also seem to be fairly durable, as I&#x27;ve gotten several good shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> more than two shaves with a merkur blade, but these are trucking through just fine.</li>
            <li> ; (2) my beard is not overly coarse, though I do need to shave every day -- it seems to me that a person&#x27;s choice in razors is unique according to what works best for them.  </li>
            <li> The Derbys were more forgiving and comfortable for</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The shave was smooth and I got that satisfying scritch noise during shaving when you know your razor is giving you a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love these blades, they are smooth, still cut well</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best bladesfor my extremely coarse facial hair but have great performance for the price.  </li>
            <li> I like these blades, seem to fit my face better than the Merkur blades did.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Combined with good soap the Derby Extra is a good cheap blade and shave&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li> As it happens, it was good that I chose to use it that day, as it provided a close, comfortable shave that served as a perfect baseline for comparison when my new Derby blades arrived two days later.</li>
            <li> The first shave I suffered razor burn but after an adjustment received a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> My favorite blade so far is the Shark Super Chrome which I can easily get 5 great</li>
            <li> The blades are great, but I think I lack the patience of using the safety razor properly :)</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I know I will be probably be using Derbys in some of my more aggressive razors as they give a smooth, close and comfortable</li>
            <li> , easy shaves with Derby blades.</li>
            <li> I put DE shaving with this Derby blade in rotation with my remaining costly fusion multiblades and some Gillette Good News disposables (which is a nice shaver in itself in my opinion) and have been shaving every day rotating with a different razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still fairly new at all this, and someday I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll move up to the world of an expensive Merkur Futur adjustable razor and Feather&#x27;s legendary samurai blades, but for the time being, Derby is a wonderful razor for any experience level.</li>
            <li> my first impressions is for the money a really nice shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through my first 5 pack of these blades, and I have to say that I just didn&#x27;t find them to be effective for me.  </li>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s appear to be pretty popular, so they were on the list to try.</li>
            <li> The Derby was the first blade I used that I liked.</li>
            <li> Good blade to start with if you are new.</li>
            <li> Not as good as feather in my opinion, but I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> They are not as aggressive as some others which may be good for those who are new to the art of shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> they do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite blades but very good none the less.  </li>
            <li> I remember my dad&#x27;s butterfly top razor when I was young and how interesting it was to watch him use it!</li>
            <li> This is a huge savings over what the \\&quot;Big\\&quot; razor companies want you to believe you need.</li>
            <li> I like how Smooth the blade is on my skin,  </li>
            <li> ; they did not feel at all comfortable on my face.    </li>
            <li> i got a pack of 100+ a free stick of Arko shaving soap for like 12 dollers  </li>
            <li> These things are just so smooth its like your not even shaving</li>
            <li> then do yourself a huge favor and buy the 100 blades box.you will spend approx 11 cents a blade plus get a free arko shaving soap.</li>
            <li> However, no cut happened and I was free to carry on with my manly ritual.</li>
            <li> I could feel every stroke of the razor because the blade did not run across my beard in a smooth manner.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy these as my primary brand.</li>
            <li> The primary reason for my selection was price.</li>
            <li> These are a great deal in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> I started to enjoy shaving with my safety</li>
            <li> However since the blades are so cheap I just replaced the blade.</li>
            <li> So smooth and comfortable, no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> everyone is different, but for me these are some great razor blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Of cours the Derbys are diet cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap, yes.</li>
            <li> They dont fit the razor.</li>
            <li> If they did fit they would cut your face all to pieces.</li>
            <li> RiMei razor is also available on</li>
            <li> To start off with the price blades are extremely cheap compared to Merkur, feather, shark chrome etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they are cheap</li>
            <li> I touched my baby smooth face.  </li>
            <li> It is more visible than slightly-visible, but I would say it is good enough as I can go 2-3 days tops without needing a shave.</li>
            <li> I am giving one star because I have gotten one good blade out of four so far</li>
            <li> As of right now I think Feathers have given me the closest most irritation free shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m getting better at this, and I think I didn&#x27;t have the technique of whipping up a good shaving lather down before either.</li>
            <li> Like many people here, my first double-edge razor came with a free Merkur blade.</li>
            <li> My problem is that my skin is far from perfect and the Feathers tend to cut me to shreds, particularly in the first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I love the sound of the sharp blade going against the grain, I love the smoothness, and I of course love how CHEAP it all is!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve just tried Feather in a Feather razor and my first impression is that they are a better blade than Derby.</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was me, so i just kept using the blade for another 2 weeks until it was more work</li>
            <li> The whole point of buying these old-school double edged blades is because they offer a better shave at a great price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with both brands and will probably choose based upon bulk pricing, and so far the Derbys are the winner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried the \\&quot;Feathers\\&quot;, the original Merkur blades, Wilkenson Swords etc...</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor blade for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> This was a good set of blades for a pretty decent price.  </li>
            <li> The blade pulled at my hair, took many, many swipes to clear, and irritated under my chin.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the old fashioned razors better than any disposable and is completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> And the Astra Superior Platinum has been a fantastic daily shaver in all of my safety razors.</li>
            <li> Now I have to figure out how to clean blood from between the keys of my laptop.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a pack with my EJ DE89 and had thought they were pretty good but was eager to try &amp;#34;Some New Stuff!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ever since starting to use these: I have not nicked myself once, experienced no razor burn, and most importantly the ingrown hairs have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li> I get more easy, good shaves with Derby blades, despite a subjective feeling that the Feather blades are actually somewhat sharper when new.</li>
            <li> Great blades works as expected.</li>
            <li> I get one good shave out of each blade and that is the second time I use it.</li>
            <li> What can I say they are double edged razor blades at a fair price,  bought them to use in a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> and you have to throw it away and hope you get a good one with the next blade you pull.  </li>
            <li> have taken the feather blades out of my rotation, and when my costly fusion multiblades run out, I will be left with the Gillette Good News disposables and the Derby razors.  </li>
            <li> but one blade is good for about 4 shaves (I don&#x27;t grow that much facial hair but have to shave every morning)</li>
            <li> As to most modern shaving choices, they always outcut electric razors, period.  </li>
            <li> like many was thought I was liberated by three bladed, four bladed and now five bladed shavers now with vibration, before I found out I, much of it is not needed and the five blade made me break out from the additional friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, it was good enough that halfway through the shave I told myself I&#x27;d go on Amazon immediately after to write a rave review.</li>
            <li> Give me the Derbys and a good double edge razor any day.</li>
            <li> Good buy especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Arrived early, nice packaging.</li>
            <li> These were only good for one shave each.</li>
            <li> I get more nicks with these blades and the shave doesn&#x27;t seem quite as close, although still much closer than &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged blades, individually wrapped and easy to dispense.  </li>
            <li> Best blade for my Edwin jagger de89!super slick shave!</li>
            <li> sharp works great.  </li>
            <li> Some blades are great and give 5-8 good smooth shaves, others are dull out of the wrapper, and still others are good on one side and dull on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great razors, very sharp and cut clean.</li>
            <li> The Derby Extra Double Edge razors work great for me!      </li>
            <li> Know this, Derby blades are mild shave blades</li>
            <li> I used a 60&#x27;s super speed with these.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is make sure and get more than one type of blade unless you know they work for your beard type.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> These blades were great to learn on because they are not terribly sharp so less chance of you hurting yourself as you are getting accustomed to this kind of shaving.  </li>
            <li> The verdict: for me, Derby blades are as good as, if not better than, Mach 3 blades; they give a nice, clean shave that is close but extremely gentle on the face -- no nicks, and no shaved-off skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because even though the shave is nice, smooth and out perform&#x27;s my Norelco electric shaver, Gillette Mach 3 and any other cheap plastic razor</li>
            <li> Many peopl live their Derbys.</li>
            <li> However if you are taking off a full beard change your blade right after that.</li>
            <li> I first used it with the included Merkur blade, which was okay; I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot because of the learning curve that comes along with DE safety razors.</li>
            <li> I have confidence that if I stick to these blades, pretty soon I&#x27;ll be groping my own face in public just to admire how smooth it is.</li>
            <li> As you will read in many of the reviews, blades are a personal preference first and for most so do yourself a favor and buy a sample pack.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades are great if you are new to safety razor shaving, but they are definitely not the sharpest blades out there</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving, I have purchased many different brands of blades to see which is the best for my face.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am in the I Love Derby Camp with my other Favorite Blades being Polsilver Super Iridium and Bic Chrome</li>
            <li> I have been useing these for a few months now and they work great.</li>
            <li> The Dreby gives me a closer shave quicker and rarely a nick.</li>
            <li> There was a complimentary sample of oil in the razor</li>
            <li> then it was worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll honestly say this was my only mistake in switching to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Double edged blades give the best shave short of a straight razor, or barber&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something lesser than the Feathers I had been loving.</li>
            <li> I got a better shave with the blade that came with my razor (a cheap Uxcell $5 razor purchased at the same time as these blades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to nick myself a lot, now I rarely if ever do.</li>
            <li> man is it worth it at 4$ for 25.</li>
            <li> On the upside, the blade does give a nice shave initially.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.</li>
            <li> Fresh out of the package they cut as well as</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> recommend the following for that perfect shave: use these blades(or any other double edge name brand) for your face except the triangle(nose to chin) where electric razors ARE superior, much faster and safer.  </li>
            <li> The Shark Super Chrome replaced Derby the first time I used one.</li>
            <li> I formerly used Feather blades, which are rightly considered excellent and incredibly sharp.</li>
            <li> This blade is good, but not as sharp as the Feather brand.  </li>
            <li> So I cleaned them up, and bought Derby blades due to the good reviews I read for it as a starter blade.  </li>
            <li> I tried one or two other ones and decided on these for the good deal.</li>
            <li> going to go ahead and use these since they do a fair job, but I&#x27;m looking forward to trying some other blades out.</li>
            <li> Ima white dude, 54 years, average beard, nice badger brush, good shave cream...</li>
            <li> Priced right, too.</li>
            <li> Shipping came right on time and Derby&#x27;s are always great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how my chin feels right now.</li>
            <li> Will revisit this review after I find the right combination that works for me.</li>
            <li> really shouldn&#x27;t give this product such a low rating, as it might work great for people with a light beard</li>
            <li> For my second shave, I went back to my Neutrogena Daily Defense for a pre-shave wash and got a superb shave from the Derby blade: close and smooth; no blood; no razor burn.</li>
            <li> If you have fine facial hair, this blade is probably good enough.</li>
            <li> Each was progressively better in that I cut myself less and my form became better, but the stubble still remained.</li>
            <li> Blade choice depends on the individual&#x27;s beard and a number of personal preferences, so results can vary greatly from shaver to shaver, but for the price, they are worth a try.</li>
            <li> I do know that the blades seem fairly good and sharp and I have not had any pulling/nicks after 4 days of using the first one.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Merkur HD Classic based on stellar reviews, and bought a pack of these Derby&#x27;s because I sensed that on many shaving message boards they seemed to be the most positively mentioned blade.</li>
            <li> Even when I do the two rounds of shaving; one time going down, rinsing, re-lathering and then shaving against the grain I still do not get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> My first shave was less than perfect only because I decided to try the sample packet of Anthony pre shave oil that came with my order.</li>
            <li> Considering I was getting half of a good shave with the Mach 3</li>
            <li> , i dont have to go over the same spot more than twice, for sensitive skin, these are good, price is right too for the pack, i like to use them only twice</li>
            <li> so with 25 im good to go for a long time its better than paying 2.35 roughly per blade</li>
            <li> This blade will be very good for people who don&#x27;t have tough beards.</li>
            <li> I like both Feather and Bic blades very much.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for a good 6-8 shaves and really do the job well in terms of closeness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Merkur - perhaps it was just a matter of fit with the razor, but this is the only blade that consistently felt skittish, the one I consistently nicked myself with the easiest, and the only one I got razor bumps on the very.</li>
            <li> I think the Derby is a good mid-grade blade as its sharper than some of the trial or dollar store blades but not sharp enough to hack youself up .  </li>
            <li> Figured my technique needed tobe fine tuned, or my speed slowed down and to become more deliberate.  </li>
            <li> Have used om more than one occasion for hobbies and projects-they last forever.</li>
            <li> I did better buying blades at my local supermarket.</li>
            <li> if i want a first opinion on a razor, I use this blade.</li>
            <li> These came with the 91R Parker Razor I purchased from Amazon, and were the first blades I used as a D/E shaver.</li>
            <li> Merkurs are smoother and overall my favorite.</li>
            <li> I try many different blades.</li>
            <li> These Derby blades are my first \\&quot;Safety Razor\\&quot; blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the first blade for a couple weeks now, and have not even flipped it over yet to use the underneath side.</li>
            <li> These blades are what came with my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to a DE safety razor and am using these blades as my first attempt</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with DE Safety Razors.  </li>
            <li> first.</li>
            <li> However blades are different for every shaved face (for the most part).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember when I first purchased these.</li>
            <li> ordered these blades along with my first ever safety razor.</li>
            <li> I used Shark when I first started shaving and gave these a try.</li>
            <li> I started with my dads old cheap 3 piece Gillette tech take apart razor.  </li>
            <li> Wow, fabulous.  </li>
            <li> First shave with the Feather, and I was bleeding.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try that out first.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure these are going to be my standard.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> On top of that, they last longer.</li>
            <li> I got these when I first began shaving with a double-sided single-blade razor, but I have since upgraded to the sharper Feather brand of blades.</li>
            <li> recently acquired a Fatip Piccolo a razor I love but even with a forgiving Bic Chrome I found it to be aggressive.</li>
            <li> It cuts pretty well</li>
            <li> using de&#x27;s about 8 years, over that time I&#x27;ve tried dozen + top brands from different sampler packs.</li>
            <li> I finished shaving with a (first time try)</li>
            <li> when I used these in my RiMei razor with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap as the shaving soap in hot water, they would shave fantastically!!They</li>
            <li> Incidentally that was the first one I tried from the pack.</li>
            <li> My First Safety Razor Blades..</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the first one was a dud</li>
            <li> I have a good few Derbys (25 were in the order) along with the Wilkinsons (5) and Feathers (5)</li>
            <li> Then, when you get more comfortable with less nicking, grab the Feather Platinum Coated blades and learn to use those.</li>
            <li> For them, it is mild and so it will give you a close effective shave without much irritation and less chance of cuts or degree of the cut if you make mistakes in your techniques.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried some of the other blades out there yet to contrast and compare, but these blades gave me a nice close shave</li>
            <li> it must be said, but compared to the DE blades I&#x27;ve been purchasing from a big discount store chain and a local supermarket chain, these Derby Extras seem pretty good.  </li>
            <li> and they are nice and sharp 5 stars</li>
            <li> If you are shopping for a new blade these are worthy of consideration.</li>
            <li> I am still perfecting my technique, but my face was feeling great, especially after Geo Trumpers pink skin food was put on.  </li>
            <li> on first use I didnt have a good lather like I usually do but that didnt matter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them for a week, but am loving them so far.  </li>
            <li> and I (who have a thick graying stubble) am more than pleased</li>
            <li> Love how Smooth it is for me (female hair) and it cuts my hair down fine.</li>
            <li> and it DOES NOT cut any better nor smoother nor closer than the double edge single blade Derby, but costs a hell of a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> The Feather gave me a couple of excellent, sharp shaves but it became harsh after that.    </li>
            <li> Compared to the strange exotic brands you find in multi-blade sampler packs -</li>
            <li> Maybe once I am more comfortable with them I will try some of the more expensive ones to see if there is a difference</li>
            <li> They are very good blade, but not as sharp as the other brands of blades I have purchased on line.</li>
            <li> Nice blades, very sharp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how better to say that this product is worth buying, other than to feel my cheek a year after purchasing...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t post a review on my first purchase of these, I didn&#x27;t think it was appropriate being new to the whole double edge razor thing.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper ones I have bought at Wal Mart or Krogers etc., shaved just as good but didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The blade drags on certain parts of my face causing me to bleed</li>
            <li> Derby does wonderfully on that count, and Derbys are forgiving enough that you can press down quite a bit or do multiple passes if you really need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for this low cost blade they seem to be just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure when I&#x27;m done sampling other blades, I&#x27;ll be purchasing the Derby brand exclusively.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other than these two, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with them.</li>
            <li> that are much more consistent and sharp.</li>
            <li> Each one is wrapped in wax paper and come in a handy little storage box.</li>
            <li> a beginner, this blade is probably good enough if you&#x27;re willing to change out your blades every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate these fairly when I have nothing else to compare them to</li>
            <li> Blades are so dull that I can do better with my kitchen knife.&lt;br /&gt;Nobody will like them even for free.</li>
            <li> After two shaves with that blade I switched to the Derby Extra blades and it makes a huge difference (even for a novice like myself).</li>
            <li> Ive been shaving w/it for several wks nw &amp; enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Still, the Feather are much sharper.</li>
            <li> but these blades rip up my face and made me yearn for the days of my modern razor.  </li>
            <li> They were however very forgiving</li>
            <li> There are blades that are sharper, but many wet shaving vets will recommend these to start with.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of 10 after reading his review, and they made for a much smoother and easier shave.  </li>
            <li> Second to none, you can feel the difference after a couple of shaves when it stays smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull at your hair like the Feather does.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the whole DE-shaving thing a try.</li>
            <li> the razor is solid, with a comfortable heft.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades.  </li>
            <li> (With the astra, eh... not so much.</li>
            <li> It probably is as close as I will get without taking the plunge and purchasing a straight blade &amp; strop.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned that I would purchase the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; blades for my face.  </li>
            <li> Florida is very humid.</li>
            <li> They are much safer to use, too.  </li>
            <li> and he is very knowledgable since he is on shaving forums etc.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to change the blade and pop a Derby in there just to see if the brand of the blade really does make a difference or if these DE shaving enthusiasts are just nuts.</li>
            <li> I think they work really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a straight razor shaver anymore</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> The shave was effortless and the finished product is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I stuck with these because they are very merciful and provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> However, your milage may very if you have a softer beard.</li>
            <li> So far between these blades and the Merkur&#x27;s that came with my razor, I definitely like these a lot more.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting out with DE shaving, or if you&#x27;re an old pro who was never quite satisfied with off-brand blades, step up to Derby.</li>
            <li> Blades are very much an individual thing and using a review to purchase blades is not going to be as effective as buying a sampler pack of blades and just trying different ones out.     </li>
            <li> After going through about 5 blades, I can say these are by far better than my prior blades.  </li>
            <li> I get at least two good shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> These are the third brand I&#x27;ve tried since I got my own double edge</li>
            <li> They are priced at a pretty average price point and there are better</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as others but very smooth.</li>
            <li> Such impression was confirmed when, having used some other brands, I again tried a 7 AM blade just to make sure.</li>
            <li> Many users feel the same way: Derby makes a shaving blade that&#x27;s sharp, but so smooth that you might not even know you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> As far as the Derby blades go- the price is right.</li>
            <li> Feather blades cut me more than any other blade I tried.</li>
            <li> I seem to have more irritation with Derbys than with some other blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which leads me to the Derby DE  Blades - probably the most controversial blade out there - you either Love Them or Hate Them.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t need to try other blades after many reviews..</li>
            <li> its expensive, but almost everything in life that is good and far superior to the competition is more expensive, right?</li>
            <li> The main issue I had is that they really tugged on my whiskers rather than cut them.  </li>
            <li> if you end up loving the blade (usually because it works as well as many other blades and the cost/cheap price)</li>
            <li> Sharp, but not so sharp that they take a layer of face with the hair!&lt;br /&gt;No pulls or tugs, just a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> This has brought me back to using a safety razors and cost less than disposable razors and works just as good.</li>
            <li> After I shaved with these blades for the first time my face was completely covered in blood.  </li>
            <li> I have a full and dense beard and these simply won&#x27;t do shave it.</li>
            <li> They work fine, but aren&#x27;t all that sharp when you compare them to most other blades out there.</li>
            <li> The main thing they seemed to lack for me was smoothness.  </li>
            <li> I have the type of face that gets the classic 5-o&#x27;clock shadow, but with these I get a noon shadow.  </li>
            <li> YMMV, as I&#x27;ve heard that different blades work better for different people.</li>
            <li> I bought them for, and provide a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> With that said, these gave me a decent cut.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend these blades</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting a sampler pack and trying a bunch of blades to find what works for you.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item, but when it comes to razor blades I would suggest you go elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend these blades</li>
            <li> Wish I could get more than a few shaves out of each blade, but most likely I am not caring for the blades or prepping properly.  </li>
            <li> - Nice, sharp, and I can get several shaves out of them before I start getting razor bumps, hair tugging, or \\&quot;slips\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades dull quickly and easily</li>
            <li> Yesterday I went back and looked in my stash of DE Blades and thought I would revisit some blades I had written off - either due to lack of knowledge or popular</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> The good news on these is that they were extremely inexpensive, and I haven&#x27;t had any major mishaps when using them (i.e. no major cuts.)</li>
            <li> You must be careful, but you&#x27;re rewarded with that smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> fit in my razor as expected.</li>
            <li> I usually try to try as many different brands as possible, but don&#x27;t believe it can get much better than this either.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll tought it out hoping for a few more \\&quot;good\\&quot; blades</li>
            <li> a few more to try out in order to a bulk and 200 of these are 15$..</li>
            <li> If you are taking of stubble every or every other day they stay sharp for a good while.</li>
            <li> Derby Extra blades are OK, especially for beginners whose beards are not especially tough.</li>
            <li> These are NOT dull blades like most people with heavy beards say.</li>
            <li> Derby blades were recommended to me as a good \\&quot;starter\\&quot; blade, sharp enough to get a decent shave, but forgiving enough for shavers who are new to double-edge razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed those rules and I haven&#x27;t experienced any razor bumps or other irritation, even around the crease of my neck where I usually got irritation from the Fusion.    </li>
            <li> The second shave for me is usually pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Man, these blades are really sharp and so smooth</li>
            <li> This is good for people with sensitive skin or those that don&#x27;t have tough beards.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all despite being relativity new to to safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I don&#x27;t have a frame of reference to judge the quality of these blades.  </li>
            <li> Oh my god, thought my face was being ripped off with a brand new blade</li>
            <li> I use one per week, switching out to a new one every Monday.</li>
            <li> The urge to get my Mach 3 out and get closer shaves in a fraction of the time with no cuts started to become irresistible - I still had a brand new cartridge sitting in the drawer (that I had paid a fortune for).    </li>
            <li> To me, a new DE user, these have been a bit too aggressive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and was trying out a range of blades.</li>
            <li> I have newly returned to the world of DE shaving, having grown up with the practice and switching to multi-blades for decades.</li>
            <li> I received a pack of 5 with my new Edwin Jager DE razor .</li>
            <li> The first couple of blades worked fine and then the third blade was very rough.</li>
            <li> actually ended up mentally rating the razors based on how many shaves before they started feeling like the \\&quot;new\\&quot; merkur blades - and were, IMO , unusable since I&#x27;d start getting the razor bumps from my cartridge days.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different for what works best for them but don&#x27;t be afraid to try these.</li>
            <li> expensive than some more advanced blades out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They may work better for guys without fast thick beard growth.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had issues with razor burn and irritation.</li>
            <li> These blades may be fine for some people, but with safety razors you need to try a few different blades to find the right one.</li>
            <li> In any event, the last time I used a Feather blade, my face was pretty sore.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as sharp as feathers, but my skin definitely seems to react better to these blades.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased my second 25 count set, it&#x27;s been a year since that first set.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;m still an amateur at DE shaving and could make many improvements to my form.</li>
            <li> The Derbys have done a great job for me with only one pass of the razor, but as I said before, my beard is not as thick and coarse as some others may be.    </li>
            <li> This was the first DE blade I tried, and I don&#x27;t think I will need to look further!</li>
            <li> The fourth one worked OK on one side and not the other.</li>
            <li> Only nicked myself once first time shaving.</li>
            <li> It is nice to get them in bulk, and there is nothing wrong with the product (no crazy, warped blades that I have found thus far).</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse facial hair and pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, many reviewers advised that those new to D/E shaving should begin with other, more \\&quot;forgiving\\&quot; (i.e., less sharp) blades.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin and normal beards they are fine, if a little bit aggressive.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I bought these honestly for the prices over the merkurs because the merkurs are pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> The price of these blades is right on, but they are not sharp enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, hold their edge for shave after shave and the price is definitely right!   </li>
            <li> That may be the only positive thing about this product, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These have proved to be a major improvement from the high costs of cartridge razors and discomfort of the ingrown hair caused by my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I should start off by saying that i have a very thick beard and this blade might be good enough for people with less hair or a light beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Obviously razor blades are largely a matter of preference but these Derby blades have been a godsend for me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d be fine if you used a new blade each day, but there is other blades that are similarly priced</li>
            <li> A good blade for a beginner in the world of DE razors; sharp enough to start out with but not so sharp as to do permanent damage!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that in the future I eventually did end up purchasing a straight blade though.</li>
            <li> Of the three, I felt this had the most pull/ least cut feel of them all.      </li>
            <li> That about sums it up as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremly sensitive</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin</li>
            <li> - just wow.</li>
            <li> May have bled 3 times in 4 months with these Derby blades and the old Gillette superspeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far out my sample pack of blades</li>
            <li> I have very curly coarse AA hair</li>
            <li> Very affordable when bought in bulk online, each blade is individually wrapped in wax paper.</li>
            <li> The old cartridges can be used as an old sharps container.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and these things took it for a spin around the block.</li>
            <li> I do keep a old pill bottle on the bathroom counter to put the old blades in.</li>
            <li> These blades dulled incredibly fast, with them already tugging by my third use.  </li>
            <li> For the value they are totally worth buying for any wet shaver</li>
            <li> time will tell, but it&#x27;s worth the cash I spent.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as my first razor blades to go along with my first safety razor a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> This is only the third type of blade I&#x27;ve tried, so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with Derby but they are good price.</li>
            <li> Other people absolutely love Derby blades and after using several different blades with wildly varying reviews, I can appreciate that.</li>
            <li> So overall I gave these 4/5 stars, will try out some other blades before settling on one, but these are currently on the top of my list.</li>
            <li> Thus, while I didn&#x27;t have a bad impression of them, I didn&#x27;t really remember if they were good or merely decent.</li>
            <li> , it takes several passes and I never get that smooth feeling I get with other blades.</li>
            <li> will probably review the astra once I get better at wet shaving, but these razors are the place to start wet shaving!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many DE blades and I been using these quite a bit lately, tho not the sharpest they do hold a edge for several shaves, I get maybe 3 good shaves out of them and usually squeak another one out of it but its rough.</li>
            <li> Have to laugh at these commercials where they one up each other by the number of blades in a razor -</li>
            <li> to drawbacks, you have to buy a double-edged razor; they are significantly more likely to cut you than the aforementioned multi-level razors, because you have a single edge and not multi-blade&#x27;s smaller blades.  </li>
            <li> I went from enjoying my shaves to serious panic every time I got in the shower.    </li>
            <li> Even with the occasional nick, the shaves have been consistently close (except for the Merkur, I&#x27;d wake up the NEXT morning with a closer shave than I&#x27;d gotten out of some</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are reasonably sharp and with the right lather/soap should give no cuts/</li>
            <li> I know I can do better though, as some areas have far lesser shadow especially on the sides of my face, but the trouble spots are the goatee area and chin.     </li>
            <li> I swap the razor out every other week, and about ready to buy another set… The only concern that I have is that some of the imprints (brand name stamps) are very light on some razors, and very dark on others.</li>
            <li> No irritation, no drag, and it still felt as sharp after shaving my legs as it did at the first stroke!</li>
            <li> I am a young female (relatively new to the double-edged razor.)</li>
            <li> My facial hair is the type that has to be shave everyday since it grows very quickly.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
            <li> leave my face feeling soft and bare.</li>
            <li> But for a night of intimate contact, I&#x27;ll use a Wilkinson Sword or Astra in my Merkur HD Long Handle.</li>
            <li> At first use, I found them unsatisfactory; they seemed to drag on my face.</li>
            <li> and I had no major cuts and razor burn only on the first shave as I tried to get too close.</li>
            <li> They are PLENTY sharp enough but don&#x27;t seem to wear out as quick as the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Of the 3 derby blades I&#x27;ve gone through so far, I&#x27;d say the only real downside of this blade, and why I may end up trying others is that it seems to get dull rather quickly (about 5-6 shaves per blade)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge blade, pick up some of these and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a new Merkur razor from Amazon, and purchased these blades to use with it.</li>
            <li> I was new to DE shaving and ordered these and a 5-pack from Feather to replace the generic blade that came with my handle.</li>
            <li> New to double edge razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Other things I like about them: they have markings so that you can tell which side is which, they are very reasonably priced, and they come in packs of 5 rather than 10 (like my grandfather used to buy &#x27;em).</li>
            <li> Simply put, if you have coarse hairs, this product will PULL your hairs very often.</li>
            <li> Of course, Derby Extras are very forgiving if you are just starting out with a double edge</li>
            <li> but try other sample blades/packs first.</li>
            <li> Not so sharp that you get razor burn, but sharp enough to give you a satisfying shave every time.</li>
            <li> they will slice you to ribbons if you&#x27;re not careful while installing but a boot-camp close shave is guaranteed!</li>
            <li> ... before I switched to D/E shaving three months ago, I read tons of reviews on both D/E razors and blades, and regarding the latter I found that opinions vary widely: some will swear that Derby blades exemplify perfectly the adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;; that Derby blades are only moderately sharp to begin with, dull quickly, and/or drag on the face and cause tons of little nicks.    </li>
            <li> As far as Derby blades are concerned, for me they last long and give a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Fed-up with the high price of multi-blade razor cartridges, I recently decided to go back to an old-fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li> I got a variety pack of blades, these were neither the best or the worst, I would put them on the high end.</li>
            <li> Smooth gliding with no catching to speak of.  </li>
            <li> least these were cheap</li>
            <li> So far the Derby, Wilkinson and Merkur blade seem to be about the same, although I did use the Derby before I recieved my shaving oil.  </li>
            <li> I am a complete newbie to the double edge razor and these blades were my entry level purchase.</li>
            <li> a couple of months ago I recently received, from my mom, all my dads old Gillette DE razors from the 50&#x27;s 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still very carefull, but I&#x27;m speeding up now and haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts like I expected.</li>
            <li> Only DE blades I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li> I tried these hopeing to get them to last longer, I havent completely given up on the &amp;#34;straight razor&amp;#34; shave but</li>
            <li> No regrets, though...</li>
            <li> Then you are an unofficial professional of the double edged razor shaving club of the world.</li>
            <li> But like many, I&#x27;m not happy until I get baby-face bare.</li>
            <li> I am sure my technique was poor.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I feel confident blaming the Derby blades for my poor shaves.  </li>
            <li> Not very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I use my blades 4-5 times before I throw away the blade -- not because the blade is dull, but because I don&#x27;t want to press my luck with a dull blade and these are cheap enough that a work-week&#x27;s worth of use out of a single blade seems about right.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend for someone with thin or very fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li> If you new you really should try a sample pack and rotate through a few to see what works for you.</li>
            <li> The one shortcoming that really stands out is when I let my stubble grow for 5-6 days -- this will destroy a new Derby in one use.  </li>
            <li> But they certainly weren&#x27;t as sharp as the feathers.  </li>
            <li> : They&#x27;re quite sharp, noticeably sharper than Merkur but not as much as the Feather.</li>
            <li> Very pleased...they may not be as sharp as Feather but these are a fraction of the price and</li>
            <li> but they were a little to harsh (still better than those 3 bladed pieces of junk though)</li>
            <li> Worked well, not a single nick or cut yet.</li>
            <li> I shave daily or every other day, and my beard is average; not course or fine; I can grow a beard</li>
            <li> and I mean fast I can tell the difference between first and 2nd shave.</li>
            <li> Compared to what disposable cartridges cost, it it still cheaper to get stuck with a few bad blades in order to find your perfect one.</li>
            <li> Because of this I&#x27;ll likely buy from a licensed vendor in the near future.</li>
            <li> These blades are worth every penny spent instead of every dollar spent on the 5 blades.</li>
            <li> They are sharp to begin with and retain their sharpness thru at least 1/2 dozen shaves and even more.  </li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But due to how many of these you get for such a small price, and the fact that while I still see hairs sometimes and I have to make several passes and get nicked in the process...</li>
            <li> I recently ditched the electric razor, and went back to the old double edge razor.</li>
            <li> In total, I&#x27;ve only used two blades: When I first bought the sampler and tried these first, disliked it after 3 shaves and threw the blade away, and the second one just the other day to see if maybe they&#x27;ll work again.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a much closer shave, with less irritation, than I ever got using those.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only begun to shave my old grey beard the old-fashioned way.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Merkur long handled safety razor and embarked on the old fashioned shaving experience.</li>
            <li> how many passes I took or how hard I pressed down, but the Derby blade sliced through like butter and left nothing in its path.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feeling a little cocky, I decided to (what I thought would be a step up) buy some Feather blades, reading about how sharp and good they are, and put in rotation with the other 3 shaving practices I was using.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s the only blade to ever give me little nicks and drags in certain areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a safety razor is a different game than shaving with a multi-blade razor -- you have to use a good shave cream, you can&#x27;t press as hard, you have to take your time, and you have to keep an eye on what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li> I use the Art of Shaving system, and found these blades work better when I use a thin wet coat of lather .I</li>
            <li> My beard grows pretty thick and is pretty stiff by the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Having nothing left but Feather, SHARP, and 7 AM blades, I used my old Mach 3.</li>
            <li> They are not of very high quality and produce dragging and pulling, which would mean they were not sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp stainless steel, made in Turkey, and are sharper than Astra but not as sharp as Wilkinson Sword blades, IMO.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor for a few years now mainly to save money on razor blades</li>
            <li> They dull after the first shave, and even on that one they will cut your face up.  </li>
            <li> I even went online and bought new blades to replace them after only using a few packs out of the 30 or so packs I bought.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and usually get little spots of blood when shaving with the merkurs, but not with these.</li>
            <li> I have had one that wasn&#x27;t sharpened on one side, effectively making my DE half useless.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to shaving, and a few weeks ago I bought a Merkur 34C.</li>
            <li> Derby extras gave me a far smoother shave, with less irritation than the platinum de blades.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few different brands from Walgreen&#x27;s and Walmart and these out preform them by far.  </li>
            <li> After trying for a few times, I went back to my regular Gillette Sword (although more expensive).</li>
            <li> Although I was a beginner at double edged razor shaving, I was certainly not a beginner at wet shaving and expected decent, not great results on my first shave.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little sensitive.  </li>
            <li> For me Astra are more reliable and Feather, while somewhat dangerous, give the closest shaves.</li>
            <li> I eventually took so many passes that I was bleeding like crazy, my skin was swiss cheese, but still the stubble hadn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> The blades seem to last about 3 shaved on average and i am now buying the 100ct packs which last me about a year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Start wet shaving with a Double Edge razor and tell those Plastic Razor guys to take a hike.</li>
            <li> , I lather up my face well, keep it wet as much as possible</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s taken me way too long to write this review.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for several months</li>
            <li> I am almost hesitant to review these blades and tell potential buyers how my experience was, because after reading the reviews on them, I am apparently one of the few that these blades don&#x27;t agree with.</li>
            <li> I have some thick beard on my chin and its an ABSOLUTE pain to use this product.</li>
            <li> Yes the price is right, but if you have a tough beard buy the Feather blades.    </li>
            <li> I subsequently bought a pack of Merkurs and only have to shave my face once (up and down), as opposed to three + go rounds with the Derbies.</li>
            <li> However, after getting my technique down I decided to try some Astra blades that were generally reviewed as being a bit sharper than Derbys.  </li>
            <li> But maybe I just havent mastered the technique of shaving yet because after my second pass, even 3rd pass, I&#x27;ll still see the black dots - the tips of hair in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat thin, soft beard and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have is that they do not last as long as some of the other brands that I have tried (I get 2, maybe 3 shaves out of these)</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades shave as nicely as other brands I&#x27;ve used and last equally long.  </li>
            <li> These seem to compare to Dorcos and not as sharp as Astras but last longer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp enough to get the job done, but still forgiving.</li>
            <li> : They come in 5s instead of 10s like the other two razors mentioned, and each razor is individually wrapped in wax paper.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to try a blade other than I find locally.  </li>
            <li> I know all the double edged razors work a little differently based on sharpness or thickness.</li>
            <li> I have a medium thickness beard, and it seems they just weren&#x27;t sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> The other blades I have are generic ones I got at a drugstore.  </li>
            <li> would encourage all of you who can keep an open mind do a little experimenting and try or retry the Derby DE Blades in different Razors.</li>
            <li> the feathers did on the second or third cut, that is they pulled a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I have only used 2 of the blades for 3 shaves each as I&#x27;m testing 8 other kinds.</li>
            <li> Although the Mach 3 cartridges are prohibitively expensive and quick to dull,  they are gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I rinse the blades well and towel dry them.</li>
            <li> So I would say for any older men out there who have a thick beard to NOT get this product.  </li>
            <li> At least for me, these are just a little too dull and pull more than they cut.</li>
            <li> but I really have to say that this blade is NO GOOD.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t harsh like Feathers though and last twice as long.</li>
            <li> I moved up and next tried dads black handled superspeed non adjustable, with these Derby blades.  </li>
            <li> I can always go back to the black handled superspeed</li>
            <li> The packaging of the blades is smaller than traditional methods and generates less waste.  </li>
            <li> They are a little softer than you would expect and sometimes you need a double pass.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 20 years old, and though I have a beard the hair still does not grow in very thickly.  </li>
            <li> There is a reason that Americans quit using the single blade razor and that is due to the fact that it hacks and cuts your face all over the place.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as bad a shave as many report.</li>
            <li> But obviously these are MUCH cheaper than big-name but lame \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later, and bleeding profusely from a dozen points, I was wondering whether it was just the manufacturer&#x27;s fault or if I was that hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades are generally a personal preference and YMMV, but for the price I would definitely suggest giving these a go if you&#x27;re not happy with your current blade.</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT for heavy beards...</li>
            <li> I had been using Mitchells Wool Fat shaving soap for over a year, so I also bought some of Geo Trumper pink coral skin food, and decided to try DE shaving again.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different blades, i.e., Derby, Shark, etc.  </li>
            <li> the drop in sharpness is minimal.</li>
            <li> Forget about a second pass without reapplying cream to get a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or coarse facial hair, you will likely be unhappy with these blades.</li>
            <li> However, after a few days, since I had 4 blades left, I thought of giving them another try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and shave only at night, so I get around three shaves with blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid as much as $.79/blade with other brands (never mind the nonsense of several dollars per cartridge, if one chooses that extremely expensive method).  </li>
            <li> I found the Derbys to be very stiff and not a sharp as the Astra Blades.  </li>
            <li> Merkur is slightly sharper but allows you to have less tugging and more cutting through.</li>
            <li> For the performance:I have lighter than average beard growth and shave daily, I only get 4 shaves per Derby blade before it is rendered dull.</li>
            <li> Blades weren&#x27;t as sharp as I expected,  but got jib done.  </li>
            <li> They provide a close shave and have stayed sharp longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Will use the ones I have up and try some other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed this advice, and sampled a Feather blade about two weeks after I&#x27;d started D/E shaving, at which point I found them too sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say they \\&quot;nicked\\&quot; me, rather they gave such a close shave as to shave skin along with hair.     </li>
            <li> Derby is truly razor sharp-</li>
            <li> This was to ensure that impressions I had weren&#x27;t just due to being a tyro.</li>
            <li> due to the blade</li>
            <li> the second Derby was no better</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with safety razors to know how that stacks up to other types of blades, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other blades in the past, but, in terms of quality and comfort, I settles on Derby Extra.</li>
            <li> For me they are useless, a person with a lighter growth may like these and the lower price and rate it higher.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and seem to hold their edge.  </li>
            <li> They seem reasonably sharp to me.  </li>
            <li> Once I try other blades, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and cut the stubble.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely sharp and dependable, and the shave I&#x27;ve received by using them is unrivaled.</li>
            <li> I shave my face every day and my head every other day and a blade lasts about a week.  </li>
            <li> And I get small sections on my face that I have to go over several times</li>
            <li> and i do agree with other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> These razors are not really consistent.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other blades (Merkur, Shark, Feather, etc.)</li>
            <li> These are a lot sharper than other blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> then other blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are reasonably sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp, long-lasting DE blades.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a tough beard, and being new to DE shaving</li>
            <li> A little rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I will change anyones buying habits, but I will give my experiences, for what they are worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was a little leary starting DE shaving again, as I tried DE shaving about 9 years and scared my wife!  </li>
            <li> I only get 1 or 2 shaves before dull but</li>
            <li> only comparison I can make to these is to the multi-blade plastic cartridge type razors commonly seen on television advertisements.</li>
            <li> I gave up on the shave and went back to my cartridge razors until i visited my dad a few weeks later and asked him what i&#x27;m doing wrong (he has been using a safety razor as long as i remember)He told me to change blades and gave me some of his feather blades.</li>
            <li> Derby blades last at least four days for me.  </li>
            <li> It ended up to be a rough and choppy shave.</li>
            <li> Derby didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Other then the little nicks and cuts on my neck(which happens no matter what.)</li>
            <li> Blades were sharp and shave is close with little irritation.</li>
            <li> but thought I&#x27;d try a few other brands out.  </li>
            <li> I think they give a closer shave than either of my previous \\&quot;brands\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard so perhaps this blade might be good for someone with a tender beard or someone who is very fearful of getting cut</li>
            <li> I have way less nicks with the Derby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I get less nicks and a smoother shave, with still no irritation.</li>
            <li> With these blades I have much less nicking</li>
            <li> My facial hair is very tough, especially around the chin, and this thing tugged and pulled a bit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard and only shave every few days since my beard growth isn&#x27;t crazy fast either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think at first they were cutting til</li>
            <li> My current blade worked well on one side but not the other leading me to suspect poor quality control or \\&quot;seconds.\\</li>
            <li> They are giving me a tight shave.  </li>
            <li> I get little to no razor burn also.</li>
            <li> I offer this review with a few disclaimers: (1) I&#x27;m new to the game, and these are my first razor blades I&#x27;m trying, so I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of Derby blades compared with Feathers, Sharks, etc.</li>
            <li> A couple of nicks that I&#x27;ll call my fault but very close and no bleeding that wasn&#x27;t immediately staunched by cold water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few times when I knew I pushed on the razor, and had to stop in fear of getting a cut.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a starter blades in a 25 pack as I sampled a few brands.</li>
            <li> If you have a fairly heavy whiskers than this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have cut myself a few times, but I think that would happen no matter what.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a close shave if I shave after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard as well.&lt;br /&gt;However,</li>
            <li> You may end up using them as the blades for everyday shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have quite a few brands to try...</li>
            <li> so I tried a second blade, but this one was even worse and seemed to have an issue with bending uniformly in my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These Derby blades are about half the price of the Merkur blades, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they just don&#x27;t seem sharp enough -</li>
            <li> Least sharp blade according to [...]  </li>
            <li> Ineffective, extremely irritating, and useless after the first shave.</li>
            <li> After consulting with my banker for the purchase of very expensive additional blades for my Gillette Fusion with power steering and brakes, a friend coerced me into going back to the Double edge</li>
            <li> Had a 3 day growth to tame but couldn&#x27;t even manage to finish both sides with this crappy blade...</li>
            <li> I had tried dozens of different brands to no avail, I tried shaving less often, I tried expensive creams and aftershaves...</li>
            <li> /&gt;August 2012 I ordered these blades from another vendor (100 pack) and have not had a bad blade in the first 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Still just as bad as when I first tried them.</li>
            <li> Not sure how that happened without getting a few hairs along the way.  </li>
            <li> I had a 5 O-clock shadow by noon each day and the blades just dragged across my face hardly cutting the hair with a new blade.</li>
            <li> They are about half as thick as Merkurs</li>
            <li> I can recommend at least a half dozen blades I prefer to Derby (which I used for years)</li>
            <li> When your all done, wrap a little duct tape over it to keep the blades tucked away, and voila!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they don&#x27;t work with my skin</li>
            <li> I didnt soak my face like I usually do</li>
            <li> Placed the rest in a small tupperware bowl with a decedent to stop moisture and seal the lid.</li>
            <li> I usually swap out every two days or two uses.</li>
            <li> I recently switched over to a safety razor after being fed up with tossing out absurd amounts of money for replacement cartridges on my Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I gave the Derbys a 4 out of 5, not because there is anything wrong with these blades, but because I have nothing to compare it to --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a small pack of these for a novice, maybe a 5-10 count, then look for something sharper if you feel you need it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re beard is thick, heavy, or the whiskers are like wire</li>
            <li> Pulls a bit when I shave around my chin, but not sure I can blame the blade for that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i&#x27;m not sure how that compares to others.</li>
            <li> However I have very thick stubble and these blades are not that sharp compared to Shark or Feather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the bad these blades DULL fast</li>
            <li> One thing I got confused on was I ordered these blades at an average price of 16 cents per blade, and no shipping, but a $1 tax got included, bringing the price to 20 cents per blade.</li>
            <li> I started off with this razor, and then moved on to the astras.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the astra razors, this is very tame and forgiving.</li>
            <li> For the price these blades are hard to beat.</li>
            <li> These blades are almost too dull to use.</li>
            <li> It feels dull in the beginning, but you get used to it</li>
            <li> Again, I haven&#x27;t tested out the market for razor blades yet, but by no means would I say the Derbys are dull or even \\&quot;not sharp.\\</li>
            <li> , i feel after two times it gets dull.</li>
            <li> am giving these blades a rating of 4 since there was one dull blade in the pack.</li>
            <li> This manufacturer has created a dull blade that tuggs and pulls on longer beard stubble.</li>
            <li> ; - to the polar opposite of those Who Hate Derby Blades -writing them off as &amp;#34;Garbage,</li>
            <li> but then you get one that really sucks</li>
            <li> have shaved at least 10 times now and the&lt;br /&gt;blade is sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair be warned that this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> THose problems are slowly dissipating.</li>
            <li> I mean just that.</li>
            <li> Feathers are closer and less irritating but still irritating sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I was very frustrated with this first experience and began to wonder if this was just how shaving with a safety razor was.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as replacements for some less expensive blades.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that the shave wasn&#x27;t even decent, it was very poor compared to be Mach 3 shaves</li>
            <li> Nicer, sharper, and not really more expensive.</li>
            <li> No more expensive and fancy cartridges for me.</li>
            <li> They are very dull.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard either.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend for a beginner or someone with thin growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly converting my friends to DE shaving, and without fail I will always recommend Derby blades as a starter pack.</li>
            <li> (although the tugging for me was worse).  </li>
            <li> Not great</li>
            <li> paper thin and damaging to the skin.</li>
            <li> SHARP -- Not as bad as the 7 AM blades, but unsatisfactory</li>
            <li> /&gt;But being disgusted with high cost of multiblades refill (fusion),</li>
            <li> The Derby blades are by far the worst blades I have used since I changed to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it still leaves a five o&#x27;clock shadow that is visible.</li>
            <li> Through out my two weeks i kept reviewing youtube videos to see what i was doing wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> And at this price, you cannot go wrong.     </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s up to 5 blades in one expensive razor blade</li>
            <li> Ill be buying these from now on.</li>
            <li> I Hate Derby Blade Reviews and watching a few videos -</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this, but after using Feathers brand... these are not even in contention.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with the rest of &#x27;em since I hate the idea of throwing them away.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh or brutal on your face.  </li>
            <li> This was a terrible experience as the blades would pull on my beard and the shave was not very clean.</li>
            <li> I was a bloody mess, and she almost dialed 911!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>

            <li> Could have been a bad batch, so</li>
            <li> That said, my experience has been bad.</li>
            <li> Day two, the tugging was so bad that I switched blades mid-shave...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too bad in the cuts and nicks department.  </li>
            <li> They also outshave the expensive multi-level razors sold for outrageous prices.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> and I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable shave and very bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> Can get a close shave with these without your face getting nicked up or bloody.</li>
            <li> After using them up, I switched to Swordson razors (Walmart) and absolutely hated them.</li>
            <li> What I found is that the quality control is very bad.  </li>
            <li> I got a terrible shave with lots of tugging at my beard.  </li>

            <li> I like how Smooth the blade is on my skin,  I just wish it cut my whiskers better.</li>
            <li> These blades are good. I used to shave with an electric razor and the 5 blade type on too. Other then the little nicks and cuts on my neck(which happens no matter what.) I they do the job just fine. I get little to no razor burn also. You can not beat the price too. 25 blades for 3.99 is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great Blades, as good as the pricier name brands. Have used om more than one occasion for hobbies and projects-they last forever.</li>
            <li> Ive been shaving w/it for several wks nw &amp; enjoy it. I can&#x27;t tell the difference from my Mock 3. Now I&#x27;m nw reordering for my Barber Shop</li>
            <li> Great blades. Great shave. Great price. What more? The back of the container the blades come in can be used to store your used blades. When your all done, wrap a little duct tape over it to keep the blades tucked away, and voila! Safe to toss in the trash! What a great idea. I will definitely continue using these blades!</li>
            <li> I, like many others, have purchased a Merkur DE Razor.  I bought the Derby blades to compare to Feather and the Merkur blade supplied with my razor.  Of the three, I felt this had the most pull/ least cut feel of them all.      Yes the price is right, but if you have a tough beard buy the Feather blades.    I am updating my review.  I have upgraded them to 3stars for the price/cut.  I needed to use more pressure than I was used to with the Feather blades. Still, the Feather are much sharper.</li>
            <li> Ineffective, extremely irritating, and useless after the first shave. That about sums it up as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I did better buying blades at my local supermarket.</li>
            <li> these are my go to razor blades as a beginner! if i want a first opinion on a razor, I use this blade. Love how Smooth it is for me (female hair) and it cuts my hair down fine. I dont know how this product works for men because well... ive never been one (and never will lol) so men out there? you may want to disreguard my review unless buying for others? idk. i like these blades.</li>
            <li> So far between these blades and the Merkur&#x27;s that came with my razor, I definitely like these a lot more. I haven&#x27;t tried some of the other blades out there yet to contrast and compare, but these blades gave me a nice close shave and I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all despite being relativity new to to safety razors.  Of the 3 derby blades I&#x27;ve gone through so far, I&#x27;d say the only real downside of this blade, and why I may end up trying others is that it seems to get dull rather quickly (about 5-6 shaves per blade) and I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard either.  So overall I gave these 4/5 stars, will try out some other blades before settling on one, but these are currently on the top of my list.</li>
            <li> Derby extras gave me a far smoother shave, with less irritation than the platinum de blades.  They made me pay closer attention to my technique, especially on my neck where I can&#x27;t seem to keep a consistant blade angle to save my life.  All in all, a worthwhile upgrade to Gillette platinum.</li>
            <li> So many people raved about these blades that I thought I would give them a go, well not so impressed, the shave okay but leave a lot of stubble still there, got to be honest I found a better shave with the wilkinson sword blades I got from walmart. I admit everyone should try as they may find it a different experience as me, that&#x27;s why I tried them but no not so impressed. Will use the ones I have up and try some other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and used with a Merkur 180 razor.</li>
            <li> When I recently switched to a double edge razor, I was given 3-10 packs of the Merkur blades. That lasted me about 30 weeks as I replace a blade a week. This is a huge savings over what the \\&quot;Big\\&quot; razor companies want you to believe you need. These Derby blades are about half the price of the Merkur blades, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference! They still last about a week for me. Definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> ... before I switched to D/E shaving three months ago, I read tons of reviews on both D/E razors and blades, and regarding the latter I found that opinions vary widely: some will swear that Derby blades exemplify perfectly the adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;; that Derby blades are only moderately sharp to begin with, dull quickly, and/or drag on the face and cause tons of little nicks.    As the first reviewer stated, those new to D/E shaving would be best served by purchasing a blade variety pack, to see which brand works best for them. I myself sampled several different brands, such as:    1)  7 AM -- These came with the 91R Parker Razor I purchased from Amazon, and were the first blades I used as a D/E shaver. At first use, I found them unsatisfactory; they seemed to drag on my face. Such impression was confirmed when, having used some other brands, I again tried a 7 AM blade just to make sure. An unqualified thumbs-down.    2)  SHARP -- Not as bad as the 7 AM blades, but unsatisfactory; they did not feel at all comfortable on my face.    3)  Feather -- Going by the reviews, Feather blades are the top of the line, super-sharp and long-lasting. However, many reviewers advised that those new to D/E shaving should begin with other, more \\&quot;forgiving\\&quot; (i.e., less sharp) blades. I followed this advice, and sampled a Feather blade about two weeks after I&#x27;d started D/E shaving, at which point I found them too sharp. Around a week ago, after about two-and-a-half months of D/E shaving, I gave Feather another try and reached the same verdict:  Feather blades cut me more than any other blade I tried. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say they \\&quot;nicked\\&quot; me, rather they gave such a close shave as to shave skin along with hair.     4)  Derby -- I only had five of these, and used them when I&#x27;d just begun D/E shaving. Thus, while I didn&#x27;t have a bad impression of them, I didn&#x27;t really remember if they were good or merely decent. In any event, the last time I used a Feather blade, my face was pretty sore. Having nothing left but Feather, SHARP, and 7 AM blades, I used my old Mach 3. Although the Mach 3 cartridges are prohibitively expensive and quick to dull,  they are gentle on my skin. As it happens, it was good that I chose to use it that day, as it provided a close, comfortable shave that served as a perfect baseline for comparison when my new Derby blades arrived two days later. The verdict: for me, Derby blades are as good as, if not better than, Mach 3 blades; they give a nice, clean shave that is close but extremely gentle on the face -- no nicks, and no shaved-off skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a hundred pack and immediately regretted it.  I am not sure why they don&#x27;t work with my skin but these blades rip up my face and made me yearn for the days of my modern razor.  I bought them just before a vacation and they were the only blade I had out of town and I had cuts and a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow all day.  Seemed the only thing they cut was my face.  Not sure how that happened without getting a few hairs along the way.  The main thing they seemed to lack for me was smoothness.  I could feel every scrape.  I went from enjoying my shaves to serious panic every time I got in the shower.    I even went online and bought new blades to replace them after only using a few packs out of the 30 or so packs I bought.  So, not for me.  Feathers are closer and less irritating but still irritating sometimes.  Merkurs are smoother and overall my favorite.</li>
            <li> For the price these blades are hard to beat. However I have very thick stubble and these blades are not that sharp compared to Shark or Feather. They were however very forgiving and I would recommend for a beginner or someone with thin growth.</li>
            <li> I started using a safety razor just recently. I bought a Parker it came with shark DE blades, they were good. The Dreby gives me a closer shave quicker and rarely a nick. I use the Art of Shaving system, and found these blades work better when I use a thin wet coat of lather .I would highly recommend these blades</li>
            <li> double edge shaver for about three years. I try many different blades. my first impressions is for the money a really nice shave. You can get many shaves for this baby. Try it you&#x27;ll like it...</li>
            <li> i got a pack of 100+ a free stick of Arko shaving soap for like 12 dollers  just get it  its a wayy better deal and youll get alot more blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only begun to shave my old grey beard the old-fashioned way. These Derby blades are my first \\&quot;Safety Razor\\&quot; blades. Worked well, not a single nick or cut yet. I&#x27;ve used the first blade for a couple weeks now, and have not even flipped it over yet to use the underneath side. I don&#x27;t know yet how long it lasts. But obviously these are MUCH cheaper than big-name but lame \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many DE blades and I been using these quite a bit lately, tho not the sharpest they do hold a edge for several shaves, I get maybe 3 good shaves out of them and usually squeak another one out of it but its rough. I would prefer Feathers, Personas, Wilkinson Swords or Lords over these. These seem to compare to Dorcos and not as sharp as Astras but last longer. They are a good all around blade for the beginner.</li>
            <li> There are blades that are sharper, but many wet shaving vets will recommend these to start with. If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge blade, pick up some of these and see how it goes. They&#x27;re sharp enough to get the job done, but still forgiving.</li>
            <li> These razors are a wonderful deal and I love them! For the value they are totally worth buying for any wet shaver</li>
            <li> I agree with Charles Dickens.  I bought a pack of 10 after reading his review, and they made for a much smoother and easier shave.  I usually try to try as many different brands as possible, but don&#x27;t believe it can get much better than this either.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremly sensitive so I switched to traditional/wet shaving. I was using Merkur platinum blades but they were a little to harsh (still better than those 3 bladed pieces of junk though) so after some searching on different forums I decided to give these Derbys a try. They are about half as thick as Merkurs so I guess that means sharper? Either way it doesnt matter, I dont think I will ever have to try a different blade. These things are awesome.. on first use I didnt have a good lather like I usually do but that didnt matter. I didnt soak my face like I usually do but that didnt seem to matter either. These things are just so smooth its like your not even shaving but the hair is still coming off. Great seller, Great product, Gotta buy a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> please read my reviews - bottom line a great razor blade! but try other sample blades/packs first. make sure that derby is one of the samples. if you end up loving the blade (usually because it works as well as many other blades and the cost/cheap price) then do yourself a huge favor and buy the 100 blades box.you will spend approx 11 cents a blade plus get a free arko shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and keep coming back to Derby blades. These blades stand up to ANY beard. Start wet shaving with a Double Edge razor and tell those Plastic Razor guys to take a hike. You&#x27;ll be saving money and enjoying the shave a lot more. I do suggest using a quality shaving cream,ie. Clinique Cream Shave, Speick,etc.</li>
            <li> Like many people here, my first double-edge razor came with a free Merkur blade. I&#x27;d bought a Merkur razor, so why not try the manufacturer&#x27;s blade? A few minutes later, and bleeding profusely from a dozen points, I was wondering whether it was just the manufacturer&#x27;s fault or if I was that hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I popped in a Derby on my next attempt, and wow. Derby is truly razor sharp- one pass is all I need to go out in public. But like many, I&#x27;m not happy until I get baby-face bare. Derby does wonderfully on that count, and Derbys are forgiving enough that you can press down quite a bit or do multiple passes if you really need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still fairly new at all this, and someday I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll move up to the world of an expensive Merkur Futur adjustable razor and Feather&#x27;s legendary samurai blades, but for the time being, Derby is a wonderful razor for any experience level. If you&#x27;re just starting out with DE shaving, or if you&#x27;re an old pro who was never quite satisfied with off-brand blades, step up to Derby. I&#x27;m slowly converting my friends to DE shaving, and without fail I will always recommend Derby blades as a starter pack.</li>
            <li> I am no expert it must be said, but compared to the DE blades I&#x27;ve been purchasing from a big discount store chain and a local supermarket chain, these Derby Extras seem pretty good.  I think they give a closer shave than either of my previous \\&quot;brands\\&quot;.  Other things I like about them: they have markings so that you can tell which side is which, they are very reasonably priced, and they come in packs of 5 rather than 10 (like my grandfather used to buy &#x27;em).</li>
            <li> Great razors, very sharp and cut clean. This is my brand!Derby makes really great blades I use them in my merkur</li>
            <li> Nice blades, very sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades are what came with my first safety razor. After using them up, I switched to Swordson razors (Walmart) and absolutely hated them. The contrast between the two blades is incredible.  These blades are perfect for my beard type and give a super close shave that leaves my mug looking clean all day. I think these razors are the best bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Good blade. Not as sharp as others but very smooth. Requires an extra pass but no cuts.</li>
            <li> I used Feathers mostly (with Merkurs here and there) for a couple of years before trying the Derby Extras after my barber recommended them. For the price and quality I can&#x27;t see myself switching to anything else now.    Sharpness: They&#x27;re quite sharp, noticeably sharper than Merkur but not as much as the Feather. They aren&#x27;t harsh like Feathers though and last twice as long. I get 5-6 great shaves out of this razor. The Feather gave me a couple of excellent, sharp shaves but it became harsh after that.    Packaging: They come in 5s instead of 10s like the other two razors mentioned, and each razor is individually wrapped in wax paper. They do have a used blades compartment which is nice.    Quality: Second to none, you can feel the difference after a couple of shaves when it stays smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull at your hair like the Feather does. I would say it&#x27;s as good as the Merkur, just a lot cheaper.    Price: They could sell these for double the price and I&#x27;d still get them without thinking. Not sure why they&#x27;re so cheap but I&#x27;m not complaining!    Blades are generally a personal preference and YMMV, but for the price I would definitely suggest giving these a go if you&#x27;re not happy with your current blade.</li>
            <li> Combined with good soap the Derby Extra is a good cheap blade and shave&#x27;s well. Better then others I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to a DE safety razor and am using these blades as my first attempt so I can&#x27;t compare them to anything else yet. I do know that the blades seem fairly good and sharp and I have not had any pulling/nicks after 4 days of using the first one. Each one is wrapped in wax paper and come in a handy little storage box. Maybe once I am more comfortable with them I will try some of the more expensive ones to see if there is a difference but for this low cost blade they seem to be just fine.</li>
            <li> Blades weren&#x27;t as sharp as I expected,  but got jib done.  I switched to Merkur blade and it felt different.  Could have been a bad batch, so I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with DE Safety Razors.  I ordered the Merkur 1904 (came with 1 blade) along with Derby&#x27;s, Wilkinson&#x27;s and Feathers.  So far the Derby, Wilkinson and Merkur blade seem to be about the same, although I did use the Derby before I recieved my shaving oil.  There was a complimentary sample of oil in the razor and I used it with the Merkur but ran out before I got to the Derby.  The shaving oil seems to make a big difference in helping the blade glide over your skin and cut the whiskers instead of pulling or dragging.  Oil and lather seem to work really good together although I haven&#x27;t tried using just oil and doubt that I will.  It&#x27;s a noticeably good difference using the oil with the lather though.  I have a good few Derbys (25 were in the order) along with the Wilkinsons (5) and Feathers (5) so I have plenty of time to decide the outcome.  One thing:  do not go to aggressively, no matter which blade you use.  Let the weight of the razor slice the whiskers.  Any extra pressure by the user will only result in the loss of some skin.  Happy shaves.</li>
            <li> I switched over from the Gillette sensor about 3 months ago. I&#x27;m using a Merkur 180 razor and aerosol shave creme which seems to work ok. The learning curve was very short and I had no major cuts and razor burn only on the first shave as I tried to get too close. The first couple of blades worked fine and then the third blade was very rough. I rinse the blades well and towel dry them. My current blade worked well on one side but not the other leading me to suspect poor quality control or \\&quot;seconds.\\&quot; I wrote the vendor who said they had no knowledge about the quality of the product. I only bought 25 of these blades so I&#x27;ll tought it out hoping for a few more \\&quot;good\\&quot; blades but I will be trying a different brand next order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 2012 I ordered these blades from another vendor (100 pack) and have not had a bad blade in the first 5 blades. this leads me to believe that this vendor (discount jungle) is selling seconds.</li>
            <li> This is the best blade I have ever tried and it is also the most forgiving. Each blade gives me 5 shaves without loosing it&#x27;s performance. Priced right, too.</li>
            <li> This is good for people with sensitive skin or those that don&#x27;t have tough beards. My facial hair is very tough, especially around the chin, and this thing tugged and pulled a bit. My facial hair is the type that has to be shave everyday since it grows very quickly. This blade will be very good for people who don&#x27;t have tough beards. For them, it is mild and so it will give you a close effective shave without much irritation and less chance of cuts or degree of the cut if you make mistakes in your techniques. Good blade to start with if you are new.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite blade.  I tried to like it and will occasionally try a shave with one. After one shave I throw it out and move on. For me Astra are more reliable and Feather, while somewhat dangerous, give the closest shaves. Anyone needs to try different brands of blades and find what works well for them. The ones I like, I buy in cartons of 100.  At this point I may not need to buy blades for several years.  But I probably will.</li>
            <li> So I understand that every review here is subjective but I really have to say that this blade is NO GOOD.  Yes everyone has different thicknesses of beard hair which is why some people may like a blade and others not...I&#x27;m only 20 years old, and though I have a beard the hair still does not grow in very thickly.  That said, when using this razor it doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave.  So I would say for any older men out there who have a thick beard to NOT get this product.  Even when I do the two rounds of shaving; one time going down, rinsing, re-lathering and then shaving against the grain I still do not get a good shave.  The blade drags on certain parts of my face causing me to bleed and I can never get a good shave on my neck.  I&#x27;m about to try to return these blades to the seller for being unusable.</li>
            <li> I am almost hesitant to review these blades and tell potential buyers how my experience was, because after reading the reviews on them, I am apparently one of the few that these blades don&#x27;t agree with. Blades are very much an individual thing and using a review to purchase blades is not going to be as effective as buying a sampler pack of blades and just trying different ones out.     That said, my experience has been bad. I use a double edge razor to shave my entire head and face. I get one good shave out of each blade and that is the second time I use it. The first shave, I usually end up bleeding and irritated. The second shave for me is usually pretty decent. Third shave and after, it takes several passes and I never get that smooth feeling I get with other blades. My favorite blade so far is the Shark Super Chrome which I can easily get 5 great shaves with.     Other people absolutely love Derby blades and after using several different blades with wildly varying reviews, I can appreciate that. I highly recommend getting a sampler pack and trying a bunch of blades to find what works for you. Compared to what disposable cartridges cost, it it still cheaper to get stuck with a few bad blades in order to find your perfect one.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin and I break out after shaving.  After switching though to these blades and the razor and using shave soap I get a great shave and my skin feels great!  Great buy at this price too.  Disposable and reusable shavers that you buy in stores are garbage compared to the shave you will get with these.</li>
            <li> These blades may be fine for some people, but with safety razors you need to try a few different blades to find the right one. I made the mistake of buying these when I bought my safety razor and the shave was not the best for me. I had a 5 O-clock shadow by noon each day and the blades just dragged across my face hardly cutting the hair with a new blade. I bought a sample pack of different blades and found the Feathers blades worked best on my face. Again these may be the best for you, but before buying one brand in bulk you should buy a sample pack to find the right blade for your face.</li>
            <li> If you use double edge blades for any reason, this brand is excellent.  Quality, and low price. I use them for an out of production Trim Comb.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the whole DE-shaving thing a try. After looking around, I ended up buying the Parker 96R razor because it reminded me of my dad&#x27;s gillette from waayyyy back. I also ordered a 10-pack of Sharks (came with the Razor), a 10-pack of Merkur blades, and a 25-pack of Derby blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First note - the razor is solid, with a comfortable heft. It also closes up well - though not quite perfectly on both sides - and holds the blades nice and straight while making it trivial to pop a blade in or out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the razors, my impressions after trying out (almost) 2 each. This was to ensure that impressions I had weren&#x27;t just due to being a tyro. Even with the occasional nick, the shaves have been consistently close (except for the Merkur, I&#x27;d wake up the NEXT morning with a closer shave than I&#x27;d gotten out of some electrics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharks - Nice, sharp, and I can get several shaves out of them before I start getting razor bumps, hair tugging, or \\&quot;slips\\&quot; due to the blade dulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby - just wow. Nicer, sharper, and not really more expensive. Very happy with them. I almost immediately felt like this blade just glided over my skin effortlessly shaving away my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur - perhaps it was just a matter of fit with the razor, but this is the only blade that consistently felt skittish, the one I consistently nicked myself with the easiest, and the only one I got razor bumps on the very. first. shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ended up mentally rating the razors based on how many shaves before they started feeling like the \\&quot;new\\&quot; merkur blades - and were, IMO , unusable since I&#x27;d start getting the razor bumps from my cartridge days. The sharks would give me three shaves, the derby blades 4, maybe 5.</li>
            <li> I have some thick beard on my chin and its an ABSOLUTE pain to use this product. Otherwise, its somewhat OK. I decided to try it because of the attractive pricing. After trying for a few times, I went back to my regular Gillette Sword (although more expensive). I still have 20 unused Derby blades. I cannot use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I don&#x27;t have a frame of reference to judge the quality of these blades.  I can say they were a great deal, plus the shipping was fast and free.</li>
            <li> Better than disposables. Hubby loves them.</li>
            <li> After trying out the Sharks that came with my razor and some Feathers, I decided to try Derby.  Day one I got a terrible shave with lots of tugging at my beard.  My shave was not close at all.  Day two, the tugging was so bad that I switched blades mid-shave...the second Derby was no better so I switched to a third blade (a Shark this time) just to finish the shave.  I have a heavy beard so perhaps this blade might be good for someone with a tender beard or someone who is very fearful of getting cut (although the tugging for me was worse).  This is definitely NOT for heavy beards...I won&#x27;t be trying Derby again.</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor blade for a pretty good price. Fed-up with the high price of multi-blade razor cartridges, I recently decided to go back to an old-fashioned safety razor. Derby blades were recommended to me as a good \\&quot;starter\\&quot; blade, sharp enough to get a decent shave, but forgiving enough for shavers who are new to double-edge razors. Blade choice depends on the individual&#x27;s beard and a number of personal preferences, so results can vary greatly from shaver to shaver, but for the price, they are worth a try.</li>
            <li> Very good blades in my opinion ,gets the job done,for a smooth baby butt shave.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades.  I have tried multiple brands, and these ones seems to work the best for my skin.  They aren&#x27;t as sharp as feathers, but my skin definitely seems to react better to these blades.  I have way less nicks with the Derby&#x27;s.  The only gripe (hence the 4 stars) I have is that they do not last as long as some of the other brands that I have tried (I get 2, maybe 3 shaves out of these) but the shave I get definitely makes up for that.</li>
            <li> I started off with this razor, and then moved on to the astras.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the astra razors, this is very tame and forgiving. I&#x27;ve had a few times when I knew I pushed on the razor, and had to stop in fear of getting a cut. However, no cut happened and I was free to carry on with my manly ritual. (With the astra, eh... not so much. I realized why people in movies had tissue paper after shaving now!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably review the astra once I get better at wet shaving, but these razors are the place to start wet shaving!</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving, I have purchased many different brands of blades to see which is the best for my face. After trying several different blades, the Derby is one of my favorites. I&#x27;m pretty sure when I&#x27;m done sampling other blades, I&#x27;ll be purchasing the Derby brand exclusively.</li>
            <li> i used to always use a razor for my neck as my religion doesn&#x27;t allow razors  on the face, and an electric shaver for my face. i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost. its expensive, but almost everything in life that is good and far superior to the competition is more expensive, right?</li>
            <li> I purchased these as replacements for some less expensive blades.  After going through about 5 blades, I can say these are by far better than my prior blades.  These seem to handle my skin better, cause no irritation and I have yet to cut myself on these.  They stay sharp for a good 6-8 shaves and really do the job well in terms of closeness.</li>
            <li> Love the Derby Blades.  Why anyone would use disposable plastic razors puzzles me.</li>
            <li> The Derby blades are by far the worst blades I have used since I changed to DE shaving. The nicks and cuts I got in one shave left my face feeling like it had been on the losing side of a knife fight. I could feel every stroke of the razor because the blade did not run across my beard in a smooth manner. After trying Dorco, Derby, Merkur and Persona, for my face type I will stick with Persona and Merkur from now on.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite blades but very good none the less.  However blades are different for every shaved face (for the most part).  If you are shopping for a new blade these are worthy of consideration.</li>
            <li> I am a complete newbie to the double edge razor and these blades were my entry level purchase. They are a wonderful value and in my comparison are on par with the Merkur blades. They provide a close shave and have stayed sharp longer than I expected. Will continue to buy these as my primary brand.</li>
            <li> This blade is well made and provides a nice smooth shave. I gave it a 4 because even though the shave is nice, smooth and out perform&#x27;s my Norelco electric shaver, Gillette Mach 3 and any other cheap plastic razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Unfortunately, it still leaves a five o&#x27;clock shadow that is visible. It is more visible than slightly-visible, but I would say it is good enough as I can go 2-3 days tops without needing a shave. It probably is as close as I will get without taking the plunge and purchasing a straight blade &amp; strop. I will try another brand of blades just to see if it is indeed the Derby blade or if this is as close as I can get. Because I have a Edwin Jagger Safety razor, Edwin Jagger Badger brush, and Edwin Jagger shaving cream too, I lather up my face well, keep it wet as much as possible and I&#x27;m still able to see a gray shadow. I know I can do better though, as some areas have far lesser shadow especially on the sides of my face, but the trouble spots are the goatee area and chin.     Maybe I need more practice...time will tell, but it&#x27;s worth the cash I spent. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that in the future I eventually did end up purchasing a straight blade though.</li>
            <li> Oh my god, thought my face was being ripped off with a brand new blade and I shave in the shower to soften my skin which allows me to use blades longer.</li>
            <li> I was impressed.  I was very concerned that I would purchase the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; blades for my face.  Derby didn&#x27;t let me down. I have somewhat sensitive skin, which is why I started using a safety razor (Merkur Model 180 Long Handled), and they&#x27;ve lasted me so long. In fact, it&#x27;s taken me way too long to write this review. I don&#x27;t even remember when I first purchased these. Regardless, bravo!</li>
            <li> These blades are almost too dull to use.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations!  I ordered twenty five blades and they were packaged in 5&#x27;s which makes it great to share.  I would recommend this product to any man that likes a close shave.</li>
            <li> Theses blades are OK. Not great but I&#x27;ve just tried Feather in a Feather razor and my first impression is that they are a better blade than Derby.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a new Merkur razor from Amazon, and purchased these blades to use with it. The primary reason for my selection was price. These were a very good deal and seemed to be good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only comparison I can make to these is to the multi-blade plastic cartridge type razors commonly seen on television advertisements. I have gotten a much closer shave, with less irritation, than I ever got using those. They also seem to be fairly durable, as I&#x27;ve gotten several good shaves out of each blade. I don&#x27;t have experience with safety razors to know how that stacks up to other types of blades, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work great for my needs, and I would recommend them. Your mileage, of course, may vary. I have a somewhat thin, soft beard and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this blade because it gives a close shave without shaving my face off. I have used other blades in the past, but, in terms of quality and comfort, I settles on Derby Extra. The price point is excellent, and this is a great product. If you are using badger &amp; blade to shave, give this blade a try. It feels dull in the beginning, but you get used to it and you are able to have nick-free shaves. I use one per week, switching out to a new one every Monday. No more expensive and fancy cartridges for me.</li>
            <li> What can I say they are double edged razor blades at a fair price,  bought them to use in a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a starter blades in a 25 pack as I sampled a few brands. Didn&#x27;t want to buy 100 if I didn&#x27;t like them. They work fine, but aren&#x27;t all that sharp when you compare them to most other blades out there. They tug on the thicker parts of my beard. YMMV of course. The drawback of a sharper blade is irritation, but as my skills increase, sharper blades seem to be the way to go for me. These are a great deal in larger quantities. The 25 pack served its purpose well for me and if you are in a similar boat, definitely go for it.</li>
            <li> I got a 5 pack of these with my Edwin Jagger razor and have been using them since. I think they do not give as close of a shave as the feathers do, but, these do not cut the hell out of my face like the feathers.</li>
            <li> I should start off by saying that i have a very thick beard and this blade might be good enough for people with less hair or a light beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these blades along with my first ever safety razor. After researching and understanding how a safety razor should be used, i started shaving with these blades. This was a terrible experience as the blades would pull on my beard and the shave was not very clean. At first i thought it was me, so i just kept using the blade for another 2 weeks until it was more work then it was worth. Through out my two weeks i kept reviewing youtube videos to see what i was doing wrong but the shave was not improving. I gave up on the shave and went back to my cartridge razors until i visited my dad a few weeks later and asked him what i&#x27;m doing wrong (he has been using a safety razor as long as i remember)He told me to change blades and gave me some of his feather blades. WOW!! what a difference. I started to enjoy shaving with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really shouldn&#x27;t give this product such a low rating, as it might work great for people with a light beard but it was terrible for me. If you have thick hair be warned that this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> Blades came swiftly as advertised, I can get a good shave with them.  However the reasonI gave it 2 stars is it seems like every 3rd or 4th blade is out of spec or jagged or something.  Most blades in the pack work great but then you get one that really sucks and you have to throw it away and hope you get a good one with the next blade you pull.  I have gone through 3 or 4 packs like this before I gave up and switched to another brand.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and at a fantastic price. Have so many now i have to worry about degrading. Placed the rest in a small tupperware bowl with a decedent to stop moisture and seal the lid. Florida is very humid. Wont need razors for years now</li>
            <li> Good price for some nice blades. I have had one that wasn&#x27;t sharpened on one side, effectively making my DE half useless. However since the blades are so cheap I just replaced the blade. Not as good as feather in my opinion, but I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> These are good blades. I bought a Merkur 34C that came with a Merkur blade and I reaaly like this one more, it is more expensive, but for my face I think I&#x27;m gonna be buying this</li>
            <li> Many users feel the same way: Derby makes a shaving blade that&#x27;s sharp, but so smooth that you might not even know you&#x27;re shaving. Not so sharp that you get razor burn, but sharp enough to give you a satisfying shave every time.</li>
            <li> I got a variety pack of blades, these were neither the best or the worst, I would put them on the high end.</li>
            <li> cant beat the price the only issues I had was if you use regular shaving cream such as barbasol  you will get shave burn/rash I had to switch to the shave gel and it seemed to solve the problem and they tend to rust so I currently switched to feather brand blades and  very happy there much more shaper than derby and give a close nice shave</li>
            <li> This blade is good, but not as sharp as the Feather brand.  But then again, I cut myself more with the feather brand.  In the end, you just have to try different blades to know which one is best for you.</li>
            <li> It turns out I&#x27;m not a fan of the Derby blades. You never know until you try. They&#x27;re okay, they just aren&#x27;t to my liking. As a comparison, my daily favorites are Sharks as comparison.</li>
            <li> If you have a fairly heavy whiskers than this is not the product for you. They are not of very high quality and produce dragging and pulling, which would mean they were not sharp. For me they are useless, a person with a lighter growth may like these and the lower price and rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I used Shark when I first started shaving and gave these a try. Warning! you get what you pay for. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will change anyones buying habits, but I will give my experiences, for what they are worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was a little leary starting DE shaving again, as I tried DE shaving about 9 years and scared my wife!  I was a bloody mess, and she almost dialed 911!!!  But I was unprepared for DE shaving at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being disgusted with high cost of multiblades refill (fusion), a couple of months ago I recently received, from my mom, all my dads old Gillette DE razors from the 50&#x27;s 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  So I cleaned them up, and bought Derby blades due to the good reviews I read for it as a starter blade.  I had been using Mitchells Wool Fat shaving soap for over a year, so I also bought some of Geo Trumper pink coral skin food, and decided to try DE shaving again.  I was more prepared this time.  I started with my dads old cheap 3 piece Gillette tech take apart razor.  They made millions of these during the war.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I am sure my technique was poor.  I bled but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I moved up and next tried dads black handled superspeed non adjustable, with these Derby blades.  Wow, fabulous.  So smooth and comfortable, no irritation.  And no blood!  I am still perfecting my technique, but my face was feeling great, especially after Geo Trumpers pink skin food was put on.  May have bled 3 times in 4 months with these Derby blades and the old Gillette superspeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I put DE shaving with this Derby blade in rotation with my remaining costly fusion multiblades and some Gillette Good News disposables (which is a nice shaver in itself in my opinion) and have been shaving every day rotating with a different razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling a little cocky, I decided to (what I thought would be a step up) buy some Feather blades, reading about how sharp and good they are, and put in rotation with the other 3 shaving practices I was using.  First shave with the Feather, and I was bleeding.  Figured my technique needed tobe fine tuned, or my speed slowed down and to become more deliberate.  No help.  The feather blades scraped and irritated my face, especially the neckline.  The Derbys were more forgiving and comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken the feather blades out of my rotation, and when my costly fusion multiblades run out, I will be left with the Gillette Good News disposables and the Derby razors.  I will next try some of dads adjustable Gillette superspeeds and a Gillette fat boy adjustable, comforted by the knowledge I can always go back to the black handled superspeed non adjustable I have been enjoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes I just bought to add to my stock, the 100 count Derby razor blades at 10 cents a blade.</li>
            <li> They are very good blade, but not as sharp as the other brands of blades I have purchased on line.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Merkur long handled safety razor and embarked on the old fashioned shaving experience. I bought a 50 pack of Derby blades based on reviews....I&#x27;ll honestly say this was my only mistake in switching to a safety razor. The blade pulled at my hair, took many, many swipes to clear, and irritated under my chin. I was very frustrated with this first experience and began to wonder if this was just how shaving with a safety razor was. A friend at work and I were discussing this - he gave me some Persona and Feather blades to try - what a difference. Shaving was truly a pleasure. I will never buy these again. They are very dull.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband. He said it was like trying to shave with typing paper. I wouldn&#x27;t bother with them.</li>
            <li> These are infinitely better than the 7AM blades that came with my razor. I haven&#x27;t tried any other than these two, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with them. I get at least two good shaves per blade. Considering I was getting half of a good shave with the Mach 3 I&#x27;m quite happy. And at this price, you cannot go wrong.     If you can find a variety pack to find which blades work best for you, and these are included, definitely go for it. If you just want some blades that you know will be good, Derby is not gonna disappoint.</li>
            <li> Derby Extra blades are OK, especially for beginners whose beards are not especially tough. They are not the sharpest tool in the drawer but they are forgiving. I probably won&#x27;t purchase anymore Derby blades because I am moving on to a sharper blade like a Feather or Bic. I like both Feather and Bic blades very much.</li>
            <li> These work pretty good, I prefer the 7AM ones though but one blade is good for about 4 shaves (I don&#x27;t grow that much facial hair but have to shave every morning)</li>
            <li> I ordered these to try a blade other than I find locally.  The first shave I suffered razor burn but after an adjustment received a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> I use this product with a recently purchased safety razor and shaving brush because I am returning to &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; shaving.  The blades are inexpensive and work well.  They arrived on time and were well packaged.  I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged blades, individually wrapped and easy to dispense.  They are sharp and seem to hold their edge.  They are a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> The price of these blades is right on, but they are not sharp enough for my liking. They may work better for guys without fast thick beard growth. I found myself needing to shave two times a day with these. I now use feathers, which cost more, but are a sharper blade and I am back to shaving once a day. I will likely use these for travel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t post a review on my first purchase of these, I didn&#x27;t think it was appropriate being new to the whole double edge razor thing.  I just purchased my second 25 count set, it&#x27;s been a year since that first set.  I have to say I don&#x27;t shave every day and I don&#x27;t have coarse hair, so that probably factors into why these blades work so well for me.  In the meantime, I have saved a bunch of dough.</li>
            <li> These blades where a lot smother than the ones that came with the razor I got a closer shave than before</li>
            <li> Double edged blades give the best shave short of a straight razor, or barber&#x27;s razor.  They are much safer to use, too.  As to most modern shaving choices, they always outcut electric razors, period.  They also outshave the expensive multi-level razors sold for outrageous prices.&lt;br /&gt;As to drawbacks, you have to buy a double-edged razor; they are significantly more likely to cut you than the aforementioned multi-level razors, because you have a single edge and not multi-blade&#x27;s smaller blades.  You must be careful, but you&#x27;re rewarded with that smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the following for that perfect shave: use these blades(or any other double edge name brand) for your face except the triangle(nose to chin) where electric razors ARE superior, much faster and safer.  Never use double edge in that zone and you&#x27;ll never cut yourself...</li>
            <li> Shipping came right on time and Derby&#x27;s are always great.&lt;br /&gt; One thing I got confused on was I ordered these blades at an average price of 16 cents per blade, and no shipping, but a $1 tax got included, bringing the price to 20 cents per blade. No big deal, but, how can I be charged tax? Let&#x27;s be more honest, it&#x27;s either shipping or not.</li>
            <li> Good blades.  Sturdy, but not like Feather.  A little rough on my skin.  Ok for camping-out.  You will want an Alum block handy.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp stainless steel, made in Turkey, and are sharper than Astra but not as sharp as Wilkinson Sword blades, IMO.  Priced right, and packaged in lots of five with a disposable slot in the plastic case to take used blades safely, these blades are able to deliver a fine shave with good technique being used by the shaver.  For sensitive skin and normal beards they are fine, if a little bit aggressive.</li>
            <li> There is a reason that Americans quit using the single blade razor and that is due to the fact that it hacks and cuts your face all over the place.  After I shaved with these blades for the first time my face was completely covered in blood.  Spend the extra money for the three blade razor and save your blood.</li>
            <li> After consulting with my banker for the purchase of very expensive additional blades for my Gillette Fusion with power steering and brakes, a friend coerced me into going back to the Double edge Razor I shaved with for most of my life.  I think shaving is his life and he is very knowledgable since he is on shaving forums etc. yes there are shaving forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like many was thought I was liberated by three bladed, four bladed and now five bladed shavers now with vibration, before I found out I, much of it is not needed and the five blade made me break out from the additional friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are great, I can use one about six or seven times, clean up easy, and my irritation is all but gone. the savings are enormous.</li>
            <li> Good blades for the beginner or when returning to shaving with a safety razor.  Least sharp blade according to [...]  Time to try some others!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how better to say that this product is worth buying, other than to feel my cheek a year after purchasing... I swap the razor out every other week, and about ready to buy another set… The only concern that I have is that some of the imprints (brand name stamps) are very light on some razors, and very dark on others. Because of this I&#x27;ll likely buy from a licensed vendor in the near future.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as my first razor blades to go along with my first safety razor a few months ago.  I wanted to switch over from cartridge shaving because I kept getting ingrowns/irritation along my neck and jawline after every shave.  Safety razor shaving as done a GREAT job at clearing most of those problems up.  These blades were great to learn on because they are not terribly sharp so less chance of you hurting yourself as you are getting accustomed to this kind of shaving.  However, after getting my technique down I decided to try some Astra blades that were generally reviewed as being a bit sharper than Derbys.  After trying them both I definitely have to agree.  The Astra blades glide through my hairs noticeably easier than the Derby blades, which have bit more tugging/pulling no matter what angle I used them with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr&lt;br /&gt;These blades are great if you are new to safety razor shaving, but they are definitely not the sharpest blades out there and I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to Astra blades within a month or so which offered a noticeably cleaner/smoother shave.</li>
            <li> i thought i was buying twist  on the shaft , but i will try it anyways and see how it goes</li>
            <li> The blades are great, but I think I lack the patience of using the safety razor properly :) I haven&#x27;t given up, but I am taking a break..</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Merkur HD Classic based on stellar reviews, and bought a pack of these Derby&#x27;s because I sensed that on many shaving message boards they seemed to be the most positively mentioned blade. The razor came with a Merkur Platinum blade which is a better seller on Amazon so I decided to try that out first. Although I was a beginner at double edged razor shaving, I was certainly not a beginner at wet shaving and expected decent, not great results on my first shave. I was disappointed to see that the shave wasn&#x27;t even decent, it was very poor compared to be Mach 3 shaves and I had a five&#x27;o&#x27;clock shadow no matter how many passes I took. I eventually took so many passes that I was bleeding like crazy, my skin was swiss cheese, but still the stubble hadn&#x27;t come off. I had 3 more shaves with this razor. Each was progressively better in that I cut myself less and my form became better, but the stubble still remained. The urge to get my Mach 3 out and get closer shaves in a fraction of the time with no cuts started to become irresistible - I still had a brand new cartridge sitting in the drawer (that I had paid a fortune for).    Then I decided to change the blade and pop a Derby in there just to see if the brand of the blade really does make a difference or if these DE shaving enthusiasts are just nuts. How good was the shave? Well, it was good enough that halfway through the shave I told myself I&#x27;d go on Amazon immediately after to write a rave review. This is probably the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;m still an amateur at DE shaving and could make many improvements to my form. I&#x27;m amazed at how my chin feels right now. The Mach 3 on its best day would get almost everything but would still leave a bit of stubble on my chin, but right now it&#x27;s baby smooth. The Mach would also leave a bit of mustache stubble left over now matter how many passes I took or how hard I pressed down, but the Derby blade sliced through like butter and left nothing in its path.I did nick myself once, but it was just a beginner&#x27;s mistake, had nothing to do with the razor. I have confidence that if I stick to these blades, pretty soon I&#x27;ll be groping my own face in public just to admire how smooth it is.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for a very reasonable price.My husband loves the old fashioned razors better than any disposable and is completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Obviously razor blades are largely a matter of preference but these Derby blades have been a godsend for me. I formerly used Feather blades, which are rightly considered excellent and incredibly sharp. My problem is that my skin is far from perfect and the Feathers tend to cut me to shreds, particularly in the first couple of shaves. I&#x27;ve used them for quite a while and managed to get my technique as good as I could to minimize the damage but I thought I&#x27;d try something else. I read a lot of reviews and decided to try the Derbys.    My first shave was less than perfect only because I decided to try the sample packet of Anthony pre shave oil that came with my order. Not impressed. The shave, however, was very good in spite of that. A couple of nicks that I&#x27;ll call my fault but very close and no bleeding that wasn&#x27;t immediately staunched by cold water. For my second shave, I went back to my Neutrogena Daily Defense for a pre-shave wash and got a superb shave from the Derby blade: close and smooth; no blood; no razor burn. Simply the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. While I still recommend the Feathers for those whose face can take them, I&#x27;ve got to heartily recommend the Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Per husband the razor edges slip side to side, resulting with multiple nicks.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  These blades are absolutely terrific.  They are sharp to begin with and retain their sharpness thru at least 1/2 dozen shaves and even more.  Smooth shave.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more and highly recommend.  Have to laugh at these commercials where they one up each other by the number of blades in a razor - I think it&#x27;s up to 5 blades in one expensive razor blade and it DOES NOT cut any better nor smoother nor closer than the double edge single blade Derby, but costs a hell of a lot more money.  Give me the Derbys and a good double edge razor any day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor. I remember my dad&#x27;s butterfly top razor when I was young and how interesting it was to watch him use it! These are the third brand I&#x27;ve tried since I got my own double edge and I&#x27;m pretty sure these are going to be my standard. They are PLENTY sharp enough but don&#x27;t seem to wear out as quick as the others I&#x27;ve used. All things considered they are a great value.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for these razors. I know all the double edged razors work a little differently based on sharpness or thickness. I tried one or two other ones and decided on these for the good deal. I think they work really well. I have cut myself a few times, but I think that would happen no matter what. I usually swap out every two days or two uses.</li>
            <li> So far out my sample pack of blades this is my favorite one.. I have wirey beard that grows different directions and this blade got rid of it in 2 passes, these made the cut to be in my collection I a have a few more to try out in order to a bulk and 200 of these are 15$..</li>
            <li> These razors are my daily razors. If you are taking of stubble every or every other day they stay sharp for a good while. However if you are taking off a full beard change your blade right after that.</li>
            <li> We bought these for a Merkur Razor and while they are not as awesome as the original, for the very low price, they work great. A+, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these blades and the shark blades. I began with the Derby blades. To me, a new DE user, these have been a bit too aggressive. I have been receiving more nicks and cuts from these than the shark blades.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item, but when it comes to razor blades I would suggest you go elsewhere.  The whole point of buying these old-school double edged blades is because they offer a better shave at a great price.  Not these.  I have the type of face that gets the classic 5-o&#x27;clock shadow, but with these I get a noon shadow.  They dull after the first shave, and even on that one they will cut your face up.  I use top of the line products when I shave, so I know it isn&#x27;t my shaving cream.  I have basically been treating them as disposable while I wait to get rid of them.  I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li> I recently switched over to a safety razor after being fed up with tossing out absurd amounts of money for replacement cartridges on my Gillette Fusion.  I offer this review with a few disclaimers: (1) I&#x27;m new to the game, and these are my first razor blades I&#x27;m trying, so I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of Derby blades compared with Feathers, Sharks, etc.; (2) my beard is not overly coarse, though I do need to shave every day -- it seems to me that a person&#x27;s choice in razors is unique according to what works best for them.  That said...    The Derby Extra Double Edge razors work great for me!      1. Irritation -- I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation from the blades.  Shaving with a safety razor is a different game than shaving with a multi-blade razor -- you have to use a good shave cream, you can&#x27;t press as hard, you have to take your time, and you have to keep an eye on what you&#x27;re doing.  I&#x27;ve followed those rules and I haven&#x27;t experienced any razor bumps or other irritation, even around the crease of my neck where I usually got irritation from the Fusion.    2.  Sharpness -- They seem reasonably sharp to me.  Again, I haven&#x27;t tested out the market for razor blades yet, but by no means would I say the Derbys are dull or even \\&quot;not sharp.\\&quot;  Again, I think it has to do with what kind of beard you have, so you really have to feel it out and do what&#x27;s best for your own face.  The Derbys have done a great job for me with only one pass of the razor, but as I said before, my beard is not as thick and coarse as some others may be.    3.  Durability -- I use my blades 4-5 times before I throw away the blade -- not because the blade is dull, but because I don&#x27;t want to press my luck with a dull blade and these are cheap enough that a work-week&#x27;s worth of use out of a single blade seems about right.  I used to be able to get 8-10 good shaves out of my Gillette Fusion, but those cartridges cost about $4 each, whereas a Derby blade is about $0.21 apiece.      Overall, I gave the Derbys a 4 out of 5, not because there is anything wrong with these blades, but because I have nothing to compare it to -- Once I try other blades, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> Great blades works as expected. Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fairly new to safety razor shaving, but these blades seemed great to me. They&#x27;re sharp and cut the stubble. What more do you need?</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with these razor blades. They&#x27;re extremely sharp and dependable, and the shave I&#x27;ve received by using them is unrivaled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a straight razor shaver anymore but when I used a DE razor, I really liked this brand of blade.  Know this, Derby blades are mild shave blades</li>
            <li> I bought them for my boyfriend and when he used them they broke his face out.</li>
            <li> everyone is different, but for me these are some great razor blades. i tried seeral including astra, wilkinson sword, feather, and several others, these seemed to give me the best and cleanest shave. The blades seem to last about 3 shaved on average and i am now buying the 100ct packs which last me about a year.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to shaving, and a few weeks ago I bought a Merkur 34C. I first used it with the included Merkur blade, which was okay; I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot because of the learning curve that comes along with DE safety razors. After two shaves with that blade I switched to the Derby Extra blades and it makes a huge difference (even for a novice like myself). Ever since starting to use these: I have not nicked myself once, experienced no razor burn, and most importantly the ingrown hairs have almost completely gone away. I have very curly coarse AA hair and now it&#x27;s a pleasure to shave. These have proved to be a major improvement from the high costs of cartridge razors and discomfort of the ingrown hair caused by my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. These blades are cheap but you get what you pay for. It was like shaving with a file !</li>
            <li> I had some of these blades come by mistake with a razor I bought so I tried them and get a good shave with them. So I bought these to keep trying them. The shipping was fast. I&#x27;ve been using the Dorco 301 blades which give me a BBS shave and still find myself using them more. I have to make an extra pass with the Derby blade to get the close shave I like. But they are good blades for the price. Can get a close shave with these without your face getting nicked up or bloody. Everyone is different for what works best for them but don&#x27;t be afraid to try these.</li>
            <li> I was new to DE shaving and ordered these and a 5-pack from Feather to replace the generic blade that came with my handle. I&#x27;m very pleased with both brands and will probably choose based upon bulk pricing, and so far the Derbys are the winner.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a tough beard, and being new to DE shaving I&#x27;m still very carefull, but I&#x27;m speeding up now and haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts like I expected. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable blades I&#x27;ve used. I seem to have more irritation with Derbys than with some other blades. As of right now I think Feathers have given me the closest most irritation free shave. Of cours the Derbys are diet cheap. That helps. Everyone is different though. Many peopl live their Derbys. If you new you really should try a sample pack and rotate through a few to see what works for you.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor a few months ago.  I have tried a few different blades, i.e., Derby, Shark, etc.  I am settled on these Derby blades as the best blade.  They are sharp, hold their edge for shave after shave and the price is definitely right!   I shave my face every day and my head every other day and a blade lasts about a week.  When you figure it&#x27;s about 20 CENTS per week for blades, you too will say GOODBYE to Mach 3 razors!</li>
            <li> paper thin and damaging to the skin.</li>
            <li> These blades are no where close to feather. I have tried feather, astra and derby. Feather is the best no doubt.</li>
            <li> These are good razors and a good buy.  The razors give a good close shave.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the quality or price when it comes to these. Anyone shaving with a safety or butterfly razor should give these a try.</li>
            <li> What can I say about these razor blades except that they shave my husband very nicely.</li>
            <li> Very pleased...they may not be as sharp as Feather but these are a fraction of the price and the drop in sharpness is minimal. Best blades for the money IMO</li>
            <li> I was expecting something lesser than the Feathers I had been loving. But these were just awful. Tugging and pulling is an understatement. I have a full and dense beard and these simply won&#x27;t do shave it. Back to feathers.</li>
            <li> The good news on these is that they were extremely inexpensive, and I haven&#x27;t had any major mishaps when using them (i.e. no major cuts.) Unfortunately, they just don&#x27;t seem sharp enough - I get an OK shave, but nothing like I had hoped for. I got a better shave with the blade that came with my razor (a cheap Uxcell $5 razor purchased at the same time as these blades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to go ahead and use these since they do a fair job, but I&#x27;m looking forward to trying some other blades out. YMMV, as I&#x27;ve heard that different blades work better for different people.</li>
            <li> Only DE blades I&#x27;ve ever used so far. Will try Feather next, just in case. ***But maybe I just havent mastered the technique of shaving yet because after my second pass, even 3rd pass, I&#x27;ll still see the black dots - the tips of hair in my skin. And I get small sections on my face that I have to go over several times and then I begin nicking myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a sharper Feather blade would help? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s hard to rate these fairly when I have nothing else to compare them to and I&#x27;m only on my 2nd or 3rd month of DE shaving so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m no expert yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But due to how many of these you get for such a small price, and the fact that while I still see hairs sometimes and I have to make several passes and get nicked in the process... my skin feels so much smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced. It&#x27;s crazy. When it does its job, it does it AMAZINGLY well. Oh my goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT: Above, you see I mentioned that I was having problems. THose problems are slowly dissipating. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m getting better at this, and I think I didn&#x27;t have the technique of whipping up a good shaving lather down before either. I&#x27;m better at all of it, and so my shaves are better. I used to nick myself a lot, now I rarely if ever do. I love the sound of the sharp blade going against the grain, I love the smoothness, and I of course love how CHEAP it all is!</li>
            <li> It leaves me with a nice close shave but you only get 2 to 3 uses out of them.  I tried these hopeing to get them to last longer, I havent completely given up on the &amp;#34;straight razor&amp;#34; shave but Im getting close.</li>
            <li> These blades worked well with my vintage gillette and lord safety razors. They were super cheap, which also makes them good!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise these blades enough! I am a young female (relatively new to the double-edged razor.) I tried these tonight after receiving them this afternoon. This is the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever experienced. As an acne sufferer I was plagued by some fierce razor burn with cartridge razors. I had tried dozens of different brands to no avail, I tried shaving less often, I tried expensive creams and aftershaves...None of it worked. I gave up and visited a dermatologist and she recommended DE razors. My razor is a Merkur 180 long handle, this is the best blade I have used in my life! I have tried the \\&quot;Feathers\\&quot;, the original Merkur blades, Wilkenson Swords etc... This one is the VERY BEST. No irritation, no drag, and it still felt as sharp after shaving my legs as it did at the first stroke! I think I have found my razor blade for life! The price is amazing as well. Ladies, do your skin a huge favor and buy these blades!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them for a week, but am loving them so far.  They are giving me a tight shave.  I think I&#x27;ll get them again!</li>
            <li> The blades came quickly, fit nearly perfectly with my safety razor I bought them for, and provide a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came in 5 packs of 5, and have no problems so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend, &amp; would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through my first 5 pack of these blades, and I have to say that I just didn&#x27;t find them to be effective for me.  This is only the third type of blade I&#x27;ve tried, so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  The main issue I had is that they really tugged on my whiskers rather than cut them.  It ended up causing a lot of irritation as I had to make more passes over those areas.  They&#x27;re not too bad in the cuts and nicks department.  I have a medium thickness beard, and it seems they just weren&#x27;t sharp enough.  I have been wet shaving for several months so I can&#x27;t sit here and say my technique was perfect and it was all the blade, but I really do feel that way.  The other blades I have are generic ones I got at a drugstore.  I just completed a shave with one of those after using the Derby Extras, and I won&#x27;t be going back.  The shave was effortless and the finished product is much smoother.  That&#x27;s why I feel confident blaming the Derby blades for my poor shaves.  In fact if I have anything good to say about the Derbys is that they made my technique better as I had to have the blade at the perfect angle to have any chance of trimming my whiskers effectively.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t discount anybody&#x27;s experience with these, it seems that you just have to try different blades to find ones that work for your face.  With that in mind, try to get some sample packs and don&#x27;t be like me and just buy a 25 pack of Derby blades if you don&#x27;t know they&#x27;ll work for you.  I think I&#x27;ll take my own advice and look around for some blade sample packs now.  I still have 20 more Derbys so perhaps I will try one in the future and revise my review.</li>
            <li> This was a good set of blades for a pretty decent price.  Blades arrived in 5 convenient packages of 5 blades each.  Blades were sharp and shave is close with little irritation.</li>
            <li> This was the first DE blade I tried, and I don&#x27;t think I will need to look further! Very affordable when bought in bulk online, each blade is individually wrapped in wax paper. The old cartridges can be used as an old sharps container.</li>
            <li> I recently ditched the electric razor, and went back to the old double edge razor. You only need one blade.</li>
            <li> I bought these honestly for the prices over the merkurs because the merkurs are pretty expensive. After receiving them, I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were gonna do the job, but man I was wrong. I have pretty sensitive skin and usually get little spots of blood when shaving with the merkurs, but not with these. My face is spot free! On top of that, they last longer. I couldn&#x27;t go more than two shaves with a merkur blade, but these are trucking through just fine. Good buy especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I just got my 5 pack in and I gave myself a shave to try them out.  Actually two shaves as I was also trying out different shave cremes as well.  To be honest I was looking for something that worked a bit better?.  But i have to admit that the derby is a pretty good blade and i do agree with other reviewers.  I think the Derby is a good mid-grade blade as its sharper than some of the trial or dollar store blades but not sharp enough to hack youself up .  It&#x27;s certainly better than the Wilkerson blades I&#x27;ve been using but i needed something just a wee bit sharper and the Derby blade makes the grade here.  I&#x27;d try a pack yourself as it really a pretty good blade!.  Indiana Ed</li>
            <li> Cheap, yes. That may be the only positive thing about this product, but you get what you pay for. I subsequently bought a pack of Merkurs and only have to shave my face once (up and down), as opposed to three + go rounds with the Derbies.</li>
            <li> I got these when I first began shaving with a double-sided single-blade razor, but I have since upgraded to the sharper Feather brand of blades. I get less nicks and a smoother shave, with still no irritation. I&#x27;d get a small pack of these for a novice, maybe a 5-10 count, then look for something sharper if you feel you need it.</li>
            <li> a very good price i think it was about .14 cents per blade so with 25 im good to go for a long time its better than paying 2.35 roughly per blade and they are nice and sharp 5 stars</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my brother in law. It was what he needed to go with the razor he got for his birthday.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve ordered these blades.  I tried a few different brands from Walgreen&#x27;s and Walmart and these out preform them by far.  Great price too!  Got them in 4 days.</li>
            <li> I too read many of the reviews trying to decide which blades to buy. OVerall the consensus seemed to be these were for beginners.  That seems a fair assessment, but I tried them anyways. Here&#x27;s what my experience has been:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy shave&lt;br /&gt;Few/no nicks and cuts&lt;br /&gt;Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Blades dull quickly and easily&lt;br /&gt;More ingrown whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Requires multiple strokes to get all the stubble&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still way better than a disposable cartridge razor.  I would recommend for someone with thin or very fine facial hair.  If you&#x27;re beard is thick, heavy, or the whiskers are like wire try the Wilkinson Sword stuff.</li>
            <li> Blades are so dull that I can do better with my kitchen knife.&lt;br /&gt;Nobody will like them even for free.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, nice packaging. sharp works great.  This has brought me back to using a safety razors and cost less than disposable razors and works just as good.</li>
            <li> These are really good blades, try them!!</li>
            <li> Goodbye razor burn!!!! I only get 1 or 2 shaves before dull but man is it worth it at 4$ for 25. Only blades to not give me razor burn and im a happy man. Ill be buying these from now on.</li>
            <li> A good blade for a beginner in the world of DE razors; sharp enough to start out with but not so sharp as to do permanent damage!  Also good as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; blade t compare others against.</li>
            <li> Pretty good razor blades. Definitely the best bang for your buck you can get. Better than the merkur blade that came with my razor. Pulls a bit when I shave around my chin, but not sure I can blame the blade for that.</li>
            <li> For the price a good shave.  However I only get 2 shaves out of them before they start to tug.</li>
            <li> These razors are not really consistent.  I found that some razors are better than others in the 5 blade package.</li>
            <li> These were only good for one shave each. Unfortunately, i&#x27;m not sure how that compares to others. But, i&#x27;m definitely not a fan of these. On the upside, the blade does give a nice shave initially.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh or brutal on your face.  They are a little softer than you would expect and sometimes you need a double pass.  Smooth gliding with no catching to speak of.  Only had one nick in a month and that was my fault, not the blades.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> These blades are great !!!&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved at least 10 times now and the&lt;br /&gt;blade is sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these blades&lt;br /&gt;over the fancy multiple blade setups&lt;br /&gt;and they cost a fraction of multiple blades..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W.Boggs .... Brewster, Wa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and was trying out a range of blades. Derby&#x27;s appear to be pretty popular, so they were on the list to try. These didn&#x27;t work out too well for me. I have somewhat sensitive skin and these things took it for a spin around the block. Very uncomfortable shave and very bad razor burn. No regrets, though... they just didn&#x27;t work out for ME. I used a 60&#x27;s super speed with these.</li>
            <li> This blade is great.  I was purchasing blades at the market.  What a mistake that was.  Derby blades last at least four days for me.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I went back and looked in my stash of DE Blades and thought I would revisit some blades I had written off - either due to lack of knowledge or popular consensus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leads me to the Derby DE  Blades - probably the most controversial blade out there - you either Love Them or Hate Them.* I had gotten a pack with my EJ DE89 and had thought they were pretty good but was eager to try &amp;#34;Some New Stuff!&amp;#34; So into the stash they went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently acquired a Fatip Piccolo a razor I love but even with a forgiving Bic Chrome I found it to be aggressive. Just kept on getting nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after reading the never ending opus of I Love Derby/I Hate Derby Blade Reviews and watching a few videos - I thought WTH?! So I have been using a Derby Blade in my Fatip and I (who have a thick graying stubble) am more than pleased -not only did I achieve a BBS Shave In 2 passes with touch ups but no nicks, cuts or irritation. The shave was smooth and I got that satisfying scritch noise during shaving when you know your razor is giving you a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have to say I am in the I Love Derby Camp with my other Favorite Blades being Polsilver Super Iridium and Bic Chrome Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage all of you who can keep an open mind do a little experimenting and try or retry the Derby DE Blades in different Razors. I know I will be probably be using Derbys in some of my more aggressive razors as they give a smooth, close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave on Friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When I note controversial - I mean just that. I have never read such a divisive pairing of reviews on Amazon - those who Love Derby Blades sing their praises &amp;#34;The Best, Excellent, The Only Blade I&#x27;ll use&amp;#34; - to the polar opposite of those Who Hate Derby Blades -writing them off as &amp;#34;Garbage, Butter Knife Blades, Never Again, and Typing Paper!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!!! Makes you wonder if they are reviewing the same DE Blade?!</li>
            <li> I have newly returned to the world of DE shaving, having grown up with the practice and switching to multi-blades for decades. I bought a Jagger razor and the Derby blades and have been experimenting with them since. I have very sensitive skin and have had issues with razor burn and irritation. I have purchased other blades (Merkur, Shark, Feather, etc.) as well as a Parker razor. In coming weeks I am going to experiment with different blade/razor combinations to see what works for me. As far as the Derby blades go- the price is right. For the performance:I have lighter than average beard growth and shave daily, I only get 4 shaves per Derby blade before it is rendered dull. Will revisit this review after I find the right combination that works for me.</li>
            <li> Dunno, what is one to say. They work well in the razor and are a value. I do keep a old pill bottle on the bathroom counter to put the old blades in. That way anyone having to go back into the garbage is not cut.&lt;br /&gt;  Just a tip form your Uncle Ken.</li>
            <li> These are a lot sharper than other blades I&#x27;ve used. Forget about a second pass without reapplying cream to get a few stray hairs. If that&#x27;s what you are looking for than go for it, but I found they were a bit to cutty for my face and they didn&#x27;t make up for it by doing a better job then other blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I get about 4 to 5 shave&#x27;s per blade......i didn&#x27;t need to try other blades after many reviews..very pleased with purchase..will order a couple more derby razor blades... to stock up....</li>
            <li> love these blades, they are smooth, still cut well, i dont have to go over the same spot more than twice, for sensitive skin, these are good, price is right too for the pack, i like to use them only twice, i feel after two times it gets dull.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp.  I would put them below Personna whereas Feather being the sharpest.</li>
            <li> I was comparing these to Feather razors. Just feel that Feather is the better product. I&#x27;m keeping these in case I run out of Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Cuts great, great price, overall love this product. It cuts pretty well and I&#x27;ve yet to nick myself once, plus for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse facial hair and pretty sensitive skin. The Derby was the first blade I used that I liked. After a couple years of shaving with a DE razor, they are basically the bottom of the barrel with regards to blades I shave with. The Shark Super Chrome replaced Derby the first time I used one. And the Astra Superior Platinum has been a fantastic daily shaver in all of my safety razors. And they&#x27;re both priced comparably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;They are reasonably sharp. You will get a close shave with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;They are consistent.&lt;br /&gt;Less expensive than some more advanced blades out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you have coarse facial hair, these blades don&#x27;t stand up to multiple shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Beyond 2 shaves, my face suffers as a result from the lack of durability. I&#x27;m talking about cuts, not just nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;As a beginner, this blade is probably good enough if you&#x27;re willing to change out your blades every day or every other day. If you have fine facial hair, this blade is probably good enough. If you have sensitive skin or coarse facial hair, you will likely be unhappy with these blades. They are priced at a pretty average price point and there are better (read: sharper, more forgiving) blades out there at this price point.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor for a few years now mainly to save money on razor blades and I have saved a ton. It is worth it. As far as Derby blades are concerned, for me they last long and give a decent shave. The cheaper ones I have bought at Wal Mart or Krogers etc., shaved just as good but didn&#x27;t last as long. This all depends on how your beard is and how often you shave. I shave daily or every other day, and my beard is average; not course or fine; I can grow a beard but it takes a couple of weeks to look good. I am not impressed with Derby but they are good price. I plan to upgrade to a sharper blade, but it will be awhile; I have the 25 ct and that will last me a couple of years, and I am not in any hurry.</li>
            <li> Sharp, long-lasting DE blades.  Not the sharpest or the closest shave, but almost certainly the best value on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought a sampler back in July since I had just gotten into DE shaving. I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard and only shave every few days since my beard growth isn&#x27;t crazy fast either. But Derby blades gave me the most uncomfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I actually prefer the Wilkinson Sword brand over those cause they actually feel like they have an edge and aren&#x27;t as abrasive on my skin. I also have to do more passes over my face with these blades so irritated skin is unavoidable. Also, it&#x27;s the only blade to ever give me little nicks and drags in certain areas on my face. In total, I&#x27;ve only used two blades: When I first bought the sampler and tried these first, disliked it after 3 shaves and threw the blade away, and the second one just the other day to see if maybe they&#x27;ll work again. Nope, they don&#x27;t. Still just as bad as when I first tried them. Not sure what to do with the rest of &#x27;em since I hate the idea of throwing them away.</li>
            <li> These blades get the job done, but they are not as good as the Merkur blade that came with my razor.  I get more nicks with these blades and the shave doesn&#x27;t seem quite as close, although still much closer than &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; shaving systems.  Good value, though.</li>
            <li> They dont fit the razor. I would not buy these again. If they did fit they would cut your face all to pieces.</li>
            <li> These are great! they will slice you to ribbons if you&#x27;re not careful while installing but a boot-camp close shave is guaranteed!</li>
            <li> Ima white dude, 54 years, average beard, nice badger brush, good shave cream... blah blah blah etc... on a superior face :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using de&#x27;s about 8 years, over that time I&#x27;ve tried dozen + top brands from different sampler packs. Had a 3 day growth to tame but couldn&#x27;t even manage to finish both sides with this crappy blade... ouch! it was more akin to \\&quot;Hacking\\&quot; vs shaving. I finished shaving with a (first time try) \\&quot;Astra Superior Platinum\\&quot; blade, so far, it has really impressed me. My standard has been Shark but figured I&#x27;de experiment a bit. Shame on Derby for making/ selling this. Shaves like a serrated blade! I actually put tape over the Derby pack with word \\&quot;DANGER\\&quot;. Now I have to figure out how to clean blood from between the keys of my laptop. Ka-Ka blade. \\&quot;Danger Will Robinson!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They are good but not the best. I don&#x27;t get a close shave if I shave after a few days.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor.  After reading some of the reviews that have been posted concerning these, I decided to purchase 25 along with some feather brand blades and a merkur razor to compare them.  With that said, these gave me a decent cut.  But they certainly weren&#x27;t as sharp as the feathers.  Fresh out of the package they cut as well as the feathers did on the second or third cut, that is they pulled a little bit.  They are a terrific value though, and this should be taken into consideration.  That is why I gave them 4 stars.  But I will continue to experiment with different brands.</li>
            <li> These are NOT dull blades like most people with heavy beards say.I have a heavy beard as well.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I used these in my RiMei razor with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap as the shaving soap in hot water, they would shave fantastically!!They last only 2-3 shaves on me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RiMei razor is also available on amazon.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Silver-Double-Shaver-Nonslip-Handle/dp/B0050HO9MI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1347412755&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;silver+tone+razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving these blades a rating of 4 since there was one dull blade in the pack.Incidentally that was the first one I tried from the pack.So, I felt that Derbys are probably not for me.However, after a few days, since I had 4 blades left, I thought of giving them another try.In fact,the rest of the blades were really nice. I would recommend these as trial blades to anyone.You may end up using them as the blades for everyday shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a lighter note,these make me wanna shave twice a day :)</li>
            <li> To start off with the price blades are extremely cheap compared to Merkur, feather, shark chrome etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are reasonably sharp and with the right lather/soap should give no cuts/irratation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad these blades DULL fast and I mean fast I can tell the difference between first and 2nd shave. But they are cheap so it evens out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid as much as $.79/blade with other brands (never mind the nonsense of several dollars per cartridge, if one chooses that extremely expensive method).  What a value these are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades shave as nicely as other brands I&#x27;ve used and last equally long.  The packaging of the blades is smaller than traditional methods and generates less waste.  I recommend these as a great value.</li>
            <li> I have been useing these for a few months now and they work great. I change the blade out once a week and never go without a great shave. You can&#x27;t beat these blades.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best bladesfor my extremely coarse facial hair but have great performance for the price.  Compared to the strange exotic brands you find in multi-blade sampler packs - the Derby&#x27;s are superior.  After trying both Astra and Derby, I&#x27;d go with Derby.  Only Feather tops it in my book.  I still have quite a few brands to try...</li>
            <li> use this product only for my neck so i don&#x27;t know how it is on face as i use an electric shaver for my face. however, on my neck its great.  leave my face feeling soft and bare.</li>
            <li> I use different blades for different areas.  I use this blade in a Merkur 180to shave my head.  I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> great quality, shipped quick. fit in my razor as expected. very good quality containers also, certainly will but them again</li>
            <li> The razor blades were surprisingly better then I had anticipated.I would probably order them again in the future if possible</li>
            <li> The only blades I use. I bought a hundred pack after this purchase. I tried feather, merkur and these. I stuck with these because they are very merciful and provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> This manufacturer has created a dull blade that tuggs and pulls on longer beard stubble. Simply put, if you have coarse hairs, this product will PULL your hairs very often. These are the last blades I use when I run out of the Feathers. Of course, Derby Extras are very forgiving if you are just starting out with a double edge blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just starting out, choose Merkur and you won&#x27;t regret it. Merkur is slightly sharper but allows you to have less tugging and more cutting through. Then, when you get more comfortable with less nicking, grab the Feather Platinum Coated blades and learn to use those. Then you are an unofficial professional of the double edged razor shaving club of the world.</li>
            <li> My First Safety Razor Blades.. So I am not a expert but they work well and I get about 5 shaves out of a blade</li>
            <li> I received a pack of 5 with my new Edwin Jager DE razor . The first one I used was great , I even got 6 or more shaves out of it. The second one, about cut my face off. I changed that one and installed the third one ,and it was pulling the hair out of my face. The fourth one worked OK on one side and not the other. One more to go and I will be starting my sample pack ! I&#x27;m hoping the razor god put his brand in there, after what I&#x27;ve been going through with the derby&#x27;s. Happy shaving Gent&#x27;s !! I am giving one star because I have gotten one good blade out of four so far , couldn&#x27;t wait for the fifth ! may not even try it !</li>
            <li> I have only used 2 of the blades for 3 shaves each as I&#x27;m testing 8 other kinds. They seem to be satisfactory in that they remove whiskers,no razor burn, and no nics. Time will tell. Service from Amazon was excellent and has been every time I&lt;br /&gt;have ordered from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Don C. Allis</li>
            <li> As you will read in many of the reviews, blades are a personal preference first and for most so do yourself a favor and buy a sample pack. Personally​ I found the Derbys to be very stiff and not a sharp as the Astra Blades.  It ended up to be a rough and choppy shave.</li>
            <li> Best blade for my Edwin jagger de89!super slick shave! Get maybe 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade! Definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> These blades seem to be the best for me, every person has their opinions but for me these seem to shave the best and they are some of the cheapest blades. I stick to these but try to buy in the 100 bundle</li>
            <li> These were recommended to me.  What I found is that the quality control is very bad.  Some blades are great and give 5-8 good smooth shaves, others are dull out of the wrapper, and still others are good on one side and dull on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price.  I&#x27;m going back to something American made</li>
            <li> They are not as aggressive as some others which may be good for those who are new to the art of shaving with a safety razor.  My skin is a little sensitive.  With these blades I have much less nicking</li>
            <li> Excellent shave, both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I use a Feather razor and have used Feather blades. I get more easy, good shaves with Derby blades, despite a subjective feeling that the Feather blades are actually somewhat sharper when new. I get more _good_, easy shaves with Derby blades. Feather blades start to pull faster than Derby.</li>
            <li> New to double edge razor shaving. No problems with this razor blade. Only nicked myself once first time shaving. Close even  shave, better that what I used to get with the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; style multi bladed razors. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and shave only at night, so I get around three shaves with blade. So far very happy with change to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; style shaving.</li>
            <li> I like these blades, seem to fit my face better than the Merkur blades did.&lt;br /&gt;Will rebuy when these are up :)</li>
            <li> These do a fairly good job and they are inexpensive.  The one shortcoming that really stands out is when I let my stubble grow for 5-6 days -- this will destroy a new Derby in one use.  Terrible razor burn, and the blade is Dead.  But when I was shaving every morning before going to work, these got the job done without breaking the bank.  But for a night of intimate contact, I&#x27;ll use a Wilkinson Sword or Astra in my Merkur HD Long Handle.</li>
            <li> If you know what you&#x27;re doing you can get a BBS shave with almost any razor. I can recommend at least a half dozen blades I prefer to Derby (which I used for years) but it&#x27;s not as bad a shave as many report. You might love them and you&#x27;ll have to shave with them to find out.</li>
            <li> If you have a safety razor, these blades will do you well.  They&#x27;re inexpensive, and they cut great.  I try and limit it to 3 or 4 shaves per side of the blade, so I get 12-16 shaves out of one blade - way cheaper than a Mach 3 or something else!</li>
            <li> These are the only Double Edge razor blades I have used.  Gives me a nice shave.  Wish I could get more than a few shaves out of each blade, but most likely I am not caring for the blades or prepping properly.  Nice packaging and easy to use.  Never going back to electric or disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Derby blades are not the sharpest blades out there - This is not news to anyone who has done some research on their DE blades. It is nice to get them in bulk, and there is nothing wrong with the product (no crazy, warped blades that I have found thus far). The only thing I would say is make sure and get more than one type of blade unless you know they work for your beard type. At least for me, these are just a little too dull and pull more than they cut.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting a shave like those exorbitant priced 5 blade razors, but that&#x27;s what I got. Man, these blades are really sharp and so smooth I didn&#x27;t think at first they were cutting til I touched my baby smooth face.  These blades are worth every penny spent instead of every dollar spent on the 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this, but after using Feathers brand... these are not even in contention.  I ran out of Feathers, so in a pinch I used these that came with my razor and I was sorely disappointed. However, your milage may very if you have a softer beard.</li>
            <li> My husband still uses the 2 sided razor to&lt;br /&gt;shave. He loves these blades; they are not&lt;br /&gt;sold everywhere anymore. He&#x27;s a happy camper&lt;br /&gt;now that he has his blade supply.</li>
            <li> Sharp, but not so sharp that they take a layer of face with the hair!&lt;br /&gt;No pulls or tugs, just a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> My beard grows pretty thick and is pretty stiff by the next morning.  My razor came with an Astra Superior Platinum blade and I was very happy with it but thought I&#x27;d try a few other brands out.  These blades dulled incredibly fast, with them already tugging by my third use.  The Astra I got almost 5 days out of it before it just started pulling.  I thought maybe the first one was a dud so I tried a second blade, but this one was even worse and seemed to have an issue with bending uniformly in my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least these were cheap so I&#x27;m not too upset about throwing them all out.  They&#x27;d be fine if you used a new blade each day, but there is other blades that are similarly priced that are much more consistent and sharp.</li>
