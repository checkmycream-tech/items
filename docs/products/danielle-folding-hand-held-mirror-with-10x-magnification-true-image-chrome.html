            <li>Great mirror!</li>
            <li>My perfect travel makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>A great magnifying mirror</li>
            <li>It might be a great mirror, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love the mirror, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Needed a good travel mirror and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is good quality glass.</li>
            <li>Really strong casing, very handy to hold</li>
            <li>10X magnification is exactly what I wanted and this gives a great image.  </li>
            <li>but experience has taught me better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is much nicer than the hand mirror I had been using because it is good quality construciton.</li>
            <li>A top-notch mirror with added feature of being able to fold up the handle and take less space.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use either as a hand mirror or to fold into a stand-alone mirror.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easily angled construction.  </li>
            <li>In general it is compact, durable, and I love that it can stand on its own.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and handle and stands exactly where you want it and at the angle</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t resist the far superior clarity of both the 10X mirror and the regular mirror; I&#x27;ve never found any other that could compare to the excellent quality of these mirrors.  </li>
            <li>Actually it&#x27;s great for everyday use too.</li>
            <li>I like this hand held mirror very much, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed for applying make-up etc.</li>
            <li>I do wish it was available in a little more magnification....</li>
            <li>Regular image on one side, magnifying on the other (great for putting on eye makeup).</li>
            <li>I always come back and buy new one because it&#x27;s right size and perfect for putting my make up in the morning but not happy with the quality of the plastic they use.</li>
            <li>Advertising this with the REAL non-reversing mirrors makes it seem like</li>
            <li>What a great little mirror to hang and ot place on a table due to</li>
            <li>The plastic around the hinge of my most recent mirror crumbled and fell away so quickly,  I&#x27;m totally fed up and searching for a new mirror option.  </li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend it for anyone needing a new mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror on the other side is fine and the stand/ handle makes it useful in several settings.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the black plastic one is a little more durable, but I will never buy another of these mirrors.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The great aspects of this hand mirror is why it&#x27;s so disappointing that the plastic holder always, ALWAYS breaks at the folding hinge, usually within the first 3 months.  </li>
            <li>At first, the handle will remain firm</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have owned about a dozen of these exact same mirrors in the past ten years.  They are regularly available at Steinmart for approximately $15.00, which is still not cheap for a hand mirror.  I couldn&#x27;t resist the far superior clarity of both the 10X mirror and the regular mirror; I&#x27;ve never found any other that could compare to the excellent quality of these mirrors.  I also like the U-shaped handle ~ so space-saving and convenient to hang on a hook on the wall inside bathroom linen closet by my makeup shelf.  The great aspects of this hand mirror is why it&#x27;s so disappointing that the plastic holder always, ALWAYS breaks at the folding hinge, usually within the first 3 months.  I hoped it was just a fluke but experience has taught me better.  At first, the handle will remain firm so it&#x27;s easy to use either as a hand mirror or to fold into a stand-alone mirror.  Then the mirror begins to flop at the hinge.  This makes it necessary to hold the mirror around the plastic circle rim.  Very awkward and inconvenient.  Storage advantage is also lost.  The plastic is brittle and soon breaks at the most vulnerable point: the hinge.  The plastic around the hinge of my most recent mirror crumbled and fell away so quickly,  I&#x27;m totally fed up and searching for a new mirror option.  I stumbled across this ad on Amazon and felt this serious flaw needs to be shared.  For what it&#x27;s worth, the black plastic one is a little more durable, but I will never buy another of these mirrors.  There are plenty of discarded broken ones in a closet basket that I can hold by the rim for a long time to come!  Buyer beware because now you know.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one seeing double in the magnifying mirror?  The mirror is concave.  If I&lt;br /&gt;Look in it from a couple of feet away, the image is upside down.  Close up it is double!!  Totally useless.  The mirror on the other side is fine and the stand/ handle makes it useful in several settings.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> What a great little mirror to hang and ot place on a table due to it&#x27;s easily angled construction.  I would highly reccommend it for anyone needing a new mirror.</li>
            <li> Great mirror! Regular image on one side, magnifying on the other (great for putting on eye makeup). Stands securely in multiple positions, flat for packing. Use at home and for travel.</li>
            <li> 10X magnification is exactly what I wanted and this gives a great image.  Easy to hold and handle and stands exactly where you want it and at the angle you want.</li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s great for everyday use too. I had one of these mirrors and used it everyday and also took it with me when I traveled and eventually it broke... so I had to buy a second one. In general it is compact, durable, and I love that it can stand on its own. I would definitely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> This mirror deliveries on the magnification that I wanted.  I love it.</li>
            <li> But they were way more expensive.  Otherwise it is much nicer than the hand mirror I had been using because it is good quality construciton.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Hard to find 10x...works well.</li>
            <li> A top-notch mirror with added feature of being able to fold up the handle and take less space.</li>
            <li> Needed a good travel mirror and this fits the bill.  Mirror is good quality glass.</li>
            <li> Really strong casing, very handy to hold</li>
            <li> I like this hand held mirror very much, I would buy it again. I do wish it was available in a little more magnification....</li>
            <li> I love the mirror, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had. Having said that the holder always breaks on me into pieces, therefore 2 stars. I always come back and buy new one because it&#x27;s right size and perfect for putting my make up in the morning but not happy with the quality of the plastic they use. I guess that&#x27;s one way of keeping the sales up ... :(</li>
            <li> My perfect travel makeup mirror. Lightweight.</li>
            <li> It reflects big on one side, standard size on the other.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  A great magnifying mirror</li>
            <li> Advertising this with the REAL non-reversing mirrors makes it seem like this is one of them, but in a smaller size, but it is NOT at all like the others.  It might be a great mirror, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed for applying make-up etc.</li>
