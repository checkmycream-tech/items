            <li> The first time I used this tape it held for three weeks.  This is the only tape I use now.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but none would last as long as this one.</li>
            <li> It stays adhered to your scalp longer than the lace.  Just make sure to get the proper remover.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even hold for a day</li>
            <li> Extremely strong adhesive. Worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> these really hold.  they don&#x27;t last 2 weeks but they do hold for a day or two.  kept my wig in place during comic con.  didn&#x27;t move or slip.</li>
            <li> These strips seem to be more ideal than the B curve. The curve isn&#x27;t as deep which makes sticking it to the front edge of your hair line a lot easier in my opinion.I use tape and glue because nothing else works on me.</li>
            <li> This tape sucks. It doesn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> holds for along time but not good for people with sensitive skin even with scalp protector. only use if you have not sensitive skin</li>
            <li> they do their job well</li>
            <li> Was not the right curve but I have found another use for product.  Didn&#x27;t show proper curve style in add.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t get it.  Then i got it done. Super sick. Stayed for a weed before ii decided to put a cap and glue it to the cap away from me hair</li>
            <li> This tape is amazing.  It stays put, I can take my wig off and put it back on without changing the tape three or four days in a row. When info need to take the tape off, it comes off the wig easily with no solvent and no damage to the hairpiece,</li>
            <li> The strips work okay but will leave your hair very sticky. I work in a hot environment so my heads does lots of sweating.</li>
            <li> Great hold and easy to apply .</li>
            <li> Works good a bit thick</li>
            <li> Definitely sticky!  I actually got these to use on my CPAP mask since it leaks some and this tape is definitely sticky and did the job.  I&#x27;m sure it works well for what it is really intended.</li>
            <li> careful when using this, it really sticks, LIKE REALLY STICKS and it can be painful</li>
            <li> I really like the hold that this tape gives, it held my lace wig down for about 2 weeks with a firm gripe. On the 3 week it started to lift. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCTS TO ANY ONE!</li>
            <li> great product reliable seller! highly recommend</li>
            <li> This tape truly works for me! I prefer this over the liquid adhesive because I apply my own lace wig. The tape alleviates the mess and gives me a more accurate fit!</li>
            <li> This tape is wonderful!  Keeps your wig in place.  No need to keep adjusting wig.  Did not have any problem with tape sticking to my skin when I took my wig of.  In fact, ordering more now.</li>
            <li> The lace wig Gods shed mercy on me! I FINALLY found an adhesive that ACTUALLY WORKS!!! Thank you!!! I will be stocking up!</li>
