            <li>We are an extremely fair family and can easily burn in the sun.</li>
            <li>Of course, you have to re-apply periodically, but it is a great first line of defense!</li>
            <li>It smelled nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I went to Amazon and ordered my own bottle before my family went on a cruise to Grand Cayman this year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an ocean lifeguard for 7 years, and this is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist put me on to it, and I&#x27;m glad he did.  </li>
            <li>I love that it also moisturizes as it protects.  </li>
            <li>I like this stuff over others I&#x27;ve tried because it seems to rub in better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many that just won&#x27;t rub in no matter what.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My children don&#x27;t get skin rashes and we feel confident they are safe from excess sun.</li>
            <li>Keeps my husband safe as well, he has had melanoma and we are an outdoors family.</li>
            <li>Love the lizard.  </li>
            <li>definitely the best of all SPF 30+ suncreeen proctectors</li>

            <li>i love this product...</li>
            <li>I know how important it is to prevent them from BIRTH!  </li>
            <li>Apply once in the AM maybe once more in the afternoon...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad to say that it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>It comes out thinner and spreads better than you might expect</li>
            <li>Love all your products.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST sunscreen and the only one I take with me to the Caribbean!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended I try this many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t know that many sunscreens have ingredients in them that are cancer causing agents.</li>
            <li>The best sunscreen by a long shot</li>
            <li>Now more than ever it is important to make sure that she never has a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, and suffered from sunburns my entire childhood.  </li>
            <li>This sunblock has kept him burn free and enjoying summer.</li>
            <li>First I thought she was trying to make a pretty penny off me, but this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin well and glides on easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised this product gets so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>but, sure beats skin cancer, am I right?!?</li>
            <li>I wear this religiously during any vacation, and still get a beautiful tan without risking over exposure.</li>
            <li>best sunblock ever for the beach...hands down.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea that it does not harm the environment while providing excellent protection from the hot Southern sun.</li>
            <li>While the consistency is slightly runny this is THE BEST sunscreen my family has used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super waterproof and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the pasty kind of stuff that most other brands are, but flows nicely, so I can spread it on my skin easily.  </li>
            <li>No greasy feel but can get smooth coverage.  </li>
            <li>I like its light scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and will absolutely keep you from being burned.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for a chemical free sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Living in Florida it is important to have good sun coverage bee aboslutely love Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, takes a minute or two to soak in but does not leave your skin greasy and does not turn your clothes orange.</li>
            <li>Just rub it in and enjoy your day.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have found Blue Lizard to be a great product.</li>
            <li>Not only is this a great sunscreen (recommended by my dermatologist) with great wearability, the container turns blue whenever there are UV rays.</li>
            <li>This one goes on super easy and skin feels fine after.</li>
            <li>This may seem like a cheap gimmick, but it&#x27;s actually a nice reminder to be conscious of the sun!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals.</li>
            <li>Sure, after a few hours it&#x27;s a great idea to reapply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s without a doubt the longest lasting and most effective sun-screen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Smooth feeling, absorbs well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>It works great and made me realize how many chemicals are in the typical sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Although it is a bit heavy, it causes me no problems and protects my very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Pleased, this product really shields from burns.  </li>
            <li>I only have good opinions about this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is our absolute favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The blue container is a good reminder to put the sunscreen on and/or</li>
            <li>He also thought the color changing bottle was super cool.</li>
            <li>Soaks in quickly, its not greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a natural chemical free sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a lot better than most and doesn&#x27;t need re-application in a short time.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard, when applied properly and according to the package recommendations, is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Many times this was our only application for the day, and we were in the sun most of the days 6-8 hours.  </li>
            <li>my older boys like the most because of it.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen, it is well worth the money spent on it and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>This is the first sunblock I have ever bought that worked!</li>
            <li>I have very light and sensitive skin in a high-altitude desert, and this is my #1 go-to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My dermatoligist recommended this product a few years ago and we have used it since with great results.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny . . .</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I love how the bottle turns blue when it&#x27;s exposed to UV light.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is on the pricey side, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but the safety of this product is worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>You will smell fresh and clean the whole time too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works best if you apply it to dry skin, let it dry before going out in the sun, reapply as needed.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smoothly and kept my children from burning their winter white skin while vacationing in the Bahamas</li>
            <li>I feel this lasts longer at a higher protection level than store brands.</li>
            <li>Kinda cool that the bottle turns blue when exposed to UV light.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I first used this 11 years ago and have used it ever since.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable too!</li>
            <li>the minute you apply it, your skin feels more protected than regular sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>, I fried to a crisp.  </li>
            <li>Plus they use safe ingredients,unlike 90% of the sunscreens out there; which can actually harm you.</li>
            <li>Yes, sure it leaves a pearlescent white sheen, but did I mention that it works?</li>
            <li>last many hours after application.</li>
            <li>My skin was hot.</li>
            <li>We have always made sure our kids were properly protected when going out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Kids used it all summer 6 days a week in the pool and it has not failed on them yet.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a tan, but don&#x27;t want to get burnt to a crisp, this is your product.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid golfer</li>
            <li>It has all the right ingredients and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>A little greasy but covers exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>After much research on safe sunscreens we tried Blue Lizard and now will use nothing else.</li>
            <li>My son has eczema &amp; super sensitive skin &amp; always complains that sunscreen BURNS!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to wear any sunscreen because I think all of them (the good ones) are a little too heavy, but I also care about skin.</li>
            <li>Even better, this product is such fantastic sunscreen that we use it for the entire family.</li>
            <li>this sunscreen came highly recommended by my dermatologist and she was right.  </li>
            <li>I burn easily, but have never burned if I put on Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li>While the sunscreen worked fine in Maine and NY, we recently went to Aruba.  </li>
            <li>It stays on very well in water.  </li>
            <li>I really feel protected with this sunscreen at the beach.  </li>
            <li>Really protects you.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this suncreen!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all I ask for...</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Bought this looking for a sunscreen that really works &amp; isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>but this really dries my daughters skin out on her face.  </li>
            <li>really worked\\&quot; as he did not have any sunburn at all after using this product.</li>
            <li>We like the product so much we bought another bottle.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was very diligent about it, so</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing after a 30 minute swim and one hour walk.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>We really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the sensitive version of this product is better, but only if you don&#x27;t sweat and don&#x27;t go in the water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out</li>
            <li>It blends in nicely, without a ghostly pale effect or overly oily appearance.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy like many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>people who are normally allergic to creams and sunscreens are not allergic to this one !  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing, however, is the fact that there are no toxic chemicals, like in virtually every other mainstream sunblock.  </li>
            <li>So many of the other sunscreens have so many other chemicals in them that I was breaking out from them.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their skin from the sun.</li>
            <li>Our Very Water Resistant Regular and Sport formulas meet the most stringent Australian Standards which are 240 minutes in whirlpool water, making them over three times as water resistant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blue bottle was cool?</li>
            <li>She did not get burned once this whole summer (and we live in South Texas).</li>
            <li>The Blue Lizard for kids is also a great buy if you are looking for something that stays on and tends not to irritate delicate skin.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and performed as expected -- no sunburn on my very fair-complected son, even on a 5 day fishing trip in FL!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My dermitlogist highly recommended this product for one reason, it works.</li>
            <li>He said he highly recommends it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>High zinc content, as recommended by dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Comes highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
            <li>Plus the bottle turns bright blue when the sun&#x27;s rays are dangerous, which I find pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>This product truly works protecting you from the sun&#x27;s rays (hey, I live in FL).  </li>
            <li>Definitely my new fave.</li>
            <li>It states 100% chemical free and lists zinc oxide 6% as the active ingredient in the online description.  </li>
            <li>no yellow shirts ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular and sport line of Blue Lizard sunscreen is not listed as chemical free on the company&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>I was devastated, after all I&#x27;ve read about how even one sunburn on a very young child can increase their risk of skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I have just spent a full week in Saint Thomas in JULY</li>
            <li>The cool factor of the bottle turning blue had the children wanting to be \\&quot;Slathered with the Blue Stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses the sensitive formula because she has very sensitive</li>
            <li>and it can look pretty pasty at first, but it does become less opaque as you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard has the least amount of harmful chemicals while it has the most amount of protection!</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit to rub in because of its high SPF (it&#x27;s lotiony, just really opaque) but it&#x27;s worth it, because does the job like no other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in MOSTLY clear.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who always developed a rash in the sun.</li>
            <li>Thanks Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>I had no problems as far as breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I had complete protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>My child has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle is white, but when it&#x27;s exposed to enough UV light that you need sunscreen, it turns blue to let you know you need to put it on!</li>
            <li>Works very well at preventing sunburn and seems to last through swimming.</li>
            <li>I used it on my 6-month old and the 2-year old.  </li>
            <li>get out of the sun completely.</li>
            <li>Recommended by pediatrician for our child with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and although it&#x27;s more expensive - it&#x27;s worth the protection for your skin.  </li>
            <li>It works too, I burn so easy and for an average day (4 to 5 hours) of being in direct sun outside swimming, I have never needed to re-apply.</li>
            <li>I got some from my dermatologist, as I was looking for a high SPF sunscreen especially for my face.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend Blue Lizard!!</li>
            <li>We took a large bottle of some regular sun screen with us and all it did was provide extra weight in our luggage.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the higher price, it did not make me itch, does not smell bad, and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>She was able to stay out in the sun and water without getting the least bit red.</li>
            <li>It does take longer than most to get on, it&#x27;s very thick and a lot goes a long way--you really have to rub this stuff in.  </li>
            <li>no excessive perfumes...has all the necessary products to protect your children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>He was from New Mexico and had blue eyes and blonde hair, as did his three young children.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen is thick, so it actually feels like you are apply a good lotion instead of a runny mess.  </li>
            <li>the serious bonus is the healthy star of approval this product gets from the environmental working group - thank you blue lizard!!!</li>
            <li>no regrets...</li>
            <li>Only the baby and sensitive lines are listed as such----the drawback is that they are then not water/sweat resistant.  </li>
            <li>No stinging skin, no sunburn and the zinc is really apparent.  </li>
            <li>Most physical sunscreens go on thickly and don&#x27;t blend well, leaving skin white and sticky.</li>
            <li>Love this - goes on a little white and thick... but pays off with no sun burn.. buy the large jug.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little runnier than I first expected, which resulted in an extra handful of sunscreen on he first use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>After lubing up very well and letting it sit for half an hour I trekked out to the ocean.</li>
            <li>Still thick, and absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, it is a little more massaging to rub it in than most of the suncreens I&#x27;ve used in the past, but nothing to difficult at all.</li>
            <li>for this price, i might as well get something that pure mineral, with just a few ingredients i understand how to pronounce.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> We are an extremely fair family and can easily burn in the sun.</li>
            <li> Of course, you have to re-apply periodically, but it is a great first line of defense!</li>
            <li> It smelled nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I went to Amazon and ordered my own bottle before my family went on a cruise to Grand Cayman this year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an ocean lifeguard for 7 years, and this is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist put me on to it, and I&#x27;m glad he did.  </li>
            <li> I love that it also moisturizes as it protects.  </li>
            <li> I like this stuff over others I&#x27;ve tried because it seems to rub in better.  </li>

            <li> i love it.</li>

            <li> This is the BEST sunscreen and the only one I take with me to the Caribbean!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I try this many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t know that many sunscreens have ingredients in them that are cancer causing agents.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen by a long shot</li>
            <li> Now more than ever it is important to make sure that she never has a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, and suffered from sunburns my entire childhood.  </li>
            <li> This sunblock has kept him burn free and enjoying summer.</li>
            <li> First I thought she was trying to make a pretty penny off me, but this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin well and glides on easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this product gets so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> but, sure beats skin cancer, am I right?!?</li>
            <li> I wear this religiously during any vacation, and still get a beautiful tan without risking over exposure.</li>
            <li> best sunblock ever for the beach...hands down.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea that it does not harm the environment while providing excellent protection from the hot Southern sun.</li>
            <li> While the consistency is slightly runny this is THE BEST sunscreen my family has used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super waterproof and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the pasty kind of stuff that most other brands are, but flows nicely, so I can spread it on my skin easily.  </li>
            <li> No greasy feel but can get smooth coverage.  </li>
            <li> I like its light scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and will absolutely keep you from being burned.</li>

            <li> It goes on smoothly, takes a minute or two to soak in but does not leave your skin greasy and does not turn your clothes orange.</li>
            <li> Just rub it in and enjoy your day.</li>

            <li> This sunscreen is fantastic.</li>

            <li> Not only is this a great sunscreen (recommended by my dermatologist) with great wearability, the container turns blue whenever there are UV rays.</li>
            <li> This one goes on super easy and skin feels fine after.</li>
            <li> This may seem like a cheap gimmick, but it&#x27;s actually a nice reminder to be conscious of the sun!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals.</li>
            <li> Sure, after a few hours it&#x27;s a great idea to reapply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s without a doubt the longest lasting and most effective sun-screen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Smooth feeling, absorbs well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> It works great and made me realize how many chemicals are in the typical sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Although it is a bit heavy, it causes me no problems and protects my very fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Pleased, this product really shields from burns.  </li>
            <li> I only have good opinions about this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is our absolute favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The blue container is a good reminder to put the sunscreen on and/or</li>
            <li> He also thought the color changing bottle was super cool.</li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly, its not greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a natural chemical free sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a lot better than most and doesn&#x27;t need re-application in a short time.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard, when applied properly and according to the package recommendations, is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Many times this was our only application for the day, and we were in the sun most of the days 6-8 hours.  </li>
            <li> my older boys like the most because of it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, it is well worth the money spent on it and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunblock I have ever bought that worked!</li>
            <li> I have very light and sensitive skin in a high-altitude desert, and this is my #1 go-to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My dermatoligist recommended this product a few years ago and we have used it since with great results.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny . . .</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I love how the bottle turns blue when it&#x27;s exposed to UV light.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is on the pricey side, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but the safety of this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> You will smell fresh and clean the whole time too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works best if you apply it to dry skin, let it dry before going out in the sun, reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and smoothly and kept my children from burning their winter white skin while vacationing in the Bahamas</li>
            <li> I feel this lasts longer at a higher protection level than store brands.</li>
            <li> Kinda cool that the bottle turns blue when exposed to UV light.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I first used this 11 years ago and have used it ever since.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable too!</li>
            <li> the minute you apply it, your skin feels more protected than regular sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> , I fried to a crisp.  </li>
            <li> Plus they use safe ingredients,unlike 90% of the sunscreens out there; which can actually harm you.</li>
            <li> Yes, sure it leaves a pearlescent white sheen, but did I mention that it works?</li>
            <li> last many hours after application.</li>
            <li> My skin was hot.</li>
            <li> We have always made sure our kids were properly protected when going out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Kids used it all summer 6 days a week in the pool and it has not failed on them yet.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a tan, but don&#x27;t want to get burnt to a crisp, this is your product.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid golfer</li>
            <li> It has all the right ingredients and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> A little greasy but covers exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> After much research on safe sunscreens we tried Blue Lizard and now will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema &amp; super sensitive skin &amp; always complains that sunscreen BURNS!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to wear any sunscreen because I think all of them (the good ones) are a little too heavy, but I also care about skin.</li>
            <li> Even better, this product is such fantastic sunscreen that we use it for the entire family.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen came highly recommended by my dermatologist and she was right.  </li>
            <li> I burn easily, but have never burned if I put on Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li> While the sunscreen worked fine in Maine and NY, we recently went to Aruba.  </li>
            <li> It stays on very well in water.  </li>
            <li> I really feel protected with this sunscreen at the beach.  </li>
            <li> Really protects you.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this suncreen!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really all I ask for...</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Bought this looking for a sunscreen that really works &amp; isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> but this really dries my daughters skin out on her face.  </li>
            <li> really worked\\&quot; as he did not have any sunburn at all after using this product.</li>
            <li> We like the product so much we bought another bottle.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was very diligent about it, so</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing after a 30 minute swim and one hour walk.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> We really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the sensitive version of this product is better, but only if you don&#x27;t sweat and don&#x27;t go in the water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out</li>
            <li> It blends in nicely, without a ghostly pale effect or overly oily appearance.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy like many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> people who are normally allergic to creams and sunscreens are not allergic to this one !  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing, however, is the fact that there are no toxic chemicals, like in virtually every other mainstream sunblock.  </li>
            <li> So many of the other sunscreens have so many other chemicals in them that I was breaking out from them.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> Our Very Water Resistant Regular and Sport formulas meet the most stringent Australian Standards which are 240 minutes in whirlpool water, making them over three times as water resistant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blue bottle was cool?</li>
            <li> She did not get burned once this whole summer (and we live in South Texas).</li>
            <li> The Blue Lizard for kids is also a great buy if you are looking for something that stays on and tends not to irritate delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and performed as expected -- no sunburn on my very fair-complected son, even on a 5 day fishing trip in FL!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My dermitlogist highly recommended this product for one reason, it works.</li>
            <li> He said he highly recommends it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> High zinc content, as recommended by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Comes highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
            <li> Plus the bottle turns bright blue when the sun&#x27;s rays are dangerous, which I find pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> This product truly works protecting you from the sun&#x27;s rays (hey, I live in FL).  </li>
            <li> Definitely my new fave.</li>
            <li> It states 100% chemical free and lists zinc oxide 6% as the active ingredient in the online description.  </li>
            <li> no yellow shirts ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular and sport line of Blue Lizard sunscreen is not listed as chemical free on the company&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> I was devastated, after all I&#x27;ve read about how even one sunburn on a very young child can increase their risk of skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have just spent a full week in Saint Thomas in JULY</li>
            <li> The cool factor of the bottle turning blue had the children wanting to be \\&quot;Slathered with the Blue Stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses the sensitive formula because she has very sensitive</li>
            <li> and it can look pretty pasty at first, but it does become less opaque as you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard has the least amount of harmful chemicals while it has the most amount of protection!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to rub in because of its high SPF (it&#x27;s lotiony, just really opaque) but it&#x27;s worth it, because does the job like no other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in MOSTLY clear.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who always developed a rash in the sun.</li>
            <li> Thanks Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> I had no problems as far as breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I had complete protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li> My child has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is white, but when it&#x27;s exposed to enough UV light that you need sunscreen, it turns blue to let you know you need to put it on!</li>
            <li> Works very well at preventing sunburn and seems to last through swimming.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 6-month old and the 2-year old.  </li>
            <li> get out of the sun completely.</li>
            <li> Recommended by pediatrician for our child with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and although it&#x27;s more expensive - it&#x27;s worth the protection for your skin.  </li>
            <li> It works too, I burn so easy and for an average day (4 to 5 hours) of being in direct sun outside swimming, I have never needed to re-apply.</li>
            <li> I got some from my dermatologist, as I was looking for a high SPF sunscreen especially for my face.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend Blue Lizard!!</li>
            <li> We took a large bottle of some regular sun screen with us and all it did was provide extra weight in our luggage.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the higher price, it did not make me itch, does not smell bad, and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> She was able to stay out in the sun and water without getting the least bit red.</li>
            <li> It does take longer than most to get on, it&#x27;s very thick and a lot goes a long way--you really have to rub this stuff in.  </li>
            <li> no excessive perfumes...has all the necessary products to protect your children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> He was from New Mexico and had blue eyes and blonde hair, as did his three young children.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen is thick, so it actually feels like you are apply a good lotion instead of a runny mess.  </li>
            <li> the serious bonus is the healthy star of approval this product gets from the environmental working group - thank you blue lizard!!!</li>
            <li> no regrets...</li>
            <li> Only the baby and sensitive lines are listed as such----the drawback is that they are then not water/sweat resistant.  </li>
            <li> No stinging skin, no sunburn and the zinc is really apparent.  </li>
            <li> Most physical sunscreens go on thickly and don&#x27;t blend well, leaving skin white and sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this - goes on a little white and thick... but pays off with no sun burn.. buy the large jug.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little runnier than I first expected, which resulted in an extra handful of sunscreen on he first use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> After lubing up very well and letting it sit for half an hour I trekked out to the ocean.</li>
            <li> Still thick, and absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, it is a little more massaging to rub it in than most of the suncreens I&#x27;ve used in the past, but nothing to difficult at all.</li>
            <li> for this price, i might as well get something that pure mineral, with just a few ingredients i understand how to pronounce.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old is on a medication that makes his skin extremely photosensitive.  </li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way with this stuff</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s golf friends joke that he&#x27;s &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; immediately after application, and it does turn you white initially, but that effect doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> This is not chemical free!&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed to pay $24 for a bottle of &#x27;chemical free&#x27; sunscreen only to flip the bottle around to see oxybenzone listed as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the sensitive, baby or face formulas for chemical free products.</li>
            <li> After having a melanoma removed, I am now diligent about using Blue Lizard sunscreen, wearing hats, long sleeves, etc.  </li>
            <li> The regular lasts for the 4 hours as long as you:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> The other bottles, of similar Blue Lizard products all had 2 years left on their expiration dates.</li>
            <li> apply on dry skin and let sit for 15 minutes prior to sun exposure</li>
            <li> We use the regular for water/sweat activities and the sensitive for everyday.  </li>
            <li> So much more expensive than the other stuff, yes.  </li>
            <li> My kids had to learn not to &#x27;rub eyes dry&#x27; as this did cause a slight burn on cheeks the first few times we used it.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor, pricy, but a bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And one application lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has long staying power.  </li>
            <li> reason leads me to believe that they can only claim 80min due to US regulations, and only claim 30+SPF due to Australian regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the entire time and did get mildly pink on his legs,</li>
            <li> We spent the next week at the beach, and my nephew (15 y/o) told me \\&quot;it</li>
            <li> but of this stuff goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> Will use this stuff as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Wish it would rub in and then feel dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has the exact same ingredients as all the other far less expensive sunscreens.</li>
            <li> She just played a 4 day soccer tournament, one of the days we spent 10 hours outside at the fields, and absolutely no burns!  </li>
            <li> Previous sun products tuned his clothes orange so when a friend recommended Blue Lizard we had to try it.</li>
            <li> This past summer we were running low on our trip and my husband decided to use the banana boat SPF 30 and 2 hours later he was cooked.</li>
            <li> I was on a five day cruise and used this 2x daily, i spent the everyday out on the highest desk of the ship and did not get a single burn.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve worn nearly every day for at least 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would absolutely NEVER travel to a tropical location or</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I put it on one time and get absolutely no tan or burn.</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Blue Lizard products for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Even better testimonial is my husband will actually use this too, and he is one to HATE anything creamy.</li>
            <li> A little pricy, but if you&#x27;re looking to avoid a lot of the other potentially toxic ingredients in sunscreens, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li> And since the effects last longer than the average sunscreen, so you use less.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a bit more effort to rub in than some of the other brands, and it&#x27;s not that horrible spray sunscreen that really doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I have found that this was the only product on the market that did not cause extreme eye irritation during heavy sweating.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find locally.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It worked on our Irish and Polish kids who usually spend 1 day in the sun and 5 in the shade.</li>
            <li> Skin cancer can travel to your other organs and lymph nodes.  </li>
            <li> I tried every other sunscreen on the shelf and nothing was working.  </li>
            <li> My pediatrician recommended this for my daughter who has reacted to other skin creams and soaps.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t repeat all of the other reviewers&#x27; acolades (though I agree) to save time, but I refuse to buy anything else anymore.  </li>
            <li> I believe the reason for this is due to what the US allows the product to claim.  </li>
            <li> In the end I would not use any other product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other after getting this.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s got oxybenzone in it, and a bunch of other chemicals.</li>
            <li> Other sunscreens burn and irritate my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> and it the protection lasts longer than any other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Quality sunscreen that uses the zinc blocker and not the chemicals but still goes on lighter that some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> It was already too late, I got an extreme sunburn on my shoulders, neck, ears, chest, and back.</li>
            <li> It reacts with minerals in the water, and we have hard water---so we have yellowed white shirts where the sunscreen hits.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the stuff is greasy.  </li>
            <li> skin has to be completely dry before you reapply, or it turns into a white gluey glob and won&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li> It does tend to have a slight whitish sheen even after being rubbed in, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, as I know my kids are protected.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than average sunblock</li>
            <li> It is thick and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> This was a bit scary to me as I was very young.  </li>
            <li> It is a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> And even though this is a little pricey too, reapplication is not needed as often as store bought brands</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; is a little runnier than the &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> A little</li>
            <li> A very small amount of this goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll protect you and your kiddos from the harsh summer sun.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one of the few that seems to do the job and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> it is one of the few sunscreens with zinc oxide in it.  </li>
            <li> I emailed amazon to let them know the product description is not accurate.</li>
            <li> If you start sweating, your skin may have a pale glow to it -</li>
            <li> There simply is no better sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> (I usually us a swim shirt when swimming</li>
            <li> This is usually caused by sunscreens that contain Avobenzone.</li>
            <li> Over 15 years ago, my Dermatologist removed a small brown spot from my skin and diagnosed me with basal cell carcinoma.  </li>
            <li> That being said, our youngest had a small brown mole on the bottom of her foot from birth.  </li>
            <li> The only time I have issues with sun protection is when I simply fail to apply the BL sunscreen thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have small kids who are in and out of the pool</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but I didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting it rubbed in &amp; it didn&#x27;t feel greasy or icky like some stuff does.  </li>
            <li> And the shocking thing is the 6- month old was in the direct sun hardly at all (just the unavoidable exposure from walking from boat to beach umbrella, pool to hotel lobby, etc.).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have been educated the hard way from the harmful effects of the sun, so</li>
            <li> It turns blue when dangerous rays are out.  </li>
            <li> these reasons aren&#x27;t enough, my husband suffers from a sort of sun allergy.  </li>
            <li> When they say this is waterproof, they mean it.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but even after quite a lot of use, our bottle doesn&#x27;t appear to be very empty.</li>
            <li> but this year it had risen in price to a ridiculous amount.</li>
            <li> It seem expensive</li>
            <li> but I WAS WRONG.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult applying; you&#x27;ll need to work it onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just so expensive.</li>
            <li> It blocks the dangerous rays.  </li>
            <li> I fried like piece of chicken, and came out looking like a lobster.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it&#x27;s disappointing to have kids with sunburns even when you know how and how often to apply sunscreen, and you do so.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every brand out there all the way up to spf 100 and still gotten badly BURNED.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband and I both use this.  It is a great sunscreen and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard is the only sun screen I have found that stays on all day even after swimming!</li>
            <li> Best sun block for sports  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and keep going back.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who always developed a rash in the sun. No rash using this, very happy.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor, pricy, but a bit goes a long way. I do ocean kayaking and am out in the fla sun a lot .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an ocean lifeguard for 7 years, and this is my favorite sunscreen. It does take a bit to get it to sink in, but it works even when I do not have time to reapply as often as I need to. Its the only sunscreen that works on my face, and it keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen on the planet for body coverage (Cotz tinted face is my favorite for the face) I would absolutely NEVER travel to a tropical location or anywhere where I was going to be in the sun without it. My entire family has converted. We never ask where is the sunscreen, we ask where is the blue lizard. Yes, it takes a bit more effort to rub in than some of the other brands, and it&#x27;s not that horrible spray sunscreen that really doesn&#x27;t work.  I wear this religiously during any vacation, and still get a beautiful tan without risking over exposure. There simply is no better sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Florida and it worked wonderfully - not one of us has had a sunburn yet this summer.  A great product.  My friends are always borrowing it from me for their kids.</li>
            <li> great stuff, without the chemicals</li>
            <li> I have found that this was the only product on the market that did not cause extreme eye irritation during heavy sweating.</li>
            <li> Pleased, this product really shields from burns.  I even put some on my arms and face and none on my legs and saw the immediate difference in protection.  I feel this lasts longer at a higher protection level than store brands.</li>
            <li> When this product arrived the bottle had the appearance of having been around the block.  When i looked at the bottom the expiration date was only one year from my purchase date.  According to the manufacturer they use a 3 year expiration date period.  I can understand losing a year, but 2!  The company/Amazon was great about returning the product.  Future buyers should check the expiration dates on the bottom.  The other bottles, of similar Blue Lizard products all had 2 years left on their expiration dates.</li>
            <li> Years ago my dermatologist recommended Blue Lizard. I have used it ever since when I play golf or swim in the ocean. I like the idea that it does not harm the environment while providing excellent protection from the hot Southern sun.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this.  First I thought she was trying to make a pretty penny off me, but this stuff works great.  I burn easily, but have never burned if I put on Blue Lizard.  It stays on very well in water.  Sure, after a few hours it&#x27;s a great idea to reapply.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it getting in my eyes either and I&#x27;ve worn nearly every day for at least 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 2013 Edit.  Two years later, including a couple of summer weeks in the desert, and no burns!  That&#x27;s well over 3 years of use.  It seem expensive but I wear it daily and one bottle will typically last me nine months (I usually us a swim shirt when swimming, so I do save on some sunscreen there).</li>
            <li> It is a little on the pricey side but it is worth it. The bottle turns darker blue with the sunlight. It is not greasy like many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the zinc in this sunscreen that makes this product the best sunscreen on the market.  Having had skin cancer before and losing my dad to skin cancer, I would never use another brand.  I fully trust Blue Lizard to do its job!</li>
            <li> The cool factor of the bottle turning blue had the children wanting to be \\&quot;Slathered with the Blue Stuff\\&quot;. It worked on our Irish and Polish kids who usually spend 1 day in the sun and 5 in the shade. Thanks Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is thick, so it actually feels like you are apply a good lotion instead of a runny mess.  Kinda cool that the bottle turns blue when exposed to UV light.  I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It blocks the dangerous rays.  And one application lasts a long time.  My dermatologist put me on to it, and I&#x27;m glad he did.  Worth every penny . . . even at twice the price.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen to me and my family.  It contains zinc oxide which blocks out harmful rays.  After having a melanoma removed, I am now diligent about using Blue Lizard sunscreen, wearing hats, long sleeves, etc.  Skin cancer can travel to your other organs and lymph nodes.  Don&#x27;t be cavalier like I was.</li>
            <li> I first used this 11 years ago and have used it ever since. I would use nothing else. Back then I ordered it online from a online store in Australia and could buy the 8.75oz bottle, including shipping to the US, for just over $10. I bought it for last several years from Amazon but this year it had risen in price to a ridiculous amount. Will be checking out the Australian store again.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old is on a medication that makes his skin extremely photosensitive.  I tried every other sunscreen on the shelf and nothing was working.  10 minutes and he&#x27;d burn.  His pediatrician recommended blue lizard.  Works great.  Soaks in quickly, its not greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell.  We both were very happy with it.  I won&#x27;t use anything else on him from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I purchase now...it always works...and no sunburns in this household...no regrets...no excessive perfumes...has all the necessary products to protect your children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I have had several cancers already removed, and my dermatologist recommends Blue Lizard sunscreen.  I love that it also moisturizes as it protects.  It&#x27;s not the pasty kind of stuff that most other brands are, but flows nicely, so I can spread it on my skin easily.  My mother also loves using this product.  No greasy feel but can get smooth coverage.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion on my daughter who has eczyma and have not had a problem. My husband uses too and swears by it.</li>
            <li> Trying to avoid the chemical sunscreens.  I like this stuff over others I&#x27;ve tried because it seems to rub in better.  I&#x27;ve used many that just won&#x27;t rub in no matter what.  This stuff is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!  I got some from my dermatologist, as I was looking for a high SPF sunscreen especially for my face.  I noticed there was a Blue Lizard face lotion as well, but I just used the regular.  I love it!  I had no problems as far as breakouts.  It takes a little bit to rub in because of its high SPF (it&#x27;s lotiony, just really opaque) but it&#x27;s worth it, because does the job like no other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.  And since the effects last longer than the average sunscreen, so you use less.  Plus the bottle turns bright blue when the sun&#x27;s rays are dangerous, which I find pretty cool.  I really feel protected with this sunscreen at the beach.  I like its light scent.  The price is reasonable too!</li>
            <li> this sunscreen came highly recommended by my dermatologist and she was right.  the minute you apply it, your skin feels more protected than regular sunscreens.  a little goes a long way, it stays on in the water, it&#x27;s great for athletics as it does not sting if you get it in your eyes.  people who are normally allergic to creams and sunscreens are not allergic to this one !  i love it.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does as it promises.  Excellent sun burn protection -- even in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Really protects you.  My dermatologist recommended this product and although it&#x27;s more expensive - it&#x27;s worth the protection for your skin.  I&#x27;m glad my children are using it.</li>
            <li> My dermatoligist recommended this product a few years ago and we have used it since with great results. Just don&#x27;t know why we can&#x27;t find it in any stores. Best sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li> A friend said her dermatologist recommended this sunscreen, after I said I wanted to find a non-chemical sunscreen. Most physical sunscreens go on thickly and don&#x27;t blend well, leaving skin white and sticky. This one goes on super easy and skin feels fine after. It smelled nice without being overwhelming. And after a week&#x27;s beach vacation in the sun, my daughter did not burn at all. LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I only have good opinions about this sunscreen. It&#x27;s amazing and will absolutely keep you from being burned. It&#x27;s super waterproof and I love it. Yes, it&#x27;s a tad greasy for the face, but it&#x27;s really great stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife used this on our vacation in florida. She was able to stay out in the sun and water without getting the least bit red. Highly recommend Blue Lizard!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a person who has cancer and is not allowed in the sun even on a cloudy day. His cancer doctor told him about this product or else he would&#x27;ve never known about it. He has been using it for about two weeks now and it&#x27;s the only reason that he can go out because of this product is so good. Just want to let more people know about it</li>
            <li> My pediatrician recommended this for my daughter who has reacted to other skin creams and soaps. It is a physical sunblock. It works great and made me realize how many chemicals are in the typical sunscreen! I use it for both kids and neither has even gotten sunburned or had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I used this on My vacation.  The days I used it I had complete protection from the sun.  The day I decided I would go without and try to get a tan, I fried to a crisp.  This stuff has long staying power.  It does take longer than most to get on, it&#x27;s very thick and a lot goes a long way--you really have to rub this stuff in.  It doesnt stink like a lost of sunscreens do--it just smells like regular hand lotion. The bottle is great.  It turns blue when dangerous rays are out.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My dermitlogist highly recommended this product for one reason, it works. It&#x27;s without a doubt the longest lasting and most effective sun-screen I&#x27;ve ever used. The Blue Lizard for kids is also a great buy if you are looking for something that stays on and tends not to irritate delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I met a dermatologist last year at a healthcare seminar I attended.  He was from New Mexico and had blue eyes and blonde hair, as did his three young children.  I asked it the sun and heat were an issue for them and he told me that they swim all day so it&#x27;s not a problem.  I asked about sunburns and he told me about Blue Lizard sun block.  He said he highly recommends it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I went to Amazon and ordered my own bottle before my family went on a cruise to Grand Cayman this year.  My youngest daughter who burns no matter what we do had Blue Lizard applied twice a day while she played in the ocean and built sand castles.  I am happy to say, she did not burn once during our seven days in the tropics!  I would highly recommend this suncreen!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan I BURN. I have tried every brand out there all the way up to spf 100 and still gotten badly BURNED. Urgent care and i are very good friends in summer. I have what most would call porcelain skin. This is the first sunblock I have ever bought that worked! I have just spent a full week in Saint Thomas in JULY and I was on the beach every day for hours in the sun. I did re apply often though it was a bit longer than the 80 minutes recommended on the bottle. And no burn. I also used it on the kids and no burning. It is worth the higher price, it did not make me itch, does not smell bad, and rubs in easily. As a skeptic I doubted it would work but I WAS WRONG.</li>
            <li> This is excellent sunscreen.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a chemical free sunscreen. It states 100% chemical free and lists zinc oxide 6% as the active ingredient in the online description.  I just received the bottle today and it also has octinoxate 5% octocryene 2% oxybenzone 3%. All the chemical ingredients I was trying to avoid. I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a natural chemical free sunscreen. This sunscreen has the exact same ingredients as all the other far less expensive sunscreens. I emailed amazon to let them know the product description is not accurate.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida it is important to have good sun coverage bee aboslutely love Blue Lizard. It&#x27;s a little runnier than I first expected, which resulted in an extra handful of sunscreen on he first use. Otherwise fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, it is well worth the money spent on it and does an amazing job. I was on a five day cruise and used this 2x daily, i spent the everyday out on the highest desk of the ship and did not get a single burn. Plus they use safe ingredients,unlike 90% of the sunscreens out there; which can actually harm you. Customer for life, thank you for your products</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works great! It goes on easily and smoothly and kept my children from burning their winter white skin while vacationing in the Bahamas AND they were in the water all day! Of course, you have to re-apply periodically, but it is a great first line of defense!</li>
            <li> Years ago I did a search for zinc based sunscreen for my children that won&#x27;t burn their eyes when they inevitably rub them with their sunscreened hands.  This was my gold mine!  I won&#x27;t repeat all of the other reviewers&#x27; acolades (though I agree) to save time, but I refuse to buy anything else anymore.  Even the pricey &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; sunscreen in the stores always burned for them.  And even though this is a little pricey too, reapplication is not needed as often as store bought brands so you end up actually saving money there.  LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> My husband is a waterman and in the sun all day.Previous sun products tuned his clothes orange so when a friend recommended Blue Lizard we had to try it. It goes on smoothly, takes a minute or two to soak in but does not leave your skin greasy and does not turn your clothes orange. We use it every day.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s so waterproof even soap won&#x27;t remove it (tissue or cloth works). It doesn&#x27;t leave obvious white bits all over either. No burned skin after a week of hopping in and out of both the ocean and a pool.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. I used it in Colombia when I went scuba diving. Like the description says, it turns blue when it&#x27;s exposed to the sun. This may seem like a cheap gimmick, but it&#x27;s actually a nice reminder to be conscious of the sun! Don&#x27;t worry, the actual sun cream does not turn blue.</li>
            <li> Our entire family has been using this sunscreen for years.  It is very effective and goes on like a lotion.</li>
            <li> Smooth feeling, absorbs well and quickly.  High zinc content, as recommended by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> We bought this for a trip to South America and it worked wonderfully. It is a little thicker than average sunblock but it is very effective and we never got burnt. I asked my dermatologist what she recommended and she chose this product</li>
            <li> I have very light and sensitive skin in a high-altitude desert, and this is my #1 go-to sunscreen. It works. Yes, sure it leaves a pearlescent white sheen, but did I mention that it works? It works well. That&#x27;s really all I ask for...</li>
            <li> How did I find this product?  I was looking for a sunscreen that would not turn my white clothes yellow when washed.  This is usually caused by sunscreens that contain Avobenzone. It reacts with minerals in the water, and we have hard water---so we have yellowed white shirts where the sunscreen hits.  Enter Blue Lizard...no yellow shirts ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular and sport line of Blue Lizard sunscreen is not listed as chemical free on the company&#x27;s website.  Only the baby and sensitive lines are listed as such----the drawback is that they are then not water/sweat resistant.  I used the regular BL sunscreen all last summer and I have to say we LOVED it.  It is the only sunscreen my kids can wear from 12-5p and not get burned.  You will note that the product info claims up to 4 hours of water resistance but the bottle states to reapply after 80min of water or every 2 hours.  I believe the reason for this is due to what the US allows the product to claim.  According to Blue Lizard&#x27;s company website [...] :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water Resistance&lt;br /&gt;In the United States, the highest standards for water resistance are 80 minutes in still water. Our Very Water Resistant Regular and Sport formulas meet the most stringent Australian Standards which are 240 minutes in whirlpool water, making them over three times as water resistant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reason leads me to believe that they can only claim 80min due to US regulations, and only claim 30+SPF due to Australian regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, we were very happy with the products.  We use the regular for water/sweat activities and the sensitive for everyday.  The regular lasts for the 4 hours as long as you:&lt;br /&gt;1) apply on dry skin and let sit for 15 minutes prior to sun exposure&lt;br /&gt;2) do not rub off.  My kids had to learn not to &#x27;rub eyes dry&#x27; as this did cause a slight burn on cheeks the first few times we used it.  Now they don&#x27;t do it, no red cheeks&lt;br /&gt;3) reapply regardless of how much time has passed if you have towel dried or laid on/sat on towels or cloth chairs.airs.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen by a long shot</li>
            <li> My child has extremely sensitive skin. This sunscreen is the ONLY product I have found that does not irritate my child&#x27;s skin. Even better, this product is such fantastic sunscreen that we use it for the entire family. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product truly works protecting you from the sun&#x27;s rays (hey, I live in FL).  It&#x27;s a bit difficult applying; you&#x27;ll need to work it onto the skin.  Also, as you perspire it will tend to leave an opaque sheen from the zinc oxide.  In the end I would not use any other product.</li>
            <li> For my husband, he loves it. Used it on his recent bike trip from Alabama to California to Oregon, Washington, Montana, Colorado and back to Alabama.</li>
            <li> the best sun protection you can ever get; love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing sunscreen! I can&#x27;t use any other after getting this. Even better testimonial is my husband will actually use this too, and he is one to HATE anything creamy. A very small amount of this goes a very long way. It works too, I burn so easy and for an average day (4 to 5 hours) of being in direct sun outside swimming, I have never needed to re-apply. Never had any sunburn, or even the feeling of being sunburned that most sunscreens leave me with. This really works. It has a nice clean smell too, so great for men or women. Non-greasy, it is a little more massaging to rub it in than most of the suncreens I&#x27;ve used in the past, but nothing to difficult at all. Just rub it in and enjoy your day. You will smell fresh and clean the whole time too. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> This is our absolute favorite sunscreen. We go through a bottle each summer. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores. I ordered two bottles this summer and received them within two days. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have a bottle that has expired, and it still works great.  I put it on one time and get absolutely no tan or burn.</li>
            <li> This is not chemical free!&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed to pay $24 for a bottle of &#x27;chemical free&#x27; sunscreen only to flip the bottle around to see oxybenzone listed as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the sensitive, baby or face formulas for chemical free products.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic sunscreen. It&#x27;ll protect you and your kiddos from the harsh summer sun. One of the coolest things about it is the bottle, though. The bottle is white, but when it&#x27;s exposed to enough UV light that you need sunscreen, it turns blue to let you know you need to put it on!</li>
            <li> Bought this looking for a sunscreen that really works &amp; isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals.  This stuff is great and I love how the bottle turns blue when it&#x27;s exposed to UV light.  It&#x27;s thick, but I didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting it rubbed in &amp; it didn&#x27;t feel greasy or icky like some stuff does.  Was on the beach for about 5 hours (in and out of the sun), didn&#x27;t get burned and I didn&#x27;t reapply. My husband was in the ocean the entire time and did get mildly pink on his legs, but it&#x27;s because he forgot to reapply to his legs.  One tip...skin has to be completely dry before you reapply, or it turns into a white gluey glob and won&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li> goes on white but works in. not greasy and great protection. used it in the bahamas fishing in bright sun all day - never burned...</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is fantastic. After spending 6 hours at the sea world and days on the beach nobody got sunburn.</li>
            <li> excellent protection from UV rays last many hours after application. I am a boater, always under the sun and is now the only sunscreen that I use .</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for the kids</li>
            <li> While the consistency is slightly runny this is THE BEST sunscreen my family has used. Fully waterproof and great coverage against the sun.</li>
            <li> After much research on safe sunscreens we tried Blue Lizard and now will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen we have found! My daughter goes to a summer day camp that does not reapply sunscreen. We have been using this based on a friends recommendation. She did not get burned once this whole summer (and we live in South Texas). This sunscreen is on the pricey side, but is well worth it. We will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; is a little runnier than the &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; version. Still thick, and absorbs quickly into skin. Works very well at preventing sunburn and seems to last through swimming. It does tend to have a slight whitish sheen even after being rubbed in, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, as I know my kids are protected. No scent or odor.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! My son has eczema &amp; super sensitive skin &amp; always complains that sunscreen BURNS! This sunscreen NEVER burned him &amp; kept him from getting a sunburn. He also thought the color changing bottle was super cool. A little really goes a long way with this stuff so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s got oxybenzone in it, and a bunch of other chemicals. for this price, i might as well get something that pure mineral, with just a few ingredients i understand how to pronounce. oxybenzone is known to increase cancer risk. there is no reason why any sunscreen should have it and the fda should have banned it years ago, but they don&#x27;t. the sensitive version of this product is better, but only if you don&#x27;t sweat and don&#x27;t go in the water. does anyone not either sweat or get wet when out in direct sunlight? i&#x27;ll use this up, but won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Worked well on vacation. My family is fair skin.</li>
            <li> This is great sunscreen. My children don&#x27;t get skin rashes and we feel confident they are safe from excess sun. Keeps my husband safe as well, he has had melanoma and we are an outdoors family.</li>
            <li> I bought both the blue lizard face and regular sunscreen. I&#x27;ve used it before and find it works great. Comes highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Love the lizard.  Non greasy. Doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. Second purchase cause mine gets taken. Really good product. Protects well.</li>
            <li> works great, recommended by my pmd</li>
            <li> Great but this really dries my daughters skin out on her face.  I won&#x27;t be buying again next year and will look at another brand</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and performed as expected -- no sunburn on my very fair-complected son, even on a 5 day fishing trip in FL!  The only thing we don&#x27;t like about this sunscreen is the greasy feel it leaves.  Wish it would rub in and then feel dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> definitely the best of all SPF 30+ suncreeen proctectors</li>
            <li> A little pricy, but if you&#x27;re looking to avoid a lot of the other potentially toxic ingredients in sunscreens, this is the one for you.  It rubs in MOSTLY clear.  If you start sweating, your skin may have a pale glow to it - but, sure beats skin cancer, am I right?!?</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my nephew&#x27;s dermatologist in Tennessee, and I could not find in Florida when he was visiting so I ordered it from Amazon.  We spent the next week at the beach, and my nephew (15 y/o) told me \\&quot;it really worked\\&quot; as he did not have any sunburn at all after using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Other sunscreens burn and irritate my daughter&#x27;s skin. This one was gentle and provided great protection.</li>
            <li> Fried. I fried like piece of chicken, and came out looking like a lobster. The blue bottle was cool? My skin was hot. Yes I reapplied multiple times. Yes I waited before I swam.</li>
            <li> The dermatogist recommended this as have had several cancer places removed from face. This seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff on our diving vacation to Bali. No burns and it stayed on after being in the water.</li>
            <li> I heard about this through The People&#x27;s Pharmacy podcasts several years ago. It&#x27;s kind of heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals. I ride horses so I&#x27;m outside a lot in the summer and I ALWAYS wear this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever.  You put it on and it lasts and lasts.  Went to the beach every day for one week.  Literally only had to reapply once.  Great.  Great for kids too.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen!  I never burn if I use this product. This is must use product.</li>
            <li> Best lotion my wife and have used.  We even used it on the grandkids and they didn&#x27;t burn.  We like the product so much we bought another bottle.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Best spf lotion on the market for a day of boating.</li>
            <li> Try it in the Caribean sun. It&#x27;s  a lot better than most and doesn&#x27;t need re-application in a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this product gets so many good reviews.  I have been using this on my daughter (at the suggestion of a dermatologist) beginning at age 1.  She is 2.5 now.  While the sunscreen worked fine in Maine and NY, we recently went to Aruba.  I used it on my 6-month old and the 2-year old.  Both got what I would call a sunburn (red skin where clothes were not covering, which disappeared the next day).  I was devastated, after all I&#x27;ve read about how even one sunburn on a very young child can increase their risk of skin cancer.  Now I know you may be thinking it was user error, but I reapplied it on them every 1-2 hours.  And the shocking thing is the 6- month old was in the direct sun hardly at all (just the unavoidable exposure from walking from boat to beach umbrella, pool to hotel lobby, etc.).  I thought I was very diligent about it, so I don&#x27;t know if it was the product or my application.  Regardless, it&#x27;s disappointing to have kids with sunburns even when you know how and how often to apply sunscreen, and you do so.  Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Best sunblock on the market. One application lasts for hours, even getting in and out of the water.</li>
            <li> i love this product...it is greasy upon application and you have to rub it in but neither myself or my kids get sunburns after putting this on even when spending time in the water (reapplication is necessary depending on the time duration in the water), plus to me the serious bonus is the healthy star of approval this product gets from the environmental working group - thank you blue lizard!!!</li>
            <li> the best sun screen ever!</li>
            <li> A very good sunblock without all the chemicals. I use this year around and it&#x27;s one of the few that seems to do the job and not irritate my skin. There are several formulas so I use this everywhere except my face since I actually buy the Face formula, as well. Yes, it&#x27;s kind of thick and it can look pretty pasty at first, but it does become less opaque as you rub it into your skin. To be honest, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to wear any sunscreen because I think all of them (the good ones) are a little too heavy, but I also care about skin. So, this is my go to sunblock.</li>
            <li> Over 15 years ago, my Dermatologist removed a small brown spot from my skin and diagnosed me with basal cell carcinoma.  This was a bit scary to me as I was very young.  I am very fair skinned, and suffered from sunburns my entire childhood.  On the advice of that doctor, my family has been using Blue Lizard sunscreen products now for almost 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents generation didn&#x27;t believe in using sunscreen.  I have been educated the hard way from the harmful effects of the sun, so I know how important it is to prevent them from BIRTH!  We have always made sure our kids were properly protected when going out in the sun.  That being said, our youngest had a small brown mole on the bottom of her foot from birth.  At age 5, the dermatologist began measuring the mole and said eventually it would have to be removed with surgery.  At age 8, we went ahead and had it taken off.  Now more than ever it is important to make sure that she never has a sunburn.  Blue Lizard, when applied properly and according to the package recommendations, is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  My daughter uses the sensitive formula because she has very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these reasons aren&#x27;t enough, my husband suffers from a sort of sun allergy.  The ONLY sunscreen that keeps him from itching after sun exposure is Blue Lizard.  I personally use the regular, and sometimes sport if I will be sweating, and don&#x27;t forget the face...I use it every day 365 days a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best if you apply it to dry skin, let it dry before going out in the sun, reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and spend a lot of time in the sun riding my bike. I have found Blue Lizard to be a great product. My dermatologist recommended it to me. I apply Blue Lizard liberally before I start a ride, and don&#x27;t reapply for the rest of the day - which could be five hours in the saddle. I like that the product is waterproof, since sweating and dribbling water while drinking from a water bottle during the ride doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the sun protection. Be prepared though, it is a zinc oxide product, so it does look white on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best sunscreen on the market.  It is a bit pricey, but the safety of this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based upon the recommendations. I took this on my 4 day trip to Puerto Rico the week of August 1st. After lubing up very well and letting it sit for half an hour I trekked out to the ocean. I swam for 30 minutes in the ocean and then walked the beach with my wife for an hour. I got back and could already feel a burning a sensation. It was already too late, I got an extreme sunburn on my shoulders, neck, ears, chest, and back. It&#x27;s so bad the doctor said I had sun-poisoning (didn&#x27;t even know that existed). This did absolutely nothing after a 30 minute swim and one hour walk. The rest of the trip I was in agony in the shade praying the sun wouldn&#x27;t hit me.. Ruined the trip for me..</li>
            <li> best sunblock ever for the beach...hands down.  Have used everything...but this is the best.  Apply once in the AM maybe once more in the afternoon... We are in the ocean waves 6 hours a day and do not burn!  Amazing</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very good water resistance.  Kids used it all summer 6 days a week in the pool and it has not failed on them yet.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness does this stuff ever work!  My younger daughter and I have extremely fair skin and burn very easily.  We gave this a shot just for the sake of finding something that will stop us from blistering.  This works so good!  She just played a 4 day soccer tournament, one of the days we spent 10 hours outside at the fields, and absolutely no burns!  We even put in on her scalp and it prevented burns without making her hair look greasy.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Blue Lizard products for a few years now. The only time I have issues with sun protection is when I simply fail to apply the BL sunscreen thoroughly. It blends in nicely, without a ghostly pale effect or overly oily appearance. I&#x27;m also glad to say that it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have used Blue Lizard sunscreen for several years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Great product!</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great sunscreen (recommended by my dermatologist) with great wearability, the container turns blue whenever there are UV rays. The blue container is a good reminder to put the sunscreen on and/or get out of the sun completely. It works well on both body and face.</li>
            <li> We went to the Dominican Republic and wanted a sun screen that we didn&#x27;t have to apply every 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found blue lizard and decided to try it.  We bought two bottles for 4 of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We applied this every morning before we went to the beach.  Many times this was our only application for the day, and we were in the sun most of the days 6-8 hours.  If you are looking for a tan, but don&#x27;t want to get burnt to a crisp, this is your product.  My wife is fair skinned, and she had great protection with this stuff, and tanned up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, we took two bottles and came back home after a week with over one bottle left.  A little but of this stuff goes a LONG way.  We took a large bottle of some regular sun screen with us and all it did was provide extra weight in our luggage.  Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I discovered this sunscreen, It goes on like lotion, and does not feel greasy. I wanted to find a better sunscreen for my husband who has fair skin. Our family takes our vacations in the summer at the beach and he always get burned. We tried this sunscreen and not one of us had a sunburn! I&#x27;ve been using it for three years now and not one problem. I have small kids who are in and out of the pool and it the protection lasts longer than any other sunscreen. This past summer we were running low on our trip and my husband decided to use the banana boat SPF 30 and 2 hours later he was cooked. He will never use another lotion again!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the stuff is greasy.  It has all the right ingredients and is reasonably priced.  I like it.</li>
            <li> If your looking for all over sun protection this is for you. We are an extremely fair family and can easily burn in the sun. A doctor friend recommended this to us and we haven&#x27;t looked back since.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this for use at the beach.  Although it is a bit heavy, it causes me no problems and protects my very fair skin.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Quality sunscreen that uses the zinc blocker and not the chemicals but still goes on lighter that some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest sunscreen ...... we have a beach home and I use this on the grandkids and myself and we never get sunburned.  I was in the  Bahamas for 2 weeks and out on a boat and never got sunburned .... it is one of the few sunscreens with zinc oxide in it.  It is thick and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Recommended by pediatrician for our child with sensitive skin. Works well</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen we use. Worth the money. If we use this, we don&#x27;t get burned. Period.</li>
            <li> Best sunblock around period.</li>
            <li> The was recommended by my dermatologist. I know it&#x27;s a great product but it&#x27;s just so expensive. To prices for my purse.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I would highly recommend it.  No harmful chemicals so not to worry there.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  You can watch water bead up on skin when in the ocean! No stinging skin, no sunburn and the zinc is really apparent.  So much more expensive than the other stuff, yes.  But, my son always got skin discomfort when reapplying over salt and sandy skin.  Not a problem with this, no stinging. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this is so worth it.  It comes out thinner and spreads better than you might expect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best on the market, our Dermatologist recommended it 7 years ago and thatâ€™s all we use.</li>
            <li> We really like this sunscreen. It absorbs into the skin well and glides on easily. It is expensive, but even after quite a lot of use, our bottle doesn&#x27;t appear to be very empty. The blue bottle is such a neat idea and it is the one my older boys like the most because of it. Definitely my new fave.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have found.  A little greasy but covers exceptionally well.  Would definitely purchase it again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that I recommend to my friends. My eyes have not been hurt and tear since I use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this - goes on a little white and thick... but pays off with no sun burn.. buy the large jug.</li>
            <li> Love all your products. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My son burned every summer no matter what sunblock I used on him...until this summer. This sunblock has kept him burn free and enjoying summer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST sunscreen and the only one I take with me to the Caribbean!</li>
            <li> kept us safe in ecuador on the beach in the summer!</li>
            <li> I play tennis in Georgia, and in the summer months that means a LOT of sweat.  When they say this is waterproof, they mean it.  My favorite thing, however, is the fact that there are no toxic chemicals, like in virtually every other mainstream sunblock.  My husband&#x27;s golf friends joke that he&#x27;s &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; immediately after application, and it does turn you white initially, but that effect doesn&#x27;t last long.  Will use this stuff as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I try this many years ago.  I have been using blue Lizard ever since. So many of the other sunscreens have so many other chemicals in them that I was breaking out from them.  I have discoid Lupus, allergic to the sun. This product allowed me to get off medication!  I am an avid golfer so I greatly appreciate this product.  It is not easy to find locally.  Then I found  Amazon  partners with a company that supplies them so I always have access to it! It absorbs right into your skin the best sun protection I have found!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen there is. Some people don&#x27;t know that many sunscreens have ingredients in them that are cancer causing agents. Blue Lizard has the least amount of harmful chemicals while it has the most amount of protection! Ask any dermatologist! I found it after my mother was diagnosed with melanoma. I would recommend it 200%.</li>
