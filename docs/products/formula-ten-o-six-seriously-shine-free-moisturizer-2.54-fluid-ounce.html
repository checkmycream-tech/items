            <li>It also works wonderfully as a makeup primer, and it holds the BB cream onto my face all day</li>
            <li>The price, the container size, how it mattyfies your makeup is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>If this had a 30+ spf with it, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect product for oily faces.  </li>
            <li>this lotion is the best that I have found!</li>
            <li>Once again this is the best I have found</li>
            <li>chemical-y is the best I can do.  </li>
            <li>My face starts off with a nice matte finish and stays that way!!</li>
            <li>Loved this product!</li>
            <li>For myself, it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>and I believe this is a great product.</li>
            <li>, then happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It also works great as a make-up primer.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Best oil free lotion Iv used.</li>
            <li>I used to have problems with oily skin because I wasn&#x27;t using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>For a good moisturizer for men, I recommend Nivea For Men.</li>
            <li>Really good</li>
            <li>So at times I have to apply sunblock over the product during the day because I am so fair.</li>
            <li>Keep blotting papers always on your person or think about buying a good mattifying primer.</li>
            <li>Keep blotting papers always on your person or think about buying a good mattifying primer.</li>
            <li>In the end, I thought I would try it because regardless if it didn&#x27;t remove shine, it was said to be a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a good mattifying lotion.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like in terms of matting my skin, but a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m sure most of you saw the lawsuit commercials about Accutane, so I&#x27;m very happy to say none of that happened to me.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on the skin and is a good mattifier....</li>
            <li>I love this line of skin care products!</li>
            <li>However, it works as an amazing make-up primer.</li>
            <li>This brand works amazing on my face.</li>
            <li>and this leaves my skin fairly matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li>So, my advice, BUYER BEWARE if you are acne prone or have any kind of skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>So, my advice, BUYER BEWARE if you are acne prone or have any kind of skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t depend 100% on peoples reviews when it comes to any kind of beauty care product.</li>
            <li>I had used the Formula 10.0.6 best face forward daily cleanser and absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the most honest answer.</li>
            <li>Very light and non-greasy formula.</li>
            <li>; feeling you get with many moisturizers.</li>
            <li>My make-up stays on all day and appears more radiant.</li>
            <li>I have been in search of a mattifying moisturizer since my favorite Estee Lauder and Lancome products for oily skin were both discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I will not be able to use the rest of this product because of its smell.</li>
            <li>It took my face a couple days to get used to it, but now I love this product.</li>
            <li>From what I can gather it is the bamboo \\&quot;essence\\&quot; causing the peculiar or notable odor.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I get more bang for my buck using this</li>
            <li>All in all, I am exceptionally pleased with the quality of the product, the price point, and the fact that it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out while it reduced my shine.  </li>
            <li>Whats really nice about this moisturizer is that it&#x27;s oil free</li>
            <li>And for the most part does absorb oil.</li>
            <li>I like it, and will probably purchase more of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Try Skindinavia No Shine for better shine control.</li>
            <li>it does not clog pores either and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>So with that, it&#x27;s a pretty good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I originally bought a mattefying moisterizer that was over 40 bucks!</li>
            <li>I loved the matte effect but it was really runny even when I shook it up...</li>
            <li>For mildly oily all over, I&#x27;m sure it would work better than on my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>it lasts probably about 4 hours (matte effect) goes on easy.</li>
            <li>I use mineral makeup that can easily turn out shiny throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Unscented is one thing, but this cream has a strong smell which does not dissipate after application.  </li>
            <li>Of course, since my skin is very oily I do have to touch up with oil absorbing sheets but other than that it is a very great product if you&#x27;re looking to save money and get good results!</li>
            <li>No ones skin is exactly like another, and it honestly depends on your type of skin.</li>
            <li>Also it smells a lil funky, but if It worked I would be fine with that.</li>
            <li>On my cheeks, it was just fine.</li>
            <li>and while I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with oily skin or dryness</li>
            <li>The smell seems to be a huge issue with this product.</li>
            <li>It has a light fresh-and-clean scent which I do like.</li>
            <li>Not shine free.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a product that was oil free because I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>so when I saw the shine free moisturizer i decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>This product kept my skin shine free, but not mannequin matte.</li>
            <li>I loved the Clean and Clear, but was saddened when it was discontinued</li>
            <li>It is a creme/gel and absorbs almost instantly into my skin (unheard of before trying this) and it has a light scent that I find pleasant.  </li>
            <li>and I love the oil absorbing power!</li>
            <li>It does feel really clean on my face, so perhaps I will continue to try it and see if it minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent not too overpowering at all and works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just blot my face a few times a day, but I love the moisture--it feels great</li>
            <li>My large pores love pumping out oil and</li>
            <li>Good for short periods of time though.</li>
            <li>(young male)I have been using this product for about a week now, and I thought I would give an honest review on the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li>So this product not working isn&#x27;t much a surprise, but more of a... expectation?</li>
            <li>instead of &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34;  That said, it&#x27;s not a bad smell, and it is gone as soon as the lotion dries on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad and why are you buying this lotion again??</li>
            <li>Honest to God clear skin that rarely broke out.</li>
            <li>It was like a mild sunburn-like stinging, but I could ignore it until it stopped.</li>
            <li>It was like a mild sunburn-like stinging, but I could ignore it until it stopped.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re mildly oily, just don&#x27;t accidentally get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Now I want to order more of this before I&#x27;ve finished using my Clean and Clear!</li>
            <li>Best of all--it really does keep my my face seriously shine free...</li>
            <li>This stuff smells exactly like that!</li>
            <li>Also, it soaks in very quickly; the lotion consistency is between a regular lotion and a gel, so it&#x27;s lighter than many lotions I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel dirty/or that &amp;#34;weighed</li>
            <li>This lotion really helps too keep my skin oil free longer.</li>
            <li>I really like this light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now I rarely wear foundation or powder because my skin is so balanced and there&#x27;s no greasy shine.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll go back too since it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and made it nice.</li>
            <li>that complain taken out of the way, I do like it, my skin feels soft and non-greasy, which is something I love.</li>
            <li>There are far better ways to combat oil than this product out there.was like a dream because of my oily skin.</li>
            <li>There are far better ways to combat oil than this product out there.</li>
            <li>it worked well but wasnt worth the cost, so I tried this.</li>
            <li>i can say i am satisfied so far ,</li>
            <li>But as a light moisturizer I think it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>The mud mask was also really cool as I enjoy using masks frequently during the week.</li>
            <li>The mud mask was also really cool as I enjoy using masks frequently during the week.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily give my face a completely matte finish but does eliminate a good bit of shine.</li>
            <li>that you don&#x27;t have to put too much on, and that it absorbed into the skin right away.</li>
            <li>This one you get more product at a great price point, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>The texture is light, it absorbs easily, and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a strange film on the skin.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, someone got the bright idea to create mattifying creams, lotions, and gels to assist in combating excess oil, which makes my mission a little easier.</li>
            <li>but after a little dab with a paper towel I&#x27;m good to go again.</li>
            <li>and I have never, ever been able to find (despite an almost constant search) anything that could control the oil on my face...</li>
            <li>It is matte when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I first thought that the breakout was because of hormones, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>But if I looked past the breakout fiasco, then the actual performance of the products weren&#x27;t very great.</li>
            <li>But if I looked past the breakout fiasco, then the actual performance of the products weren&#x27;t very great.</li>
            <li>It has more of a matte finish than regular moisturizer, but I still have a shiny forehead after I apply it.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I put this on my face after my shower each morning and instantly I noticed a more matte like look to my face.</li>
            <li>It is pretty odorless to me.</li>
            <li>I wish I could&#x27;ve come back on here and left a dazzling review, since I saw so many other great reviews saying how well this stuff worked, but I guess it&#x27;s just not a good fit for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white, light and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I tried this product on a whim, recommended by Amazon when I ordered the Clean and Clear Mattifying Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>as the Clean &amp; Clear Mattifying Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am pretty pale, do not tan easily and have mildly oily skin with mild break outs</li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin you will still have very oily skin after this product does not mattify AT ALL!</li>
            <li>It was just too much to buy consistently</li>
            <li>First off, I have VERY oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It does have a sour milk kind of smell and its runny.</li>
            <li>Also, it felt like one needed to used a lot of the product to get the right amount of moisture as it seemed to dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, it felt like one needed to used a lot of the product to get the right amount of moisture as it seemed to dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not the too strong though, matte doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts/pimples from about the time I turned 18-19, but have struggled with having oily skin, large pores, and blackheads for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But certain things happened....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and would recomend this product to anyone who wants less shiny skin!</li>
            <li>but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t rely on it to keep you shine free.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for something that will actually keep you shine free for any period of time</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I put it on under the BB cream I use as a foundation, and my face is shine free for the entire day.</li>
            <li>Very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a very matte moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It should NOT cost as much as it does, but it works on my oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product as well as the mud mask.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>me start by saying I have combo/oily skin and that I was very acne-prone until 3 years ago when my dermatologist put me on the Accutane system.</li>
            <li>Plus, wasn&#x27;t too fond of the very citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Plus, wasn&#x27;t too fond of the very citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using Shine Free daily for about a month</li>
            <li>Works really well in keeping oil at bay.</li>
            <li>all the medications under the sun haven&#x27;t really worked for me.</li>
            <li>At the price, you can try it without wasting to much time/money.</li>
            <li>Course, given the amount of time and money I&#x27;ve put into my skin trying to get it balanced and acne free, I&#x27;d just about rub essence of skunk on it so long as it worked.</li>
            <li>But, as I settle into my 30&#x27;s, I need more products: wrinkle treatments for crow&#x27;s feet and mannequin lines, dark spot correctors, concealer, etc.  </li>
            <li>Also, it seems the more I use it, the less shine I have.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer does a decent job of controlling oil, but does not seem to work as well (on my skin, anyway)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend pairing this moisturizer with their cleanser for optimal results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use it as a lotion under my makeup when I know that I have a big day ahead of me, my face gets pretty oily throughout the day even when I am not doing much, but this moisturizer really kept my makeup looking fresh and matte, like i had just recently applied it.</li>
            <li>The product is wonderfully matte, but the smell is so bad</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try, so I found some at the local Ulta beauty store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and debating in ultra for quite a few minutes, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one because in comparison to others you get more bang for the buck (most on the market are a small $ for 1oz or less).</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to stop and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find something that says it&#x27;s oil free and clog free and means it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I break out after using a new product, but not at all with this one.</li>
            <li>Finally, let me just say that my skin is very troublesome and very oily.</li>
            <li>I did notice the smell that many other reviewers remarked on, but while a little plant-like and outdoorsy, I didn&#x27;t mind it as it dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>I did notice the smell that many other reviewers remarked on, but while a little plant-like and outdoorsy, I didn&#x27;t mind it as it dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>At night I use alone, and wake with a nice dewy complexion (not dry or slick).</li>
            <li>As far as the smell some are referring to, it is a non factor!</li>
            <li>Overall, the moisturizer didn&#x27;t live up to its claims which is really sad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, the moisturizer didn&#x27;t live up to its claims which is really sad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on light not greasy and helped with dry patches on my skin but didn&#x27;t make me feel extra oily and greasy.</li>
            <li>but my skin &amp;#34;gets used to it&amp;#34; quickly and feels no further irritation after initial application.</li>
            <li>However, the product I received recently was almost pure liquid and completely unusable.  </li>
            <li>And considering the freedom of trying so many different products, makeup, cleansers, and formulas over the past 3 years, I also thought my skin wasn&#x27;t very sensitive at all when it came to trying new things....</li>
            <li>Clear skin.</li>
            <li>It strips you of your natural skin oil which you need</li>
            <li>I saw this moisturizer and decided to try it because I&#x27;d really like to find something that helps my facial skin to not overproduce sebum like it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a mission to clear up my skin; combination/oily, photosensitive, sensitive, acne prone, aging (30&#x27;s), etc</li>
            <li>It makes my skin incredibly soft while leaving it with a matte finish.</li>
            <li>My skin type is very oily and when comparing this product to a high-end one, this moisturizer didn&#x27;t make my skin get oily quicker, they worked the same!</li>
            <li>I scrubbed with exfoliators and cleansers nearly every day.</li>
            <li>My least favorite thing about this moisturizer is the smell.  </li>
            <li>because it didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.  </li>
            <li>With my stubborn sensitive skin, that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, soft, and firm even after one use.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the consistency is so liquidy that it easily spills(this could be because it was left by my garage and froze before I got home), however that is minor because it dries very quickly on my face after application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick on your skin at all, and the shine goes away instantly.</li>
            <li>have moderately oily skin in the T-zone, especially, and this moisturizer was OK - not fantastic</li>
            <li>I mean, take it into consideration if you think it pertains to you, but honestly, beauty care products are going to affect different people in different ways.</li>
            <li>Favorite for the oily areas of my face, this is hard to find!</li>
            <li>much less a fresh one, which I would expect for something I&#x27;m putting on my face.</li>
            <li>If you even suspect for a second that your skin may be sensitive, DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li>If you even suspect for a second that your skin may be sensitive, DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li>I used 10-0-6 products back in my teens and early 20s.  </li>
            <li>Before I started using it, I&#x27;d feel greasy in my chin area by the early afternoon, but now I&#x27;m not greasy at all throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>I am a female in my early 20s</li>
            <li>But I have to be careful with this product because if I&#x27;m not I feel that the whole of it is going to pour onto my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very watery and practically pours out of the container so you have to be careful when unscrewing the cap.  </li>
            <li>After a minute or so, i could barely tell it was there.</li>
            <li>I mean there is a light smell</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s female with extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li>Seriously Shine Free mattifying lotion.  </li>
            <li>This Seriously Shine Free mattifying lotion works just as well as Proactiv&#x27;s mattifying gel in reducing the shine in my t-zone.  </li>
            <li>It also burns my skin a little when I first put it on</li>
            <li>I have used it with several facial cleansers and only ONE, paired with this moisturizer, completely and totally zaps my oil problem.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a lot of it because the first time I used it I did this and it leaves your face feeling kinda tacky or stiff.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and usually breaks out from any new product and this product did not make me break out!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> mattifying aspect is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It also works wonderfully as a makeup primer, and it holds the BB cream onto my face all day</li>
            <li> The price, the container size, how it mattyfies your makeup is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> If this had a 30+ spf with it, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for oily faces.  </li>
            <li> this lotion is the best that I have found!</li>
            <li> Once again this is the best I have found</li>
            <li> chemical-y is the best I can do.  </li>
            <li> My face starts off with a nice matte finish and stays that way!!</li>
            <li> Loved this product!</li>
            <li> For myself, it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> and I believe this is a great product.</li>
            <li> , then happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It also works great as a make-up primer.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Best oil free lotion Iv used.</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with oily skin because I wasn&#x27;t using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For a good moisturizer for men, I recommend Nivea For Men.</li>
            <li> Really good</li>
            <li> So at times I have to apply sunblock over the product during the day because I am so fair.</li>
            <li> Keep blotting papers always on your person or think about buying a good mattifying primer.</li>
            <li> Keep blotting papers always on your person or think about buying a good mattifying primer.</li>
            <li> In the end, I thought I would try it because regardless if it didn&#x27;t remove shine, it was said to be a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a good mattifying lotion.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like in terms of matting my skin, but a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m sure most of you saw the lawsuit commercials about Accutane, so I&#x27;m very happy to say none of that happened to me.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin and is a good mattifier....</li>
            <li> I love this line of skin care products!</li>
            <li> However, it works as an amazing make-up primer.</li>
            <li> This brand works amazing on my face.</li>
            <li> and this leaves my skin fairly matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li> So, my advice, BUYER BEWARE if you are acne prone or have any kind of skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> So, my advice, BUYER BEWARE if you are acne prone or have any kind of skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t depend 100% on peoples reviews when it comes to any kind of beauty care product.</li>
            <li> I had used the Formula 10.0.6 best face forward daily cleanser and absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the most honest answer.</li>
            <li> Very light and non-greasy formula.</li>
            <li> ; feeling you get with many moisturizers.</li>
            <li> My make-up stays on all day and appears more radiant.</li>
            <li> I have been in search of a mattifying moisturizer since my favorite Estee Lauder and Lancome products for oily skin were both discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I will not be able to use the rest of this product because of its smell.</li>
            <li> It took my face a couple days to get used to it, but now I love this product.</li>
            <li> From what I can gather it is the bamboo \\&quot;essence\\&quot; causing the peculiar or notable odor.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I get more bang for my buck using this</li>
            <li> All in all, I am exceptionally pleased with the quality of the product, the price point, and the fact that it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out while it reduced my shine.  </li>
            <li> Whats really nice about this moisturizer is that it&#x27;s oil free</li>
            <li> And for the most part does absorb oil.</li>
            <li> I like it, and will probably purchase more of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Try Skindinavia No Shine for better shine control.</li>
            <li> it does not clog pores either and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> So with that, it&#x27;s a pretty good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a mattefying moisterizer that was over 40 bucks!</li>
            <li> I loved the matte effect but it was really runny even when I shook it up...</li>
            <li> For mildly oily all over, I&#x27;m sure it would work better than on my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> it lasts probably about 4 hours (matte effect) goes on easy.</li>
            <li> I use mineral makeup that can easily turn out shiny throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Unscented is one thing, but this cream has a strong smell which does not dissipate after application.  </li>
            <li> Of course, since my skin is very oily I do have to touch up with oil absorbing sheets but other than that it is a very great product if you&#x27;re looking to save money and get good results!</li>
            <li> No ones skin is exactly like another, and it honestly depends on your type of skin.</li>
            <li> Also it smells a lil funky, but if It worked I would be fine with that.</li>
            <li> On my cheeks, it was just fine.</li>
            <li> and while I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with oily skin or dryness</li>
            <li> The smell seems to be a huge issue with this product.</li>
            <li> It has a light fresh-and-clean scent which I do like.</li>
            <li> Not shine free.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a product that was oil free because I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> so when I saw the shine free moisturizer i decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> This product kept my skin shine free, but not mannequin matte.</li>
            <li> I loved the Clean and Clear, but was saddened when it was discontinued</li>
            <li> It is a creme/gel and absorbs almost instantly into my skin (unheard of before trying this) and it has a light scent that I find pleasant.  </li>
            <li> and I love the oil absorbing power!</li>
            <li> It does feel really clean on my face, so perhaps I will continue to try it and see if it minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent not too overpowering at all and works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just blot my face a few times a day, but I love the moisture--it feels great</li>
            <li> My large pores love pumping out oil and</li>
            <li> Good for short periods of time though.</li>
            <li> (young male)I have been using this product for about a week now, and I thought I would give an honest review on the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> So this product not working isn&#x27;t much a surprise, but more of a... expectation?</li>
            <li> instead of &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34;  That said, it&#x27;s not a bad smell, and it is gone as soon as the lotion dries on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad and why are you buying this lotion again??</li>
            <li> Honest to God clear skin that rarely broke out.</li>
            <li> It was like a mild sunburn-like stinging, but I could ignore it until it stopped.</li>
            <li> It was like a mild sunburn-like stinging, but I could ignore it until it stopped.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re mildly oily, just don&#x27;t accidentally get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Now I want to order more of this before I&#x27;ve finished using my Clean and Clear!</li>
            <li> Best of all--it really does keep my my face seriously shine free...</li>
            <li> This stuff smells exactly like that!</li>
            <li> Also, it soaks in very quickly; the lotion consistency is between a regular lotion and a gel, so it&#x27;s lighter than many lotions I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel dirty/or that &amp;#34;weighed</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps too keep my skin oil free longer.</li>
            <li> I really like this light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Now I rarely wear foundation or powder because my skin is so balanced and there&#x27;s no greasy shine.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll go back too since it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and made it nice.</li>
            <li> that complain taken out of the way, I do like it, my skin feels soft and non-greasy, which is something I love.</li>
            <li> There are far better ways to combat oil than this product out there.was like a dream because of my oily skin.</li>
            <li> There are far better ways to combat oil than this product out there.</li>
            <li> it worked well but wasnt worth the cost, so I tried this.</li>
            <li> i can say i am satisfied so far ,</li>
            <li> But as a light moisturizer I think it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> The mud mask was also really cool as I enjoy using masks frequently during the week.</li>
            <li> The mud mask was also really cool as I enjoy using masks frequently during the week.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily give my face a completely matte finish but does eliminate a good bit of shine.</li>
            <li> that you don&#x27;t have to put too much on, and that it absorbed into the skin right away.</li>
            <li> This one you get more product at a great price point, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> The texture is light, it absorbs easily, and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a strange film on the skin.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, someone got the bright idea to create mattifying creams, lotions, and gels to assist in combating excess oil, which makes my mission a little easier.</li>
            <li> but after a little dab with a paper towel I&#x27;m good to go again.</li>
            <li> and I have never, ever been able to find (despite an almost constant search) anything that could control the oil on my face...</li>
            <li> It is matte when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I first thought that the breakout was because of hormones, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> But if I looked past the breakout fiasco, then the actual performance of the products weren&#x27;t very great.</li>
            <li> But if I looked past the breakout fiasco, then the actual performance of the products weren&#x27;t very great.</li>
            <li> It has more of a matte finish than regular moisturizer, but I still have a shiny forehead after I apply it.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I put this on my face after my shower each morning and instantly I noticed a more matte like look to my face.</li>
            <li> It is pretty odorless to me.</li>
            <li> I wish I could&#x27;ve come back on here and left a dazzling review, since I saw so many other great reviews saying how well this stuff worked, but I guess it&#x27;s just not a good fit for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white, light and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim, recommended by Amazon when I ordered the Clean and Clear Mattifying Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> as the Clean &amp; Clear Mattifying Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am pretty pale, do not tan easily and have mildly oily skin with mild break outs</li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin you will still have very oily skin after this product does not mattify AT ALL!</li>
            <li> It was just too much to buy consistently</li>
            <li> First off, I have VERY oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It does have a sour milk kind of smell and its runny.</li>
            <li> Also, it felt like one needed to used a lot of the product to get the right amount of moisture as it seemed to dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, it felt like one needed to used a lot of the product to get the right amount of moisture as it seemed to dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> Not the too strong though, matte doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts/pimples from about the time I turned 18-19, but have struggled with having oily skin, large pores, and blackheads for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But certain things happened....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied and would recomend this product to anyone who wants less shiny skin!</li>
            <li> but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t rely on it to keep you shine free.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something that will actually keep you shine free for any period of time</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I put it on under the BB cream I use as a foundation, and my face is shine free for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a very matte moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It should NOT cost as much as it does, but it works on my oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product as well as the mud mask.</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> me start by saying I have combo/oily skin and that I was very acne-prone until 3 years ago when my dermatologist put me on the Accutane system.</li>
            <li> Plus, wasn&#x27;t too fond of the very citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Plus, wasn&#x27;t too fond of the very citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shine Free daily for about a month</li>
            <li> Works really well in keeping oil at bay.</li>
            <li> all the medications under the sun haven&#x27;t really worked for me.</li>
            <li> At the price, you can try it without wasting to much time/money.</li>
            <li> Course, given the amount of time and money I&#x27;ve put into my skin trying to get it balanced and acne free, I&#x27;d just about rub essence of skunk on it so long as it worked.</li>
            <li> But, as I settle into my 30&#x27;s, I need more products: wrinkle treatments for crow&#x27;s feet and mannequin lines, dark spot correctors, concealer, etc.  </li>
            <li> Also, it seems the more I use it, the less shine I have.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer does a decent job of controlling oil, but does not seem to work as well (on my skin, anyway)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend pairing this moisturizer with their cleanser for optimal results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use it as a lotion under my makeup when I know that I have a big day ahead of me, my face gets pretty oily throughout the day even when I am not doing much, but this moisturizer really kept my makeup looking fresh and matte, like i had just recently applied it.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderfully matte, but the smell is so bad</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try, so I found some at the local Ulta beauty store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and debating in ultra for quite a few minutes, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one because in comparison to others you get more bang for the buck (most on the market are a small $ for 1oz or less).</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to stop and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find something that says it&#x27;s oil free and clog free and means it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I break out after using a new product, but not at all with this one.</li>
            <li> Finally, let me just say that my skin is very troublesome and very oily.</li>
            <li> I did notice the smell that many other reviewers remarked on, but while a little plant-like and outdoorsy, I didn&#x27;t mind it as it dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> I did notice the smell that many other reviewers remarked on, but while a little plant-like and outdoorsy, I didn&#x27;t mind it as it dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> At night I use alone, and wake with a nice dewy complexion (not dry or slick).</li>
            <li> As far as the smell some are referring to, it is a non factor!</li>
            <li> Overall, the moisturizer didn&#x27;t live up to its claims which is really sad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, the moisturizer didn&#x27;t live up to its claims which is really sad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on light not greasy and helped with dry patches on my skin but didn&#x27;t make me feel extra oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> but my skin &amp;#34;gets used to it&amp;#34; quickly and feels no further irritation after initial application.</li>
            <li> However, the product I received recently was almost pure liquid and completely unusable.  </li>
            <li> And considering the freedom of trying so many different products, makeup, cleansers, and formulas over the past 3 years, I also thought my skin wasn&#x27;t very sensitive at all when it came to trying new things....</li>
            <li> Clear skin.</li>
            <li> It strips you of your natural skin oil which you need</li>
            <li> I saw this moisturizer and decided to try it because I&#x27;d really like to find something that helps my facial skin to not overproduce sebum like it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a mission to clear up my skin; combination/oily, photosensitive, sensitive, acne prone, aging (30&#x27;s), etc</li>
            <li> It makes my skin incredibly soft while leaving it with a matte finish.</li>
            <li> My skin type is very oily and when comparing this product to a high-end one, this moisturizer didn&#x27;t make my skin get oily quicker, they worked the same!</li>
            <li> I scrubbed with exfoliators and cleansers nearly every day.</li>
            <li> My least favorite thing about this moisturizer is the smell.  </li>
            <li> because it didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.  </li>
            <li> With my stubborn sensitive skin, that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth, soft, and firm even after one use.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the consistency is so liquidy that it easily spills(this could be because it was left by my garage and froze before I got home), however that is minor because it dries very quickly on my face after application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick on your skin at all, and the shine goes away instantly.</li>
            <li> have moderately oily skin in the T-zone, especially, and this moisturizer was OK - not fantastic</li>
            <li> I mean, take it into consideration if you think it pertains to you, but honestly, beauty care products are going to affect different people in different ways.</li>
            <li> Favorite for the oily areas of my face, this is hard to find!</li>
            <li> much less a fresh one, which I would expect for something I&#x27;m putting on my face.</li>
            <li> If you even suspect for a second that your skin may be sensitive, DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> If you even suspect for a second that your skin may be sensitive, DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I used 10-0-6 products back in my teens and early 20s.  </li>
            <li> Before I started using it, I&#x27;d feel greasy in my chin area by the early afternoon, but now I&#x27;m not greasy at all throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> I am a female in my early 20s</li>
            <li> But I have to be careful with this product because if I&#x27;m not I feel that the whole of it is going to pour onto my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very watery and practically pours out of the container so you have to be careful when unscrewing the cap.  </li>
            <li> After a minute or so, i could barely tell it was there.</li>
            <li> I mean there is a light smell</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s female with extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously Shine Free mattifying lotion.  </li>
            <li> This Seriously Shine Free mattifying lotion works just as well as Proactiv&#x27;s mattifying gel in reducing the shine in my t-zone.  </li>
            <li> It also burns my skin a little when I first put it on</li>
            <li> I have used it with several facial cleansers and only ONE, paired with this moisturizer, completely and totally zaps my oil problem.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a lot of it because the first time I used it I did this and it leaves your face feeling kinda tacky or stiff.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and usually breaks out from any new product and this product did not make me break out!</li>
            <li> Have you ever left a load of towels in the washer too long</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to this cream&#x27;s effectiveness as a moisturizer because I didn&#x27;t keep it long enough to find out.  </li>
            <li> thinking I left them without washing too long.</li>
            <li> But I have obscenely oily skin, so it helped but didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hope.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a b* to tame over the last near two decades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant and is not something I appreciate having on my face, because the smell lasts for hours and since it&#x27;s right there literally under my nose, I can smell it for hours too.  </li>
            <li> (thankfully) long past the oily skin of the teen and early 20 years, and yet this product couldn&#x27;t even give a matte finish to my middle-aged skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been an oil slick since I was a young teen</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of expensive for how small it is.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little different from the high-end one because of the aloe ingredient but it does the same job!</li>
            <li> and when you finally dry them they smell funky?</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have extremely oily skin &amp; large pores.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I spent a lot of money using Proactiv Solution&#x27;s acne system, including their mattifying gel.  </li>
            <li> I apply this lotion over my anti-wrinkle/firming day cream, but only on my forehead and down my nose.  </li>
            <li> The system pulls every little thing that could possible become a breakout to the surface and your face is like a pizza for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Keeps me matte for a few extra hours.</li>
            <li> I still find that after a few hours I get some shine back</li>
            <li> I only use a few drops and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It simply smells of lotion ingredients, not of a heavy cloying perfume that other manufacturers use to cover up the scent of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> All you need is a little amount, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I probably would not recommend wearing it in the morning if you are going to be up close with other people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one or the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it during the winter which also contributed to the extreme dryness and breakouts.</li>
            <li> Many reviews say this product smells horrible while my personal opinion is that it smells like regular powdered or liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> I took all other review into account</li>
            <li> Other moisturizers leave me greasy and wondering why I bothered to wash my face.</li>
            <li> mask, on the other hand, I did like a bit.</li>
            <li> I did feel the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation other people claimed.</li>
            <li> It was quite sharp and acrid, but again, dissipated after 2 or so minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> mask, on the other hand, I did like a bit.</li>
            <li> I did feel the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation other people claimed.</li>
            <li> It was quite sharp and acrid, but again, dissipated after 2 or so minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looking at the reviews of this product (from amazon and other sites)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too afraid of more breakouts that I had worked so hard and suffered to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too afraid of more breakouts that I had worked so hard and suffered to get rid of.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gross and hard to describe -</li>
            <li> Everyone should consider wearing spf regularly, especially on the delicate skin of the face, ears, and neck.</li>
            <li> I used intensive benzoyl peroxide spot treatments and Neosporin and Cortisone 10 to bring it all down.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, thumbs down.  </li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s the smell I got used to when my little one was smaller.</li>
            <li> And although I am waaay past that now, I discovered this product when searching for a cheaper alternative to the mattifying face cream I&#x27;ve been using for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used a high-end mattifying moisturizer that cost $40.</li>
            <li> I have less shine on my forehead throughout the day, but the shine comes through on my nose after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> none the less.</li>
            <li> This one literally zaps the oil and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too tight.</li>
            <li> Since I use so little, I do not notice the smell at all.  </li>
            <li> It just needs a little help that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I still got oily on my nose after 4 hours, but I would recommend for everyday use as a makeup primer alternative.</li>
            <li> I was still shiny after a few hours, even within two hours, so there was no mattifying going on.</li>
            <li> I was still shiny after a few hours, even within two hours, so there was no mattifying going on.</li>
            <li> I used to dry out my skin trying to combat my oil problem, but then had flakey skin with oil, not a charming combination.  </li>
            <li> usually squeeze a little bit of moisturizer onto my fingers whenever I&#x27;m using scrubs, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> But about 3-4 hours into my day it gets just as oily if not more oily than I normaly do.</li>
            <li> I can get past that.</li>
            <li> but once it arrived I realized just how small 2.54 OZ is</li>
            <li> only problem i have with this product is the smell it gives out&lt;br /&gt;it has a weird plant  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was short lived.</li>
            <li> It has not caused me to break out at all (or no more than usual).</li>
            <li> All in all however, not very good.</li>
            <li> it may work well as a mattifying moisturizer, but unfortunately I found the scent so appalling that I could not stomach it and threw it away after only 2 days -</li>
            <li> This stuff literally sucks up the oil from your skin the moment you put it on and dries seconds before you are finished applying it to your face.</li>
            <li> At least that is what it smells like to me; bamboo-esk.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about the product is it lacks spf.</li>
            <li> Formula 10-0-6 gives moisture--not oil--and absorbs oil for at least 10 hours.  </li>
            <li> but this one does seem to control decently, at least until late morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to use a mattifying primer because this does the job so well for everyday use!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost unpleasant but definitely not a neutral smell,</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is definitely not ideal as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced abnormal or excessive breaking out since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> It works but will dry out your skin like crazy</li>
            <li> Horrible deep red places all along my neck, jawline, chin, and mouth.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> the lotion had a weird smell to it like it was bad or old</li>
            <li> It left my skin incredibly dry and made me break out all over my forehead, the worst I have broken out on my forehead in probably 5 years.</li>
            <li> First off the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> At most, 2 bad places but nothing horrific.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t decreased the shine on my face at all.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly thin, watery product.</li>
            <li> This product is very watery and has a terrible scent.</li>
            <li> The product is indeed thin, but not watery.</li>
            <li> But sadly, this product didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> No product will eliminate oil (sadly)</li>
            <li> I gave it only 4 stars because the package arrived in terrible shape.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I usually use this as a base, add foundation and follow with pressed powder.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product due to the horrific smell.</li>
            <li> but they are impossible to find or ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m dirty, and I don&#x27;t even have to be hot/sweaty for a sheen to build up on my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li> The seal was intact though, so I wasn&#x27;t afraid to try it out.</li>
            <li> I had the worst breakout I&#x27;ve ever had for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> I either got a bad batch, or they&#x27;ve changed the formula, but I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I noticed after a while it would tighten my skin, in a bad way.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad.</li>
            <li> but the smell is downright horrible.</li>
            <li> The smell is so horrible that I literally threw it into the garbage can.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that smelled so horrible.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel disgusting.</li>
            <li> Too watery and has a terrible scent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used 10-0-6 products back in my teens and early 20s.  And although I am waaay past that now, I discovered this product when searching for a cheaper alternative to the mattifying face cream I&#x27;ve been using for the past several years.  At only $7 a bottle I figured it was worth a try, so I found some at the local Ulta beauty store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used it twice now, my conclusion is that the product developers must not know what the word \\&quot;mattifying\\&quot; means.  I am (thankfully) long past the oily skin of the teen and early 20 years, and yet this product couldn&#x27;t even give a matte finish to my middle-aged skin.  My forehead was shiny as though I hadn&#x27;t used anything.  Shine-free?  Not even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s back to the $30 mattifier I&#x27;ve been using.  You definitely do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad...I still use it every day but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t rely on it to keep you shine free.  I have oily skin, so I usually use this as a base, add foundation and follow with pressed powder.  I&#x27;d say by the time I finish my commute to work it&#x27;s time to reapply the powder.  So if you&#x27;re looking for something that will actually keep you shine free for any period of time I would go with a matte primer or something like that.  But as a light moisturizer I think it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have extremely oily skin &amp; large pores.  My skin has been an oil slick since I was a young teen and I have never, ever been able to find (despite an almost constant search) anything that could control the oil on my face...until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer fits the bill, but there is a bit of a catch.  I have used it with several facial cleansers and only ONE, paired with this moisturizer, completely and totally zaps my oil problem.  It&#x27;s Derma E&#x27;s Vitamin A Glycolic Cleanser.  I highly recommend pairing this moisturizer with their cleanser for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with certainty that this is the only moisturizer I have ever used that didn&#x27;t leave my face even oilier than it was before putting it on.  It is a creme/gel and absorbs almost instantly into my skin (unheard of before trying this) and it has a light scent that I find pleasant.  Best of all--it really does keep my my face seriously shine free...all day.</li>
            <li> works wonders! i no longer have oily skin. it does not clog pores either and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s female with extremely oily skin. I haven&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts/pimples from about the time I turned 18-19, but have struggled with having oily skin, large pores, and blackheads for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product line in a local ULTA beauty store. Would have purchased from Amazon(Smile) but ULTA was running a BOGO 50% off and for what I wanted to buy, it came out cheaper. Anyway, I bought the daily foaming cleanser, the salicylic acid astringent, this moisturizer, and one of the masks. This stuff works WONDERS. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily give my face a completely matte finish but does eliminate a good bit of shine. Also, it soaks in very quickly; the lotion consistency is between a regular lotion and a gel, so it&#x27;s lighter than many lotions I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel dirty/or that &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; feeling you get with many moisturizers. It has a light fresh-and-clean scent which I do like. It keeps me shine and oil-free all day and also, with it&#x27;s quick-absorbing properties, doesn&#x27;t get in the way of applying makeup. Definitely would recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps too keep my skin oil free longer. Best oil free lotion Iv used.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin and is a good mattifier....but the smell is downright horrible. Have you ever left a load of towels in the washer too long and when you finally dry them they smell funky? This stuff smells exactly like that! I kept it on hoping it would dissipate, but it definitely lingers.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have very oily skin and this leaves my skin fairly matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t necessarily do what it markets. It hasn&#x27;t decreased the shine on my face at all. However, it works as an amazing make-up primer. My make-up stays on all day and appears more radiant.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion as I didn&#x27;t want to pay $60 for the Dr Brandt version I&#x27;d gotten a sample of.  I read the reviews and saw that a lot of people didn&#x27;t care for the odor, but figured it was inexpensive enough to take the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I have no idea what these people are talking about regarding the odor. It simply smells of lotion ingredients, not of a heavy cloying perfume that other manufacturers use to cover up the scent of the ingredients. So I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;fragrance free,&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34;  That said, it&#x27;s not a bad smell, and it is gone as soon as the lotion dries on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mattifying aspect is wonderful. I put it on under the BB cream I use as a foundation, and my face is shine free for the entire day. Before I started using it, I&#x27;d feel greasy in my chin area by the early afternoon, but now I&#x27;m not greasy at all throughout the entire day. It also works wonderfully as a makeup primer, and it holds the BB cream onto my face all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Favorite for the oily areas of my face, this is hard to find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.  However, the product I received recently was almost pure liquid and completely unusable.  It literally poured out of the tube when I opened it, which I&#x27;ve never seen happen before.  I either got a bad batch, or they&#x27;ve changed the formula, but I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I loved the matte effect but it was really runny even when I shook it up... it lasts probably about 4 hours (matte effect) goes on easy. dont like the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It works but will dry out your skin like crazy so I stopped using it. It strips you of your natural skin oil which you need</li>
            <li> I have been in search of a mattifying moisturizer since my favorite Estee Lauder and Lancome products for oily skin were both discontinued.  After sampling several department store brands, I googled what I was looking for in regards to my oily skin and found this item.  Read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m 50.  Caucasion.  Very oily skin.  The price, the container size, how it mattyfies your makeup is wonderful!  I ended up buying another tube to have as a back-up.  Would definately recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to have problems with oily skin because I wasn&#x27;t using a good moisturizer. Now I rarely wear foundation or powder because my skin is so balanced and there&#x27;s no greasy shine.</li>
            <li> The smell is so horrible that I literally threw it into the garbage can. I have never used a product that smelled so horrible. I probably would not recommend wearing it in the morning if you are going to be up close with other people. I looked up the reviews again and again and realized that I&#x27;m not the only one who feels this way. It does feel really clean on my face, so perhaps I will continue to try it and see if it minimizes my pores. I&#x27;ll go pick it up from the garbage can now.....</li>
            <li> It is a very matte moisturizer. I don&#x27;t recommend using this with makeup primer. It&#x27;s one or the other. I still got oily on my nose after 4 hours, but I would recommend for everyday use as a makeup primer alternative.</li>
            <li> My face has always been oily. I bathe and wash my face every day so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m dirty, and I don&#x27;t even have to be hot/sweaty for a sheen to build up on my forehead and nose. I saw this moisturizer and decided to try it because I&#x27;d really like to find something that helps my facial skin to not overproduce sebum like it does. It makes me feel disgusting. But sadly, this product didn&#x27;t do it for me. I did like that you don&#x27;t have to put too much on, and that it absorbed into the skin right away. But after applying it after my morning shower, I spend my days in air conditioned offices and I still end up with an oily face by 9 or 10am. Also I saw another review on here saying that the lotion smells like baby puke, and I agree. At least, that&#x27;s the smell I got used to when my little one was smaller. I&#x27;d have ignored the smell, though, if the lotion worked for me. I wish I could&#x27;ve come back on here and left a dazzling review, since I saw so many other great reviews saying how well this stuff worked, but I guess it&#x27;s just not a good fit for my skin.</li>
            <li> Too watery and has a terrible scent. Returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> It is matte when you first apply it. Also it smells a lil funky, but if It worked I would be fine with that. But about 3-4 hours into my day it gets just as oily if not more oily than I normaly do. Not impressed. Nor will I repurchase. Good for short periods of time though. Like a photo shoot or a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to this cream&#x27;s effectiveness as a moisturizer because I didn&#x27;t keep it long enough to find out.  I sent it back after only one application because it smelled hideous.  Unscented is one thing, but this cream has a strong smell which does not dissipate after application.  It lingers on the skin for some time.  If the manufacturer didn&#x27;t care enough for their product to notice the problem or rectify it , then I don&#x27;t care to use it.</li>
            <li> Not shine free. If you have very oily skin you will still have very oily skin after this product does not mattify AT ALL!</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the face wash the company sells and they work so well together. It goes on light not greasy and helped with dry patches on my skin but didn&#x27;t make me feel extra oily and greasy. It has a nice light scent not too overpowering at all and works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; for the last couple weeks because I wanted to change it up a bit and I was looking for a product that was oil free because I have oily skin. First off the smell is awful. I can get past that. If the product works well than the smell shouldn&#x27;t matter. This stuff literally sucks up the oil from your skin the moment you put it on and dries seconds before you are finished applying it to your face. I noticed after a while it would tighten my skin, in a bad way. It left my skin incredibly dry and made me break out all over my forehead, the worst I have broken out on my forehead in probably 5 years. It does take he shine away from your skin, but the matte finish just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me. I use moisturizer once in the morning and once in the evening. This moisturizer is definitely not ideal as an everyday moisturizer. I will continue to use it, but only maybe once a week. I&#x27;ve been using it during the winter which also contributed to the extreme dryness and breakouts. All in all however, not very good. For a good moisturizer for men, I recommend Nivea For Men. That&#x27;s what I was using before this for the last two years and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll go back too since it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and made it nice.</li>
            <li> I had used the Formula 10.0.6 best face forward daily cleanser and absolutely loved it so when I saw the shine free moisturizer i decided to give it a try. I use it as a lotion under my makeup when I know that I have a big day ahead of me, my face gets pretty oily throughout the day even when I am not doing much, but this moisturizer really kept my makeup looking fresh and matte, like i had just recently applied it. This brand works amazing on my face. I am pretty pale, do not tan easily and have mildly oily skin with mild break outs and i loveee this.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad. I never use it.</li>
            <li> Really good but once it arrived I realized just how small 2.54 OZ is, it&#x27;s kind of expensive for how small it is. It also burns my skin a little when I first put it on but my skin &amp;#34;gets used to it&amp;#34; quickly and feels no further irritation after initial application.</li>
            <li> I will not be able to use the rest of this product because of its smell. It&#x27;s almost unpleasant but definitely not a neutral smell, much less a fresh one, which I would expect for something I&#x27;m putting on my face.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and debating in ultra for quite a few minutes, I decided to try this product. I am a female in my early 20s and while I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with oily skin or dryness I find myself with combination skin and deal with both daily. Many reviews say this product smells horrible while my personal opinion is that it smells like regular powdered or liquid makeup. It does leave skin with a matte finish and is liquidy. I don&#x27;t mind the liquid consistency because my skin needs it and it soaked it up instantly. My skin feels smooth, soft, and firm even after one use. This product works so well it could even be used as a primer. I took all other review into account and I believe this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It took my face a couple days to get used to it, but now I love this product. It&#x27;s not thick on your skin at all, and the shine goes away instantly. Sometimes I break out after using a new product, but not at all with this one. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would recomend this product to anyone who wants less shiny skin!</li>
            <li> i buy this product a lot and my order from them the lotion had a weird smell to it like it was bad or old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a mission to clear up my skin; combination/oily, photosensitive, sensitive, acne prone, aging (30&#x27;s), etc...It&#x27;s been a b* to tame over the last near two decades. Thankfully, someone got the bright idea to create mattifying creams, lotions, and gels to assist in combating excess oil, which makes my mission a little easier. I purchased this one because in comparison to others you get more bang for the buck (most on the market are a small $ for 1oz or less). This one you get more product at a great price point, and a little goes a very long way. I&#x27;ve not experienced abnormal or excessive breaking out since I&#x27;ve been using it. Keeps me matte for a few extra hours. I wash and tone and apply this after. It&#x27;s white, light and absorbs quickly into the skin. Other moisturizers leave me greasy and wondering why I bothered to wash my face. This one literally zaps the oil and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too tight. The smell seems to be a huge issue with this product. Personally, I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but that&#x27;s subjective. From what I can gather it is the bamboo \\&quot;essence\\&quot; causing the peculiar or notable odor. The bamboo is the mattifying ingredient according to the Formula website. At least that is what it smells like to me; bamboo-esk. The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to linger regardless. Course, given the amount of time and money I&#x27;ve put into my skin trying to get it balanced and acne free, I&#x27;d just about rub essence of skunk on it so long as it worked. My biggest complaint about the product is it lacks spf. I want a mattifying sunscreen but they are impossible to find or ridiculously expensive. If this had a 30+ spf with it, it would be perfect. So at times I have to apply sunblock over the product during the day because I am so fair. Everyone should consider wearing spf regularly, especially on the delicate skin of the face, ears, and neck. At night I use alone, and wake with a nice dewy complexion (not dry or slick).</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is AMAZING! I use it at night before putting on my acne medicine and in the morning after I wash my face and before I apply makeup. I don&#x27;t even need to use a mattifying primer because this does the job so well for everyday use!! My skin is very sensitive and usually breaks out from any new product and this product did not make me break out! The only complaint I have is that the consistency is so liquidy that it easily spills(this could be because it was left by my garage and froze before I got home), however that is minor because it dries very quickly on my face after application. Overall, I&#x27;m just upset I haven&#x27;t discovered it sooner!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim, recommended by Amazon when I ordered the Clean and Clear Mattifying Moisturizer.  I loved the Clean and Clear, but was saddened when it was discontinued, then happy to find it on Amazon.  However, I knew that someday Amazon would no longer have it, so I needed something else.  Wall-ah!!  This is the perfect product for oily faces.  I used to dry out my skin trying to combat my oil problem, but then had flakey skin with oil, not a charming combination.  Formula 10-0-6 gives moisture--not oil--and absorbs oil for at least 10 hours.  I just blot my face a few times a day, but I love the moisture--it feels great and I love the oil absorbing power! Now I want to order more of this before I&#x27;ve finished using my Clean and Clear!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly thin, watery product. It should NOT cost as much as it does, but it works on my oily T-zone. I use it as a primer under my foundation. Keeps me shine-free for about 6 hours, depending on the temperature I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin this lotion is the best that I have found! I still find that after a few hours I get some shine back but after a little dab with a paper towel I&#x27;m good to go again. Very light and non-greasy formula. It absorbs immediately. As far as the smell some are referring to, it is a non factor! I mean there is a light smell but it&#x27;s not bad and why are you buying this lotion again?? For the smell or the anti-shine factor?? Once again this is the best I have found and I am as oily as anyone and if it works for me it will work for you! Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> There are a couple of things that I do not like about this product, it has a liquid consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually squeeze a little bit of moisturizer onto my fingers whenever I&#x27;m using scrubs, lotions, etc. But I have to be careful with this product because if I&#x27;m not I feel that the whole of it is going to pour onto my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that complain taken out of the way, I do like it, my skin feels soft and non-greasy, which is something I love.</li>
            <li> it may work well as a mattifying moisturizer, but unfortunately I found the scent so appalling that I could not stomach it and threw it away after only 2 days - I see that others do not find it so objectionable - but for me this was a total deal breaker - I am not recommending against it, just think you should check out a \\&quot;bamboo\\&quot; scent (if that&#x27;s what it is) before purchasing</li>
            <li> The product is wonderfully matte, but the smell is so bad, I cannot use it.  I would not recommend this product due to the horrific smell.</li>
            <li> I love this line of skin care products! They are comparable to Clinique at a fraction of the cost. This moisturizer evens out my oily skin which is a feat. I always keep a bottle in my makeup bag. A must have for anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had previously used a high-end mattifying moisturizer that cost $40. It was just too much to buy consistently so I decided to give this a try and I really love it. The texture is a little different from the high-end one because of the aloe ingredient but it does the same job! It makes my skin incredibly soft while leaving it with a matte finish. My skin type is very oily and when comparing this product to a high-end one, this moisturizer didn&#x27;t make my skin get oily quicker, they worked the same! Of course, since my skin is very oily I do have to touch up with oil absorbing sheets but other than that it is a very great product if you&#x27;re looking to save money and get good results!</li>
            <li> Loved this product! I only use a few drops and it lasts all day. My face starts off with a nice matte finish and stays that way!!</li>
            <li> This smells terrible...sort of like spoiled milk.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product as well as the mud mask. I really did. But certain things happened....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I have combo/oily skin and that I was very acne-prone until 3 years ago when my dermatologist put me on the Accutane system. Now, I&#x27;m sure most of you saw the lawsuit commercials about Accutane, so I&#x27;m very happy to say none of that happened to me. I was on the system for 8 months. Six of those months, I was in acne hell. The system pulls every little thing that could possible become a breakout to the surface and your face is like a pizza for quite a while. However, coming off the system, I had what I always wanted. Clear skin. Honest to God clear skin that rarely broke out. At most, 2 bad places but nothing horrific. And considering the freedom of trying so many different products, makeup, cleansers, and formulas over the past 3 years, I also thought my skin wasn&#x27;t very sensitive at all when it came to trying new things....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these products regularly for 2 weeks before I had to stop. I had the worst breakout I&#x27;ve ever had for the past 3 years. Horrible deep red places all along my neck, jawline, chin, and mouth. I tried everything to get rid of them. I washed my bed linens, pillowcases, and blankets thinking I left them without washing too long. I scrubbed with exfoliators and cleansers nearly every day. I used intensive benzoyl peroxide spot treatments and Neosporin and Cortisone 10 to bring it all down. I tried everything. It was only when I stopped using the moisturizer and the mud mask and went back to my regular moisturizers and Queen Helene Mint Julepe mask did anything start to heal. Admittedly, I first thought that the breakout was because of hormones, but not anymore. Never before has hormones done this to me for 3 years. The only thing I changed in my routine were these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I wanted to like these products. The idea of a mattifying moisturizer was like a dream because of my oily skin. The mud mask was also really cool as I enjoy using masks frequently during the week. But if I looked past the breakout fiasco, then the actual performance of the products weren&#x27;t very great. The moisturizer didn&#x27;t do what it claimed. I was still shiny after a few hours, even within two hours, so there was no mattifying going on. Also, it felt like one needed to used a lot of the product to get the right amount of moisture as it seemed to dry very quickly. I did notice the smell that many other reviewers remarked on, but while a little plant-like and outdoorsy, I didn&#x27;t mind it as it dissipated quickly. Overall, the moisturizer didn&#x27;t live up to its claims which is really sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask, on the other hand, I did like a bit. I did feel the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation other people claimed. It was like a mild sunburn-like stinging, but I could ignore it until it stopped. The mask did make my face feel a bit smoother and fresher, but I didn&#x27;t see all the benefits that the product had on the packaging. Plus, wasn&#x27;t too fond of the very citrus scent. It was quite sharp and acrid, but again, dissipated after 2 or so minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase either of these products again, nor try any of the rest of the line. I&#x27;m too afraid of more breakouts that I had worked so hard and suffered to get rid of. After the acne nightmare I had been through, I would never wish this reaction on anyone else. So, my advice, BUYER BEWARE if you are acne prone or have any kind of skin sensitivity. If you even suspect for a second that your skin may be sensitive, DO NOT BUY THIS! Stick to what you know that works. Keep blotting papers always on your person or think about buying a good mattifying primer. There are far better ways to combat oil than this product out there.was like a dream because of my oily skin. The mud mask was also really cool as I enjoy using masks frequently during the week.

            <li> It has more of a matte finish than regular moisturizer, but I still have a shiny forehead after I apply it.</li>
            <li> For a long time I spent a lot of money using Proactiv Solution&#x27;s acne system, including their mattifying gel.  I get more bang for my buck using this Seriously Shine Free mattifying lotion.  Proactiv worked for me in regards to my acne throughout my 20&#x27;s.  But, as I settle into my 30&#x27;s, I need more products: wrinkle treatments for crow&#x27;s feet and mannequin lines, dark spot correctors, concealer, etc.  I just couldn&#x27;t justify the expense for Proactiv.  This Seriously Shine Free mattifying lotion works just as well as Proactiv&#x27;s mattifying gel in reducing the shine in my t-zone.  I have been using Shine Free daily for about a month and I have not had any breakouts in my t-zone.  I apply this lotion over my anti-wrinkle/firming day cream, but only on my forehead and down my nose.  It also works great as a make-up primer.  I have less shine on my forehead throughout the day, but the shine comes through on my nose after a couple of hours.  Since I use so little, I do not notice the smell at all.  Also, it seems the more I use it, the less shine I have.  All in all, I am exceptionally pleased with the quality of the product, the price point, and the fact that it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out while it reduced my shine.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> This product is very watery and has a terrible scent. Returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a mattefying moisterizer that was over 40 bucks! it worked well but wasnt worth the cost, so I tried this. Works really well in keeping oil at bay. I even use a mattefying primer over it before I put on my foundation. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this light moisturizer. I have combination skin and this moisturizer is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It has aloe vera as one of the ingredients, which softens skin. Skin feels smooth. I use it under my foundation or by itself when I&#x27;m not wearing make up. All you need is a little amount, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is going to have lots of different reviews because of everyone&#x27;s different types of skin. No ones skin is exactly like another, and it honestly depends on your type of skin. For myself, it worked beautifully. I enjoy the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Its all up to each individual. That&#x27;s the most honest answer. Don&#x27;t depend 100% on peoples reviews when it comes to any kind of beauty care product. I mean, take it into consideration if you think it pertains to you, but honestly, beauty care products are going to affect different people in different ways.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer. Oil-free which helps avoid breakouts. And it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> i recently bought this product a month ago at ulta i have to say i am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;i have oily skin to the point i have to keep and keep reapplying powder.&lt;br /&gt;i stumbled across this product and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;it works. it immediately takes away my shine and gives me a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;i apply my makeup once a day now.&lt;br /&gt;the only problem i have with this product is the smell it gives out&lt;br /&gt;it has a weird plant  smell to it but honeslty it doesent bother me once i finish applying my makeup&lt;br /&gt;overall i can say i am satisfied so far , im sticking to this product.</li>
            <li> My least favorite thing about this moisturizer is the smell.  It&#x27;s really gross and hard to describe - chemical-y is the best I can do.  It&#x27;s not pleasant and is not something I appreciate having on my face, because the smell lasts for hours and since it&#x27;s right there literally under my nose, I can smell it for hours too.  I only use it at night because of the smell.  It&#x27;s also very watery and practically pours out of the container so you have to be careful when unscrewing the cap.  When I went to use it today, water (or some liquid) leaked out  as soon as I took the cap off.  Gross.  I gave it 2 stars just because it seems to moisturize and because it didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.  Otherwise, thumbs down.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> (young male)I have been using this product for about a week now, and I thought I would give an honest review on the effectiveness of the product. First off, I have VERY oily skin. My large pores love pumping out oil and all the medications under the sun haven&#x27;t really worked for me. Looking at the reviews of this product (from amazon and other sites) it seemed like a mix bag of reviews. In the end, I thought I would try it because regardless if it didn&#x27;t remove shine, it was said to be a good moisturizer. At the price, you can try it without wasting to much time/money. Anyway, I put this on my face after my shower each morning and instantly I noticed a more matte like look to my face. Unfortunately, this was short lived. After an hour or two I can see some of the oil shine through. Although it is not as \\&quot;intense\\&quot; as it was before. I have yet to find a good mattifying lotion. The closest I got to was OC 8 (not quite a lotion but a mattifying gel). It worked alright but it caused me to break out. Whats really nice about this moisturizer is that it&#x27;s oil free and it does not clog your pores. It&#x27;s very hard to find something that says it&#x27;s oil free and clog free and means it. So with that, it&#x27;s a pretty good moisturizer. It has not caused me to break out at all (or no more than usual). With my stubborn sensitive skin, that is saying a lot. I don&#x27;t know what the reviews are saying about the smell. It is pretty odorless to me. Anyway, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like in terms of matting my skin, but a good moisturizer none the less. Finally, let me just say that my skin is very troublesome and very oily. I have yet to find another person that has oilier or just as oily skin as me. So this product not working isn&#x27;t much a surprise, but more of a... expectation? Anyway, I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Well suited for oily skin. Not the too strong though, matte doesn&#x27;t last all day. Buut it does put moisture back in the skin, seemingly tighten pores and skin alike. And for the most part does absorb oil. It just needs a little help that&#x27;s all. Good for the price. Par.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does a decent job of controlling oil, but does not seem to work as well (on my skin, anyway) as the Clean &amp; Clear Mattifying Moisturizer. The texture is light, it absorbs easily, and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a strange film on the skin. No product will eliminate oil (sadly) but this one does seem to control decently, at least until late morning.&lt;br /&gt;I have moderately oily skin in the T-zone, especially, and this moisturizer was OK - not fantastic but I won&#x27;t be throwing the tube away either. On my cheeks, it was just fine. For mildly oily all over, I&#x27;m sure it would work better than on my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if you&#x27;re mildly oily, just don&#x27;t accidentally get it in your eyes. It burns (trust me).</li>
            <li> Reviews for this product ran this product ran the gamut, so the only thing to do was get it and see for myself. The product is indeed thin, but not watery. It absorbs fairly quickly. After a minute or so, i could barely tell it was there. I&#x27;m in my 50s, but my skin still gets oily, especially here in the southern heat and humidity. This product kept my skin shine free, but not mannequin matte. I like it, and will probably purchase more of it. I gave it only 4 stars because the package arrived in terrible shape. The seal was intact though, so I wasn&#x27;t afraid to try it out. I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> It does have a sour milk kind of smell and its runny. Don&#x27;t use a lot of it because the first time I used it I did this and it leaves your face feeling kinda tacky or stiff. But I will buy again it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to stop and the price is right.</li>
            <li> After a month of use I still have oily skin, it actually seems oilier than before. I will keep looking</li>
            <li> I use mineral makeup that can easily turn out shiny throughout the day. After I started using this a year or so ago that hasn&#x27;t been an issue at all. I love this.</li>
            <li> But I have obscenely oily skin, so it helped but didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hope. Try Skindinavia No Shine for better shine control.</li>
