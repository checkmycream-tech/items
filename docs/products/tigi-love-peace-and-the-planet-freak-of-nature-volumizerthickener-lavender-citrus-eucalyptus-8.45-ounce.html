            <li>It smells great, is eco-friendly, and works well on my fine, oily hair.  </li>

            <li>Nice container and catchy label..</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing and is organic... what could be better???</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thinning quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>My fine, flyaway hair loves this!</li>
            <li>Love Freak of Nature</li>
            <li>Makes hair have much more volume and easier to style.</li>
            <li>This product makes it look like I have much more hair on my head.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to find it.  </li>
            <li>and I was so glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>You can easily use a round-brush to style.  </li>
            <li>So I got this product hoping it would make my full hair more full and it did didly squat.  </li>
            <li>I am \\&quot;freaking\\&quot; out right now because I am about to run out of Freak of Nature and need to order some ASAP. :-)</li>
            <li>Get it while you can...  originally $16.00 retail in stores.</li>
            <li>Love this product but the price is too much.  </li>
            <li>The more natural ingredients are a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I put it on my hair before a quick half-dry and then go to bed.</li>
            <li>The product is super, a little bit goes a long way, and the fragrance is really wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have the limpest hair on the planet and all I can say is that this product REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I have straight short hair and this product provides excellent body without that stiff \\&quot;gel\\&quot; feeling.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that it was organic but forsure not worth the price.</li>
            <li>so have been on the hunt for a leave-in volumizer and tried Neutrogena and Nexxus but much prefer this.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant but subtle and it really helps my fine hair have more body and bring down frizz without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It found a new home in my trash can after one use.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair along w/bald spots in certain places.  </li>
            <li>Searched high and low for it and found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is the only product that leaves my hair soft, yet gives it a volumized lift.</li>
            <li>Discovered this first in a little shop in Maine in 2002.  </li>
            <li>Only note of caution is that you need to dry your hair fairly quickly after applying since it will turn slightly crunchy if you wait too long (probably due to the natural ingredients).</li>

            <li> Continue to search for and use this for my fine thin hair!</li>
            <li> , it does the job for my very straight and limp hair!!!</li>
            <li> You only use a small amount,a size of a pea,  so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Whether I used wet or dry, with blow dryer or not, the product didn&#x27;t add any volume, shine etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but none has provided satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I think its the Eucalyptus that doesn&#x27;t agree with my nose, but it smells like dead fish to</li>
            <li> It works to help my thin grey hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount (in damp hair before blow-drying) gives me day-long body.  </li>
            <li> so I purchased the very pricey Phyto Actif ($28) and was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or hard to get a brush through.  </li>
            <li> this product is not a good substitute for a leave in conditioner-</li>
            <li> This stuff literally stinks.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s reformulation</li>
            <li> I have also tried the John Frieda Volumunizer before this and was equally disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I was disappointed with Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s reformulation so have been on the hunt for a leave-in volumizer and tried Neutrogena and Nexxus but much prefer this. Smell is pleasant but subtle and it really helps my fine hair have more body and bring down frizz without being heavy or greasy. The more natural ingredients are a huge plus. Only note of caution is that you need to dry your hair fairly quickly after applying since it will turn slightly crunchy if you wait too long (probably due to the natural ingredients).</li>
            <li> gave my hair some volume but I could have done that with hairspray. Don&#x27;t overpay for this Menard&#x27;s (yeah the hardware store) had this for 2.00 dollars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but none has provided satisfactory results.  Recently I went on a cruise and forgot to bring this so I purchased the very pricey Phyto Actif ($28) and was extremely disappointed.  I have also tried the John Frieda Volumunizer before this and was equally disappointed.  Love Freak of Nature, it does the job for my very straight and limp hair!!!</li>
            <li> Wife likes it and she is has scrutinizing tastes..Makes her hair look nice and supple..Nice container and catchy label..Thank you</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about 2years knew what I was getting. It works to help my thin grey hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t work for my hair as advertised. Whether I used wet or dry, with blow dryer or not, the product didn&#x27;t add any volume, shine etc. to my hair. It smelled good though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online as my hair stylist no longer can get it, and says its not being manufactured anymore. The product is super, a little bit goes a long way, and the fragrance is really wonderful. If one bottle didn&#x27;t last over a year, I&#x27;d re-order.</li>
            <li> I have the limpest hair on the planet and all I can say is that this product REALLY WORKS! I am \\&quot;freaking\\&quot; out right now because I am about to run out of Freak of Nature and need to order some ASAP. :-)</li>
            <li> Very pleased will order again</li>
            <li> So I got this product hoping it would make my full hair more full and it did didly squat.  I also liked that it was organic but forsure not worth the price. I got mine for ten dollars though.</li>
            <li> Love this product but the price is too much.  It doubled since I last purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and I find this product makes my hair feel ticker and  keeps the style longer.</li>
            <li> It smells great, is eco-friendly, and works well on my fine, oily hair.  It&#x27;s not sticky or hard to get a brush through.  You can easily use a round-brush to style.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  And it doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily.  The problem is that no one seems to sell it except online.</li>
            <li> I have straight short hair and this product provides excellent body without that stiff \\&quot;gel\\&quot; feeling.  It smells great too.  You only need a tiny amount so it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Wish Tigi brands had not discontinued it. Glad to have found some!</li>
            <li> Makes hair have much more volume and easier to style. My hair is very fine and thinning quite a bit.  This product makes it look like I have much more hair on my head.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff literally stinks. I think its the Eucalyptus that doesn&#x27;t agree with my nose, but it smells like dead fish to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It found a new home in my trash can after one use.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully for my plentiful but fine hair.  Just a small amount (in damp hair before blow-drying) gives me day-long body.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and will continue to do so!</li>
            <li> Discovered this first in a little shop in Maine in 2002.  Continue to search for and use this for my fine thin hair! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I put it on my hair before a quick half-dry and then go to bed. In the am I have volume that lasts all day. It also smells amazing and is organic... what could be better???</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to find it.  My stylist could no longer get it from the beauty supplier in our town.  It is the only product that leaves my hair soft, yet gives it a volumized lift.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair along w/bald spots in certain places.  This product gave the texture my hair needed &amp; the thickness.</li>
            <li> FYI this product is not a good substitute for a leave in conditioner- I recommend TIGIs Let It Be leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> My fine, flyaway hair loves this!</li>
            <li> This product does everything you need to thicken your  hair. You only use a small amount,a size of a pea,  so it last a long time. I have looked and looked for this product and I was so glad to find it again. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased in a rate moment of fiscal irresponsibility the product was underwhelming and did not meet my expectations at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it. I was not.able to find it in a local store so I eent</li>
            <li> Used this product for several years and it was discontinued by TiGi.  Searched high and low for it and found it on Amazon.  Wonderful product!  Now have a 5 year supply!  Get it while you can...  originally $16.00 retail in stores.</li>
