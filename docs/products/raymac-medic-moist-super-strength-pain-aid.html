            <li>This is perfect for my back muscles, quick soothing and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I find I use this Medic Moist the most out of everything I have tried.</li>
            <li>I attribute this to my body developing a tolerance to the meds, which makes the Medic-Moist even more desirable.  </li>
            <li>Medic Ice used to be my favorite until they quit making it, which led me to try the Raymac Medic Moist.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s up to $50 and more depending on seller.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things including LIDODERM patches, but there is nothing that compares to this product.</li>
            <li>This cream has gone up $10 in a year but one 16oz bottle lasts me a year or better.</li>
            <li>Overall, just a wonderful product that is a true blessing for someone in my condition.  </li>
            <li>It helps tremendously!</li>
            <li>When I posted my original review the cost for the 16 oz.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money in my opinion!</li>
            <li>My Sister gave us a sample of this stuff and my Husband loved it so much, we ordered the large size to help with his aches and pains.  </li>
            <li>While I still believe the product is amazing the new price might be be an issue for some budgets.  </li>
            <li>This product,Raymac Medic-moist Super Strength Pain Aid was what I took a chance on helping me.</li>
            <li>Some days I would easily pay the price depending on the pain, and others not so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Yes it leaves a menthol scent but the relief it brings and the ease to fall asleep is worth the scent.</li>
            <li>love the product, but we bought a 16 oz size and when it came in it was the same size as the 4 oz container we already have.</li>
            <li>the next day she was much, much better.  </li>
            <li>At times it works better than my prescribed pain medication which I have to take daily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not smelly, not burning hot like some muscle rubs and it does kill the pain.</li>
            <li>I take opioids for my pain, but this cream works better for the pain deep in my joints.  </li>
            <li>helps to reduce pain, better than I had expected</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You do not need much.</li>
            <li>i must say this product really does work ,,,,we have used for years  ,, never disapointed</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a decent product and does offer some pain relief.</li>
            <li>I have tried Medic Ice, Polar Frost, Bio-freeze, Sombra, and Raymac Medic-Moist does a much better job at blocking pain deep within the joints.  </li>
            <li>Still haven&#x27;t found anything better but not sure I would fork out $50.  </li>
            <li>Comments by associates have mentioned the same quick relief on several aches or muscle pains</li>
            <li>the container i have is miss marked and is a 16oz.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not my 12 year old dog has Arthuritis</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of stuff for my chronic gout / sports injuries  and just old age joint pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for a complete takeover by the Raymac and Traumeel.    </li>
            <li>jar for me and one for my near 80 year old mom.</li>
            <li>This product bring fast muscle and joint pain relief, especially when combined with Traumeel ointment.</li>
            <li>I know this is expensive but anything in life that is good or works costs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually been able to cut my pain meds dosage in half, which is also helping my overall health.  </li>
            <li>I sure hope the fine folks who make this won&#x27;t quit making it, like the morons at Medic Ice did with theirs.    </li>
            <li>find the large pump on the larger 16oz size is a plus as I use the stuff 24/7 and not having to take the top off with bad hands</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s a must for my husband when he has muscle pain from too much yard work, and it soothes my 5 year old granddaughter when she suffers at night with growing pains in her legs.</li>

            <li> love the product, but we bought a 16 oz size and when it came in it was the same size as the 4 oz container we already have. the container i have is miss marked and is a 16oz.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely fantastic!!! My family has used it for years and we LOVE it! It&#x27;s absolutely the BEST out there!!! (and we have tried a lot of different creams and rubs!)</li>
            <li> I have used Raymac Pain Aid for about a year now and it is the quickest relief I have found for anything that is aching.  Feet, legs and hands, it is wonderful for muscle pain also.  Believe it or not my 12 year old dog has Arthuritis and I used it the other day when she could barely get up and down on her back hip and leg and the next day she was much, much better.  I would recomend this to anyone and hope that they continue making this.</li>
            <li> My shoulder and arm had been broken in a fall and I was frantic to get some relief from the pain.This product,Raymac Medic-moist Super Strength Pain Aid was what I took a chance on helping me. Boy, did it help!  I don&#x27;t run out of &amp;#34;this paineraser&amp;#34; ever now.  I recommend it to all who need help with swelling, aching, and &amp;#34;what hurts&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of stuff for my chronic gout / sports injuries  and just old age joint pain. I find I use this Medic Moist the most out of everything I have tried. I do hate the smell ( that normal sports rub smell) so I do not use it until I am home and not around people.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the list of ingredients such as emu oil to tea and peppermint, capsicum and almost 40 others.  It looks like this product has EVERYTHING in it ever made for joint pain; just wish they would leave the stinky one out.&lt;br /&gt;I find the large pump on the larger 16oz size is a plus as I use the stuff 24/7 and not having to take the top off with bad hands helps.&lt;br /&gt;Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have reached the Creaky Age, when joints and muscles start complaining daily.  Medic Moist is the best product we&#x27;ve found for aches and pains.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried Medic Ice, Polar Frost, Bio-freeze, Sombra, and Raymac Medic-Moist does a much better job at blocking pain deep within the joints.  I&#x27;ve had chronic degenerative disk disease for the last 15 years and this Medic Moist is the only topical analgesic which actually blocks deep joint pain to a degree that is noticeable.  At times it works better than my prescribed pain medication which I have to take daily. I attribute this to my body developing a tolerance to the meds, which makes the Medic-Moist even more desirable.  Along with the Traumeel I take daily I&#x27;ve actually been able to cut my pain meds dosage in half, which is also helping my overall health.  I&#x27;m hoping for a complete takeover by the Raymac and Traumeel.    Overall, just a wonderful product that is a true blessing for someone in my condition.  Medic Ice used to be my favorite until they quit making it, which led me to try the Raymac Medic Moist.  What I thought was a tragedy with the discontinued Medic Ice turned out to be a blessing in disguise.    I sure hope the fine folks who make this won&#x27;t quit making it, like the morons at Medic Ice did with theirs.    The smell of the Raymac isn&#x27;t over bearing and is actually tolerable.  You can wear it in public without anyone noticing, which is hard to do with the other higher dosage menthol products.  And did I mention it starts working in less than 5 minutes, at least for me it does.  I just can&#x27;t quit smiling because of the relief this product has brought me.    Update 11-14-14:    When I posted my original review the cost for the 16 oz. of Raymac Medic Moist was $28.  Now it&#x27;s up to $50 and more depending on seller.  While I still believe the product is amazing the new price might be be an issue for some budgets.  Still haven&#x27;t found anything better but not sure I would fork out $50.  Some days I would easily pay the price depending on the pain, and others not so much.  Those of us with chronic pain and limited budgets understand the dilemma.kd</li>
            <li> My Sister gave us a sample of this stuff and my Husband loved it so much, we ordered the large size to help with his aches and pains.  I&#x27;ve also used it and it&#x27;s not smelly, not burning hot like some muscle rubs and it does kill the pain.</li>

            <li> This product was recommended by a friend so we bought a container and it helped with my back pain caused by stints in my kidneys.</li>
            <li> Works to reduce muscle pain</li>
            <li> Wonderful! This cream has saved me from lots of pain. I use it on my joints for arthritis pain. It helps tremendously! I was skeptical when my aging mom told me about it. I love it. I even have used it on my sinus area. Sinus meds were not working. This did the trick. I woke with no headache! It warms the skin but does not burns like other creams of this type. Well worth the money in my opinion! I bought the 16 oz. jar for me and one for my near 80 year old mom. It works! If using for headache take care not to get in eyes.</li>
            <li> helps to reduce pain, better than I had expected</li>
            <li> the closest thing to &#x27;miracle in a bottle&#x27; my tired hands and wrists have found.&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging &amp; shipping too.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I was referred this cream years ago by a friend that has been a message therapist for thirty years.  I have a degenerative joint disease and have extreme chronic pain.  I take opioids for my pain, but this cream works better for the pain deep in my joints.  I have tried many things including LIDODERM patches, but there is nothing that compares to this product. Do not be fooled by some of the emu creams.  Just read the ingredient list on Medic-Moist compared to any other &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;pain cream.  I know this is expensive but anything in life that is good or works costs.  This cream has gone up $10 in a year but one 16oz bottle lasts me a year or better. You do not need much.</li>
            <li> i must say this product really does work ,,,,we have used for years  ,, never disapointed</li>
            <li> This product bring fast muscle and joint pain relief, especially when combined with Traumeel ointment. Yes it leaves a menthol scent but the relief it brings and the ease to fall asleep is worth the scent. Buy it, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Good product. Have been using this product for severial years. And reasoniable price.</li>
            <li> We have used it several years and have found that it does what is says it will do.  Must try it.</li>
            <li> Came across this product that was a TV item advertisement years ago,tried it on shoulder ache and the discomfort was gone in 10min. Been continuous buyer of this raymac for several years since. Comments by associates have mentioned the same quick relief on several aches or muscle pains</li>
            <li> good pain reliever but wish it was rollon. Because it&#x27;s a cream it kind of gets everywhere.  but it&#x27;s still a decent product and does offer some pain relief.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my back muscles, quick soothing and pleasant smell. Will purchase again when we empty the tub</li>
            <li> This stuff is all it&#x27;s cracked up to be! It&#x27;s a must for my husband when he has muscle pain from too much yard work, and it soothes my 5 year old granddaughter when she suffers at night with growing pains in her legs.</li>
