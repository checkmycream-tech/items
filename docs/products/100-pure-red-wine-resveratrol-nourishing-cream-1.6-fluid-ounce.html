    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I use it day and night, makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Great price on this site-much cheaper than ordering from company.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I read it was good for healing them.</li>
            <li>This cream is quite good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with the anti wrinkle results:)</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream!  </li>
            <li>But seriously, it&#x27;s a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>I also use the coffee bean eye cream which has a very nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GOOD !</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Smell wasn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li>I think 100% pure needs to come up with a better deal or more plumped line for the anti aging skin care regime.</li>
            <li>BUT THIS HAS REALLY BEEN KEEPING IT FEELING NICE AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li>But overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>a good natural product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t, but not having the skin problems fron the other creams is a very good result.</li>
            <li>The aroma is light and sweet.</li>
            <li>I really love these, they really work well on my skin.</li>
            <li>Here is a great article that breaks it all down...</li>
            <li>Both have been good for my 63 year old sensitive face.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer to use in the AM in addition to other facial treatments - intend to order more.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit - it smooths on nicely and it works!!!</li>
            <li>I love this moisteriZer as it really moisturizers the skin and the smell is terrific smells like fresh grapes..</li>
            <li>This is unusual for 100% to have something that irritates my skin - and perhaps its a type of &#x27;peeling&#x27; action that is relevant to this cream, but I was only able to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>But 100% Pure still uses this ingredient that does exactly what synthetic parabens do.</li>
            <li>Unlike thick moisturizers that sit on top of your skin, this will easily absorb.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact cream I had bought locally at a much, much high price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Rubs in very well and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I like some of their other creams much better.</li>
            <li>Especially like it for how much better the lines above my lips look.</li>
            <li>This product contains Japanese Honeysuckle, and many say using Japanese honeysuckle is a way for companies to hide their parabens.</li>
            <li>And FYI, from what I&#x27;ve noticed looking at their ingredients, 100% Pure uses this in MANY (if not most) of their skincare products.</li>
            <li>I should make a plug for their 100% Pure Coffee Bean Eye Cream which I use religiously because it has never ever irritated my skin, or bothered my eyes).  </li>
            <li>Have been using the 100% pure red wine resveratrol nourishing cream for about a month.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The main issue is a chemical in Japanese honeysuckle called para-hydroxy benzoic acid that acts just like a paraben.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice any improvement, smells bad, but ok for a moisturizer.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> AND MY SKIN IS DRY</li>
            <li> It says it is for anti-aging and whatever, I just like it for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Or, my perceived &#x27;dry&#x27; skin.  </li>
            <li> Dumb move, but I decided to research the ingredients in this (and 6 other 100% Pure products that I purchased) AFTER purchasing them.</li>
            <li> I like this product but the wine smell is a little strange.</li>
            <li> Resveratrol cream Has enabled me to continue using my other anti-aging creams.  </li>
            <li> But overall is it a anti aging I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> and it was such a small bottle that it lasted less than two months.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I put some on every half hour</li>
            <li> I had no idea about any of this until I dug a little deeper.</li>
            <li> I really bought it for cold sores.</li>
            <li> Those creams used to be too harsh on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not sure ,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I should wear it and drive!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quite expensive for a small tube.</li>
            <li> What I found was disturbing.</li>
            <li> it is very poor quality</li>
            <li> this product is of poor quality and smells bad.</li>
            <li> Read and article that recommended resveratrol for cold sore healing.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer to use in the AM in addition to other facial treatments - intend to order more.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream!  Thanks</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GOOD ! AND MY SKIN IS DRY BUT THIS HAS REALLY BEEN KEEPING IT FEELING NICE AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I use it day and night, makes my skin feel great! Especially like it for how much better the lines above my lips look.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not greasy. I really bought it for cold sores. I read it was good for healing them. I haven&#x27;t gotten any, maybe because I&#x27;m using the cream. Not sure ,but I&#x27;m happy with the anti wrinkle results:)</li>
            <li> Resveratrol cream Has enabled me to continue using my other anti-aging creams.  Those creams used to be too harsh on my face.  My skin would get red and flakey.  I have been using this cream for 4 months, and I haven&#x27;t had that problem once. I thought resveratrol cream would make my skin look younger.  It doesn&#x27;t, but not having the skin problems fron the other creams is a very good result.</li>
            <li> Like, likety, like like this a lot.  You only need a teeny tiny dab to moisturize your skin. I can&#x27;t imagine slathering this over your entire face, but if you need moisturizer to soak in, this will do it. You do not need to use a lot for it to cover your skin.  It says it is for anti-aging and whatever, I just like it for dry skin. Or, my perceived &#x27;dry&#x27; skin.  Unlike thick moisturizers that sit on top of your skin, this will easily absorb.  It feels like a serum. The aroma is light and sweet. I should make a plug for their 100% Pure Coffee Bean Eye Cream which I use religiously because it has never ever irritated my skin, or bothered my eyes).  These are must have products for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice any improvement, smells bad, but ok for a moisturizer.  Won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> Rubs in very well and is not greasy. Great price on this site-much cheaper than ordering from company.</li>
            <li> Read and article that recommended resveratrol for cold sore healing.  The cream does speed up my healing time and if I am out in the sun (a trigger) I put some on every half hour and my incidences have diminished.</li>
            <li> People raved about this in the reviews.  It was okay.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything different than with my regular drugstore face cream and it was such a small bottle that it lasted less than two months.  Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is unusual for 100% to have something that irritates my skin - and perhaps its a type of &#x27;peeling&#x27; action that is relevant to this cream, but I was only able to use it sparingly. I like some of their other creams much better.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  You only need a little bit - it smooths on nicely and it works!!!</li>
            <li> Dumb move, but I decided to research the ingredients in this (and 6 other 100% Pure products that I purchased) AFTER purchasing them. What I found was disturbing. This product contains Japanese Honeysuckle, and many say using Japanese honeysuckle is a way for companies to hide their parabens. The main issue is a chemical in Japanese honeysuckle called para-hydroxy benzoic acid that acts just like a paraben. Here is a great article that breaks it all down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this product gets one star because of the company&#x27;s sketchy marketing when they say \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot;. We avoid parabens because they are considered hormone mimickers, and their suspected link to cancers. But 100% Pure still uses this ingredient that does exactly what synthetic parabens do. Unless you do your research, you don&#x27;t know this, and this is what the company hopes, I&#x27;m sure. I had no idea about any of this until I dug a little deeper. And FYI, from what I&#x27;ve noticed looking at their ingredients, 100% Pure uses this in MANY (if not most) of their skincare products.</li>
            <li> a good natural product</li>
            <li> It works great. The resveratrol is a savoir and I&#x27;m glad I got it. The cream makes me look younger than ever before.</li>
            <li> I love this moisteriZer as it really moisturizers the skin and the smell is terrific smells like fresh grapes.. But overall is it a anti aging I&#x27;m not sure and it&#x27;s quite expensive for a small tube. I think 100% pure needs to come up with a better deal or more plumped line for the anti aging skin care regime. People want to notice it immediately</li>
            <li> I really love these, they really work well on my skin. I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using the 100% pure red wine resveratrol nourishing cream for about a month.  I like that it is all natural organic ingredients.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it soaks into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling.  My skin feels very smooth.  Time will tell if it prevents wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like this product but the wine smell is a little strange. I&#x27;m not sure I should wear it and drive! But seriously, it&#x27;s a nice lotion. I also use the coffee bean eye cream which has a very nice sweet smell. Both have been good for my 63 year old sensitive face.</li>
            <li> This is the exact cream I had bought locally at a much, much high price.  This cream is quite good.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I had imagined. But overall happy with this purchase. Smell wasn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li> this product is of poor quality and smells bad. packaging substandard. it is very poor quality and i do not recommend at all.</li>
