            <li>The mango scent is pleasant!</li>
            <li>Great price as well, will buy this again.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Works great though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this nail polish remover</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing polish, even darker shades, and does not cause any drying at all.  </li>
            <li>Great nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>but, it works remarkably well.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a pleasant sort of fruity scent behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes off polish perfectly,  still smells, but that isn&#x27;t  a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li>This is a good nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>: I need to use a fair amount and</li>
            <li>This mineral fusion made nail polish come off so easily!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is healthier for my nails!  </li>
            <li>I found no toxic chemicals in here which is nice and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a miracle worker in my opinion.</li>
            <li>A bottle of it lasts awhile and it takes the polish off nicely.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, not overpowering or strong.</li>
            <li>It is acetone-free, but still has a very strong odor.  </li>
            <li>This product does have a very strong scent but it works like a champ and does not damage my nails.</li>
            <li>The best and most effective natural nail Polish Ever.</li>
            <li>Still, a better sealing cap would be nice.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, easily remove the polish without hurting the nails!!!</li>
            <li>However, the cap isn&#x27;t very secure</li>
            <li>Did a much better job and</li>
            <li>Light nice smell :)</li>
            <li>Nails and surrounding skin feels a lot better than using acetone.</li>
            <li>So while I do like the product, the packaging needs more work.</li>
            <li>When I received it, I had 2 layers of polish, 3 layers of a glitter coat, AND a top coat on my nails.</li>
            <li>Better than the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; chemical polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Still better then the alternative</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>the polish is quick and effective.</li>
            <li>This polish remover is lightly scented, free of acetone, quite effective.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on good reviews but was concerned, as most of the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; polish removers I&#x27;ve tried aren&#x27;t very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>due to many allergies, this is great!</li>
            <li>I like that easily removes nail color without any residue.</li>
            <li>so it leaks easily.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, when I use a brush dipped in the solution the effectiveness is exceptional and so fast on the removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It removes well but strong smell makes me cough.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider it the best natural np remover as far as ingredients, but it&#x27;s more affordable.</li>
            <li>And the fragrance is light and non-offensive.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and they graciously sent me another one for free.</li>
            <li>Works very well, and I&#x27;m happy to use a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re doing your best to limit harsh chemicals in your beauty routine</li>
            <li>It left my nails feeling great (as opposed to ravaged/sad/dry/gross).</li>
            <li>warm water and a soft nail brush easily eliminates any trace.</li>
            <li>It does take more pressure and time to remove certain kinds of nail polish.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s even using the aluminum foil wrap method to really get the most out of the cotton pad.</li>
            <li>quickly--</li>
            <li>If you do not, well, I find a quick wash with an organic, lemon hand soap,</li>
            <li>This entire collection of products is amazing.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and deserve to have it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Whole Foods as part of a 2 for $10 special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant, mild scent and is not near as drying as most other brands.</li>
            <li>Easily removes old polish.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong even when the bottle is closed, so I placed it in a ziploc bag and even still it is fairly strong.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s so much healthier and safer to use!</li>
            <li>I find the scent of this product to be much more offensive than traditional nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>I can remove a whole hand&#x27;s worth of nails with one soaked cotton pad.</li>
            <li>Solid color polish comes off within the first swipe for me but if I decided to put sparkles on top of the solid color, then it takes more work.</li>
            <li>This works just as fast and is cheaper, so I&#x27;m officially switching!</li>
            <li>Really effective at removing polish, not like other non-acetone removers i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, it definitely has a strong smell like other polish removers but when it dries it smells good.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, it definitely has a strong smell like other polish removers but when it dries it smells good.</li>
            <li>Works unbelievably fast just as good as asatone if not better.</li>
            <li>for the remover itself, it is a pretty decent remover.</li>
            <li>Works very</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is really a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; polish remover.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a diff between this and a non-acetone remover from, say, Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This product fits that bill, but I find the scent of this product to be more offensive and longer lasting than old fashioned nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>I did not find the smell to be any more offensive than other removers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It smells SO much better than other polish removers on the market</li>
            <li>used this for the first time, and I was totally amazed at how fast my nail polish came off!!</li>
            <li>It works best on a small cotton square or flattened cotton ball and then hold to nail for a few seconds before wiping.</li>
            <li>This is the only nail polish remover I&#x27;ve found so far that easily removes Mineral Fusion nail polish.</li>
            <li>I did not groom my nails that often anymore because of the toil and strain of removing the old nail polish!!</li>
            <li>I can use one cotton ball for all my nails (3 coats navy and clear coat of the same brand) and then one cotton ball to clean up my skin area.</li>
            <li>Used on several layers of &amp;#34;traditional/conventional&amp;#34; nail polish and was prepared to have to rub and rub, just knowing it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective as the conventional smelly remover.</li>
            <li>It took off Essie&#x27;s Big Spender from 5 toes with one saturated cotton ball and for that, it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful remover, at least on natural nails with plain polish (I have not tried it with glitter polish).  </li>
            <li>It has a chemical smell, but it&#x27;s not as strong as your typical nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>Very, very, *very* sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails like most other removers do.</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like is that it has an intense aroma.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to chemical odors, I would pass on this product.</li>
            <li>They are natural and vegan.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t need to use as much product as with standard removers.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to chemical scents, as I am, do not buy this.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>final result is gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that it&#x27;s so much less toxic than your typical nail polish remover too.    </li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money spent over drug store brands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not cheap, but I expect this one bottle to last a pretty long time so the cost benefit is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried the natural nail polish removers at Whole Foods, and other stores.</li>
            <li>This removes the Mineral fusion brand polish easily (My wife had to scrub with 2 other conventional polish</li>
            <li>I have purchased nearly the entire line.</li>
            <li>O_O  </li>
            <li>I remove my nail polish nearly every day and since I began using this product, my nails are healthier and not as dry and brittle.  </li>

            <li> this words but the smell (from fragrance) is so strong and weird.  </li>
            <li> the total fluid ounces are relatively low with respect to amount needed for removal of a dark color.</li>
            <li> Less harsh than drug store brands and works really well!</li>
            <li> When it first arrived in the mail, the seal was broken so about a third of the bottle was already gone.</li>
            <li> With other brands I have to use several applications.</li>
            <li> Might be a little more expensive than ones you can pick up at Walgreens</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a dry residue feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> i had such a hard time finding something that i didn&#x27;t feel was super unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Managed to get everything off (with minimal cotton ball destruction, I might add) in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Sticking with this and throwing the other stuff away.</li>
            <li> the polish came off in seconds, and I only had to use a small amount on one cottonball.</li>
            <li> only real complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the cap doesn&#x27;t keep it from leaking.</li>
            <li> No more pre-soaking, and rubbing for a long time!</li>
            <li> I was low on my other stuff, I figured, &amp;#34;This product cannot be as bad as the other ones; it can only get</li>
            <li> Not sure if I want to buy it again.</li>
            <li> no one in the household complained about the smell.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> and I also feel it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find them to be any worse than anything else than I have used</li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> No paraffins  or artificial anything.</li>
            <li> This acetone-free nail polish remover works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t have that awful chemical odor, which is harmful to smell and usually indicates another product tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I took off 1 star, but I hope that I just had bad luck.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist says that I&#x27;m having a reaction to one of them. :(</li>
            <li> Either this nail polish remover OR the Mineral Fusion Base Coat (or both) are causing my nails to split, peel and break horizontally!</li>

            <li> Smelly as acetone but works as well</li>
            <li> Used on several layers of &amp;#34;traditional/conventional&amp;#34; nail polish and was prepared to have to rub and rub, just knowing it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective as the conventional smelly remover. WRONG.  Did a much better job and no one in the household complained about the smell.  Sticking with this and throwing the other stuff away.</li>
            <li> The best nail polish!</li>
            <li> Accidentally reviewed under my husbands account. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now. It works just as well as acetone. As far as the smell, it definitely has a strong smell like other polish removers but when it dries it smells good. I will write another review to see if it&#x27;s made my nails healthier when I&#x27;ve used it for a month or so</li>
            <li> Really effective at removing polish, not like other non-acetone removers i&#x27;ve tried. Great price as well, will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the only nail polish remover I&#x27;ve found so far that easily removes Mineral Fusion nail polish. It has a chemical smell, but it&#x27;s not as strong as your typical nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now. It works just as well as acetone. As far as the smell, it definitely has a strong smell like other polish removers but when it dries it smells good. I will write another review to see if it&#x27;s made my nails healthier when I&#x27;ve used it for a month or so</li>
            <li> This works just as well as traditional acetone-based polish removers but I feel like it&#x27;s so much healthier and safer to use! And the fragrance is light and non-offensive.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful remover, at least on natural nails with plain polish (I have not tried it with glitter polish).  It&#x27;s got a pleasant, mild scent and is not near as drying as most other brands.</li>
            <li> I like that easily removes nail color without any residue. One application I can remove all nail polish and then do a touch up. With other brands I have to use several applications. The only thing I do not like is that it has an intense aroma.</li>
            <li> Works very quickly-- the polish came off in seconds, and I only had to use a small amount on one cottonball. Well worth the extra money spent over drug store brands. I did not find the smell to be any more offensive than other removers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is acetone-free, but still has a very strong odor.  I find the scent of this product to be much more offensive than traditional nail polish remover.  It does a great job of removing nail polish.  If you are sensitive to chemical odors, I would pass on this product.</li>
            <li> This entire collection of products is amazing. They are natural and vegan. No paraffins  or artificial anything. I have purchased nearly the entire line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is really a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; polish remover.  I don&#x27;t really see a diff between this and a non-acetone remover from, say, Sally Hansen. but, it works remarkably well. didn&#x27;t need to use as much product as with standard removers.  read and follow the directions though before you use it.  It took off Essie&#x27;s Big Spender from 5 toes with one saturated cotton ball and for that, it&#x27;s worth the cost. it&#x27;s not cheap, but I expect this one bottle to last a pretty long time so the cost benefit is worth it. job well done, mineral fusion!</li>
            <li> I was seeking nail polish remover without acetone.  This product fits that bill, but I find the scent of this product to be more offensive and longer lasting than old fashioned nail polish remover.  If you are sensitive to chemical scents, as I am, do not buy this.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> due to many allergies, this is great!</li>
            <li> I remove my nail polish nearly every day and since I began using this product, my nails are healthier and not as dry and brittle.  Have officially switched brands of remover to this.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, easily remove the polish without hurting the nails!!! Light nice smell :) Worth the price and deserve to have it</li>
            <li> Easily removes old polish. Nails and surrounding skin feels a lot better than using acetone.</li>
            <li> It removes well but strong smell makes me cough. Not sure if I want to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This removes the Mineral fusion brand polish easily (My wife had to scrub with 2 other conventional polish removers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced, however, that the ingredients are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I don&#x27;t consider it the best natural np remover as far as ingredients, but it&#x27;s more affordable. It works and the smell isn&#x27;t nauseating.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a dry residue feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived in the mail, the seal was broken so about a third of the bottle was already gone. I contacted Amazon and they graciously sent me another one for free. So props to Amazon for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the remover itself, it is a pretty decent remover. I can remove a whole hand&#x27;s worth of nails with one soaked cotton pad. However, the cap isn&#x27;t very secure so it leaks easily. The scent is pretty strong even when the bottle is closed, so I placed it in a ziploc bag and even still it is fairly strong. So while I do like the product, the packaging needs more work.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Whole Foods as part of a 2 for $10 special. Bought Mineral Fusion polish and their remover. This product does have a very strong scent but it works like a champ and does not damage my nails. I found no toxic chemicals in here which is nice and the polish is quick and effective. It does take more pressure and time to remove certain kinds of nail polish. Solid color polish comes off within the first swipe for me but if I decided to put sparkles on top of the solid color, then it takes more work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly awesome! When I received it, I had 2 layers of polish, 3 layers of a glitter coat, AND a top coat on my nails. Managed to get everything off (with minimal cotton ball destruction, I might add) in about 10 minutes. It&#x27;s kind of a miracle worker in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  Better than the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; chemical polish remover.  It&#x27;s wonderful knowing I&#x27;m not applying chemicals to my body!!  A little expensive but I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is a good nail polish remover. It does have a strong smell and I also feel it&#x27;s a little expensive. Works great though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tate&#x27;s nail polish remover for years.  This works just as fast and is cheaper, so I&#x27;m officially switching!</li>
            <li> i had such a hard time finding something that i didn&#x27;t feel was super unhealthy. this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> Takes off polish perfectly,  still smells, but that isn&#x27;t  a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and I&#x27;m happy to use a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this nail polish remover the smell is wonderful and takes the nail polish off immediately unlike the one to buy in the store it also seems gentler on the nailbed itself</li>
            <li> Works unbelievably fast just as good as asatone if not better. It smells too perfume like for my taste. Still better then the alternative but I could do without the scent. It works best on a small cotton square or flattened cotton ball and then hold to nail for a few seconds before wiping. I can use one cotton ball for all my nails (3 coats navy and clear coat of the same brand) and then one cotton ball to clean up my skin area.</li>
            <li> I like the way this words but the smell (from fragrance) is so strong and weird.  It smells like chemical fruity pebbles.  Am going to shop around for a natural-ish remover that works but without all the gross fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best nail polish remover ever!  It smells SO much better than other polish removers on the market and I love that it is healthier for my nails!  Might be a little more expensive than ones you can pick up at Walgreens but it&#x27;s well worth it.  A bottle of it lasts awhile and it takes the polish off nicely.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> BEST polish remover!  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails like most other removers do.</li>
            <li> Used to buy this from Wholefoods until I boycotted them. This acetone-free nail polish remover works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t have that awful chemical odor, which is harmful to smell and usually indicates another product tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the power, I would say double the strength of typical chemical nail polish removers.</li>
            <li> Smell like a lady, not a salon or chemist. This polish remover is lightly scented, free of acetone, quite effective. The mango scent is pleasant! Assuming you care for mango. If you do not, well, I find a quick wash with an organic, lemon hand soap, warm water and a soft nail brush easily eliminates any trace. And I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance. Very, very, *very* sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to give the polish 5 stars but here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a 4: I need to use a fair amount and the total fluid ounces are relatively low with respect to amount needed for removal of a dark color. That&#x27;s even using the aluminum foil wrap method to really get the most out of the cotton pad. If I could, I&#x27;d actually give it 4.5 stars. (UPDATE: After trying another brand that wrecked my nails, skin and cuticles from ONE use, I&#x27;m forgiving the amount needed and going up to 5 stars for unparalleled, unmatched moisturizing, protection and nourishing qualities, and will never stray again.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final result is gentle. My skin, cuticles and nail bed don&#x27;t look as though they&#x27;ve been jogging in the dessert. They are actually moisturized. It&#x27;s especially GREAT for touch-ups while doing a manicure. For whatever reason, when I use a brush dipped in the solution the effectiveness is exceptional and so fast on the removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re doing your best to limit harsh chemicals in your beauty routine I&#x27;d recommend this product without reservation. Just buy two bottles and thank me later.</li>
            <li> This works and works well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best nail polish remover I have ever used! It left my nails feeling great (as opposed to ravaged/sad/dry/gross). I&#x27;m super impressed. It&#x27;s nice to know that it&#x27;s so much less toxic than your typical nail polish remover too.    UPDATE: Either this nail polish remover OR the Mineral Fusion Base Coat (or both) are causing my nails to split, peel and break horizontally! O_O  My hair stylist says that I&#x27;m having a reaction to one of them. :( Anyone else experience this? I took off 1 star, but I hope that I just had bad luck.</li>
            <li> The best and most effective natural nail Polish Ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on good reviews but was concerned, as most of the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; polish removers I&#x27;ve tried aren&#x27;t very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is different.  It does a great job of removing polish, even darker shades, and does not cause any drying at all.  It also leaves a pleasant sort of fruity scent behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a difference of opinion between reviewers regarding the fumes while this is being used.  I don&#x27;t find them to be any worse than anything else than I have used and I find there are fewer residual fumes in the room when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle.  The 6 oz. bottle isn&#x27;t going to last long for anyone who does their nails on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Less harsh than drug store brands and works really well!</li>
            <li> Great nail polish remover. Smells good, not overpowering or strong. The only complaint I have is that the cap doesn&#x27;t keep it from leaking. If it gets tipped on its side, it gets everywhere. It leaves a greasy residue too. It ruined a part of my computer desk, but that was my fault. Still, a better sealing cap would be nice.</li>
            <li> I have tried the natural nail polish removers at Whole Foods, and other stores. I did not groom my nails that often anymore because of the toil and strain of removing the old nail polish!! OH boy! It would take so long with the other natural nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was low on my other stuff, I figured, &amp;#34;This product cannot be as bad as the other ones; it can only get better.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for the first time, and I was totally amazed at how fast my nail polish came off!! No more pre-soaking, and rubbing for a long time! This mineral fusion made nail polish come off so easily!! Thank you!!</li>
