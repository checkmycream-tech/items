    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>There was no was on that floss, and it flowed from the container flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>It was the best floss when Gore started it.  </li>
            <li>if you have tooth that are tighly pack together like mine - this is the best product to slide between your teeth</li>
            <li>This floss is the best.  </li>
            <li>EXCELLENT.  </li>
            <li>This used to be the best floss I&#x27;d ever used.</li>
            <li>It does not shred during use, and the compact flip-top container holds an incredible 109+ yards of floss!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li>Otherwise very good product that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Great price for 3 packs of floss.  </li>
            <li>And a great deal.</li>
            <li>Had to throw it away with a good amount of floss still on the spindle.      </li>
            <li>If you like the good stuff, Glide by Gore, don&#x27;t try to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>- i&#x27;ve tried everything else, they get stuck while flossing and none slides as good as this product</li>
            <li>&amp; I believe it makes the flossing MORE EFFECTIVE.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find Glide made of Gore-Tex anywhere.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Used to love Glide floss.  </li>
            <li>Flossed my teeth better too.  </li>
            <li>I love the floss tape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can hold the top on while pulling to prevent this.</li>
            <li>I am glad to see so many others have found this item to be so disapointing.</li>
            <li>It is the most effective and comfortable brand/style of floss that we have found.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>THE IDEAL FLOSSING SOLUTION PROVIDING THE ULTIMATE IN CONVENIENCE, EASE OF USE &amp; EFFECTIVENESS.</li>
            <li>My dental checkups began to improve immediately after flossing became easy.</li>
            <li>This floss is fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no moron, I&#x27;ll go elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This packaging option is the most economical way it is offered on Amazon, so we just keep reordering it when we run out.</li>
            <li>i.e. Crest Glide Original Tape which Amazon also sells.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this Glide 3 pack of 109.4 yd original flavor dental floss manufactured by Gore.  </li>
            <li>I was able to fix it by pulling a big ball of wax out of the top.  </li>
            <li>I wish Crest would change back to the old product and make us all happy.</li>
            <li>Frequently, when I pull to cut the tape across the tube top&#x27;s cutter, the entire top would pop out and the taperoll fall onto the ground.  </li>
            <li>Before a great dentist (Dr. Nancy Kaher in Palo Alto &amp; San Carlos, CA) had me try Glide, Dentotape was the only floss I could use as everything else would shred several times in just 1 flossing attempt.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap stuff, constantly snapped mid-floss</li>
            <li>We continue to get this over and over again because it really works!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This used to be the best floss, never shredded the packaging was stable, now it SHREDS constantly and the dispenser breaks off BOTH the metal on the smaller square packages and the mental AND plastic top on the larger canister style floss.</li>
            <li>The crest stuff shreds, it&#x27;s too slick to hold on to, and not too good at pulling plaque off your teeth.    </li>
            <li>I find that the original glide floss breaks and shreds less easily than the mint.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still easy to slide in &amp; out without shredding, but MORE SOLID due to being thicker.</li>
            <li>Very disapointing when companies try to save money but RUIN the product in the process.</li>
            <li>Overpriced version of the same floss available elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching to purchase as many of the old tubes in any local store I can find.</li>
            <li>The value for the 109.4 yard pack of three was better than I could find for other lengths.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only floss my husband can use that isn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Found this particular company on Amazon.      </li>
            <li>Some engineer tried to save a few pennies and the metal part now breaks off frequently or the top comes off.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the flip top pops open fairly easily when pulling out a piece of floss.  </li>
            <li>+ given worse problems with all the other types of floss many dentists &amp; hygienists have had me try, it&#x27;s worth the inconvenience of the slightly slippery Glide to have an easy to use, non-shredding option until a better solution emerges for tight teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found THE EVEN BETTER SOLUTION FOR TIGHT TEETH</li>
            <li>The pictures of Glide floss on Amazon appear to be the old versions of Glide that still had Gore-Tex fibers.</li>
            <li>The plastic compartment that holds the floss comes apart frequently and the metal piece falls off sometimes, too.</li>
            <li>After Crest acquired Glide, they apparently gutted the brand.</li>
            <li>What took me by surprise was that I grabbed an old tube out of my shaving kit, and the people who said this is not the same product that it used to be are spot on.  </li>
            <li>Such a disappointment too because I loved the old stuff.  </li>
            <li>Turns out, Crest bought the company from Gore a while back and obviously changed the product and packaging quality completely.</li>
            <li>So, DESPITE THE WAXING MAKING IT SOMETIMES GLIDE TOO EASILY OR HARDER TO HANG ON TO, I&#x27;M INFINITELY GRATEFUL FOR GLIDE as at least I can now floss easily without dread or needing to deal with the problems that stuck or shredded floss can cause.  </li>

It&#x27;s still easy to slide in &amp; out without shredding, but MORE SOLID due to being thicker. That makes it EASIER TO WORK WITH &amp; I believe it makes the flossing MORE EFFECTIVE.  AND IT&#x27;S NOT SLIPPERY like the Glide floss.  DEFINITELY THE IDEAL FLOSSING SOLUTION PROVIDING THE ULTIMATE IN CONVENIENCE, EASE OF USE &amp; EFFECTIVENESS.</li>
            <li> After Crest acquired Glide, they apparently gutted the brand. The pictures of Glide floss on Amazon appear to be the old versions of Glide that still had Gore-Tex fibers. The Crest Glide is completely different. Glide is just run-of-the-mill dental floss now not worth the premium in price. I haven&#x27;t been able to find Glide made of Gore-Tex anywhere. I&#x27;m finally going through this order of mediocre floss. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake. You&#x27;re better off using Oral-B.</li>
            <li> This ad is for the flip-top tube of 109 yards of floss. But what Amazon sends you is the little square boxes of floss. I ordered the flip-top tube from two different ads on Amazon and both vendors sent me the little square boxes. Use Google and buy the flip-top tube elsewhere (assuming you still want it after reading all the negative reviews of the product).</li>
            <li> This used to be the best floss, never shredded the packaging was stable, now it SHREDS constantly and the dispenser breaks off BOTH the metal on the smaller square packages and the mental AND plastic top on the larger canister style floss. Very disapointing when companies try to save money but RUIN the product in the process. What&#x27;s even worse is they increased the price of this already expensive floss and your getting less quality. I&#x27;m no moron, I&#x27;ll go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Used to love Glide floss.  But the recent 3 pack I ordered is not the same as the stuff I&#x27;m used to.  The last tube I was using, wax would be stripped off the floss as it was coming out of the dispenser to the point where it eventually clogged up.  I was able to fix it by pulling a big ball of wax out of the top.  Unfortunately this was only a temporary fix, as the floss moved up on the spindle inside and would catch against the top.  Eventually I was opening the tube every time I wanted to unwind a yard of floss, until some sort of tangle happened and it became unusable.  Had to throw it away with a good amount of floss still on the spindle.      What took me by surprise was that I grabbed an old tube out of my shaving kit, and the people who said this is not the same product that it used to be are spot on.  There was no was on that floss, and it flowed from the container flawlessly.  Flossed my teeth better too.  Not sure if this has to do with Crest buying the name, but this product is now garbage.  Overpriced version of the same floss available elsewhere.  Such a disappointment too because I loved the old stuff.  Alas.</li>
            <li> I love the floss tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube packaging is unacceptable.  Frequently, when I pull to cut the tape across the tube top&#x27;s cutter, the entire top would pop out and the taperoll fall onto the ground.  Who the heck designed this unsanitary dispensing design?</li>
            <li> I ordered this Glide 3 pack of 109.4 yd original flavor dental floss manufactured by Gore.  Amazon bait and switch me and sent me Glide by Crest.  The crest stuff shreds, it&#x27;s too slick to hold on to, and not too good at pulling plaque off your teeth.    I complained once, Amazon sent me another ship of Glide by Crest (deliberately ignoring my instructions to check the vendor).  I will be returning the junk floss and buying from somewhere that won&#x27;t advertise a product and sell me something inferior.    If you like Glide by Crest, this is it for you.  If you like the good stuff, Glide by Gore, don&#x27;t try to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Crest,  Since your company acquired glide floss the quality has plummeted!  It was the best floss when Gore started it.  Now I would give it a grade of D+.  I am an Orthodontist so I know what I am talking about.  Dr. Jerry  P.S.  This is written to Crest with the hope they again make floss we all like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, including the generic brand of this product and they simply do not come close. Everything else shreds and having a piece of dental floss stuck in your teeth is enough to drive you nuts. You can&#x27;t touch this price in the drugstore, so stock up!</li>
            <li> if you have tooth that are tighly pack together like mine - this is the best product to slide between your teeth - i&#x27;ve tried everything else, they get stuck while flossing and none slides as good as this product</li>
            <li> I find that the original glide floss breaks and shreds less easily than the mint.  The value for the 109.4 yard pack of three was better than I could find for other lengths.  My only complaint is that the flip top pops open fairly easily when pulling out a piece of floss.  I then have to gather the spool and put it back together.  You can hold the top on while pulling to prevent this. Otherwise very good product that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> We continue to get this over and over again because it really works! This packaging option is the most economical way it is offered on Amazon, so we just keep reordering it when we run out. It&#x27;s the only floss my husband can use that isn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This floss is the best.  It doesn&#x27;t shred between your teeth.    Found this particular company on Amazon.      Great price for 3 packs of floss.  Prompt delivery.  EXCELLENT.  Will order from them again.    Thanks!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the most expensive dental floss on earth and for that, you&#x27;d expect it wouldn&#x27;t break continuously.  But it does break. It&#x27;s intensely frustrating to use. I hate it and will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This floss is fine. And a great deal. All the people rating it 1 star are talking about a differently packaged product. This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> This used to be the best floss I&#x27;d ever used. But, the past several times I purchased it, it has been terrible. The plastic compartment that holds the floss comes apart frequently and the metal piece falls off sometimes, too. And, the floss itself is terrible quality lately. It shreds and falls apart unlike it used to. I didn&#x27;t know how the quality could have changed so dramatically until I went online and Googled &amp;#34;what happened to quality of Glide floss&amp;#34;. Turns out, Crest bought the company from Gore a while back and obviously changed the product and packaging quality completely. I wish Gore hadn&#x27;t sold to Crest. This product is terrible now. Don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> I am glad to see so many others have found this item to be so disapointing. This is not the same quality it used to be. It breaks all the time and doesn&#x27;t slide smoothly in tight spots. I am so sad about the quality. I have been searching to purchase as many of the old tubes in any local store I can find. I wish Crest would change back to the old product and make us all happy.</li>
            <li> We have been using Glide dental floss for years. It is the most effective and comfortable brand/style of floss that we have found.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It does not shred during use, and the compact flip-top container holds an incredible 109+ yards of floss! Unfortunately, this specific package format is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was given a Glide sample by some dentist years ago, I have been hooked. There are a couple of places in my mouth where two teeth are quite close together, and I had difficulty complying with flossing orders because floss so often broke off (and sometimes got stuck between teeth) during flossing. After switching to Glide, there is no reason to look elsewhere. My dental checkups began to improve immediately after flossing became easy. It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> Very cheap stuff, constantly snapped mid-floss</li>
