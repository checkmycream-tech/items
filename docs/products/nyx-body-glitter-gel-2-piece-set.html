            <li> Great for the price. Apply easily  much h better  than  a  spray.</li>
            <li> Both bottles arrived with no safety seal ~ and half empty!  How gross ~ they obviously had been used and returned by another customer.  Disgusting...had to disinfect my hands afterward.</li>

            <li> Exactly what I expected to get...glitter for your body. :)</li>
            <li> In the picture it looks like spray...wrong it&#x27;s a squirt gel with sparkle. It looks good but not convenient for stage. My girls do not the feel of it.</li>
            <li> perfect selection for the holidays.  I don&#x27;t know why it has become so hard to find this glitter gel, so I was happy to see this combo available.  thank you!</li>
            <li> I brought this gillter to to put on my skin so it can sparkle and give my skin a glam it last all day long</li>

            <li> I brought these for a costume and it works perfectly on my skin. it look pretty good in the sun light.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work it smears all the paint of face or make up</li>
            <li> Best body glitter gel I have found. also arrived fast</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-The glitter is shines on any type of skin&lt;br /&gt;-Very sparkly &amp; pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Stings Skin at times&lt;br /&gt;-Falls off easily &amp; quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Comes out really fast in big blobs of glitter that stay on one specific location (hand, arm,etc.), so must spread quickly before it dries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my 1st time buying glitter gel, and this product is okay. As I said before, it looks very nice on skin, but it falls off really fast.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably mix these with lotion &amp; Vaseline so they&#x27;ll stay on longer.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Stay on all day! Great product!</li>
            <li> You get a lots for your money but you only need to use a little ....daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but if its just for a one on, the bottles are too big.  If it is daily use, you will get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> I have now reordered this product five times, enough said? I just love it. My new nick name is sparkle girl.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly!  Excellent price too!!  I used this both on the hair and face. There was no weird gel build up, it was the perfect glitter gel.</li>
            <li> The glitter is a little strong, but I mixed it with body lotion and worked perfect!</li>
            <li> Great for nights out.a bit of sparkle.would buy again.the item&#x27;s arrived very quickly. Very happy with it.I would recommend it</li>
