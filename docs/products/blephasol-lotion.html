    <ol>
            <li>Really great!  </li>
            <li>i have eye allergies and this stuff is very good.</li>
            <li>It is great and</li>
            <li>its really great at cleaning your eyelids of any crust or contaminants.</li>
            <li>great stuff</li>
            <li>so you may not find this good for removing mascara, eyeliner, etc.</li>
            <li>works great and easy to use - will buy again</li>
            <li>I have tried warm compresses and antibiotic ointments for the inflamation in my eyes after I wear my contacts.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>but Blepharitis works better.  </li>
            <li>but it arrived with a leaking top.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things for belpharitis.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for daily treatment of blepharitis.  </li>
            <li>This has been the best thing for my eyes and now can not believe it took me so long to find this product.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, but found it almost a third cheaper in Boots over the counter, feel I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li>Please read the attached comments for more detailed information.  </li>
            <li>Great eye cleaner for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>And I have tried EVERY eyelid cleanser available.</li>
            <li>So grateful that it&#x27;s available here.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem most people have is that U.S. products tend to be too strong, and eventually cause an irritation as you consistently use the those products.  </li>
            <li>This condition effects everyone differently, and experimenting with various products and cleansing methods can be worthwhile until you find what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blehasol is far more mild, and does a better job of clearning away the buildup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but before I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this product, even with this medicine, I still couldn&#x27;t be on the computer for more than two hours or so without getting real eye dries.  </li>
            <li>item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The Blephasol is for use with cotton pads and doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed,  Great for when I don&#x27;t want to wash to whole face with soap (seriously dry skin).  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li>However, it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>If you have this particular ailiment, it would be wise to have a variety of different cleansing agents at your disposal to avoid relying on just one treatment alone.  </li>
            <li>is a good philosophy to live by when experimenting with personal health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very gentle and does not irritate the eyes like using Baby Shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have used this lotion and it seems to do the trick without burning whenever I brush the inside of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This is the first thing that has helped.  </li>
            <li>The BEST cleanser I have found for treating the most annoying condition Blepharitis.</li>
            <li>my eyes are able to produce its natural tears and keep my eyes naturally moist the way they are intended to be by nature.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will work this well for other people with dry eyes, but for me it work great.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfy</li>
            <li>I started washing my my eyelids (with my eyes closed) about twice a day, but most days</li>
            <li>Seems to really help the eyelid inflammation.</li>
            <li>Works very well to remove all residue.  </li>
            <li>I really like both formulas of this product Blephagel &amp; Blephasol.  </li>
            <li>I like this cleanser better than the other stuff i had been using.</li>
            <li>This product is so much better than optometrist-recommended brands such as Eye-Scrub or other brands such as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s eye makeup remover because it doesn&#x27;t sting at all when I use it to remove eye makeup and clean my eyelids thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Could probably find similar in USA but was recommended this by UK optician and relative and was easy to order on line.</li>
            <li>only thing is its only available in UK so it takes about 3 weeks to receive to USA.</li>
            <li>so far well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially the results were very positive, however, after awhile, I began to find the product too harsh for my very sensitive eye-lids, and had to discontinue its use.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for cleaning the eyelid and assists with a common but very irritating eye lid affliction known as Blepheritis.  </li>
            <li>Having dry eyes and blepharitis, I&#x27;m always looking for something new that might help with my problem.</li>

            <li> I wish this one could remove makeup completely (it does a little) because Blepharitis doesn&#x27;t remove any at all.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to arrive but it works for me so far</li>
            <li> Also, I still need to use medicine for dry eyes (Restasis)</li>
            <li> it cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry your eyelids.</li>
            <li> whereby there is a buildup of foreign matter on the edges of your eyelids near your eyelash roots, and the small oil-glands that are along that same eyelid edge.  </li>
            <li> This lotion (not really a lotion in consistency, it is a liquid like water), is specifically designed to treat blepharitis, (an eye lid problem)</li>
            <li> things have improved so far to the point that I have only periodic, minor episodes of dry eyes that bother only bad enough to get my washing cleaning done.</li>
            <li> Even just plain soap and water can be alternately used.  </li>
            <li> but I would recommend this product over other lid cleansers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it at night and also in the morning before makeup, and there seems to be some relief that other products give.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a day and it calms down the itchy inflammation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have found that often times the philosophy of \\&quot;Less is More\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> With that I mean that maybe if I&#x27;d follow religiously my eyelid cleaning twice a day, my eyes wouldn&#x27;t bother me, but I need a little reminder though.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while for package to be received.</li>
            <li> Prior to Blephasol, I was so desperate that I tried several medicines, including computer software to remind me to close eyes for lubrication, that my eye doctor was running out of options.  </li>
            <li> no more antibiotics</li>
            <li> I assume that this was because the base of the lashes was cleaner.</li>

            <li> Excelent! I am very satisfy</li>
            <li> This lotion (not really a lotion in consistency, it is a liquid like water), is specifically designed to treat blepharitis, (an eye lid problem) whereby there is a buildup of foreign matter on the edges of your eyelids near your eyelash roots, and the small oil-glands that are along that same eyelid edge.

The blehasol is far more mild, and does a better job of clearning away the buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a terrific product, and we would not hesitate purchasing it again as it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional note.  If you have this particular ailiment, it would be wise to have a variety of different cleansing agents at your disposal to avoid relying on just one treatment alone.  Even just plain soap and water can be alternately used.  This condition effects everyone differently, and experimenting with various products and cleansing methods can be worthwhile until you find what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;We have found that often times the philosophy of \\&quot;Less is More\\&quot;. is a good philosophy to live by when experimenting with personal health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for awhile, I&#x27;m including this up-date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially the results were very positive, however, after awhile, I began to find the product too harsh for my very sensitive eye-lids, and had to discontinue its use.  Please read the attached comments for more detailed information.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Having dry eyes and blepharitis, I&#x27;m always looking for something new that might help with my problem. I&#x27;m back for a second bottle, even though the price is quite steep. I found that after using the product for approx 2 months, my eye lashes had improved. They were longer and thicker. I assume that this was because the base of the lashes was cleaner.</li>
            <li> works great and easy to use - will buy again</li>
            <li> item arrived quickly. I like this cleanser better than the other stuff i had been using. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a miracle cure or anything, because i&#x27;ll always be cursed with eye issues. but I would recommend this product over other lid cleansers.</li>
            <li> I started washing my my eyelids (with my eyes closed) about twice a day, but most days --now-- I do it once a day and things have improved so far to the point that I have only periodic, minor episodes of dry eyes that bother only bad enough to get my washing cleaning done. With that I mean that maybe if I&#x27;d follow religiously my eyelid cleaning twice a day, my eyes wouldn&#x27;t bother me, but I need a little reminder though. Also, I still need to use medicine for dry eyes (Restasis) but before I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this product, even with this medicine, I still couldn&#x27;t be on the computer for more than two hours or so without getting real eye dries.  Prior to Blephasol, I was so desperate that I tried several medicines, including computer software to remind me to close eyes for lubrication, that my eye doctor was running out of options.  So Blephasol is nothing but a blessing for me.  I don&#x27;t know if it will work this well for other people with dry eyes, but for me it work great. I hope it continue working so far well and I don&#x27;t develop allergies to it.</li>
            <li> The BEST cleanser I have found for treating the most annoying condition Blepharitis. Always makes my eyes feel refreshed after every use. It is also very gentle and does not irritate the eyes like using Baby Shampoo. It takes a little while for package to be received. However, it is well worth the wait. And I have tried EVERY eyelid cleanser available.</li>
            <li> Big help works on my eyelids. Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for cleaning the eyelid and assists with a common but very irritating eye lid affliction known as Blepheritis.  This is the only product I have ever encountered that is intended to assist with this problem.  Really great!  Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> Seems to really help the eyelid inflammation. Use it twice a day and it calms down the itchy inflammation. Wish it came in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> This lotion takes that itch off ASAP</li>
            <li> It gets rid of crusty stuff around the eyelids and does not need to be washed afterwards. Baby shampoo has to be rinsed and leaves lids dry-dry-dry.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have used this lotion and it seems to do the trick without burning whenever I brush the inside of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;Will possibly order this again.</li>
            <li> Very good product, but found it almost a third cheaper in Boots over the counter, feel I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li> This is a liquid (like water) not a lotion.  Otherwise it&#x27;s ok but Blepharitis works better.  I wish this one could remove makeup completely (it does a little) because Blepharitis doesn&#x27;t remove any at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it at night and also in the morning before makeup, and there seems to be some relief that other products give.</li>
            <li> This product is so much better than optometrist-recommended brands such as Eye-Scrub or other brands such as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s eye makeup remover because it doesn&#x27;t sting at all when I use it to remove eye makeup and clean my eyelids thoroughly.  Works very well to remove all residue.  So grateful that it&#x27;s available here.</li>
            <li> Great eye cleaner for sensitive eyes. Imported from UK.  Could probably find similar in USA but was recommended this by UK optician and relative and was easy to order on line.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it arrived with a leaking top. A lot of the lotion had leaked and saturated the box.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to arrive but it works for me so far</li>
            <li> I really like both formulas of this product Blephagel &amp; Blephasol.  The Blephasol is for use with cotton pads and doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed,  Great for when I don&#x27;t want to wash to whole face with soap (seriously dry skin).  I cannot use eye makeup because of Sjogren&#x27;s so you may not find this good for removing mascara, eyeliner, etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things for belpharitis.  This is the first thing that has helped.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I think it helps if used regularly</li>
            <li> I have tried warm compresses and antibiotic ointments for the inflamation in my eyes after I wear my contacts.  This has been the best thing for my eyes and now can not believe it took me so long to find this product.  It is great and no more antibiotics</li>
            <li> I have ordered this lotion a second time.  It is perfect for daily treatment of blepharitis.  I wear contacts, and this lotion allows me to get through the day.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used the lotion a couple of times. its really great at cleaning your eyelids of any crust or contaminants. i have eye allergies and this stuff is very good. it cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry your eyelids. my eyes are able to produce its natural tears and keep my eyes naturally moist the way they are intended to be by nature. great stuff you won&#x27;t regret this purchase. only thing is its only available in UK so it takes about 3 weeks to receive to USA.</li>
