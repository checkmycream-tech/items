            <li> I wanted another product, but but the design on container (white and pink) is the same on all their products.</li>
            <li> now Sween Cream is the only moisturizer I use at  home for my hands, face and any other dry skin patches.  </li>

            <li> Used on a family member in nursing home. It is the best cream for preventing bed sores.</li>
            <li> Back in the days when I was a home health nurse, I functioned as the wound care nurse as well.  I found the sween cream to be very beneficial for irritated skin on the elderly as well as the young.  So having ran out of the sample tubes that I was so lucky to have, I was so happy to find that I could purchase this wonderful cream on line.</li>
            <li> i love  it. i have dry skin and use it every day. no more itching or tightness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly and it works fine. I just can&#x27;t get over the nasty perfume odor. I constantly smell like I just came back from visiting a nursing home full of ladies with papery skin. I&#x27;m pretty sure the average age of people who use this stuff is about 84.</li>
            <li> Better than Vanicream</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to help my split heels. I thought it was a never ending battle that I would just have to suffer through for the rest of my life. I WAS WRONG! This product has made my feet so much healthier and has relieved so much pain. thank you Sween Cream! Aslo my daughter had chicken pox. Completely gone in 72 hours with sween cream. amazing</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Moisturizes skin, nice scent. Great for massages!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this lotion before seeing it on here. As I am a new Ostomy wearer, I was looking for a lotion I could wear under the adhesive of the Ostomy bags and I can say that I was NOT disappointed!! I love, love, love this lotion!! No more sore spots around my stoma and my skin is so soft and healthy looking!! Great seller too!</li>
            <li> They must have changed the contents of this product. It used to start the healing process overnight, now it takes days.</li>
            <li> it has fully met our expectations and has been a very good find for a cream for my invalid wife.</li>
            <li> excellent product that we use everyday, so do not like having to submit a review since we have been buying it for 3 yrs and have written numerous reviews, Amazon should develop a way of not requesting reviews on items already reviewed over and over, is annoying</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cream.  My skin is itchy and red.  Since using Sween Cream it&#x27;s soft and not itchy or red anymore.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have chronically rough and cracked heels; I put this on every morning before I put my shoes and socks on and it keeps my&lt;br /&gt;feet smooth and soft.  The only thing I have ever used that actually Worked.  It was recommended by my pedicurist</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It is good for so many uses. I keep some on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> Great product to heal most skin break down issues rashes, redness, irritation, itching, severe beakdown of skin. I have used it for years, highly recommend it&#x27;s use!&lt;br /&gt;Craig</li>
            <li> My husband began using this every night before he had radiation, he had 33 radiation visits. We applied it thickly and let it soak in. The doctors are amazed at how good his skin looks and feels. Just be sure to clean it completely off before getting the radiation.</li>
            <li> THE best product for dry skin. My wife uses it for her hands and it is the same produce that nurses and pain specialists recommend to use. The price here is the best that I found after doing a lot of research. Stop your searching around, buy it here....good delivery.  I am not a shill, all I&#x27;ve said is true.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and love this product.  Will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Our doctor recommended Sween for dry skin.  It seems that the nurses at the hospital swear by it. It is less greasy than the usual petroleum base products.  The only draw back is that when first applied it is white, but that goes away as it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Make sure it has Vitamin D.</li>
            <li> I use this on my husband&#x27;s legs.  They are very sore and have swelling and leakage.  Helps for the dryness.</li>
            <li> I just keep buying this cream.  My mother&#x27;s home health nurse recommended it years ago.  It is a staple in my home.  Particularly good for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> this cream is a excellent body moisturuzer.....the reason for three stars is the smell.....every time i use it i have add some essential oil to it.....the smell is weird for a body cream.....they should make it fragrance free</li>
            <li> Did not like this quite as much as the Atrac-tain coloplast. Much thinner and not as efficient.</li>
            <li> This cream is especially good for children and older adults who avoid using cream for chapping because it &amp;#34;stings&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;feels funny&amp;#34;.  Get some for all those chapped hands and faces this winter!  Great year round.</li>
            <li> I use this on my nieces&#x27; unmanageable hair as a detangler after baths.  Works great, plus softens their hair.  They have fine blonde hair that tangles if you look at it.</li>
            <li> THE BEST CREAM EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and it helped her severe dry skin.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I made for my dad. Really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> i ordered the 12 oz jar and received 6.5 oz. tube. totally unacceptable, false advertising.  I have used this product for years</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  What more can I say.  Been using this for a couple of years and always been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Cooling to the skin, helps cracked fingers immensely!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream for dry skin, and I also use in on my arm that was burned.  Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The nurses and physical therapists used Sween Cream on me when I was in the hospital.  It was the only moisturizer they would use on my dry skin and it worked miracles.  I came home and threw  away all those bottles of lotion and jars of moisturizer I had and now Sween Cream is the only moisturizer I use at  home for my hands, face and any other dry skin patches.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema, and believe me when I tell you I have spent a fortune trying to find a lotion or cream that will help alleviate his dry, itchy skin.  This Sween Cream really works.  He absolutely loves it.  My only complaint is I dislike the fragrance.  It does not bother him at all.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and it absorbs well.  When he puts this on he can usually go a few days without itching.  A real blessing.</li>
            <li> not the sween cream I used a few years back but is OK</li>
            <li> This cream is very good for dry skin.  I have used the thicker version of Sween in the tube, but wanted to try this type also.  It goes on real smooth...and in just a minute your hands and skin have a velvet satin feel to them.</li>
            <li> great product goes into shin easy</li>
            <li> Its a good product, but one of them arrived with a crack in the bottom. Some cream was wasted!</li>
            <li> Same as the Sween 24, but easier to apply.  Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing or towels.</li>
            <li> Best Diaper Rash Cream ever</li>
            <li> This cream is sticky, and it leaves uncomfortable feeling on your skin. I threw it in the trash. I wanted another product, but but the design on container (white and pink) is the same on all their products. So whether it&#x27;s a hand cream or body cream or foot cream, the design and colours will all be the same, pink and white (confusing).</li>
            <li> Have been using sween cream for the last thirty years.  Live in a very dry climate and have very dry skin, especially in the winter.  Have not used any other product that has been as effective.</li>
