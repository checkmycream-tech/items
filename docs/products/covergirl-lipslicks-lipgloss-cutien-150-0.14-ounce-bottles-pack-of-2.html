            <li> The colour is very natural and the gloss goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or artificial.</li>
            <li> Love it and use it nightly to moisturize my lips, especially in the winter months, which in turn seems to help ward off cold sores?</li>
            <li> Usually it rubs off within an hour</li>
            <li> Disappointed that Covergirl discontinued line.</li>

            <li> The color is perfect and it does keep lips moist, however it does not last very long. Usually it rubs off within an hour so you have to constantly reapply it. However, I don&#x27;t wear make up that much and for the cost, I think it is still a good product.</li>
            <li> could no longer find this in the brick and mortar stores so I&#x27;m happy to find it at Amazon. It is light but looks great applied along with a lip liner.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Wish I could buy in the store still</li>
            <li> This is easy.  This lipgloss is exactly what I wanted, and the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  Simple as that.</li>

            <li> Wish Cover Girl did not discontinue this product</li>

            <li> I do like this product but it is a tad too light for my taste, however I have found I can wear it under lipstick and it adds a shiny shimmer that I like.</li>
            <li> Very nice!...It is like lipstick and lip gloss in one!</li>
            <li> This is the only tinted lipgloss that I will ever wear!!!!  CoverGirl stopped making it so I&#x27;m trying to hoard all that I can find!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it really does stay on for a long time I really like it. The color is perfect.</li>
