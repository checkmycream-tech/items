            <li>Might just be good for a backup/travel razor.</li>

            <li>So yes its a good razor</li>
            <li>Good quality and functional.</li>
            <li>I was dissapointed with this, not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, it would be good for travel though.</li>
            <li>and I LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Once I tried it, I loved it</li>
            <li>I was about to purchase it when I saw a link to the Clio Shaver, which also had good reviews.</li>
            <li>I consider, that I found a good buy,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim and easy to hang in your shower with its attached dainty rope.</li>
            <li>The bright and colorful design was delightful.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SHAVER!</li>
            <li>Do love that it is waterproof and can stay in my shower!</li>
            <li>Well it is amazing.</li>
            <li>As the title says, this shaver is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>so well I am getting my own.</li>
            <li>I have also found it to be particularly handy for the bikini zone.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;~ Removable wrist strap or shower hanger keeps it handy</li>
            <li>It works nicely, as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>That particular model was awesome because it was rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>I see it&#x27;s still cheap to buy online anyway. :P    </li>
            <li>It is cute looking and a nice travel companion.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so inexpensive, I&#x27;d give it four stars, but for the great price, it is definitely worth it and deserves five stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and does not cause any pain or irritation at all!</li>
            <li>now I love it</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I was impressed enough to try it- after all, look at the price!</li>
            <li>I bought this from Walgreens about a year ago because of its compact size, and cute design.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>NOW THERE ARE TOO MANY</li>
            <li>(MOST</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>It works ok if you can get the battery to engage and get it started.  </li>
            <li>Tried a better battery</li>
            <li>Looking for a better razor.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it again,</li>
            <li>Bonus: it comes in cute colors and patterns.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok in an emergency, or when you find yourself out of razors, but I would not use it routinely.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this shaver.</li>
            <li>I love the color you sent me.</li>
            <li>I love a bargain, but quite often you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>In this case though I feel I got much more than that and couldn&#x27;t be happier about finding this deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still believe most electric razors are too noisy, this one is no exception</li>
            <li>I love the strap that allows you to hang it in the shower or tub.  </li>
            <li>But better than shaving for sure.</li>
            <li>I have to rate this shaver as ok.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I may order more for my granddaughters who are just&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel, non-irritating, and battery will last a while.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok w me</li>
            <li>Lovely lavender and floral exterior.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s a picky person :)</li>
            <li>love this   I had a Remmington for over 30 years lost the cord, found it could not be replaced.  </li>
            <li>This is a just okay product.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of shaving, quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no bumps, nice and clean</li>
            <li>I first started shaving, my Mom bought me a battery-operated electric razor that I loved.</li>
            <li>wow it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Anyway my daughter loves it and was really happy when I fixed it.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is pretty awesome so far.</li>
            <li>You can use it in the water too, which is cool!</li>
            <li>Better than the original</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I sent for 2 more</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Bought this razor in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have nicks on my knees anymore &amp; for easy shaving while camping.</li>
            <li>The Palmperfect cordless shaver is easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaving head is easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, so you can easily take it traveling or drop it in your cosmetics drawer in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>This works ok but clogs easy so after every swipe you have to clean out with a strong stream of water.  </li>
            <li>If the blades are going to be   easily  </li>
            <li>It is compact and easy to use and safer than a disposable type</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great, delicate, very nice for shaving.</li>
            <li>It works fine for me for my use; not as close as a blade razor</li>
            <li>It performed just fine, but I had always considered it a bit bulky.</li>
            <li>Love this because its so small and works perfect for my legs and underarms!!!</li>
            <li>It is light, gentle on your skin, easy to handle, fits in the palm of your hand, does the kind of job that every woman desires, packs easily for your traveling moments.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of a material that&#x27;s easy to grip and is the right size for fitting in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>It fits comfortable in the hand and easy to clean the razor head.</li>
            <li>but there is no convenient place to put my foot comfortably, so</li>
            <li>I think the problem is that the motor no longer works, and it must be a cheap motor.</li>
            <li>Smooth......</li>
            <li>For only $10, it was a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>B00006WNQZ Remington WDF-1100 Smooth &amp; Silky Women Body Contour Shaver (Color May Vary)]]</li>
            <li>it is cheap.</li>
            <li>Does not make your legs smooth.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS GREAT AND IS GENTLE</li>
            <li>This was very economically priced</li>
            <li>SALONS ARE CLEAN ALONG WITH THEIR WAX)...</li>
            <li>That said, I can&#x27;t figure out how to change the blades to clean them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who needs a razor that will do a decent job in a hurry, and that&#x27;s easy to use, and a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>On the bright side, I got my money back.</li>
            <li>This shaver works great on longer hairs, even with no attachment or trimmer, so you can still have great results even when you use it after missing several days of shaving.</li>
            <li>I really liked this Clio shaver, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive underarm or bikini area.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU CLIO FOR MAKING A TRUE WOMAN&#x27;S RAZOR....</li>
            <li>I just purchased this item at a local drug store yesterday based in the good reviews</li>
            <li>It gives what looks like a good shave, but definitely doesn&#x27;t feel like a close shave...</li>
            <li>As all shavers, it doesn&#x27;t do as close a shave as a razor, but good enough.  </li>
            <li>AS I TRAVEL THE SUPER HIGHWAY OF MENOPAUSE!!!!!!YEARS</li>
            <li>AND WITH ONE QUICK PASS I AM ALL SET FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS...</li>
            <li>but it still looses it power too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also, I read reviews that it drains the battery quickly.</li>
            <li>It does quick work w close shave on armpits.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>But, this one works well if you need a quick shave in between blade shaves.  </li>
            <li>, thank you very much , I will come bake soon!</li>
            <li>This is easily the best $10 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>It will be great for my upcoming trips too; it takes up a lot less space</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t pain free.  </li>
            <li>Unless it dies within a few weeks, this is a great bargain.</li>
            <li>Well, it uses AAA batteries &amp; has economical replaceable razor-tops, so it&#x27;s sooo economical</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised that it doesn&#x27;t cost more.  </li>
            <li>AND WAS NOT CHANGED OUT FOR FRESH WAX!!!!THAT</li>
            <li>It has made it fun to shave.</li>
            <li>Fresh batteries and</li>
            <li>In plain words, it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it fills the purpose for which I bought it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t argue this with me, you know I&#x27;m right).</li>
            <li>I can see why the price was so right now.</li>
            <li>Got rusty right away in the bathroom</li>
            <li>I bought this simply to keep my bikini line trimmed because it&#x27;s very easily irritated</li>
            <li>This little razor is amazing!</li>
            <li>, it gives you a close trim and is very painless, fast, and easy.</li>
            <li>So small and does a great job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wired kind of strange.  </li>
            <li>was looking for a replacement and was surprised to find it in Pink, GREAT,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the hand, both adult and child size.  </li>
            <li>Although I had not heard of this brand before, the reviews her were mostly positive and for the price is was worth the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works just fine so far.  </li>
            <li>I did purchase blades for my old shaver to use at home and it worked out fine.  </li>
            <li>First time I ever tried a Clio Cordless.  </li>
            <li>This does it&#x27;s job, but it pulls the hair at first.</li>
            <li>In fact, I still have a very inexpensive battery-operated trimming razor that still works after 23 years!</li>
            <li>BUT MY FEMALE FACE IS GETTING MORE HAIRS</li>
            <li>So this was the first electric razor I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work consistently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say more like 10% of the time is actually turns on.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is same as its description, so l love it</li>
            <li>I had a similar sized electric shaver with a cord from the 70s that i threw away when I purchased this (the cord kept falling out &amp; was probably not too safe anymore) but that shaver worked.</li>
            <li>I had gotten this as my granddaughter&#x27;s first razor.  </li>
            <li>This is the first item from Amazon that I returned.  </li>
            <li>, I bought an extra as well as blades, just so I would always have one. :)</li>
            <li>I had to fight to get it to register the batteries the first time.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t even get this one to start the FIRST time around.  </li>
            <li>AT FIRST WHEN I BOUGHT IT</li>
            <li>used the Clio for the first time in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I cannot use a razor on my legs because I will nick myself in many different places</li>
            <li>It does a decent enough job for her underarms, and it&#x27;s great that it is a wet/dry, but I definitely recommend spending the extra cash for a better model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very loud and it&#x27;s very light weight and portable.</li>
            <li>This was a very reasonably priced and useful gift for a student graduating to high school.</li>
            <li>This will be great for carrying on trips as it is very small and no attachements to worry about taking along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that time consuming and frustrating, having said that, the fact that its waterproof and I can keep it in the bathroom does come in handy and it does do the job, eventually, just takes more than one pass.</li>
            <li>MOST SHAVER&#x27;S ARE BIG BULKY AND VERY SLIPPERY.</li>
            <li>It is cute and small so easily stored; Performance:</li>
            <li>Shaved completely dry and in a rush, yet it did a fine job!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a very close or consistent shave</li>
            <li>more than twice no matter how long I have neglected said area.</li>
            <li>It works just as good as my past electric shavers and it is battery operated.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase, fast delivery, all that was expected!!!!</li>
            <li>Went over the same spot 5 times and then gave up because it&#x27;s faster and way more productive to just use a normal razor.</li>
            <li>It gives a very decent shave, and the way it is designed makes it very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>Nice little shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy little woman&#x27;s razor and works well on legs.  </li>
            <li>So far this has been a good little shaver.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t found any of these things to be huge problems, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>wet or dry,-what more can you ask?</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but</li>
            <li>Plus, it looses energy too fast.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well</li>
            <li>I especially like the shape, which makes it comfortable to hold when using.</li>
            <li>so I can use it fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for avoid this product at all costs.  </li>
            <li>Really inefficient.</li>
            <li>I was thinking that I have nothing to lose if I buy such a cheap item and doesn&#x27;t works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to ordering this I had used the Remington WDF-1100 Smooth &amp; Silky Women Body Contour Shaver for the last year.</li>
            <li>This shaver works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the trimmers on the sides.    </li>
            <li>Especially near the pool.</li>
            <li>Too much noise it made.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair</li>
            <li>I took this with me for a trip to Barbados and it really does work very well for the price.</li>
            <li>, it still left my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well - leaves no stubble.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t love the shape and size to get in harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it would be too good if you have thick wiry hair to shave.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s okay for now, but if the batteries die in in just a day right in the middle of trimming my tender nether-regions then I will immediately buy a completely different manufacturer&#x27;s model that is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric shaver and after reading several reviews for many different shavers, I was a bit leery about what to expect.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure the last Clio only died because it was squished in the trunk of my car for 5 days.</li>
            <li>I needed a new razor right away and prefer battery-operated products (two of my rechargable razors lost their chargeability after little more than a year).  </li>
            <li>What a nice little travel shaver!  </li>
            <li>This one barely cuts when fresh batteries are installed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty loud.</li>
            <li>When it died after eight or nine years, she bought a new electric razor that we both hated--it felt like it yanked the hairs out by the roots rather than shaving them off!</li>
            <li>However, the shaver didn&#x27;t provide a super close shave for my underarms, which is necessary when wearing sleeveless tops.</li>
            <li>I purchased the older model of the Clio shaver about 4 years ago at a pharmacy</li>
            <li>Highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as good at removing the hair as a regular razor, but the wet/dry convenience and irritation-free shave is definitely worth the extra few swipes.</li>
            <li>The blades pop out so you can clean them, and there are replacement blades available from Amazon, in case they get dull.</li>
            <li>This little shaver is fantastic!</li>
            <li>So far I really like this cordless razor.  </li>
            <li>My experience was completely painless and I found this to be much easier and quicker than razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>Now, if you&#x27;re angry at someone and want to passive-aggressively punish them, this would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>Not as comfortable a shave as expected.</li>
            <li>It works fine, and functions pretty much the same as my previous model, I&#x27;m just bummed that I have to destroy the earth with more used batteries.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new product for the underarm area.</li>
            <li>Then I inserted brand new alkaline batteries per the instructions.  </li>
            <li>I bought new batteries and everything, but it didnt work.  </li>
            <li>( new batteries even).  </li>
            <li>It was time to replace my very old cordless shaver.  </li>
            <li>TWO just to make sure I have one in my bag for travel and the other in my back bathroom and</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s loud!  </li>
            <li>It did a better job than the others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Love the color and the small size/weight</li>
            <li>It turns on just fine, but no matter how I turn it or position it, it shaves little to no hair.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more, get something that will last.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find Clio after being unable to find a cordless, battery operated shaver locally.</li>
            <li>So surprised at the quality considering</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give a very close shave without going over the same area repeatedly, but served the purpose.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my old manual shaver with this one it does so well.  </li>
            <li>MY OLD ONE BROKE</li>
            <li>However, this shaver exceeded my expectations by far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cream hair removers but they cause an allergic reaction with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised with the power of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S COMPACT AND SOFT.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s as far as I got - the battery died.</li>
            <li>On the downside, it doesn&#x27;t give you as close a shave as a traditional razor and you do have to pass over the area a few times to get as close a shave as most of us ladies would want.</li>
            <li>This Clio is perfect...fits in the palm of the hand and completed a full shave without running down.  </li>
            <li>this Shaver , Not only, It doesn&#x27;t brake down, cleans easy, travels well</li>
            <li>; I have to go over the same area numerous times and it only shortens the hair, not completely shaving it off; that is irritating; but it is a great product for the price!</li>
            <li>My rechargable electric ladies razor just died after about 2 years &amp; after trying to get new batteries from Norelco &amp; finding out that model&#x27;s been discontinued, my only option, I thought was spend another $40-$80 for a new 1.</li>
            <li>It was finally time for a new one!  </li>
            <li>Just about when I first moved to PA  15 years ago , but the only color they had was Yellow</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I recommend this cute little pink Clio to any woman out there looking to change razors or add one in to her routine.</li>
            <li>Tried multiple new batteries, but still won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Since she has used it a few times now, it doesn&#x27;t pull so much anymore, but it doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this except to use occasionally in an emergencies and definitely not under your arms or on your face.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised by the quality of such an inexpensive item.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin, so this was my first electric shaver, I was scared to use something other than a my razor, and when I finally bought this to help with my bikini line, I tried it</li>
            <li>It is small, travels easily, uses standard batteries (AAA), and doesn&#x27;t require buying and storing disposable razors.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;~ Small palm size, makes it easy to hold especially when wet&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Small enough that it&#x27;ll be easy to take for travel or to the gym</li>
            <li>I would have to go up &amp; down my leg in the same spot for several minutes before it would be even partially smooth.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have something I could keep in my car for extra long days when I&#x27;m going straight from work to go out</li>
            <li>This barely got any of the hairs on my leg.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave and works even on coarse hair or sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I barely got 6 months out of the ones I used to get.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it two times so far, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>old enough to start shaving.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin silky soft like a traditional razor does, but what electric razor does?</li>
            <li>She thought it was well worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>Price was great, but upon researching to purchase a replacement, lo and behold, I was unable to track one down.</li>
            <li>While waiting for my Clio shaver to arrive from Amazon, I saw &amp; bought the exact one at Wal-Mart for less than $9.00.  </li>
            <li>This particular one was more expensive, but the same as rest of the order.</li>
            <li>and it was so cheap (seriously, like $10), that there was no risk in trying it.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have ever owned, I used a regular razor for down there...</li>
            <li>So I never shave my upper legs (the hair there is soft and blonde and invisible), and I shave my lower legs only when I feel like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone due to ease of use, no irritation, and you won&#x27;t cut your ankle or knee by accident anymore.</li>
            <li>It also pulls my fine thin hair if longer than stubble.  </li>
            <li>At first this thing was a little bit like torture, BUT!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Might just be good for a backup/travel razor.</li>
            <li> , I thought it couldn&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li> So yes its a good razor</li>
            <li> Good quality and functional.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed with this, not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, it would be good for travel though.</li>
            <li> and I LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Once I tried it, I loved it</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase it when I saw a link to the Clio Shaver, which also had good reviews.</li>
            <li> I consider, that I found a good buy,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim and easy to hang in your shower with its attached dainty rope.</li>
            <li> The bright and colorful design was delightful.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAVER!</li>
            <li> Do love that it is waterproof and can stay in my shower!</li>
            <li> Well it is amazing.</li>
            <li> As the title says, this shaver is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> so well I am getting my own.</li>
            <li> I have also found it to be particularly handy for the bikini zone.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;~ Removable wrist strap or shower hanger keeps it handy</li>
            <li> It works nicely, as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> That particular model was awesome because it was rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> I see it&#x27;s still cheap to buy online anyway. :P    </li>
            <li> It is cute looking and a nice travel companion.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so inexpensive, I&#x27;d give it four stars, but for the great price, it is definitely worth it and deserves five stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and does not cause any pain or irritation at all!</li>
            <li> now I love it</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I was impressed enough to try it- after all, look at the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walgreens about a year ago because of its compact size, and cute design.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> NOW THERE ARE TOO MANY</li>
            <li> (MOST</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> It works ok if you can get the battery to engage and get it started.  </li>
            <li> Tried a better battery</li>
            <li> Looking for a better razor.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it again,</li>
            <li> Bonus: it comes in cute colors and patterns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok in an emergency, or when you find yourself out of razors, but I would not use it routinely.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this shaver.</li>
            <li> I love the color you sent me.</li>
            <li> I love a bargain, but quite often you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> In this case though I feel I got much more than that and couldn&#x27;t be happier about finding this deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still believe most electric razors are too noisy, this one is no exception</li>
            <li> I love the strap that allows you to hang it in the shower or tub.  </li>
            <li> But better than shaving for sure.</li>
            <li> I have to rate this shaver as ok.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I may order more for my granddaughters who are just&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, non-irritating, and battery will last a while.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s ok w me</li>
            <li> Lovely lavender and floral exterior.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s a picky person :)</li>
            <li> love this   I had a Remmington for over 30 years lost the cord, found it could not be replaced.  </li>
            <li> This is a just okay product.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of shaving, quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no bumps, nice and clean</li>
            <li> I first started shaving, my Mom bought me a battery-operated electric razor that I loved.</li>
            <li> wow it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Anyway my daughter loves it and was really happy when I fixed it.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is pretty awesome so far.</li>
            <li> You can use it in the water too, which is cool!</li>
            <li> Better than the original</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I sent for 2 more</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Bought this razor in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have nicks on my knees anymore &amp; for easy shaving while camping.</li>
            <li> The Palmperfect cordless shaver is easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaving head is easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, so you can easily take it traveling or drop it in your cosmetics drawer in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This works ok but clogs easy so after every swipe you have to clean out with a strong stream of water.  </li>
            <li> If the blades are going to be   easily  </li>
            <li> It is compact and easy to use and safer than a disposable type</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great, delicate, very nice for shaving.</li>
            <li> It works fine for me for my use; not as close as a blade razor</li>
            <li> It performed just fine, but I had always considered it a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> Love this because its so small and works perfect for my legs and underarms!!!</li>
            <li> It is light, gentle on your skin, easy to handle, fits in the palm of your hand, does the kind of job that every woman desires, packs easily for your traveling moments.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a material that&#x27;s easy to grip and is the right size for fitting in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> It fits comfortable in the hand and easy to clean the razor head.</li>
            <li> but there is no convenient place to put my foot comfortably, so</li>
            <li> I think the problem is that the motor no longer works, and it must be a cheap motor.</li>
            <li> Smooth......</li>
            <li> For only $10, it was a great purchase.  </li>
            <li> B00006WNQZ Remington WDF-1100 Smooth &amp; Silky Women Body Contour Shaver (Color May Vary)]]</li>
            <li> it is cheap.</li>
            <li> Does not make your legs smooth.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS GREAT AND IS GENTLE</li>
            <li> This was very economically priced</li>
            <li> SALONS ARE CLEAN ALONG WITH THEIR WAX)...</li>
            <li> That said, I can&#x27;t figure out how to change the blades to clean them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who needs a razor that will do a decent job in a hurry, and that&#x27;s easy to use, and a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> On the bright side, I got my money back.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great on longer hairs, even with no attachment or trimmer, so you can still have great results even when you use it after missing several days of shaving.</li>
            <li> I really liked this Clio shaver, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive underarm or bikini area.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU CLIO FOR MAKING A TRUE WOMAN&#x27;S RAZOR....</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item at a local drug store yesterday based in the good reviews</li>
            <li> It gives what looks like a good shave, but definitely doesn&#x27;t feel like a close shave...</li>
            <li> As all shavers, it doesn&#x27;t do as close a shave as a razor, but good enough.  </li>
            <li> AS I TRAVEL THE SUPER HIGHWAY OF MENOPAUSE!!!!!!YEARS</li>
            <li> AND WITH ONE QUICK PASS I AM ALL SET FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS...</li>
            <li> but it still looses it power too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also, I read reviews that it drains the battery quickly.</li>
            <li> It does quick work w close shave on armpits.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> But, this one works well if you need a quick shave in between blade shaves.  </li>
            <li> , thank you very much , I will come bake soon!</li>
            <li> This is easily the best $10 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> It will be great for my upcoming trips too; it takes up a lot less space</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t pain free.  </li>
            <li> Unless it dies within a few weeks, this is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Well, it uses AAA batteries &amp; has economical replaceable razor-tops, so it&#x27;s sooo economical</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised that it doesn&#x27;t cost more.  </li>
            <li> AND WAS NOT CHANGED OUT FOR FRESH WAX!!!!THAT</li>
            <li> It has made it fun to shave.</li>
            <li> Fresh batteries and</li>
            <li> In plain words, it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it fills the purpose for which I bought it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t argue this with me, you know I&#x27;m right).</li>
            <li> I can see why the price was so right now.</li>
            <li> Got rusty right away in the bathroom</li>
            <li> I bought this simply to keep my bikini line trimmed because it&#x27;s very easily irritated</li>
            <li> This little razor is amazing!</li>
            <li> , it gives you a close trim and is very painless, fast, and easy.</li>
            <li> So small and does a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wired kind of strange.  </li>
            <li> was looking for a replacement and was surprised to find it in Pink, GREAT,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the hand, both adult and child size.  </li>
            <li> Although I had not heard of this brand before, the reviews her were mostly positive and for the price is was worth the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works just fine so far.  </li>
            <li> I did purchase blades for my old shaver to use at home and it worked out fine.  </li>
            <li> First time I ever tried a Clio Cordless.  </li>
            <li> This does it&#x27;s job, but it pulls the hair at first.</li>
            <li> In fact, I still have a very inexpensive battery-operated trimming razor that still works after 23 years!</li>
            <li> BUT MY FEMALE FACE IS GETTING MORE HAIRS</li>
            <li> So this was the first electric razor I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work consistently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say more like 10% of the time is actually turns on.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is same as its description, so l love it</li>
            <li> I had a similar sized electric shaver with a cord from the 70s that i threw away when I purchased this (the cord kept falling out &amp; was probably not too safe anymore) but that shaver worked.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this as my granddaughter&#x27;s first razor.  </li>
            <li> This is the first item from Amazon that I returned.  </li>
            <li> , I bought an extra as well as blades, just so I would always have one. :)</li>
            <li> I had to fight to get it to register the batteries the first time.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t even get this one to start the FIRST time around.  </li>
            <li> AT FIRST WHEN I BOUGHT IT</li>
            <li> used the Clio for the first time in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I cannot use a razor on my legs because I will nick myself in many different places</li>
            <li> It does a decent enough job for her underarms, and it&#x27;s great that it is a wet/dry, but I definitely recommend spending the extra cash for a better model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very loud and it&#x27;s very light weight and portable.</li>
            <li> This was a very reasonably priced and useful gift for a student graduating to high school.</li>
            <li> This will be great for carrying on trips as it is very small and no attachements to worry about taking along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that time consuming and frustrating, having said that, the fact that its waterproof and I can keep it in the bathroom does come in handy and it does do the job, eventually, just takes more than one pass.</li>
            <li> MOST SHAVER&#x27;S ARE BIG BULKY AND VERY SLIPPERY.</li>
            <li> It is cute and small so easily stored; Performance:</li>
            <li> Shaved completely dry and in a rush, yet it did a fine job!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a very close or consistent shave</li>
            <li> more than twice no matter how long I have neglected said area.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as my past electric shavers and it is battery operated.  </li>
            <li> Good purchase, fast delivery, all that was expected!!!!</li>
            <li> Went over the same spot 5 times and then gave up because it&#x27;s faster and way more productive to just use a normal razor.</li>
            <li> It gives a very decent shave, and the way it is designed makes it very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> Nice little shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy little woman&#x27;s razor and works well on legs.  </li>
            <li> So far this has been a good little shaver.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t found any of these things to be huge problems, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> wet or dry,-what more can you ask?</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but</li>
            <li> Plus, it looses energy too fast.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well</li>
            <li> I especially like the shape, which makes it comfortable to hold when using.</li>
            <li> so I can use it fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for avoid this product at all costs.  </li>
            <li> Really inefficient.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that I have nothing to lose if I buy such a cheap item and doesn&#x27;t works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to ordering this I had used the Remington WDF-1100 Smooth &amp; Silky Women Body Contour Shaver for the last year.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the trimmers on the sides.    </li>
            <li> Especially near the pool.</li>
            <li> Too much noise it made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hair</li>
            <li> I took this with me for a trip to Barbados and it really does work very well for the price.</li>
            <li> , it still left my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well - leaves no stubble.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t love the shape and size to get in harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it would be too good if you have thick wiry hair to shave.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s okay for now, but if the batteries die in in just a day right in the middle of trimming my tender nether-regions then I will immediately buy a completely different manufacturer&#x27;s model that is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver and after reading several reviews for many different shavers, I was a bit leery about what to expect.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure the last Clio only died because it was squished in the trunk of my car for 5 days.</li>
            <li> I needed a new razor right away and prefer battery-operated products (two of my rechargable razors lost their chargeability after little more than a year).  </li>
            <li> What a nice little travel shaver!  </li>
            <li> This one barely cuts when fresh batteries are installed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty loud.</li>
            <li> When it died after eight or nine years, she bought a new electric razor that we both hated--it felt like it yanked the hairs out by the roots rather than shaving them off!</li>
            <li> However, the shaver didn&#x27;t provide a super close shave for my underarms, which is necessary when wearing sleeveless tops.</li>
            <li> I purchased the older model of the Clio shaver about 4 years ago at a pharmacy</li>
            <li> Highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t quite as good at removing the hair as a regular razor, but the wet/dry convenience and irritation-free shave is definitely worth the extra few swipes.</li>
            <li> The blades pop out so you can clean them, and there are replacement blades available from Amazon, in case they get dull.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is fantastic!</li>
            <li> So far I really like this cordless razor.  </li>
            <li> My experience was completely painless and I found this to be much easier and quicker than razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> Now, if you&#x27;re angry at someone and want to passive-aggressively punish them, this would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Not as comfortable a shave as expected.</li>
            <li> It works fine, and functions pretty much the same as my previous model, I&#x27;m just bummed that I have to destroy the earth with more used batteries.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new product for the underarm area.</li>
            <li> Then I inserted brand new alkaline batteries per the instructions.  </li>
            <li> I bought new batteries and everything, but it didnt work.  </li>
            <li> ( new batteries even).  </li>
            <li> It was time to replace my very old cordless shaver.  </li>
            <li> TWO just to make sure I have one in my bag for travel and the other in my back bathroom and</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s loud!  </li>
            <li> It did a better job than the others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the small size/weight</li>
            <li> It turns on just fine, but no matter how I turn it or position it, it shaves little to no hair.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more, get something that will last.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find Clio after being unable to find a cordless, battery operated shaver locally.</li>
            <li> So surprised at the quality considering</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give a very close shave without going over the same area repeatedly, but served the purpose.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my old manual shaver with this one it does so well.  </li>
            <li> MY OLD ONE BROKE</li>
            <li> However, this shaver exceeded my expectations by far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cream hair removers but they cause an allergic reaction with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised with the power of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S COMPACT AND SOFT.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s as far as I got - the battery died.</li>
            <li> On the downside, it doesn&#x27;t give you as close a shave as a traditional razor and you do have to pass over the area a few times to get as close a shave as most of us ladies would want.</li>
            <li> This Clio is perfect...fits in the palm of the hand and completed a full shave without running down.  </li>
            <li> this Shaver , Not only, It doesn&#x27;t brake down, cleans easy, travels well</li>
            <li> ; I have to go over the same area numerous times and it only shortens the hair, not completely shaving it off; that is irritating; but it is a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> My rechargable electric ladies razor just died after about 2 years &amp; after trying to get new batteries from Norelco &amp; finding out that model&#x27;s been discontinued, my only option, I thought was spend another $40-$80 for a new 1.</li>
            <li> It was finally time for a new one!  </li>
            <li> Just about when I first moved to PA  15 years ago , but the only color they had was Yellow</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I recommend this cute little pink Clio to any woman out there looking to change razors or add one in to her routine.</li>
            <li> Tried multiple new batteries, but still won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Since she has used it a few times now, it doesn&#x27;t pull so much anymore, but it doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this except to use occasionally in an emergencies and definitely not under your arms or on your face.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised by the quality of such an inexpensive item.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin, so this was my first electric shaver, I was scared to use something other than a my razor, and when I finally bought this to help with my bikini line, I tried it</li>
            <li> It is small, travels easily, uses standard batteries (AAA), and doesn&#x27;t require buying and storing disposable razors.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;~ Small palm size, makes it easy to hold especially when wet&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Small enough that it&#x27;ll be easy to take for travel or to the gym</li>
            <li> I would have to go up &amp; down my leg in the same spot for several minutes before it would be even partially smooth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have something I could keep in my car for extra long days when I&#x27;m going straight from work to go out</li>
            <li> This barely got any of the hairs on my leg.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and works even on coarse hair or sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I barely got 6 months out of the ones I used to get.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it two times so far, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> old enough to start shaving.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin silky soft like a traditional razor does, but what electric razor does?</li>
            <li> She thought it was well worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Price was great, but upon researching to purchase a replacement, lo and behold, I was unable to track one down.</li>
            <li> While waiting for my Clio shaver to arrive from Amazon, I saw &amp; bought the exact one at Wal-Mart for less than $9.00.  </li>
            <li> This particular one was more expensive, but the same as rest of the order.</li>
            <li> and it was so cheap (seriously, like $10), that there was no risk in trying it.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever owned, I used a regular razor for down there...</li>
            <li> So I never shave my upper legs (the hair there is soft and blonde and invisible), and I shave my lower legs only when I feel like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone due to ease of use, no irritation, and you won&#x27;t cut your ankle or knee by accident anymore.</li>
            <li> It also pulls my fine thin hair if longer than stubble.  </li>
            <li> At first this thing was a little bit like torture, BUT!</li>
            <li> Worked well for a very short time, but then got very dull and stopped working WAY too quickly.</li>
            <li> For those who have sensitive skin and will trade a not super close shave in for just a close shave without the razor burn you get with soap and water razors, this razor is for you and will work as well as the more expensive brands without having to recharge all the time.</li>
            <li> It only lasted about 8 months before it completely died, and I only used it a few times a month, when I didn&#x27;t have time to shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> The charge never held for a full shave for me...very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised and a little concerned when this product arrived in the mail - it was smaller than I had thought from looking at the pictures.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the shave is not super close, but it&#x27;s not a razor directly to skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a long time in my experience.  </li>
            <li> Without getting graphic, let&#x27;s just say the ergo model is not as maneuverable as the design would imply, also I have trouble with the razor itself, I can go over the same patch of skin several times and the hair is either not cut or only partially cut.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, at ten dollars, this shaver is a fraction of the cost of almost all the other electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at the close shave and how quiet it was compared to other shavers I have owned.  </li>
            <li> No razor burn, despite shaving dry.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden, in less than a year of use, the shaver stopped working, and I had only been using it one to two times a week (switching use of this shaver with a different shaver), so it&#x27;s not like it received heavy use before it died.</li>
            <li> It barely trimmed any hair off after all that trouble.</li>
            <li> so I thought there wasn&#x27;t much to loose.  </li>
            <li> But I needed one for the times when I didn&#x27;t have the energy to sit down and do a proper shave in the tub.</li>
            <li> I am not particularly hairy</li>
            <li> Found same thing at the store for half the price.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful based on others reviews, but this shaver sucks!</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is a button that you click once to turn on, and click it again to turn it off, so unlike some other electric shavers, you don&#x27;t have to hold the button down the entire time you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do I like?&lt;br /&gt;~ Can be used both wet and dry&lt;</li>
            <li> In short, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It says you can use it wet, I didn&#x27;t try but this.</li>
            <li> It actually stopped working after five uses, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful,  needs batteries replaced to often.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a much pricier electric razor and it did a worse job of removing hair and cut me all the time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Provides a close shave in all areas and I haven&#x27;t received one nick, which I had problems with using my other razor</li>
            <li> I have had two other cordless razors and they never worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> When it was taken out of its packaging, it was extremely sticky.  </li>
            <li> no matter what due to the bumps.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that it tugs a little bit on some stray hairs- ouch!</li>
            <li> it pulls so hard, but no hairs are ever actually cut.  </li>
            <li> Returning is not economical</li>
            <li> I like that it is small and the battery life is long.  </li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t have to be delicate with it, and it Last for years.</li>
            <li> I went over the same area at least 5 times before I could tell it cut any hair.</li>
            <li> I got this to save myself the trouble of having to wet shave.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, you&#x27;ll be lucky if you even get past step one of trying to turn the stupid thing on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 9yr old daughter to use on her underarms, this is her very first razor, and I was afraid to let her use a regular razor, for fear of her cutting herself.</li>
            <li> I used this product until the blade was worn down.</li>
            <li> Picked it up in my hand, turned my hand upside down, and it was so sticky it stuck to my palm and never fell off.  </li>
            <li> So basically, 3 stars, minus 1 star for not being rechargeable, and minus another for killing the earth slowly.  </li>
            <li> My previous shaver had a cord and had to be charged before every use.  </li>
            <li> I got this razor for less than 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> The product is not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> I have a condition called Keratosis Pilaris on my legs, which is basically just little slightly raised bumps.</li>
            <li> I changed the batteries thinking they had run down, but the razor remained dead.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE MY DERMATOLOGIST SAID THE WAX CAUSED A LITTLE INFECTION, BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN USED OVER AND</li>
            <li> NOW I SHAVE THOSE LITTLE FREAKS OF NATURE..</li>
            <li> I have used it quite a few times now.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews saying that you had to run it over the area a few times</li>
            <li> I did get knicked a few times, but it was when I was still getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and then it died because the battery connection rusted.</li>
            <li> Have cleaned it, Changed batteries only a few times thru the years, and had been looking for an other one just to have 2 of them, Sad to say, could not find it and Now.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d only lose a little money and could then go ahead and buy the expensive one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can no longer recharge and have been searching for a product that doesn&#x27;t pinch and leave me red and sore.</li>
            <li> Usually  use a Venus razor with shaving cream on my legs</li>
            <li> ONLY FEEL THE CREEPY THINGS...</li>
            <li> Not pleased.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not elegant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a small shaver.  </li>
            <li> However, I tired of spending upwards of $75-100 for a fancy electric model, only to need to buy expensive replacement blades every few years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave hardly at all.</li>
            <li> None of that with this little contraption!!</li>
            <li> I would expect at least a couple years of use out of a $10 battery-operated razor.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BLEACHED,PLUCKED AND WAS CUTTING MY SKIN,WAS WAXED AND BROKE OUT IN TINY BLISTERS</li>
            <li> AND I AM NOT THE LEAST BIT EMBARRASSED TO SAY SO...</li>
            <li> well, at least for me.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d imagine it was a bottom line issue - cheaper NOT to manufacture rechargeable parts and just make the consumer buy batteries and kill the earth slowly over time).  </li>
            <li> It cuts slow and</li>
            <li> OVER ON OTHER WOMEN ON ALL THIER BITS AND PIECES!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing hurts so bad I cried I could barely finish my legs!</li>
            <li> is very small.  </li>
            <li> BUT THAT UGLY BEARD OF RED BUMPS LASTED FOR OVER TWO WEEKS...</li>
            <li> I feel its a completely useless item and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that this razor didn&#x27;t even last a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure what&#x27;s wrong with it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize that it even has batteries in it.</li>
            <li> Should have just got the bag of $2 razors, at least they would have shaved the hair off my legs!</li>
            <li> far, I haven&#x27;t discovered anything bad about this shaver!</li>
            <li> She is trying to talk me into shaving her legs, but I just know that this will pull like crazy, so I am looking for something a little bit nicer for that...</li>
            <li> this razor, I get 3-5 years out of it, and replacing it costs less than the replacement blades on the expensive models!</li>
            <li> TO FIND ONE FOR JUST MY POOR HAIRY WEREWOLF FACE....</li>
            <li> Frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It is thin and fits in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li> but I have not experienced that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Clio doesn&#x27;t seem to make the rechargeable model anymore</li>
            <li> Like stupid heavy machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer others sorry to say this.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been wary of buying an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I WOULD HAVE ONE OR TWO CRAZY HAIRS ON MY CHIN..</li>
            <li> Pulled the hair on her legs instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> After 2 I might as well of bought an expensive shaver!</li>
            <li> Which was very scary.</li>
            <li> I hope they didn&#x27;t invest a crap ton in these because it&#x27;s a terrible waste.</li>
            <li> Too bad, it looked like just the thing to have.  </li>
            <li> When it worked, it worked well for me, save for the fact that it gave a rather painful shave under the arms.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was horrible</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> IT IS HYSTERICAL...</li>
            <li> No way was I letting her use this disgusting thing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I needed a new product for the underarm area. I had used a rechargeable Remington product for years. Unfortunately, I can no longer recharge and have been searching for a product that doesn&#x27;t pinch and leave me red and sore. The Clio is that product!!!</li>
            <li> works just fine so far.  So surprised at the quality considering it is so inexspensive.  Highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Removing the shaver from its packaging was a headache.  Then I inserted brand new alkaline batteries per the instructions.  The shaver does not work.  Returning is not economical so I have lost some money.  Take my advice and do not fall for this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 2yrs now I love it</li>
            <li> Nice little shaver.  First time I ever tried a Clio Cordless.  Usually  use a Venus razor with shaving cream on my legs but there is no convenient place to put my foot comfortably, so thought I&#x27;d try the Clio.  It works fine for me for my use; not as close as a blade razor but it will do for me.</li>
            <li> I needed a new razor right away and prefer battery-operated products (two of my rechargable razors lost their chargeability after little more than a year).  This was very economically priced so I thought there wasn&#x27;t much to loose.  It didn&#x27;t give a very close shave without going over the same area repeatedly, but served the purpose.  However after about 6 months of use, it no longer worked.  Might just be good for a backup/travel razor.</li>
            <li> My rechargable electric ladies razor just died after about 2 years &amp; after trying to get new batteries from Norelco &amp; finding out that model&#x27;s been discontinued, my only option, I thought was spend another $40-$80 for a new 1. Which, of course, is the aim of these manufacturers. After reading reviews, I was impressed enough to try it- after all, look at the price! Well, it uses AAA batteries &amp; has economical replaceable razor-tops, so it&#x27;s sooo economical, I thought it couldn&#x27;t be good. Wrong! Noisy, maybe- but o-so-worth it. Try it- it&#x27;s a great deal for the price &amp; works well- wet or dry,-what more can you ask?</li>
            <li> So far I really like this cordless razor.  The price was right and it fills the purpose for which I bought it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 9yr old daughter to use on her underarms, this is her very first razor, and I was afraid to let her use a regular razor, for fear of her cutting herself. This does it&#x27;s job, but it pulls the hair at first. Since she has used it a few times now, it doesn&#x27;t pull so much anymore, but it doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave. She is trying to talk me into shaving her legs, but I just know that this will pull like crazy, so I am looking for something a little bit nicer for that...although, not anytime soon! If  you are looking for a close shave, this is NOT your product. It does a decent enough job for her underarms, and it&#x27;s great that it is a wet/dry, but I definitely recommend spending the extra cash for a better model.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I went into the hospital for an extended visit and couldn&#x27;t have any cords.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but wow it does a great job.  I replaced my old manual shaver with this one it does so well.  I like that it is small and the battery life is long.  It gets the job done!  It is the best electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walgreens about a year ago because of its compact size, and cute design. ait HURTS! i have very sensitive skin, so this was my first electric shaver, I was scared to use something other than a my razor, and when I finally bought this to help with my bikini line, I tried it and I &#x27;ouched&#x27;.  It feels like it just grabs onto the hair and pulls it, so I stopped, used my razor and put it away, then about 2 weeks later, I was going to try it again, and it didnt work! I bought new batteries and everything, but it didnt work.  I was going to return it but I had lost the receipt.  it was horrible</li>
            <li> I really liked this Clio shaver, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive underarm or bikini area. However, the shaver didn&#x27;t provide a super close shave for my underarms, which is necessary when wearing sleeveless tops. All of a sudden, in less than a year of use, the shaver stopped working, and I had only been using it one to two times a week (switching use of this shaver with a different shaver), so it&#x27;s not like it received heavy use before it died. I think the problem is that the motor no longer works, and it must be a cheap motor. I also noticed that some of the teeny screws have some rust, even though I never got any water on them (must be from the humidity in the air)...screws in razors should not rust. I am so disappointed that this razor didn&#x27;t even last a year. I would expect at least a couple years of use out of a $10 battery-operated razor. In fact, I still have a very inexpensive battery-operated trimming razor that still works after 23 years! Well, they don&#x27;t make them like they used to, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for women.  It is light, gentle on your skin, easy to handle, fits in the palm of your hand, does the kind of job that every woman desires, packs easily for your traveling moments.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price.  You&#x27;ll be surprised that it doesn&#x27;t cost more.  In plain words, it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Went over the same spot 5 times and then gave up because it&#x27;s faster and way more productive to just use a normal razor. This barely got any of the hairs on my leg. On the bright side, I got my money back.</li>
            <li> NOT EMBARRASSED TO SAY IT...BUT MY FEMALE FACE IS GETTING MORE HAIRS AS I TRAVEL THE SUPER HIGHWAY OF MENOPAUSE!!!!!!YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE ONE OR TWO CRAZY HAIRS ON MY CHIN..I COULD ALSO SEE CLOSE UP BACK THEN..AND PLUCK! THEY WERE GONE...NOW THERE ARE TOO MANY AND I CAN&#x27;T SEE THEM...ONLY FEEL THE CREEPY THINGS...I HAVE BLEACHED,PLUCKED AND WAS CUTTING MY SKIN,WAS WAXED AND BROKE OUT IN TINY BLISTERS BECAUSE MY DERMATOLOGIST SAID THE WAX CAUSED A LITTLE INFECTION, BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN USED OVER AND OVER ON OTHER WOMEN ON ALL THIER BITS AND PIECES!!!! AND WAS NOT CHANGED OUT FOR FRESH WAX!!!!THAT DID IT FOR ME...(MOST SALONS ARE CLEAN ALONG WITH THEIR WAX)...BUT THAT UGLY BEARD OF RED BUMPS LASTED FOR OVER TWO WEEKS...NOW I SHAVE THOSE LITTLE FREAKS OF NATURE..AND I AM NOT THE LEAST BIT EMBARRASSED TO SAY SO...THIS RAZOR WORKS GREAT AND WITH ONE QUICK PASS I AM ALL SET FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS...IT REALLY WORKS GREAT AND IS GENTLE AS WELL....SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT...MY OLD ONE BROKE AND IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIND ONE FOR JUST MY POOR HAIRY WEREWOLF FACE....BUT NOW I AM ALL SET ...THANK YOU CLIO FOR MAKING A TRUE WOMAN&#x27;S RAZOR....YOU SHOULD SEE WHEN I USE MINE AS MY HUSBAND OF 33YEARS USES HIS!  IT IS HYSTERICAL...ONLY IN MY HOUSE....</li>
            <li> It works ok if you can get the battery to engage and get it started.  I need to re-insert the battery every time I use it.  Plus, it looses energy too fast.  Tried a better battery but it still looses it power too quickly.  Looking for a better razor. Would not but this brand a second time. Would not reccommend it.</li>
            <li> It is cute and small so easily stored; Performance: so-so; I have to go over the same area numerous times and it only shortens the hair, not completely shaving it off; that is irritating; but it is a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter. I liked it so well I am getting my own. So small and does a great job. Smooth......</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver and after reading several reviews for many different shavers, I was a bit leery about what to expect.  However, this shaver exceeded my expectations by far.  My experience was completely painless and I found this to be much easier and quicker than razor shaving.  Not to mention, at ten dollars, this shaver is a fraction of the cost of almost all the other electric shavers.  The only disadvantage I found was that this did not leave me with as close a shave as a razor, but from what I have read, no electric shaver does.  This shaver works great on longer hairs, even with no attachment or trimmer, so you can still have great results even when you use it after missing several days of shaving. I have also found it to be particularly handy for the bikini zone.  I highly recommend this product... you get plenty of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> For only $10, it was a great purchase.  I previously owned a much pricier electric razor and it did a worse job of removing hair and cut me all the time.  I haven&#x27;t been nicked once by this one!  It isn&#x27;t quite as good at removing the hair as a regular razor, but the wet/dry convenience and irritation-free shave is definitely worth the extra few swipes.</li>
            <li> So this was the first electric razor I have ever bought. I bout it at CVS for like $20 which was great! I absolutely LOVED this razor! It worked really well, it gives you a close trim and is very painless, fast, and easy. It also works great in the shower. BUT one day while it was charging out of no where it turned on by itself. Which was very scary. So I tried to turn it off but it wouldn&#x27;t! I literately had to let the thing die before it went off. Then when it finally died, IT WOULDN&#x27;T COME BACK ON! So yes its a good razor but it also has some malfunctions as well.</li>
            <li> Good purchase, fast delivery, all that was expected!!!!</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our granddaughter to begin shaving with, her mom and I thought this was the perfect way for her to start.  Good quality and functional.</li>
            <li> I get severe irritation and infected hairs from regular shaving. I&#x27;ve tried cream hair removers but they cause an allergic reaction with my sensitive skin. I just purchased this item at a local drug store yesterday based in the good reviews and I&#x27;m very happy! It&#x27;s so easy to use and does not cause any pain or irritation at all! The best part is being able to shave while in the shower or out and you don&#x27;t need to spend anymore money on shaving cream. It gives a close shave and works even on coarse hair or sensitive areas. It has made it fun to shave. I&#x27;m going on vacation soon and this will be great to take along. It&#x27;s not very loud and it&#x27;s very light weight and portable. This is easily the best $10 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. Hopefully it will help end my shaving related skin issues and I won&#x27;t be using a regular razor anymore. I highly recommend this to anyone due to ease of use, no irritation, and you won&#x27;t cut your ankle or knee by accident anymore. Get this shaver!</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed with this, not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, it would be good for travel though.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace my very old cordless shaver.  I was so happy to find Clio after being unable to find a cordless, battery operated shaver locally. (I did not want one that recharges by placing in a stand which must be plugged in.)  It arrived on time and works great.  I especially like the shape, which makes it comfortable to hold when using.</li>
            <li> I purchased the older model of the Clio shaver about 4 years ago at a pharmacy and I LOVED it.  I used it all the time...no bumps, nice and clean, it was like THE ideal electric shaver.  That particular model was awesome because it was rechargeable.  Sadly, after many years I lost the cap, the screen fell out and all the trimming teeth began to break off.  It was finally time for a new one!  So I came to Amazon to purchase another.  Unfortunately, Clio doesn&#x27;t seem to make the rechargeable model anymore (or if they do, it is unavailable on Amazon) and I settled for this half-assed battery powered version.  It works fine, and functions pretty much the same as my previous model, I&#x27;m just bummed that I have to destroy the earth with more used batteries.  It&#x27;s a shame that the company decided to do away with the rechargeable model (I&#x27;d imagine it was a bottom line issue - cheaper NOT to manufacture rechargeable parts and just make the consumer buy batteries and kill the earth slowly over time).  So basically, 3 stars, minus 1 star for not being rechargeable, and minus another for killing the earth slowly.  That said, it&#x27;s okay for now, but if the batteries die in in just a day right in the middle of trimming my tender nether-regions then I will immediately buy a completely different manufacturer&#x27;s model that is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I had bought this Shaver in a discount store. Just about when I first moved to PA  15 years ago , but the only color they had was Yellow and I Still have it. Have cleaned it, Changed batteries only a few times thru the years, and had been looking for an other one just to have 2 of them, Sad to say, could not find it and Now. was looking for a replacement and was surprised to find it in Pink, GREAT,  I&#x27;m buying&lt;br /&gt;2 TWO just to make sure I have one in my bag for travel and the other in my back bathroom and My Yellow one I always keep it on my PC so I can use it fast. I LOVE LOVE. this Shaver , Not only, It doesn&#x27;t brake down, cleans easy, travels well, you don&#x27;t have to be delicate with it, and it Last for years. So glad I found it again,</li>
            <li> Brace yourself for some TMI. Skip ahead if you must. For those of you still left, here goes. I am not particularly hairy and my husband never notices whether I shave or not. So I never shave my upper legs (the hair there is soft and blonde and invisible), and I shave my lower legs only when I feel like it. I shave my armpits regularly just because armpit hair is gross (EEEEW! Even on guys it&#x27;s gross. Don&#x27;t argue this with me, you know I&#x27;m right). Given my usage and lack of concern for the utmost in baby&#x27;s bum softness, I&#x27;ve always favored electric models. However, I tired of spending upwards of $75-100 for a fancy electric model, only to need to buy expensive replacement blades every few years. Then (cue angel voices), one day I came upon the Clio Palmperfect at TJMaxx and it was so cheap (seriously, like $10), that there was no risk in trying it. Ohmygosh, I won&#x27;t buy anything else now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, I get 3-5 years out of it, and replacing it costs less than the replacement blades on the expensive models! It is small, travels easily, uses standard batteries (AAA), and doesn&#x27;t require buying and storing disposable razors. Yay! Great strides for a minimalist wannabe like me. Bonus: it comes in cute colors and patterns. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This thing hurts so bad I cried I could barely finish my legs!</li>
            <li> This things are garbage.  I&#x27;m on my second one and it will be my last.  They both broke the same way..... Water works its way into the battery compartment and rusts it away and then it won&#x27;t turn on.  You really get what you pay for avoid this product at all costs.  After 2 I might as well of bought an expensive shaver!</li>
            <li> I have never used a battery operated shaver before, but thought I would give this a try.  It&#x27;s ok in an emergency, or when you find yourself out of razors, but I would not use it routinely.  It doesn&#x27;t get close enough to suit me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews. I bought this razor and tried using it several times. I had to go over the same spots over and over to remove any hair. Really inefficient.</li>
            <li> The product is not worth the trouble.  It eats batteries even tho the job I give it is very small.  It leaves quite the shadow, too.  Too bad, it looked like just the thing to have.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that I have nothing to lose if I buy such a cheap item and doesn&#x27;t works. Well it is amazing. Great, delicate, very nice for shaving. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I went online and another website recommended this model, they might have meant for shaving your legs, I personally use it for grooming my bikini area.Without getting graphic, let&#x27;s just say the ergo model is not as maneuverable as the design would imply, also I have trouble with the razor itself, I can go over the same patch of skin several times and the hair is either not cut or only partially cut. I find that time consuming and frustrating, having said that, the fact that its waterproof and I can keep it in the bathroom does come in handy and it does do the job, eventually, just takes more than one pass.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work consistently.  I&#x27;d say more like 10% of the time is actually turns on.  I push the button again and again.  Still nothing.  It certainly isn&#x27;t pain free.  It gives what looks like a good shave, but definitely doesn&#x27;t feel like a close shave...when I can actually get it to turn on.  Tried multiple new batteries, but still won&#x27;t work.  Frustrating.  Not pleased.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little woman&#x27;s razor and works well on legs.  I liked it so much I sent for 2 more so that I would have them for the future.  It is cute looking and a nice travel companion.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shaver. I have used it quite a few times now. I love the color you sent me.</li>
            <li> I order this item to replace my bulky shaver.  I was amazed at the close shave and how quiet it was compared to other shavers I have owned.  It is thin and fits in the palm of your hand.  This makes it easy to use.  A definite buy especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this razor based on the cost alone. I love a bargain, but quite often you get what you pay for. In this case though I feel I got much more than that and couldn&#x27;t be happier about finding this deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to ordering this I had used the Remington WDF-1100 Smooth &amp; Silky Women Body Contour Shaver for the last year. [[ASIN:B00006WNQZ Remington WDF-1100 Smooth &amp; Silky Women Body Contour Shaver (Color May Vary)]] It performed just fine, but I had always considered it a bit bulky. Recently though it went *kaput* so I was in search for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to the Clio. Although I had not heard of this brand before, the reviews her were mostly positive and for the price is was worth the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I like?&lt;br /&gt;~ Can be used both wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;~ Provides a close shave in all areas and I haven&#x27;t received one nick, which I had problems with using my other razor&lt;br /&gt;~ Small palm size, makes it easy to hold especially when wet&lt;br /&gt;~ Takes just 2 AAA batteries and they seem to last quite awhile&lt;br /&gt;~ Small enough that it&#x27;ll be easy to take for travel or to the gym&lt;br /&gt;~ Removable wrist strap or shower hanger keeps it handy&lt;br /&gt;~ Replacement blades that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg [[ASIN:B000XPV5SI Clio Designs Refill Blades for all Clio 3800 Series Shavers (2 Packs of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What don&#x27;t I like?&lt;br /&gt;~ I still believe most electric razors are too noisy, this one is no exception&lt;br /&gt;~ And finally...that I didn&#x27;t find this razor a year ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend this cute little pink Clio to any woman out there looking to change razors or add one in to her routine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my step-daughter who is just starting to shave.  She loves it.  It&#x27;s easy on the hand, both adult and child size.  I love the strap that allows you to hang it in the shower or tub.  Over all this is a great product!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought.  I had my last one for several years ... I&#x27;d say over 5.  That&#x27;s a long time in my experience.  I barely got 6 months out of the ones I used to get.  Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure the last Clio only died because it was squished in the trunk of my car for 5 days.</li>
            <li> I just bought this razor and it works great.  I have had two other cordless razors and they never worked as well as this one. I have only used it two times so far, but it does the job.  It is surprisingly quiet, and it grabs every hair without having to keep shaving the same area. It does not get as close as if you shaved with a regular razor but the closest you can get for a cordless razor. Unless it dies within a few weeks, this is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a very short time, but then got very dull and stopped working WAY too quickly.Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have something I could keep in my car for extra long days when I&#x27;m going straight from work to go out so I wouldn&#x27;t be paranoid about my five o&#x27;clock shadows.  Waste of money.  It&#x27;s a shaver that doesn&#x27;t actually shave.  It uses batteries and makes a lot of noise and if you try to use it on anything longer than three millimeters it feels like it&#x27;s trying to eat your skin it pulls so hard, but no hairs are ever actually cut.  Now, if you&#x27;re angry at someone and want to passive-aggressively punish them, this would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more, get something that will last.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful,  needs batteries replaced to often.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well.  It&#x27;s made of a material that&#x27;s easy to grip and is the right size for fitting in the bikini area.  I really like the trimmers on the sides.    Bottom line: Can&#x27;t beat this shaver</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever owned, I used a regular razor for down there... bumps, itching, all that garbage. None of that with this little contraption!! You can use it in the water too, which is cool! Only down side is that it tugs a little bit on some stray hairs- ouch! But better than shaving for sure.</li>
            <li> It worked well until it suddenly didn&#x27;t. It lasted maybe a month. I&#x27;m still not sure what&#x27;s wrong with it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize that it even has batteries in it. In short, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this simply to keep my bikini line trimmed because it&#x27;s very easily irritated and I cannot shave it. This electric shaver is very simple and efficient. I read reviews saying that you had to run it over the area a few times but I have not experienced that. Maybe as the batteries lose their charge that will be the case, but I will still use it! This is a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> NOTE:  THIS  RAZOR IS MISTAKENLY IDENTIFIED AS ELECTRIC, WHEN IT RUNS ON BATTERIES!</li>
            <li> I think this product is same as its description, so l love it , thank you very much , I will come bake soon!</li>
            <li> It turns on just fine, but no matter how I turn it or position it, it shaves little to no hair. I feel its a completely useless item and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have nicks on my knees anymore &amp; for easy shaving while camping. It doesn&#x27;t shave hardly at all. I went over the same area at least 5 times before I could tell it cut any hair. It barely trimmed any hair off after all that trouble. Still had prickles all over. Should have just got the bag of $2 razors, at least they would have shaved the hair off my legs!</li>
            <li> looking for an inexpensive cordless shaver?  this will do the trick.  not fancy but it doesn&#x27;t need to be.  well, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I have to rate this shaver as ok. Not as comfortable a shave as expected.</li>
            <li> I used this product until the blade was worn down. It works nicely, as you&#x27;d expect. Price was great, but upon researching to purchase a replacement, lo and behold, I was unable to track one down. I can see why the price was so right now. LOL.  :)</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful based on others reviews, but this shaver sucks! I had a similar sized electric shaver with a cord from the 70s that i threw away when I purchased this (the cord kept falling out &amp; was probably not too safe anymore) but that shaver worked. This one barely cuts when fresh batteries are installed. I would have to go up &amp; down my leg in the same spot for several minutes before it would be even partially smooth. It says you can use it wet, I didn&#x27;t try but this. It only lasted about 8 months before it completely died, and I only used it a few times a month, when I didn&#x27;t have time to shave with a blade. oh well.</li>
            <li> Better than the original and I didn&#x27;t think that was possible.</li>
            <li> While waiting for my Clio shaver to arrive from Amazon, I saw &amp; bought the exact one at Wal-Mart for less than $9.00.  I think I paid about $21 from Amazon, so before buying, do some cost comparing.  I did keep the one from Amazon also instead of returning it (as a back up).  As all shavers, it doesn&#x27;t do as close a shave as a razor, but good enough.  Being on a blood thinner it took forever to stop a razor cut, so that is why I switched to the Clio shaver.  It fits comfortable in the hand and easy to clean the razor head.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this item at all. It just simply didn&#x27;t seem to work no matter where/how I used it.</li>
            <li> Never got to try the shaver.  When it was taken out of its packaging, it was extremely sticky.  Tried to wipe it off and some sort of yellowish sticky film smeared al over.  I could use my fingernail to scrape gobs of it off.  Picked it up in my hand, turned my hand upside down, and it was so sticky it stuck to my palm and never fell off.  Found a coupon for replacement blades in the packaging.  It expired in 2007.  I had gotten this as my granddaughter&#x27;s first razor.  No way was I letting her use this disgusting thing.  She didn&#x27;t even want to touch it.  This is the first item from Amazon that I returned.  Have no intension of ordering another</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter - she used it 3 times and stopped working - replaced the batteries and is still now working.  Decided to purchase a more expensive one,</li>
            <li> I had to take it apart and solder a wire after about six months or so.  It&#x27;s wired kind of strange.  Anyway my daughter loves it and was really happy when I fixed it.  She thought it was well worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a yard-sale(still unopened in sealed packaging of course!) for only a dollar. I LOVE it. I had pondered getting an electric razor in the past, but I figured, with how long disposable ones last with reuse, it wouldn&#x27;t be economical to drop all that money on a razor. I see it&#x27;s still cheap to buy online anyway. :P    Anyway, it works great! I find i need to angle it to get it to shave, but it does the job well!    That said, I can&#x27;t figure out how to change the blades to clean them. Because there were no instructions on how to do that in the short manual, I knocked off one star from the final product.</li>
            <li> It actually stopped working after five uses, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So far this has been a good little shaver. I use it about 2 times a week and it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it would be too good if you have thick wiry hair to shave. It cuts slow and&lt;br /&gt;smooth which is what I wanted. I may order more for my granddaughters who are just&lt;br /&gt;now old enough to start shaving.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully everywhere I grow hair where I don&#x27;t want it to be. Especially near the pool. It&#x27;s slim and easy to hang in your shower with its attached dainty rope.</li>
            <li> Too much noise it made. Like stupid heavy machine.&lt;br /&gt;It is not elegant. I prefer others sorry to say this.&lt;br /&gt;But it is cheap. If you don&#x27;t care about the noise, then buy it.</li>
            <li> This little razor is amazing! Perfect for travel, non-irritating, and battery will last a while. I don&#x27;t have much hair so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it gives a super-close shave, but it does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read that it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. WRONG. It pulls. Also, I read reviews that it drains the battery quickly. So basically, I take out the battery when I don&#x27;t use it, and only put batteries in when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> I took this with me for a trip to Barbados and it really does work very well for the price. It was great for touch ups and even when I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a day or two, it still left my legs smooth. I did get knicked a few times, but it was when I was still getting used to it. Works well on bikini area and underarms, even though for underarms it doesn&#x27;t maneuver as well. Definitely going to bring it to my future trips!</li>
            <li> This shaver is great. I bought one for my daughter at the grocery store as a promo item. Once I tried it, I loved it and I went to get another, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere!! I finally tried Amazon.com, I bought an extra as well as blades, just so I would always have one. :)</li>
            <li> When it worked, it worked well for me, save for the fact that it gave a rather painful shave under the arms.  The problem is the key word WORKED.  I had to fight to get it to register the batteries the first time.  I had to shake it and smack it around before it registered any batteries at all on the second attempt.  It didn&#x27;t react AT ALL to any batteries on the third attempt.  Gave up and replaced it with another, thinking maybe I just got a faulty version of the product...can&#x27;t even get this one to start the FIRST time around.  Yes, I was following the instructions and the diagram, I even did just the opposite with the batteries in case the diagram some how was incorrect. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, you&#x27;ll be lucky if you even get past step one of trying to turn the stupid thing on.</li>
            <li> This was a very reasonably priced and useful gift for a student graduating to high school. The bright and colorful design was delightful.</li>
            <li> What a nice little travel shaver!  I&#x27;m surprised with the power of this shaver.  I did purchase blades for my old shaver to use at home and it worked out fine.  Both needs were met.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  The Palmperfect cordless shaver is easy to use and works well.  Cleaning the shaving head is easy.  It makes shaving a breeze!</li>
            <li> Worked for about 10 uses and then I had to change the batteries every time I wanted to use it. And now the it dies before I ca. Even finish shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this for 8 dollars at walmart.  It works very well.  It&#x27;s a great shaver.  It does quick work w close shave on armpits.  However, it&#x27;s loud!  But that&#x27;s ok w me</li>
            <li> This particular one was more expensive, but the same as rest of the order.</li>
            <li> I considered this a &#x27;starter&#x27; shaver for my daughter who is begining to shave.  Fits in your palm perfectly, runs nice, looks to be a great starter razor (or for on the run).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a very close or consistent shave</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAVER! IT IS PAINLESS AND IT SHAVES VERY GOOD. AT FIRST WHEN I BOUGHT IT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I SEEN THIS ON AMAZON.COM AND I WANTED TO TRY IT OUT. SO I BOUGHT IT AT A CVS STORE FOR 10 DOLLARS. AND I WAS SAYING I HOPE THIS WORKS. I LIKE THAT IT&#x27;S COMPACT AND SOFT. MOST SHAVER&#x27;S ARE BIG BULKY AND VERY SLIPPERY. THANK YOU CLIO MAKER&#x27;S!</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job, however it requires to pass throug the area several times.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is fantastic! It runs on AAA batteries, so there&#x27;s no cord or plug-in. It&#x27;s compact, so you can easily take it traveling or drop it in your cosmetics drawer in the bathroom. It does a good job of shaving, quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started shaving, my Mom bought me a battery-operated electric razor that I loved. When it died after eight or nine years, she bought a new electric razor that we both hated--it felt like it yanked the hairs out by the roots rather than shaving them off! Since then, I&#x27;ve been wary of buying an electric shaver. But I needed one for the times when I didn&#x27;t have the energy to sit down and do a proper shave in the tub. So I did some research and found a $40 electric shaver that had the best reviews. I was about to purchase it when I saw a link to the Clio Shaver, which also had good reviews. I figured for $8 I could afford to try it. If it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d only lose a little money and could then go ahead and buy the expensive one. Well, I won&#x27;t be buying that $40 razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Clio for the first time in a hurry. Shaved completely dry and in a rush, yet it did a fine job! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin silky soft like a traditional razor does, but what electric razor does? It did a better job than the others I&#x27;ve used in the past. No razor burn, despite shaving dry. The blades pop out so you can clean them, and there are replacement blades available from Amazon, in case they get dull. The on/off switch is a button that you click once to turn on, and click it again to turn it off, so unlike some other electric shavers, you don&#x27;t have to hold the button down the entire time you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t discovered anything bad about this shaver! I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who needs a razor that will do a decent job in a hurry, and that&#x27;s easy to use, and a fantastic price! In fact, I&#x27;m buying another one for my mother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a small shaver.  And, so happy this one has batteries.  My previous shaver had a cord and had to be charged before every use.  The charge never held for a full shave for me...very frustrating.  This Clio is perfect...fits in the palm of the hand and completed a full shave without running down.  This will be great for carrying on trips as it is very small and no attachements to worry about taking along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer.</li>
            <li> Does not make your legs smooth. Still stubble after using</li>
            <li> As the title says, this shaver is amazing for the price. It gives a very decent shave, and the way it is designed makes it very ergonomic. If you&#x27;re worried about nicking yourself with this, you shouldn&#x27;t be. I have a condition called Keratosis Pilaris on my legs, which is basically just little slightly raised bumps. I cannot use a razor on my legs because I will nick myself in many different places no matter what due to the bumps. I can use this shaver on my legs without any problems. On the downside, it doesn&#x27;t give you as close a shave as a traditional razor and you do have to pass over the area a few times to get as close a shave as most of us ladies would want. It&#x27;s also pretty loud. However, I haven&#x27;t found any of these things to be huge problems, especially for the price. If it wasn&#x27;t so inexpensive, I&#x27;d give it four stars, but for the great price, it is definitely worth it and deserves five stars. I am very surprised by the quality of such an inexpensive item.</li>
            <li> Lovely lavender and floral exterior. Works very well - leaves no stubble.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift. It broke the second time my friend used it. Now I have to send it back.</li>
            <li> This works ok but clogs easy so after every swipe you have to clean out with a strong stream of water.  It also pulls my fine thin hair if longer than stubble.  I also don&#x27;t love the shape and size to get in harder to reach areas. Do love that it is waterproof and can stay in my shower!</li>
            <li> My mother LOVES this razor.  She had a razor similar to it for years, and years and finally it died.  This has been a holy grail search for a replacement.  The price was excellent and her review also excellent and she&#x27;s a picky person :)</li>
            <li> I was surprised and a little concerned when this product arrived in the mail - it was smaller than I had thought from looking at the pictures.  But, I am very happy with it. It works just as good as my past electric shavers and it is battery operated.  I like the fact that it is lite weight &amp; it is easier to handle. It will be great for my upcoming trips too; it takes up a lot less space &amp; I don&#x27;t need an electrical outlet.</li>
            <li> love this   I had a Remmington for over 30 years lost the cord, found it could not be replaced.  This razon is larger, but it is water proof(a plus)  and does the same job.   I consider, that I found a good buy,  If the blades are going to be   easily  replaced  you will gain another star.</li>
            <li> It is a gift and a perfect replacement for the shaver my friend wore out!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the shaver and would recommend it to others.  It is compact and easy to use and safer than a disposable type</li>
            <li> I got this to save myself the trouble of having to wet shave. After about 5 or so minutes of trying the shaver in every direction, the hair was still there. That&#x27;s as far as I got - the battery died. Fresh batteries and it drained them. Yep. I hope they didn&#x27;t invest a crap ton in these because it&#x27;s a terrible waste. I returned mine for a refund.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work from out of the package. ( new batteries even).  Found same thing at the store for half the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I was lookin&#x27; for.</li>
            <li> This shaver is pretty awesome so far. Doesnt hurt or give me razor burn at all. Yes, the shave is not super close, but it&#x27;s not a razor directly to skin, it&#x27;s just not going to be. I have tried more expensive electric razors and the closeness of the shave is the same as I get with this razor. For those who have sensitive skin and will trade a not super close shave in for just a close shave without the razor burn you get with soap and water razors, this razor is for you and will work as well as the more expensive brands without having to recharge all the time.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described.  Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a just okay product. It does shave you but it tends to scratch your legs. I tried it under my arms and was sore for several days and was left with a scratch or two. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this except to use occasionally in an emergencies and definitely not under your arms or on your face.</li>
            <li> Love this because its so small and works perfect for my legs and underarms!!! Definately will be buying another one for sure!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my teenage daugther. Pulled the hair on her legs instead of cutting. Got rusty right away in the bathroom</li>
            <li> The clio is the best...been using this product for years!!!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great Item.</li>
            <li> It is great, just as described and delivered as promised.  Love the color and the small size/weight and it does a nice job removing the unwanted hair!</li>
            <li> At first this thing was a little bit like torture, BUT! there is a learning curve and all is well. No pulling anymore and I don&#x27;t need to go over the area more than twice no matter how long I have neglected said area.</li>
            <li> Does not even work well enough to shave my legs.  Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of electric/battery shavers.  I prefer a blade.  But, this one works well if you need a quick shave in between blade shaves.  I&#x27;d recommend it for a quicky shave.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I used it a few times and then it died because the battery connection rusted. I&#x27;m throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for less than 10 dollars. I used it 3 times and then it died. I changed the batteries thinking they had run down, but the razor remained dead.</li>
