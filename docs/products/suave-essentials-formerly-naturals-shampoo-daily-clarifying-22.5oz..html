    <ol>
            <li>It was an excellent alternative to the [[ASIN:B001E96OUQ</li>
            <li>I used Suave Shampoo for Oily Hair for years and felt it was the best product on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful value for the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world.  </li>
            <li>great deal!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans my hair great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s On Point Price Wise,Smells Incredible</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>Delightful shampoo works well AND looks good while it waits to be used.  </li>
            <li>Great for my oily scalp and hair, and smells great too.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and works great?</li>
            <li>This is a great item for a gal with oily hair.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this shampoo on Amazon!</li>
            <li>My kind of shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I have always loved the fragrant scent</li>
            <li>Good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Suave is just as good, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>smells good.</li>
            <li>it works great to clean the body!  </li>
            <li>used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; brands.</li>
            <li>Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an \\&quot;under 4 oz.\\&quot; size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some.</li>
            <li>Glad you had it.  </li>
            <li>and I already have my favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I guess it is okay.</li>
            <li>I have used this many times before</li>
            <li>This is a great, really affordable shampoo.</li>
            <li>As a hand cleaner, there is none better.</li>
            <li>Removes residue, but strips moisture from hair more than the clarifying options from Neutrogena or Pantene do.</li>
            <li>Love it .....</li>
            <li>what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for years and continue to love it.</li>
            <li>Two of my favorite things in a shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;No fragrences, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather rinse and you don&#x27;t even need to repeat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, Great seller</li>
            <li>It is easy on the hair, never drying or damaging and my hair is even shinier when I am done.</li>
            <li>is it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Okay it&#x27;s just a cheap shampoo, but when all it is supposed to do is clean my hair and scalp and delivers...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>With the clarifying shampoo I can wash hair and body, rinses off easily, hair is squeaky clean and skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I was traveling in a smoggy area and could almost feel the smog in my hair, but also because it was cheap</li>
            <li>The sellers sent it promptly and made the experience hassle free.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for sloughing of the accumulated product and oils prior to doing a deep-conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product since it was so cheap, but didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I feel really clean with this soap.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done, your hair is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Has a sorta clean smelling fragrance which I like.  </li>
            <li>It gets my scalp and hair squeaky clean without over drying.</li>
            <li>Yes, it worked well getting my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>According to Consumer Reports, almost all shampoos will get your hair equally clean.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>I ordered several different shampoos that were on a list of best shampoos for oily hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Best way to remove soap scum!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite strip the hair as much as regular shampoos, and it&#x27;s a natural hair friendly option for a good clean.</li>
            <li>It smells like something between fresh and floral.</li>
            <li>and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Totally affordable, cleans nicely, but doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
            <li>I have really curly but really oily hair, and it gets the oil out better than anything else I use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in oil, and I&#x27;ve tried alot better products out that that will keep oil away for much longer.</li>
            <li>It gets your hair clean and nice-smelling, and it doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>The Suave Natural Shampoo was the most reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I think because it removes a lot of stuff regular shampoos don&#x27;t, it makes conditioners work even better.</li>
            <li>We always have many bottles in the house and refill a larger pump bottle from another shampoo</li>
            <li>Cleans 3-day unwashed hair very well with no repeat!</li>
            <li>Of course you can get it elsewhere much cheaper!  </li>
            <li>It took a lot of effort, despite starting from the ends and moving upward with the detangling solution (Infusium Leave In Treatment, which works great after using Neutrogena Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner,) and it left a lot of hair in my brush although that isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li>leaves the hair so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The funny thing was that the \\&quot;longer lasting fragrance\\&quot; was what was advertised on the bottle, not it&#x27;s ability to clean hair.</li>
            <li>But, it didn&#x27;t really clarify like I wanted</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>The whole family likes it.</li>
            <li>About 4 times as much.</li>
            <li>For years, all we could afford was the $1.00 bottle of Suave, and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if the scent is any good -- my wife hasn&#x27;t complained about it</li>
            <li>I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why so many other companies&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>way better than other &#x27;fancy&#x27;</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Clear Shampoo costs more, but it is worth it as it removes any build up and residue using it less than once per week</li>
            <li>I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Wash my short hair with this, build up a nice lather, rapidly rinse in the shower, style with pomade while wet</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, and it gets hair squeaky clean, usually with only one lather...</li>
            <li>This really seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it soft and</li>
            <li>So many soaps leave my skin dried out.</li>
            <li>My hair felt nice and soft and had very few tangles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my fine, flyaway hair just as clean and soft as as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I have used two bottles of the new formulation and determined that a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot;</li>
            <li>i always like suave shampoos, they all do the job well and get my dirty ol locks nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 because I can no longer find the clear version</li>
            <li>give the Naturals version 1 star because it is nowhere close to the clear version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping Suave hasn&#x27;t stopped producing the clear version.</li>
            <li>I also transfer it into clear, vinyl liquid soap pumps to stand on my vanities--matching colors to decor.  </li>
            <li>this Suave Clarifying was the only clarifying shampoo I could find at Walmart which really had me baffled.</li>
            <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t bothersome to me and I am sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best and least expensive Clarifying Shampoos that I have used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shown as the clear Daily Clarifying, not Naturals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hoping Amazon made a mistake and that I can still get the clear Daily Clarifying shampoo from Suave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bottle says for \\&quot;normal to oily\\&quot; hair, but my hair is dry and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.</li>
            <li>I still have about a third of a bottle of Neutrogena Clear Shampoo left.</li>
            <li>not sure if I&#x27;m a little allergic to one or more ingredients or not.</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick and curly, and since I don&#x27;t wash it as regularly as someone with thinner hair, it can get some build-up around the scalp.</li>

            <li> bottle says for \\&quot;normal to oily\\&quot; hair, but my hair is dry and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.</li>

            <li> Used it today and yes, it does clean the hair but no better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since in the past I have used more expensive shampoos.</li>
            <li> last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless.  </li>
            <li> As Target where I live stopped selling this item, and there were so few options for purchasing this product online at amazon.com,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Where I live we have extremely hard water. So many soaps leave my skin dried out. With the clarifying shampoo I can wash hair and body, rinses off easily, hair is squeaky clean and skin is smooth. I feel really clean with this soap. And, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price.  It was an excellent alternative to the [[ASIN:B001E96OUQ Neutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless.  When I got home, I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can no longer use this product.  I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula.</li>
            <li> I like using this shampoo after I&#x27;ve been in a pool with clorine or when I&#x27;ve used hairspray or other gel products on my hair.  This really seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; brands. Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an \\&quot;under 4 oz.\\&quot; size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some. I bought this one because I was traveling in a smoggy area and could almost feel the smog in my hair, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip. (I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my fine, flyaway hair just as clean and soft as as the more expensive brands. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this shampoo and my much more expensive salon brand! Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip. I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven&#x27;t found a single one that I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;ve saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners. Two thumbs up for this product!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this shampoo on Amazon! It&#x27;s shown as the clear Daily Clarifying, not Naturals. I ordered 4 because I can no longer find the clear version anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my shipment, Amazon had shipped me Daily Clarifying, &#x27;Naturals&#x27;. The blue, gooky, smelly stuff. Not what I wanted at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping Amazon made a mistake and that I can still get the clear Daily Clarifying shampoo from Suave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Naturals version 1 star because it is nowhere close to the clear version. It&#x27;s sticky, smelly and leaves a lot of residue in my hair. Not &#x27;Daily Clarifying&#x27; by any stretch. It even says &#x27;Longer lasting Fragrance&#x27; on the bottle. The antithesis of what I want!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m hoping Suave hasn&#x27;t stopped producing the clear version. Does anyone know where it can be purchased? Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the same clarifying shampoo that my drugstore no longer carries.  The sellers sent it promptly and made the experience hassle free.  The seller was called Odzo or something like that.  Glad you had it.  They no longer carry Pantene clarifying shampoo either.  I think the Suave is a little easier on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I used Suave Shampoo for Oily Hair for years and felt it was the best product on the market. Suave has dropped that product in favor of the Daily Clarifying Shampoo for Dry to Oily Hair.  I have used two bottles of the new formulation and determined that a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; approach to shampoo is destined to fail when it comes to handling oily hair. Despite washing my hair daily (as I always have), this new formulation fails to get me through 16 hours before my hair is a stringy, oily mess. This new and improved product is a failure.</li>
            <li> For years I used the Redken&#x27;s Clarifying Shampoo weekly on recommendation of my stylist. It has lemon and other citrusy fruits and really, I mean really cleans your hair. When you&#x27;re done, your hair is squeaky clean. I ran out of that and this Suave Clarifying was the only clarifying shampoo I could find at Walmart which really had me baffled. I went ahead and bought it with the clarifying conditioner. Used it today and yes, it does clean the hair but no better than any other shampoo. My hair felt nice and soft and had very few tangles. But, it didn&#x27;t really clarify like I wanted and I already have my favorite shampoo and conditioner. The funny thing was that the \\&quot;longer lasting fragrance\\&quot; was what was advertised on the bottle, not it&#x27;s ability to clean hair. The scent wasn&#x27;t bothersome to me and I am sensitive to fragrances. It smells like something between fresh and floral. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it&#x27;s just fine. I&#x27;ll probably use this about two times a week and hopefully the rest of the family will help me out using it up. I doubt I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> great deal!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans my hair great!</li>
            <li> The shampoo does the intended cleaning job. I have lost my sense of smell so I don&#x27;t know if the scent is any good -- my wife hasn&#x27;t complained about it so I guess it is okay.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle of shampoo weeks ago so I didn&#x27;t know about the defective packaging until today when I opened it.  The bottle cap is warped and I had to take scissors and punch a hole in it.  The bottle cap will not stay closed either.  Has to remain open sitting on the tub.</li>
            <li> Got this with a coupon and subscribe and save so it was cheaper than in stores, couldn&#x27;t pass it up and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Suave Naturals Shampoo, Daily Clarifying - 22.5oz. . .. I have used this many times before and I have always loved the fragrant scent</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, Great seller</li>
            <li> This is one of the best and least expensive Clarifying Shampoos that I have used.  I can&#x27;t understand why so many other companies&lt;br /&gt;have to charge an arm and a leg for the same thing!</li>
            <li> This is a great, really affordable shampoo. I have very long, fine hair.  I use this every other washing. It is easy on the hair, never drying or damaging and my hair is even shinier when I am done. I think because it removes a lot of stuff regular shampoos don&#x27;t, it makes conditioners work even better. Just a theory.</li>
            <li> Delightful shampoo works well AND looks good while it waits to be used.  I also transfer it into clear, vinyl liquid soap pumps to stand on my vanities--matching colors to decor.  As a hand cleaner, there is none better.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  Removes residue, but strips moisture from hair more than the clarifying options from Neutrogena or Pantene do.</li>
            <li> Love it .....leaves the hair so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> We only use this for occasional hair washing but use it daily as a replacement for soap in the shower.  No more soap scum and it works great to clean the body!  We always have many bottles in the house and refill a larger pump bottle from another shampoo is it&#x27;s easy to use.  Just one or two squirts on a washcloth is enough for a shower.</li>
            <li> I still have about a third of a bottle of Neutrogena Clear Shampoo left. As Target where I live stopped selling this item, and there were so few options for purchasing this product online at amazon.com, I decided to give Sauve Naturals Shampoo, Daily Clarifying a try. It tangled my hair like glue. Despite using a detangler, which is usually just &amp;#34;optional&amp;#34; for me, my hair remained badly tangled. It took a lot of effort, despite starting from the ends and moving upward with the detangling solution (Infusium Leave In Treatment, which works great after using Neutrogena Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner,) and it left a lot of hair in my brush although that isn&#x27;t normal. I found Sauve Naturals Shampoo, Daily Clarifying to be a poor quality product for me that is harsh on my hair. Neutrogena Clear Shampoo costs more, but it is worth it as it removes any build up and residue using it less than once per week plus it&#x27;s gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> Okay it&#x27;s just a cheap shampoo, but when all it is supposed to do is clean my hair and scalp and delivers...what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t condition, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to.  Has a sorta clean smelling fragrance which I like.  Cleans 3-day unwashed hair very well with no repeat!</li>
            <li> Great for my oily scalp and hair, and smells great too. It&#x27;s a wonderful value for the money. I can&#x27;t believe it is a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; shampoo, because in my opinion, it is not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; in quality at all. Inexpensive and works great? My kind of shampoo!</li>
            <li> It gets your hair clean and nice-smelling, and it doesn&#x27;t cost much. Fancy &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; shampoos have nearly all the same ingredients as this, but they add trace vitamins and plant essences that merely wash down the drain without doing anything for your hair. Suave is just as good, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for sloughing of the accumulated product and oils prior to doing a deep-conditioning treatment. Don&#x27;t use it without a deep conditioner though or your hair will become very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo believing it might be my solution to what I felt was a daily buildup on my hair and scalp due to hair spray. However, my hair feels somewhat rough after using it so it isn&#x27;t going to be a long term solution for me. In addition, it seems to cause my head to itch a little, so not sure if I&#x27;m a little allergic to one or more ingredients or not. I decided to alternate my use of this shampoo with another shampoo produce also from Suave (Tropical Coconut) and this seems to alleviate the itching and add softness to my hair. This product won&#x27;t be a regular shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair for a low price. The whole family likes it. We use it daily. smells good. please sell it on subscribe and save again</li>
            <li> i always like suave shampoos, they all do the job well and get my dirty ol locks nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great item for a gal with oily hair. I try other things, but always go back to this shampoo. Totally affordable, cleans nicely, but doesn&#x27;t strip my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> You sent me the wrong shampoo.  You sent the Naturals shampoo  come on Amazon, get with it.  All my orders lately have problems.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and curly, and since I don&#x27;t wash it as regularly as someone with thinner hair, it can get some build-up around the scalp. it&#x27;s no tdandruff, it&#x27;s just product and oil build-up, and now after finally finding an affordable clarifying shampoo, I can thank it for my cleaner scalp and my softer hair. It doesn&#x27;t quite strip the hair as much as regular shampoos, and it&#x27;s a natural hair friendly option for a good clean.</li>
            <li> Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up.  I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottle says for \\&quot;normal to oily\\&quot; hair, but my hair is dry and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it drying out my scalp. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world.  If I didn&#x27;t suffer from dandruff I would use it only a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Best way to remove soap scum!</li>
            <li> This stuff gets everything out of my hair. I used to have to use some heavy duty hair gel from Got 2B in my hair because my hair had to be pulled back and I couldn&#x27;t have fly-aways. I&#x27;d come home and use this stuff and it got every bit of that gel out with ease. It&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I use it about once or twice a week. I have really curly but really oily hair, and it gets the oil out better than anything else I use.</li>
            <li> After giving birth, my hair texture has changed.  My hair is extra oily, and this is the only shampoo I have found that cleans without leaving a greasy build-up.  And the price is right!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done well</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, and it gets hair squeaky clean, usually with only one lather... way better than other &#x27;fancy&#x27; brands.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this is ridiculously more expensive than what I pay in my local Smith&#x27;s/Kroger&#x27;s supermarket. About 4 times as much. Not the usual pricing I expect from Amazon.</li>
            <li> We keep this in the guest bathroom and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years and continue to love it. It gets my scalp and hair squeaky clean without over drying. However, the amazon price of $7 is outrageous, and you can buy it at your local drug store for under $2!</li>
            <li> I tried this product since it was so cheap, but didn&#x27;t like it. 1. It doesn&#x27;t foam up/lather much, so its hard to get it worked into your hair/scalp. 2. After one day, you will see oil building up again. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in oil, and I&#x27;ve tried alot better products out that that will keep oil away for much longer.</li>
            <li> Wash my short hair with this, build up a nice lather, rapidly rinse in the shower, style with pomade while wet and I&#x27;m good to go!  Shampoo is unscented, or close to it, though not necessarily hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Like the product, but the price was less than half at discount store</li>
            <li> I had started having problems with oily hair. I ordered several different shampoos that were on a list of best shampoos for oily hair.  The Suave Natural Shampoo was the most reasonably priced.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since in the past I have used more expensive shampoos. This shampoo is fantastic. I shampoo my hair everyday and when I wake up in the mornings no more oily roots. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who has the problem of your hair being oily late in the afternoon after shampooing that morning.</li>
            <li> ALMOST $8 (at the time of this review) for a SUAVE SHAMPOO?  Times have changed.  Of course you can get it elsewhere much cheaper!  Yes, it worked well getting my hair clean.  According to Consumer Reports, almost all shampoos will get your hair equally clean.  The differences lie in the thickness, richness, lather and scent.  So, buy what you like and can afford.  For years, all we could afford was the $1.00 bottle of Suave, and it worked really well.  It still works well.</li>

            <li> I used to use this shampoo before and it has made my hair dry and caused dandruff. Would not use ever</li>
            <li> Two of my favorite things in a shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;No fragrences, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather rinse and you don&#x27;t even need to repeat.</li>
