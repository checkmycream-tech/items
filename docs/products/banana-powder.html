            <li>(Essentially best on dark skin! :))</li>
            <li>I actually dip my brush or sponge into it as otherwise it seems to fly everywhere.</li>
            <li>Makes concealer look really smooth and prevents dreading as well as adds a highlighted look.</li>
            <li>I was really excited after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I read so many positive reviews on Youtube about Ben Nye banana powder.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping Product as described.  </li>
            <li>This helps tremendously with helping to keep my concealer in place.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this because it not only gives me a nice finish to my makeup, but also is useful when my T-zone gets oily</li>

            <li>Im very upset!</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>When I apply this to my under eye area its apparent, and that area is brighter, but honestly I can&#x27;t  figure out why its been made a big deal.  </li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for me.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cover or really even highlight.</li>
            <li>I am a medium brown but this works very well even though I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Got it fast.</li>

            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I thought the container was larger but its actually kind of small</li>
            <li>The powder is good but the size is too small !!!</li>
            <li>i love it but very small</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s professional and looks as such.</li>
            <li>I stick with Bare Minerals, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like</li>
            <li>and I always have to pour the product in my hand which always results in me pouring too much and making a big mess.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best product ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited after reading the reviews. The product doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for me. It didn&#x27;t cover or really even highlight. I&#x27;ll stick with benefit. Their products do what they say. Feel like I wasted my money on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> I am a medium brown but this works very well even though I have oily skin. Plan on purchasing the camel color next.</li>
            <li> A must have! Perfect for light contouring.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of it .. Just to matte my skin. So I love it for that</li>
            <li> i like this powder. i feel like it makes my foundation last all day…i only use it under neath my eyes though….</li>
            <li> I bought this because a friend recommended it to me. Honestly, I don&#x27;t see it doing anything for me. I used it to just set my under eyes and I didn&#x27;t notice anything. I tried it a few times for my entire face to set my makeup and I still didn&#x27;t notice anything. My 3 dollar drug store powder does the same thing. The other thing I dont like is that it comes in this little jar and I always have to pour the product in my hand which always results in me pouring too much and making a big mess. I just wish there was another way to getting it on my brush other than pouring it in my hand/dipping my entire brush in there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference after I put ny concelor on</li>
            <li> I thought the container was larger but its actually kind of small BUT... BUT a little goes a long way. I like the use of this powder and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You have to conceal your highlight before applying this powder so Duh if you&#x27;re just putting the powder alone it won&#x27;t stick! If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing don&#x27;t use it. Also if you&#x27;re WHITE use the white powder don&#x27;t use banana because of course it won&#x27;t highlight like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Excellent setting powder . It makes the finish look so flawless</li>
            <li> This is the BEST powder i&#x27;ve ever used in my life. It&#x27;s professional and looks as such.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I actually dip my brush or sponge into it as otherwise it seems to fly everywhere. The powder is super fine, but does an excellent job</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> The powder is good but the size is too small !!! Its over priced i thought the size will be bigger</li>
            <li> I love this powder for highlighting. Great find!!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping Product as described.  Wonderful powder that sets make up and stays on all day.  believe the hype!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to try this product out. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to order the bigger bottle because a little goes a long way when applying. Love! !</li>
            <li> Excellent setting powder . Gives a flawless finish</li>
            <li> I love it ..works great with my medium brown Completion ☺</li>
            <li> Meh, I&#x27;m glad I bought the cheaper one, because I don&#x27;t think this powder does what it says. I stick with Bare Minerals, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like this stuff did.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Love love love it! And the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t understand what all the buzz is about it doesn&#x27;t seem great to me</li>
            <li> I read so many positive reviews on Youtube about Ben Nye banana powder. So I purchased my own on Amazon. I really like it. I use a concealer&lt;br /&gt;first then brush the banana powder over the concealer. I get a nice highlight around the eyes, cheeks, forehead , and chin.</li>
            <li> Not how I expected it to be</li>
            <li> i love it but very small</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice highlight.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE! This stuff is amazing! It takes away any oily look on your face and leaves you with a flawless natural look!</li>
            <li> This is the best setting powder ever for concealer!</li>
            <li> I Hate this product. It didn;t stay on my face, made no highlight difference. Im very upset!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Got it fast.</li>
            <li> If you want to get that right, natural and smooth glow on your face, DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!! This product gives the BEST highlights/glow it needs for people with fair to dark skin (Essentially best on dark skin! :)) Apply this product with a make up blending sponge after applying your foundation then lightly blend the powder with a flat blush brush, then girl you be rocking your make up all day! Some people says this product is &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; that&#x27;s because they mistakenly use this as finishing powder or foundation LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, no wonder Kim Kardashian&#x27;s make up is always on point! ;D</li>
            <li> Makes concealer look really smooth and prevents dreading as well as adds a highlighted look. I apply it with a beauty blender and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the container I have to move it to another one because it falls out when I remove the cap. I like the powder but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I love this powder very much, probably the best product I&#x27;ve purchased so far in 2015. This helps tremendously with helping to keep my concealer in place. Good product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this powder at all. Did not work well with contouring my face or covering blemishes.  I also tried putting it over my foundation and it left my face with the yellow tint.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes along way! Great product!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this because it not only gives me a nice finish to my makeup, but also is useful when my T-zone gets oily and I&#x27;m in need of powder! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Did not match my skin tone. I am fair skinned and this was far too yellow. But for the price I do not feel like I am out any money. I gave the product to my mother-in-law! she loved it. She has complained about how Bare minerals has dried out her skin but this is did not.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper compare to buying in the store. Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> When I apply this to my under eye area its apparent, and that area is brighter, but honestly I can&#x27;t  figure out why its been made a big deal.  Maybe cuz i like simplicity and when something is raved about i like to see its value. Wasn&#x27;t  a bad price for all the product you get either. I like that I&#x27;m able to distinguish  my highlighted area from my contour area.</li>
            <li> Its good just have to figure out how to use it better!!</li>
