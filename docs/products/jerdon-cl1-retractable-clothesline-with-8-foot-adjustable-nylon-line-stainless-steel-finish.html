            <li>Good job and</li>
            <li>a good price.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>Easy to install and works great for indoor use.  </li>
            <li>Get some metal anchors, the kind the expand inside the wall, or wing anchors.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of not taking up space with a drying rack.  </li>
            <li>I gave up using them and figured it out on my own.  </li>
            <li>But it holds the clothes and looks nice</li>
            <li>It is nice to retract</li>
            <li>I installed it very easily in my mudroom over the washer/dryer with no problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of visitors who were intrigued by this easy, \\&quot;hideaway\\&quot; device and wanted one for themselves!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more.  </li>
            <li>But be sure to use sturdy wall anchors for this too.  </li>
            <li>Spend alittle more money and get something of better quality.</li>
            <li>It could be better finished.</li>
            <li>Once I did that, I was able to loosen it the rest of the way by hand and get the cover off.  </li>
            <li>ok maybe 15</li>
            <li>I just love this item.  </li>
            <li>Plastic ones were more money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all metal, but it&#x27;s mostly metal.  </li>
            <li>More than</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend going to the hardware store and getting anchors that are rated for more weight than you expect to put on the line.  </li>
            <li>This has a bit of a longer cord (8 ft.) than some others (be sure to measure your space before ordering).  </li>
            <li>So glad we found one that works well.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got this and will buy more for friends..</li>
            <li>I love it for hanging up my kids&#x27; swimsuits.</li>
            <li>I love this space saving product.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>works well, just wish I had purchased a lot longer length, clothes take up more room than I remembered.</li>
            <li>Bought this clothesline in 10/2012, handyman installed in laundry room, able to hang delicates &amp; more.&lt;br /&gt;Retractable</li>
            <li>We need more line</li>
            <li>This unit works perfectly, with enough tension in the cord to hold the light things we need to hang-dry.</li>
            <li>Once I got around that problem I was able to install it, and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel screws was a good touch.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install (took about 20 mins).  </li>
            <li>It appeared to be quite easy from the directions, but it was either defective or a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install, connect and operate.</li>
            <li>and you have to go easy on it.  </li>
            <li>You can not remove the cover for easy installation as directed.  </li>
            <li>It would be easy and convenient for the company to print an installation template on the box.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Installation was easy, for a non-handy person like me it took 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy to pull out and retract.  </li>
            <li>it is a good product for the price; just don&#x27;t expect to use it as your main source for laundry drying.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>After about 6 months, it&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>It seemed great, but it broke after the 3rd time we used it.  </li>
            <li>Each line comfortably holds two towels and assorted swim wear.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>so no extra space used, great addition to laundry room &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for cloth diapers and it works great.</li>
            <li>Have had it under a year, so far so good in terms of rust</li>
            <li>I had visions of drying a load of laundry but eight foot isn&#x27;t a lot of space and if I had be more realistic</li>
            <li>That should be interesting as stress will be high on these pieces.</li>
            <li>The line tension isn&#x27;t sufficient to hold up more than a couple shirts without significant sagging, even when you&#x27;ve cranked the tension as far as it can go.</li>
            <li>The string broke when I used it the very first time, to hang a damp windbreaker.</li>
            <li>I would have known this is mostly good for a limited number of items at once.  </li>
            <li>It turns out I don&#x27;t need to retract to get into the cabinets, so a shower curtain bar would have been better and certainly firmer and able to hold larger items.</li>
            <li>The quality is really not that good.</li>
            <li>And for the price you really can&#x27;t ask for a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>The Jerdon retractable clothesline was replacing an older broken one and was an exact match, so it worked out to be a perfect and easy solution.</li>
            <li>because I take my time to get it right.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, it certainly isn&#x27;t designed for any outdoor use.  </li>
            <li>First, throw away the plastic anchors that came with it.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I only had to swear once. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Pull out some of the line first, then follow the instructions to hold the reel and turn the knob counter-clockwise.  </li>
            <li>Glad we didn&#x27;t have the second holes drilled in the wall yet.</li>
            <li>I paid $16 when I bought it from Amazon; call me a fool, but I think I&#x27;m going to buy the same one again and hope it lasts better than the first.</li>
            <li>Would give this one 5 stars if first clothesline hadn&#x27;t pooped out.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Jerdon first Class Cl1 retractable clothesline.   </li>
            <li>I ordered this to hang my workout clothes after washing and it does exactly what is says it does.</li>
            <li>but is it a good value for less than $10 absolutely.</li>
            <li>I bought this item as a replacement for one I&#x27;d owned for about 11 or 12 years, (the line finally snapped), so I was fairly certain I would be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t pulled out a bit of line first, you&#x27;ll hear it click all day long but won&#x27;t be able to separate the cover from the reel.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty much what it looks like.</li>
            <li>It can hold running capris, jog bra, and a long sleeve dri-fit top.</li>
            <li>So far, my new one is working fine - no retraction problem.</li>
            <li>I have it in my laundry room and am able to hang up clothes to dry.</li>
            <li>It is simple to install and the tension is strong.</li>
            <li>Sustained a pretty high wind and did not snap/break.</li>
            <li>pliers and turn it further, and it does free up</li>
            <li>The screws fit into two holes in the back, which are slotted.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not so fast.  </li>
            <li>The bell appears to be stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>However, the &#x27;Stainless steel&#x27; construction is misleading.</li>
            <li>If it should break however, marine grade stainless steel replacement parts can be found at any marine supply.</li>
            <li>and I wanted the real deal for my laundry room.  </li>
            <li>It just kinda constantly swivels on the wall which makes it feel slightly cheap.</li>
            <li>But when it arrived, I immediately installed it in my laundry room which is really a pass through to my garage.</li>
            <li>THE HOUSING IS STAINLESS STEEL</li>
            <li>I USED A STUD FINDER AND SOME STAINLESS STEEL SCREWS TO ATTACH MINE.</li>
            <li>but really I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>I bought it for 9.99 a year ago which I think is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Why did it go up so much???</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slow to retract all the time and it sags a fair amount with any amount of weight on it.</li>
            <li>As for it failing when loaded up, this is clearly not a general purpose clothes line, but a light-weight unit for light items.</li>
            <li>It carries almost as much stress as the screws on the main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First the rope broke, which we fixed, then a spring broke</li>
            <li>Once it clicks, you&#x27;ll be able to slide the cover down.  </li>
            <li>Does the job, but the main unit doesn&#x27;t lock into place.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with a prior purchase of this product, that I purchased a second unit to install in the guest bathroom in our beach house.</li>
            <li>Highly reco.</li>
            <li>The new one fit on the same screws as the old, so I could just drop it in place.</li>
            <li>Oh what fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The far wall receptacle is much easier, since you can see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li>I bought extra long screws to mount into the studs to be safe.  </li>
            <li>For less than $10 this is a great little closeline.  </li>
            <li>The line doesn&#x27;t retract right back all the time</li>
            <li>It meet our needs based on our light use (no more than 2 medium towels) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>However, it is easy to shorten the line to ensure it stays tight.  </li>
            <li>piece is cheap and feels like it, and it&#x27;s certainly no fun to install.  </li>
            <li>They use this same exact hook/retainer system on boats.</li>
            <li>It works OK  sort of difficult to get it really taught, but it works good enough with a slight sag.</li>
            <li>This item worked good in small spaces where storage is minimal.</li>
            <li>If you happened to mount those wall anchors just an eighth of the inch too close together, or too far apart, you aren&#x27;t going to get the unit mounted.  </li>
            <li>It only has to extend 6 feet, but at that length, it stays stretched pretty well without too much sagging.</li>
            <li>So far is holding up this product</li>
            <li>Completely unusable.</li>
            <li>the winter I also use it to hang a towel while I shower, so I can dry before getting out of the tub into the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line held up well - no rusting, no breaking, works as well as the first day I hung</li>
            <li>However, I discovered this thing incorporates a locking feature so that the line stays taught should you use less than the full length.</li>
            <li>2 other people also try to do it without success.  </li>
            <li>I purchased two of the same item in the event one was defective because I live much to far away to consider returning them.  </li>
            <li>Of course a sopping wet towel would weigh it down much more than the fresh-out-of-the-washer bathing suits I generally use it for, but it IS only a fabric cable!</li>
            <li>It works fine for that purpose as long as the items aren&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li>You turn what appears to be the proper knob as far as it goes, then nothing.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets in needing to replace it.</li>
            <li>The screw mounting system is a keyhole based system which may give you trouble getting quite right and the screws and anchors are designed to be used on drywall.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the installation instructions could&#x27;ve been made much simpler/clearer, (someone else installed my first one).</li>
            <li>have no complaint with it at all, works well and exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li>the clothes would cause the line to sag so that all of the hangers would group together at the middle of the line and not dry evenly.</li>

            <li> I only had to swear once. :)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Pull out some of the line first, then follow the instructions to hold the reel and turn the knob counter-clockwise.  </li>
            <li> Glad we didn&#x27;t have the second holes drilled in the wall yet.</li>
            <li> I paid $16 when I bought it from Amazon; call me a fool, but I think I&#x27;m going to buy the same one again and hope it lasts better than the first.</li>
            <li> Would give this one 5 stars if first clothesline hadn&#x27;t pooped out.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Jerdon first Class Cl1 retractable clothesline.   </li>
            <li> I ordered this to hang my workout clothes after washing and it does exactly what is says it does.</li>
            <li> but is it a good value for less than $10 absolutely.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a replacement for one I&#x27;d owned for about 11 or 12 years, (the line finally snapped), so I was fairly certain I would be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t pulled out a bit of line first, you&#x27;ll hear it click all day long but won&#x27;t be able to separate the cover from the reel.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much what it looks like.</li>
            <li> It can hold running capris, jog bra, and a long sleeve dri-fit top.</li>
            <li> So far, my new one is working fine - no retraction problem.</li>
            <li> I have it in my laundry room and am able to hang up clothes to dry.</li>
            <li> It is simple to install and the tension is strong.</li>
            <li> Sustained a pretty high wind and did not snap/break.</li>
            <li> pliers and turn it further, and it does free up</li>
            <li> The screws fit into two holes in the back, which are slotted.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not so fast.  </li>
            <li> The bell appears to be stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> However, the &#x27;Stainless steel&#x27; construction is misleading.</li>
            <li> If it should break however, marine grade stainless steel replacement parts can be found at any marine supply.</li>
            <li> and I wanted the real deal for my laundry room.  </li>
            <li> It just kinda constantly swivels on the wall which makes it feel slightly cheap.</li>
            <li> But when it arrived, I immediately installed it in my laundry room which is really a pass through to my garage.</li>
            <li> THE HOUSING IS STAINLESS STEEL</li>
            <li> I USED A STUD FINDER AND SOME STAINLESS STEEL SCREWS TO ATTACH MINE.</li>
            <li> but really I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for 9.99 a year ago which I think is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Why did it go up so much???</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow to retract all the time and it sags a fair amount with any amount of weight on it.</li>
            <li> As for it failing when loaded up, this is clearly not a general purpose clothes line, but a light-weight unit for light items.</li>
            <li> It carries almost as much stress as the screws on the main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First the rope broke, which we fixed, then a spring broke</li>
            <li> Once it clicks, you&#x27;ll be able to slide the cover down.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, but the main unit doesn&#x27;t lock into place.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with a prior purchase of this product, that I purchased a second unit to install in the guest bathroom in our beach house.</li>
            <li> Highly reco.</li>
            <li> The new one fit on the same screws as the old, so I could just drop it in place.</li>
            <li> Oh what fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The far wall receptacle is much easier, since you can see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> I bought extra long screws to mount into the studs to be safe.  </li>
            <li> For less than $10 this is a great little closeline.  </li>
            <li> The line doesn&#x27;t retract right back all the time</li>
            <li> It meet our needs based on our light use (no more than 2 medium towels) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> However, it is easy to shorten the line to ensure it stays tight.  </li>
            <li> piece is cheap and feels like it, and it&#x27;s certainly no fun to install.  </li>
            <li> They use this same exact hook/retainer system on boats.</li>
            <li> It works OK  sort of difficult to get it really taught, but it works good enough with a slight sag.</li>
            <li> This item worked good in small spaces where storage is minimal.</li>
            <li> If you happened to mount those wall anchors just an eighth of the inch too close together, or too far apart, you aren&#x27;t going to get the unit mounted.  </li>
            <li> It only has to extend 6 feet, but at that length, it stays stretched pretty well without too much sagging.</li>
            <li> So far is holding up this product</li>
            <li> Completely unusable.</li>
            <li> the winter I also use it to hang a towel while I shower, so I can dry before getting out of the tub into the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line held up well - no rusting, no breaking, works as well as the first day I hung</li>
            <li> However, I discovered this thing incorporates a locking feature so that the line stays taught should you use less than the full length.</li>
            <li> 2 other people also try to do it without success.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two of the same item in the event one was defective because I live much to far away to consider returning them.  </li>
            <li> Of course a sopping wet towel would weigh it down much more than the fresh-out-of-the-washer bathing suits I generally use it for, but it IS only a fabric cable!</li>
            <li> It works fine for that purpose as long as the items aren&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> You turn what appears to be the proper knob as far as it goes, then nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets in needing to replace it.</li>
            <li> The screw mounting system is a keyhole based system which may give you trouble getting quite right and the screws and anchors are designed to be used on drywall.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the installation instructions could&#x27;ve been made much simpler/clearer, (someone else installed my first one).</li>
            <li> have no complaint with it at all, works well and exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> the clothes would cause the line to sag so that all of the hangers would group together at the middle of the line and not dry evenly.</li>
            <li> This is very convenient the hang small washed items such as wash clothes and underwear.  </li>
            <li> Plus, unlike the old one, it has a screw that can be used to clamp the cord, so the return spring doesn&#x27;t have to hold all the weight (less sagging).    </li>
            <li> how long the retraction mechanism continues to work.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> There is minor wear on the line</li>
            <li> I use to dry lingerie</li>
            <li> They dry out of the way.</li>
            <li> You can even pull on the line to reduce the slack even further and then lock it down.</li>
            <li> Earlier reviews stated the line sags if the installed area is less than 8 feet.</li>
            <li> I guessed that the threads on the knob were stuck, so I wrapped a rag around the knob (to prevent damage) and used a wrench to try to turn it counter clockwise a little further.  </li>
            <li> Love this and can&#x27;t find anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> My fault for being too curious and getting it tangled.  </li>
            <li> Also, the tension/release spring is sometimes rough</li>
            <li> once I expected it to break</li>
            <li> WE HAVE HUNG UP TO 4 WET BEACH TOWELS</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Certainly not &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; scale but for the price...........</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but I knew it based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the line will sag if your space isn&#x27;t 8ft accross.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to separate the outside casing from the inside mechanism to mount the clothesline on a wall.  </li>
            <li> Pull the string out, hook it to the other side and tighten the thumb screw to keep the line taught.  </li>
            <li> Throw them away and use some other plastic anchors.  </li>
            <li> Ended up having to return the clothesline due to installation issues.</li>
            <li> This product functions just as I expected however, don&#x27;t tighten down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to dry a heavy wool mattress pad, size queen</li>
            <li> housing was a little difficult to get apart at first.</li>
            <li> For swimsuits and the occasional delicate or sweater</li>
            <li> Others have complained about the problems they had opening up the unit, but I don&#x27;t know why that would be necessary.</li>
            <li> My closet is about 6 feet wide and I loaded it up with some heavy clothes over those years.  </li>
            <li> The screw holes are slotted, allowing the screw heads to be slid through the wide opening in the slot and then the unit slid down to the narrow part of the slot.    </li>
            <li> The retractable mechanism&#x27;s operation is not very smooth but it does the trick.  </li>
            <li> The screw heads go into the holes, then the screw shaft slides down into the slots.  </li>
            <li> I used it 1-2 times a week for 6 months when the string chafed down to nothing and broke.  </li>
            <li> I, like other reviewers of this product, had trouble getting the cover to detatch during installation.  </li>
            <li> Every time I used it, the string would retract a little less.</li>
            <li> Oh, too tight.  </li>
            <li> Take it off again, and tight the screws a bit.  </li>
            <li> I have it mounted on a wall stud and often pulled on the line (while loaded with clothes) and tightened at the base as other reviewers described, putting significant tension on it.  </li>
            <li> I installed this cloth line over my tub a little over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> It took a little while for my order to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I have to feed it in a little bit</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that I should have measured it to know a solid bar would have worked, but that is no fault of the product.</li>
            <li> The spring feels flimsy, like it will stop retracting after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> The line is heavy string weight and will support socks and undies</li>
            <li> When the old one failed (the return spring broke), I went searching and found this on Amazon.    </li>
            <li> The line sags some if the items are heavy.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Purchased a diff company and was unhappy so bought this one at a higher price hoping higher quality but am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Stays tight!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in my small laundry/mud room.  </li>
            <li> it does sag, but that is to be expected as it is not a metal bar, it is thin rope.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is a financial lesson learned... never again!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t hang anything real heavy on it though</li>
            <li> I wish I can post a picture here with this comment to show everybody what I mean.</li>
            <li> The cover would not release from the back making it impossible to put the screws into the wall.  </li>
            <li> Installation, frustrating.  </li>
            <li> The clothesline in this product is a thin nylon string.  </li>
            <li> I wanted the retractable because I have cabinets behind it and thought I needed retractable to get into the cabinets.  </li>
            <li> Instructions, useless.  </li>
            <li> Those are useless.  </li>
            <li> You have to do all this blind, since the reel obscures the screw holes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unfortunately stuck with it because I missed the deadline to return it (</li>
            <li> Difficult to put up, then the pull section broke off in my husband&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> The clothesline is difficult to retract.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s in our fairly muggy bathroom).</li>
            <li> the bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH BOTH ITEMS.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Instructions, useless.  Installation, frustrating.  Quality, suspect.  Operation, marginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to remove the cover.  You do this by turning the adjustment know (not indicated in drawing) counter-clockwise until the cover releases.  You turn what appears to be the proper knob as far as it goes, then nothing.  You hesitate to force it further, concerned that you might break it.  But you have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take pliers and turn it further, and it does free up so you can continue turning by hand.  Do that until you are blue in the face.  Then realize that you have to draw some of the string out to release the cover, which then remains on the string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the cover off doesn&#x27;t help the installation.  The back is held onto the wall by screws.  The screws fit into two holes in the back, which are slotted.  The screw heads go into the holes, then the screw shaft slides down into the slots.  You would hope that taking the cover off would allow you to access the screw heads, so that you could tighten the back to the wall.  No deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the cover is off, you discover that the screw heads would still be covered up by the reel for the string.  And that is not removable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to mount this, do the following.  First, throw away the plastic anchors that came with it.  Those are useless.  Any weight on the string, while is use, will attempt to pull the unit from the wall, and the anchors provided are about the flimsiest you can imaging.  Get some metal anchors, the kind the expand inside the wall, or wing anchors.  Or mount it to a stud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not so fast.  How do you do this?  Measure the spacing of the two holes in the wall plate.  Mount the anchors into the wall as measured.  Insert the screws into the anchors, then back them out a bit.  Now try to get the wall plate attached to the screws.  Oh, too tight.  Well take the unit off, and loosen the screws a bit.  Try again.  Oh, tooloose.  Take it off again, and tight the screws a bit.  Rinse, repeat.  It&#x27;s all a trial and error process.  There is no way to put the back on the wall, and then just tighten the screws.  What a terrible design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait.  There&#x27;s more.  If you happened to mount those wall anchors just an eighth of the inch too close together, or too far apart, you aren&#x27;t going to get the unit mounted.  You might as well start again at a different spot.  Those screws will not go into the slots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention.  You have to do all this blind, since the reel obscures the screw holes.  Oh what fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The far wall receptacle is much easier, since you can see what you are doing.  But be sure to use sturdy wall anchors for this too.  It carries almost as much stress as the screws on the main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the reel is plastic, and yes the back plate is plastic.  The spring feels flimsy, like it will stop retracting after a few uses.  Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This piece is cheap and feels like it, and it&#x27;s certainly no fun to install.  Other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is a good choice for a retractable clothes line.  The bell appears to be stainless steel.  The connector for th opposit wall is plastic.  The screw mounting system is a keyhole based system which may give you trouble getting quite right and the screws and anchors are designed to be used on drywall.  I bought extra long screws to mount into the studs to be safe.  It looks and works well.</li>
            <li> It seemed great, but it broke after the 3rd time we used it.  First the rope broke, which we fixed, then a spring broke and it was no longer retractable.  Spend alittle more money and get something of better quality.</li>
            <li> It could be better finished.</li>
            <li> The clothesline in this product is a thin nylon string.  I used it 1-2 times a week for 6 months when the string chafed down to nothing and broke.  My next retractable clothesline will be a different model.</li>
            <li> It took me about 10 minutes to break both clotheslines that I bought.  My fault for being too curious and getting it tangled.  The line is heavy string weight and will support socks and undies well.  It bowed under the weight of towels, partly because I installed it with only seven foot of expansion.  I had visions of drying a load of laundry but eight foot isn&#x27;t a lot of space and if I had be more realistic I would have known this is mostly good for a limited number of items at once.  All in all it is a good product for the price; just don&#x27;t expect to use it as your main source for laundry drying.</li>
            <li> The Jerdon retractable clothesline was replacing an older broken one and was an exact match, so it worked out to be a perfect and easy solution. The item arrived in good condition and as promised.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  The quality is not the best but I knew it based on the other reviews. The plastic hook should be made of metal instead of plastic but again I knew about this. The retractable mechanism&#x27;s operation is not very smooth but it does the trick.  It meet our needs based on our light use (no more than 2 medium towels) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> For less than $10 this is a great little closeline.  I purchased this to use in my small laundry/mud room.  I liked the idea of not taking up space with a drying rack.  It was easy to install (took about 20 mins).  As mentioned in other reviews, the line will sag if your space isn&#x27;t 8ft accross.  However, it is easy to shorten the line to ensure it stays tight.  Is it all metal?  NO - but is it a good value for less than $10 absolutely.</li>
            <li> I bought and installed two of these on our covered deck for pool use. Each line comfortably holds two towels and assorted swim wear. Earlier reviews stated the line sags if the installed area is less than 8 feet. However, I discovered this thing incorporates a locking feature so that the line stays taught should you use less than the full length. You can even pull on the line to reduce the slack even further and then lock it down. Stays tight! However, the &#x27;Stainless steel&#x27; construction is misleading. The &#x27;hooking&#x27; mechanism and the &#x27;retainer&#x27; are both plastic. I see this lasting about 2-3 years! we&#x27;ll see. This is the only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5! If it should break however, marine grade stainless steel replacement parts can be found at any marine supply. They use this same exact hook/retainer system on boats.</li>
            <li> I actually returned this product.  I was not able to separate the outside casing from the inside mechanism to mount the clothesline on a wall.  It appeared to be quite easy from the directions, but it was either defective or a piece of junk.  I had 2 other people also try to do it without success.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I, like other reviewers of this product, had trouble getting the cover to detatch during installation.  I guessed that the threads on the knob were stuck, so I wrapped a rag around the knob (to prevent damage) and used a wrench to try to turn it counter clockwise a little further.  Once I did that, I was able to loosen it the rest of the way by hand and get the cover off.  Once I got around that problem I was able to install it, and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel screws was a good touch.  It was up in ten minutes; ok maybe 15 because I take my time to get it right.  Pull the string out, hook it to the other side and tighten the thumb screw to keep the line taught.  Just like the ones at the hotel.  Good job and a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The housing was a little difficult to get apart at first. I only had to swear once. :)</li>
            <li> Works for my needs. I&#x27;ve been using this inside for our delicates, and it holds up well.  I wouldn&#x27;t hang anything real heavy on it though</li>
            <li> I just love this item.  When I found it, I was amazed at the price and quality.  Plastic ones were more money and I wanted the real deal for my laundry room.  This is it!  This all metal one is just like the hotel ones.  It works great for my dedicates that can&#x27;t be put in the dryer.  Love this and can&#x27;t find anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, connect and operate. We&#x27;ll have to see how well it holds up to the moist bathroom environment and how long the retraction mechanism continues to work.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all metal, but it&#x27;s mostly metal.  I had one of these installed in my laundry closet and it lasted for over 7 years.  For what it&#x27;s worth, it certainly isn&#x27;t designed for any outdoor use.  Also, the tension/release spring is sometimes rough and you have to go easy on it.  If the line was 50% stronger it would probably lasted over 15 years.  Those are my only complaints.  My closet is about 6 feet wide and I loaded it up with some heavy clothes over those years.  I have it mounted on a wall stud and often pulled on the line (while loaded with clothes) and tightened at the base as other reviewers described, putting significant tension on it.  More than once I expected it to break but it held up like a champ.  I never tried the wall anchors that came with the product and for almost any application I&#x27;d recommend going to the hardware store and getting anchors that are rated for more weight than you expect to put on the line.  The anchors that come with it are great for mounting things like power strips and cable-guides.  I have no regrets in needing to replace it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a replacement for one I&#x27;d owned for about 11 or 12 years, (the line finally snapped), so I was fairly certain I would be satisfied.  My only complaint is that the installation instructions could&#x27;ve been made much simpler/clearer, (someone else installed my first one). I gave up using them and figured it out on my own.  Love the product!</li>
            <li> I bought this since it was suposed to be metal... the shell is indeed metal but the back components are silver plastic as well as the connecting pieces.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much what it looks like. I installed it very easily in my mudroom over the washer/dryer with no problems. After about 6 months, it&#x27;s holding up just fine. It only has to extend 6 feet, but at that length, it stays stretched pretty well without too much sagging. Of course a sopping wet towel would weigh it down much more than the fresh-out-of-the-washer bathing suits I generally use it for, but it IS only a fabric cable! For swimsuits and the occasional delicate or sweater I&#x27;ve used it for, it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;ve had lots of visitors who were intrigued by this easy, \\&quot;hideaway\\&quot; device and wanted one for themselves!</li>
            <li> So far is holding up this product is a lot stronger than the once I had purchased at ACE Hardware.</li>
            <li> I installed this clothesline over my tub.  You can not remove the cover for easy installation as directed.  You will need to create a template for use in putting the screws in the drywall.  The anchors shipped with the unit are junk.  Throw them away and use some other plastic anchors.  It would be easy and convenient for the company to print an installation template on the box.  For these reasons, I only rate it three stars.</li>
            <li> I installed this cloth line over my tub a little over a year ago.  I use to dry lingerie I wash by hand.&lt;br /&gt;In the winter I also use it to hang a towel while I shower, so I can dry before getting out of the tub into the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line held up well - no rusting, no breaking, works as well as the first day I hung it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you retract it, it is practically invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy, for a non-handy person like me it took 10 minutes. If I can do it, anyone can do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaint with it at all, works well and exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Clip head and slot are made of plastic. That should be interesting as stress will be high on these pieces.</li>
            <li> This item worked good in small spaces where storage is minimal. They worked great and retracted when not in use.</li>
            <li> After struggling with this, we figured out how to get the cover off.  Pull out some of the line first, then follow the instructions to hold the reel and turn the knob counter-clockwise.  Once it clicks, you&#x27;ll be able to slide the cover down.  If you haven&#x27;t pulled out a bit of line first, you&#x27;ll hear it click all day long but won&#x27;t be able to separate the cover from the reel.  Hope this helps the next buyer!</li>
            <li> This has a bit of a longer cord (8 ft.) than some others (be sure to measure your space before ordering).  I&#x27;ve used it to dry a heavy wool mattress pad, size queen and it held up perfectly.  Easy to pull out and retract.  A great solution to drying indoors.</li>
            <li> The quality is really not that good. It&#x27;s slow to retract all the time and it sags a fair amount with any amount of weight on it.</li>
            <li> So glad we found one that works well.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and works great for indoor use.  It can also carry a lot of weight.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great convenient product for all kinds of spaces......I am glad I got this and will buy more for friends..great item</li>
            <li> Does the job, but the main unit doesn&#x27;t lock into place. It just kinda constantly swivels on the wall which makes it feel slightly cheap. But it holds the clothes and looks nice</li>
            <li> I love it for hanging up my kids&#x27; swimsuits. My husband installed it in our kids&#x27; bathroom (like in a hotel) and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I saw these in hotels and at RV shows as a space saving product. It took a little while for my order to be fulfilled. But when it arrived, I immediately installed it in my laundry room which is really a pass through to my garage. I love this space saving product. I hang up my unmentionables and hats, and gloves and reusable mop pads. They dry out of the way. This product functions just as I expected however, don&#x27;t tighten down one of the feeder screw that threads out the cord or else it doesn&#x27;t retract like it is supposed to. Love this thing.</li>
            <li> THE HOUSING IS STAINLESS STEEL BUT THE HOOK AND HOOK ATTACHMENT IS PLASTIC. I DID NOT USE THE INCLUDED HARDWARE. I USED A STUD FINDER AND SOME STAINLESS STEEL SCREWS TO ATTACH MINE. I DID NOT DETACH THE COVER FROM THE HOUSING. INSTEAD I MEASURED THE HOLE SPACING ON THE MOUNTING PLATE, INSTALLED THE SCREWS AND SLID THE CLOTHESLINE ON. HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A MONTH WITH NO PROBLEMS. WE HAVE HUNG UP TO 4 WET BEACH TOWELS ON IT. I WOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> works well, just wish I had purchased a lot longer length, clothes take up more room than I remembered. Sustained a pretty high wind and did not snap/break.</li>
            <li> It works. Certainly not &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; scale but for the price...........</li>
            <li> The title says it all. The string is already starting to fall apart as soon as I took it out of the box. I&#x27;m unfortunately stuck with it because I missed the deadline to return it (even tho I never installed it to the wall since I know that string won&#x27;t last with use.) I wish I can post a picture here with this comment to show everybody what I mean. Buyers beware.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put up, then the pull section broke off in my husband&#x27;s hand. Glad we didn&#x27;t have the second holes drilled in the wall yet.</li>
            <li> have had the product for over a year. Purchased a diff company and was unhappy so bought this one at a higher price hoping higher quality but am disappointed. The string is flimzy and the retractable part doesnt work</li>
            <li> We had a similar device set up so that the cord spanned the across the converted closet holding our washer and dryer. It was in the house when we bought it so I have no idea of its age or source. When the old one failed (the return spring broke), I went searching and found this on Amazon.    The new one fit on the same screws as the old, so I could just drop it in place. This unit works perfectly, with enough tension in the cord to hold the light things we need to hang-dry. Plus, unlike the old one, it has a screw that can be used to clamp the cord, so the return spring doesn&#x27;t have to hold all the weight (less sagging).    Others have complained about the problems they had opening up the unit, but I don&#x27;t know why that would be necessary. The screw holes are slotted, allowing the screw heads to be slid through the wide opening in the slot and then the unit slid down to the narrow part of the slot.    As for it failing when loaded up, this is clearly not a general purpose clothes line, but a light-weight unit for light items. It works perfectly for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I installed this in my laundry room for items I don&#x27;t want to place in the dryer.  It works fine for that purpose as long as the items aren&#x27;t too heavy.  The line sags some if the items are heavy.</li>
            <li> Have had it under a year, so far so good in terms of rust (it&#x27;s in our fairly muggy bathroom). Pulling the cord as taut as possible and then tightening the lock part definitely makes a difference in terms of cord tautness when you use it.</li>
            <li> The clothesline is difficult to retract. Cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> My clothesline lasted through 3 years of occasional use. Every time I used it, the string would retract a little less. After 3 years, the string was hanging out of the housing about 2 feet, and then the spring broke and the line wouldn&#x27;t retract at all. I give it 3 stars because it worked great while it lasted. I paid $16 when I bought it from Amazon; call me a fool, but I think I&#x27;m going to buy the same one again and hope it lasts better than the first. I just don&#x27;t like the looks of any of the others on offer. (Note: To prevent the line from sagging, tighten the collar around the string where it emerges from the housing). 3/6/13 UPDATE: So far, my new one is working fine - no retraction problem. Have upped my stars from 3 to 4. Would give this one 5 stars if first clothesline hadn&#x27;t pooped out.</li>
            <li> I got this line to put in my laundry room above the washer and dryer.  I wanted the retractable because I have cabinets behind it and thought I needed retractable to get into the cabinets.  It turns out I don&#x27;t need to retract to get into the cabinets, so a shower curtain bar would have been better and certainly firmer and able to hold larger items. However I do like the retractable line.  It is nice to retract so I can slide smaller clothes onto the line, which is why I wanted it.  I can hang undergarments, swimsuits, and some of my kids clothes.  it does sag, but that is to be expected as it is not a metal bar, it is thin rope.  My only disappointment is that I should have measured it to know a solid bar would have worked, but that is no fault of the product.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with a prior purchase of this product, that I purchased a second unit to install in the guest bathroom in our beach house. now our guests can hang out swim suits, etc., without dripping all over the floors, or hanging things over doors. Perfect!</li>
            <li> the clothes would cause the line to sag so that all of the hangers would group together at the middle of the line and not dry evenly.</li>
            <li> The line tension isn&#x27;t sufficient to hold up more than a couple shirts without significant sagging, even when you&#x27;ve cranked the tension as far as it can go. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The retractable clothes line stopped retracting fully almost immediately after installation? the tension in the line when extended is also low sack? I am following up with the comnpany to for a solution. I still like the idea. even my wife did.</li>
            <li> The string broke when I used it the very first time, to hang a damp windbreaker. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Install instructions did not work with our product.  The cover would not release from the back making it impossible to put the screws into the wall.  Ended up having to return the clothesline due to installation issues.</li>
            <li> Rather easy to install has held up well for a couple of years now, looks good and comes in very handy in the rv.</li>
            <li> As others have commented, the installation is tricky, especially when midway through the line breaks at the tip. Completely unusable. Would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this clothesline in 10/2012, handyman installed in laundry room, able to hang delicates &amp; more.&lt;br /&gt;Retractable so no extra space used, great addition to laundry room &amp; house.&lt;br /&gt;No clothesline needed outside.&lt;br /&gt;Keenpetite aka Carmen</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;nylon&amp;#34; line broke on 2nd use. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH BOTH ITEMS. I purchased two of the same item in the event one was defective because I live much to far away to consider returning them.  To my amazement BOTH STRINGS WERE CHEWED up. Unfortunately this is a financial lesson learned... never again!</li>
            <li> I bought this in Sept 2012 for my laundry room. I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for cloth diapers and it works great. There is minor wear on the line but it seems to be holding up pretty well. The line doesn&#x27;t retract right back all the time and sometimes I have to feed it in a little bit but really I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. We need more line so I returned to Amazon to purchase a second and was amazed by the price increase. I bought it for 9.99 a year ago which I think is reasonable. Now it&#x27;s $28??? Why did it go up so much???</li>
            <li> Broke shortly after purchase</li>
            <li> Jerdon first Class Cl1 retractable clothesline.   My husband attached the clothesline between two posts on our patio.  This is very convenient the hang small washed items such as wash clothes and underwear.  This summer we can hang bathing suits and beach towels.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our laundry room if it was all metal I would have been a lot happier. It works OK  sort of difficult to get it really taught, but it works good enough with a slight sag. And for the price you really can&#x27;t ask for a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> This product functions exactaly as it was designed to do.  I have it in my laundry room and am able to hang up clothes to dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to hang my workout clothes after washing and it does exactly what is says it does. It can hold running capris, jog bra, and a long sleeve dri-fit top. It is simple to install and the tension is strong. Highly reco.</li>
