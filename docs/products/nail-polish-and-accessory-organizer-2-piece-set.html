            <li>I think it&#x27;s the perfect set up for polishes, since most polishes are visible but also safe from being knocked over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I, like the others, found the nail polish caddy fit bottles of most nail polish brands (including OPI, Zoya, Revlon,</li>
            <li>Super!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s already filled up</li>
            <li>I accidently brought 2 of these and was getting ready to return but decided it would be a great gift for my sister for her birthday next month.</li>
            <li>I love to display my nail polishes in this along with my clear acrylic make-up holder.  </li>
            <li>Beware that the organizer holds only EIGHT (8)</li>
            <li>Cute and Simple!</li>

            <li>I really was worried about it and was frequently checking the mail until I realized I could track my package.</li>
            <li>My only advice is to just go ahead and buy new.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I am able to return it and am hoping that they do not try to re-sell this broken one.</li>

            <li> very sturdy and shipped very well packed.  </li>

            <li> Thankfully, I am able to return it and am hoping that they do not try to re-sell this broken one.</li>
            <li> The item came double boxed with absolutely no damage to the boxes themselves but the actual acrylic nail polish holder looked like it had been dropped off of a 3 story building.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that there are some empty spaces..</li>
            <li> have one complaint, however, and though it&#x27;s not a huge deal and doesn&#x27;t change my rating, I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Apparently the used one had been &amp;#34;quality inspected&amp;#34; according to the sticker on the box, but it was broken in several places.</li>
            <li> I ordered the two-piece set which arrived on time and with no cracks (which was quite a relief considering that other customers had received damaged merchandise).</li>
            <li> They compliment each other.  </li>
            <li> and I keep basecoats, clearcoats, and the colors I&#x27;m working with in the small tray along with files and such.</li>
            <li> -though a bit tight, Orly, etc.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing a &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; one for a few dollars less.</li>
            <li> I ordered this via prime and it didn&#x27;t ship til the due date, and arrived two days late without warning or any explanation from the company.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy, thick acrylic - not cheap or thin.</li>

            <li> Sturdy, thick acrylic - not cheap or thin. I enjoyed this product</li>

            <li> I bought this to organize my essential oils.  Works great for that.  I will probably be ordering another one as my collection expands.</li>
            <li> This product works for me! I ordered the two-piece set which arrived on time and with no cracks (which was quite a relief considering that other customers had received damaged merchandise). The products are new, clean, and have the same dimensions as advertised. The polish organizer fits all my OPI nail polishes.  **CRITICISM: Beware that the organizer holds only EIGHT (8) standad sized OPI polish bottles per row, so if you have all OPI, your organizer will only hold thirty-two (32) bottles of OPI polish.</li>
            <li> Cute and Simple! Fits my needs</li>
            <li> Very good quality and perfect as shown in picture</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  Did I say Beautiful?  Yes!  I love to display my nail polishes in this along with my clear acrylic make-up holder.  They compliment each other.  I accidently brought 2 of these and was getting ready to return but decided it would be a great gift for my sister for her birthday next month.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a plastic container....very sturdy and shipped very well packed.  tku</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my nail polish!! I love that you can see every color.</li>

            <li> This is a great item(s)! I have the manicure part with the rest of my home gel nail equipment and keeps it beautifully organized. Much better than the plastic container I had it all stuffed into. There is plenty of room for everything!  The nail polish section I keep in my bedroom. Polish used to be kept in bathroom closet! Couldn&#x27;t see what I had. Now I can put like colors together and see every polish! Super! Only problem is that there are some empty spaces..lol. Such a problem to have huh? &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Awesome I would order again!</li>
            <li> This holds a bunch of nail polish! Great set! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love them, holds most of my bottles</li>
            <li> I, like the others, found the nail polish caddy fit bottles of most nail polish brands (including OPI, Zoya, Revlon, Finger Paints -though a bit tight, Orly, etc. Because I read the reviews, I knew I&#x27;d want additional storage so I got the accessory container too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to be of sturdy build and nice quality. I think it&#x27;s the perfect set up for polishes, since most polishes are visible but also safe from being knocked over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one complaint, however, and though it&#x27;s not a huge deal and doesn&#x27;t change my rating, I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning. I ordered this via prime and it didn&#x27;t ship til the due date, and arrived two days late without warning or any explanation from the company.  It&#x27;s a first for me. I really was worried about it and was frequently checking the mail until I realized I could track my package. I wouldn&#x27;t order from this company if I was in a big rush to get my items, but I guess this isn&#x27;t something you need in an emergency, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived and was wrapped well enough to protect the items but without wasteful extra wrapping, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Good quality and made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Good quality, and product met expectations.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter for all her nail polish and stuff.....She loved it it&#x27;s already filled up</li>
