            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>love this wig and will order another!&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>It gets tangled easily</li>
            <li>Easy to style or even braid.</li>
            <li>Also, the hair comes out easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and</li>
            <li>For wearing, fine.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t look much like in the photo.</li>
            <li>I like how the bangs fit my face though.</li>
            <li>It came in fast and the quality of the fibers for the hair is nice.</li>
            <li>I love it SO much!</li>
            <li>I wrote back my comment about the product / salesman because I had a good feedback.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I have a slightly larger noggin than most women, but most wigs do fit me regardless.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s not a bad wig for the price.</li>
            <li>Very fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks Cool2Day!!</li>
            <li>The wig cap doesn&#x27;t work so well, but I just got a $2 one at a local beauty and hair store and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty real, but easily tangles.  </li>
            <li>I loved it though, since my hair is really boyish short, the length made me feel really pretty and girly.</li>
            <li>(Bangs are kind of long)</li>
            <li>long no smell cut nicely bang</li>
            <li>For starters, I will say that the wig is very soft and fits on my head comfortably.</li>
            <li>Better off buying human hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted this for a costume, it was supposed to be funny, but it looks like real hair, impresive!</li>
            <li>The part in the top that is to mimic skin is a total joke.</li>
            <li>And, it looks like real hair!</li>
            <li>overall, its ok.</li>
            <li>I feel like this was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li>Looks just like real hair.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels real,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t brush too much because the hair does fall out like you are having a breakdown.</li>
            <li>it is really shiny, and the color is an off-black color.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain for the price I suppose.  </li>
            <li>Wig was double boxed and arrived quickly in 3 biz days.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s NO weird smell.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m really hoping that it&#x27;s of decent quality.</li>
            <li>-they looked natural and framed her face so pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strands look and feel so realistic</li>
            <li>And the fibers are very soft, I couldn&#x27;t stop brushing my fingers through it!</li>
            <li>Ok this is strange but these wigs (we purchased several wigs) worked out well for my 20 year old daughter</li>
            <li>New opinion.&lt;br /&gt;After informing my wig did not come to Brazil, TaoBaoPit contacted me and offered me options to solve the issue of lack of product.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>So soft and realistic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really long, really soft, and looks super natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it was long and soft, and after some work, I styled it to look very pretty.</li>
            <li>Until you get some natural sunlight on it</li>
            <li>Also I am sensitive to the smell and feel of them</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a thick fall of hair, but I was expecting better than this.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman with a big head</li>
            <li>let it cover your eyes a little for that seductive look.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super lightweight and feels like you&#x27;re wearing nothing at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really was a dark brown, definitely NOT a black.</li>
            <li>It has very long strands,silky ,and so soft!</li>
            <li>, the bangs are too long for me, but that can be fixed with styling/cutting, not that I&#x27;d dare do it myself.</li>
            <li>So the expected arrival date for this was actually in mid-February, and I got it on New Year&#x27;s</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So the expected arrival date for this was actually in mid-February, and I got it on New Year&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I had to do the bangs myself, which was pretty hard to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thin even my hair is thicker than this wig.</li>
            <li> The bangs are long, but you can cut it if you want.</li>
            <li> needed a lil work really long</li>
            <li> I only wish it went down a little to cover all possible hair that might show through the back.</li>
            <li> It was super shiny though, and at times looked obviously fake.</li>
            <li> got this because of the long bangs,&lt;br /&gt;you can make it totally cover your eyebrows (because I&#x27;m lazy to do them),&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> After a long day of wearing it I was surprised to feel that the underside was hardly tangled!</li>
            <li> down the street</li>
            <li> The bangs reached down to the bottom of my eyes</li>
            <li> On the down side this wig sheds alot.</li>
            <li> And, it really IS black..</li>
            <li> I used my fingers to comb out a little snag and ended up with a bunch of hair.</li>
            <li> However, there are a few issues.</li>
            <li> and I am really impatiently waiting for it to come to me.</li>
            <li> As a whole, the wig isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> It sits very naturally against my head and it doesn&#x27;t tangle as bad as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared, that this wig,would be unrealistic,or frizzy ,or just too thin..</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s very obvious that it is a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about it</li>
            <li> Worse wig ever.</li>
            <li> However, the bangs are extremely thin and the ends of the wig were cut in a way that makes it look un-natural.</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed because the color was not a jet-black, but rather a dark brown.</li>
            <li> the wig reeked of burnt plastic, so I sprayed it with perfume, which helped a small bit.&lt;br /&gt;the bangs are ridiculously long, and they look terrible with a side part, and the baby hairs look too unrealistic.</li>
            <li> They were difficult for both of us to keep them set on our head but that could just be because we&#x27;re not experienced with them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin.</li>
            <li> Awful sheds unbrlievably, hair all over my house.</li>
            <li> is it sheds a teeny but and smells horrible!</li>
            <li> It looks plastic and has a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> But for me they were awful</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Awful sheds unbrlievably, hair all over my house. Save your money don&#x27;t buy it or from this seller. Worse wig ever. Better off buying human hair.</li>
            <li> looks sooooooooooooooooooooooo cute on picture but it didnt even ship . . so yeah  -  but it may just be my luck</li>
            <li> Looks just like real hair. Beautiful. Fits nicely. The wig cap doesn&#x27;t work so well, but I just got a $2 one at a local beauty and hair store and it works nicely. I feel like this was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. It looks and feels real, almost made my mother think my hair grew over night.  The bangs are long, but you can cut it if you want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute wig, but I don&#x27;t like the cap.it is too big for my head, even with the straps. Maybe they can include elastic in the cap of the wig. Cute anyway, for the price. I will just add a cap and go.</li>
            <li> For starters, I will say that the wig is very soft and fits on my head comfortably. However, the bangs are extremely thin and the ends of the wig were cut in a way that makes it look un-natural. I was also disappointed because the color was not a jet-black, but rather a dark brown. I would recommend Cool2Day&#x27;s party series instead of this. On the upside it got to me within 3 days! Very fast!</li>
            <li> New opinion.&lt;br /&gt;After informing my wig did not come to Brazil, TaoBaoPit contacted me and offered me options to solve the issue of lack of product.&lt;br /&gt;Now they are sending me a new wig with TRACKING CODE, and this is very good, and I&#x27;m waiting for my product.&lt;br /&gt;So I wrote back my comment about the product / salesman because I had a good feedback.&lt;br /&gt;Now, we expect the material ...</li>
            <li> Nice and silky and you you can do a lot of styles.</li>
            <li> So soft and realistic. Worth the money. I only wish it went down a little to cover all possible hair that might show through the back. It really is beautiful. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I had to do the bangs myself, which was pretty hard to do. It gets tangled easily so I&#x27;m not too happy but I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> So the expected arrival date for this was actually in mid-February, and I got it on New Year&#x27;s eve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself is just like in the picture. It&#x27;s really long, really soft, and looks super natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Until you get some natural sunlight on it :/ then it&#x27;s very obvious that it is a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about it is it sheds a teeny but and smells horrible! I think it&#x27;s the skin top doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bangs are too long for me, but that can be fixed with styling/cutting, not that I&#x27;d dare do it myself.</li>
            <li> works the job  as excpected</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a costume, it was supposed to be funny, but it looks like real hair, impresive! (Bangs are kind of long)</li>
            <li> Wouldve gave more stars if it didnt shed so much beautiful wig nice n long no smell cut nicely bang needed a lil work really long n theres no comb but for the price im gonna work it out up n down the street lol lookin fab im gonna b buying this again</li>
            <li> Love this wig! It sits very naturally against my head and it doesn&#x27;t tangle as bad as I was expecting. After a long day of wearing it I was surprised to feel that the underside was hardly tangled! And the fibers are very soft, I couldn&#x27;t stop brushing my fingers through it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for a family member who has hair loss. When i received this item however it looks extremely cheap! The part in the top that is to mimic skin is a total joke. It looks plastic and has a horrible smell. When i got this in the mail the bag was damaged and ripped. I will never purchase from this seller ever again, and i suggest if you are looking to buy a wig put some extra money and go through another company.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels great! Don&#x27;t brush too much because the hair does fall out like you are having a breakdown. I would buy more for my cosplaying!</li>
            <li> I lost this item when I moved out, but it was a good wig! It was super shiny though, and at times looked obviously fake. I loved it though, since my hair is really boyish short, the length made me feel really pretty and girly. Easy to style or even braid. I&#x27;d buy again. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t look much like in the photo. The bangs reached down to the bottom of my eyes and I had to brush them to the side. It really was a dark brown, definitely NOT a black. However, it was long and soft, and after some work, I styled it to look very pretty. Posting pictures soon :)</li>
            <li> I was a little scared, that this wig,would be unrealistic,or frizzy ,or just too thin.. But,it isn&#x27;t AT all! And, it looks like real hair!

Thanks Cool2Day!! :)  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one!!</li>
            <li> This wig took about 4 weeks to get here, which for me, was fine.&lt;br /&gt;The wig came in a bag, not a box. the wig reeked of burnt plastic, so I sprayed it with perfume, which helped a small bit.&lt;br /&gt;the bangs are ridiculously long, and they look terrible with a side part, and the baby hairs look too unrealistic. the length is great and so is the texture. it is really shiny, and the color is an off-black color. overall, its ok.</li>
            <li> I like this wig it&#x27;s good for the price. It came within the 3 days. On the down side this wig sheds alot. I ran my fingers through it and alot came out. It&#x27;s super thin even my hair is thicker than this wig. I like how the bangs fit my face though. If my mother seen this quality wig she&#x27;ll probably smack me.</li>
            <li> I think this is a case of you get what you pay for. As a whole, the wig isn&#x27;t bad. It came in fast and the quality of the fibers for the hair is nice. It&#x27;s a sleek wig and it fits my head no problem, which doesn&#x27;t always happen. However, there are a few issues. It&#x27;s very thin. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a thick fall of hair, but I was expecting better than this. Also, the hair comes out easily. I used my fingers to comb out a little snag and ended up with a bunch of hair. Like I said, it&#x27;s not a bad wig for the price.</li>
            <li> Wig was double boxed and arrived quickly in 3 biz days.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s NO weird smell. It&#x27;s easy to put on and manage.&lt;br /&gt;I got this because of the long bangs,&lt;br /&gt;you can make it totally cover your eyebrows (because I&#x27;m lazy to do them),&lt;br /&gt;and let it cover your eyes a little for that seductive look.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super lightweight and feels like you&#x27;re wearing nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;The strands look and feel so realistic it&#x27;s scary.&lt;br /&gt;A wig cap was included which was nice gift!&lt;br /&gt;I love this wig and will order another!&lt;br /&gt;Get yours today!</li>
            <li> I have a slightly larger noggin than most women, but most wigs do fit me regardless. I had no chances with this one. I ended up giving it to my beautician-friend.</li>
            <li> Ok this is strange but these wigs (we purchased several wigs) worked out well for my 20 year old daughter and they did not look like a Halloween costume on her -they looked natural and framed her face so pretty. But for me they were awful I am an older woman with a big head I guess lol -so I don&#x27;t know why but they looked like a Halloween costume on me.  Also I am sensitive to the smell and feel of them but my daughter didn&#x27;t notice or mind any of it.  They were difficult for both of us to keep them set on our head but that could just be because we&#x27;re not experienced with them.</li>
            <li> Sooooo, I ordered this a while ago and I am really impatiently waiting for it to come to me. Everyone says they&#x27;ve gotten their wigs in 3 days... well, where is mine? I can&#x27;t actually rate the wig itself but I&#x27;ll report back when I get it. Which is soon hopefully. And I&#x27;m really hoping that it&#x27;s of decent quality.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty real, but easily tangles.  Can&#x27;t really complain for the price I suppose.  If you bought it to practice braiding, this is not what you want.  For wearing, fine.</li>
