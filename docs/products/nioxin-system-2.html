            <li> Feels good with a bit of tingle. Leaves hair managable without a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Everything came on time!!!  So easy!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in giood condition and in a timely manner.  I am loading into smaller bottles for use in the shower.  This item is a very good value.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the conditioner</li>
            <li> Product was much more affordable here than at my local store.  I can tell the thinning of my hair has slowed down or stopped.  I&#x27;m not fond of the smell.  It&#x27;s not bad just a little different and my nose is very sensitive that&#x27;s the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  But I got what I ordered and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> These products  are GREAT! My hair feels and looks thicker.  I love the way my scalp feels after using the cleanser and  scalp therapy.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin in the top from over processing, but I am noticing a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;Eva Cooper</li>
            <li> Have been using these combo for years at the recommendation of my hairdresser.  System 2 is for thinning hair.  My hair is still thinning out and am hoping for the day that it will thicken.  Don&#x27;t think it will happen but I will continue to use it dispute the rising cost.  Perhaps I may find something better in the future.</li>
