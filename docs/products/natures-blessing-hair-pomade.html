            <li> I used this product once in the past when I had relaxed hair, an it left me pretty satisfied. Now that I am natural I wanted to give the product yet another try. Moderation is key with this product, but it does what its suppose to be so thats a plus in my book. All in all i&#x27;m still a satisfied customer.</li>

Thankyou Natural Blessing you have truly been a blessing in helping me manage my twist out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the recommendation of a hair care professional.  The instructions say to apply it to the hair.  However, I prefer to apply it to the scalp, which is the reason why I purchased it.  I don&#x27;t have to use a lot in order for my scalp to feel nourished and well-moisturized.  The only thing that I am not overly-fond of is the scent.  But, it is not unbearable for me.</li>
            <li> Love this pomade.  Been using it for years.  It smells nice and is filled with natural oils.  There&#x27;s no petroleum so the consistency is light and it won&#x27;t leave your hair feeling too greasy.  Can use on your skin too.  It lasts me about 4-6 months.    MReed  Phoenix, AZ  [...]</li>
