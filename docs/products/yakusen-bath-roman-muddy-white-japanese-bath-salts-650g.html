            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to take my bath without my nose hurting.la change.</li>

            <li>These are great if you&#x27;ve got family members or roommates who don&#x27;t quite get that whole privacy thing.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand of bath salts (replaces bubble baths)</li>
            <li>I am going to be getting more of these bath salts from Bath Roman.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite bath items.</li>
            <li>prefer a bit of bubbly, so it isn&#x27;t at the top of my list --</li>
            <li>does have a lovely relaxing scent and feels lovely on the skin.</li>
            <li>I would love to have an incense that smells like this</li>
            <li>but indeed it is a pretty good amount (and better be for $17!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Size: The size of the canister is pretty good-</li>
            <li>The product makes you skins feel very silks and the aroma is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it has a wonderfully pleasant scent that it very calming and not perfumy at all.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing and really keeps the water warm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just very strong.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m a huge fan of everything</li>
            <li>The inner ring inside of the lid is supposed to be the perfect amount for a full tub, and I would agree.</li>
            <li>bought this bath powder again excited to be able to use it after a hiatus from baths-</li>
            <li>It smells really strong and almost manly.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitivities to strong perfumes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This new bath powder does NOT smell good.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you that the whole bathroom smells AMAZING when my husband is using them - and the smell lingers.  </li>
            <li>but he said they do indeed leave his skin feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend, Japanese products are the BEST!</li>
            <li>makes a special bath.</li>
            <li>I opened the salts and first reaction was oh that is strong.</li>
            <li>I love this white color/fragrance, but my all time favorite is the &amp;#34;muddy blue&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But even the person who translated it for me said there really wasn&#x27;t a huge difference between the three.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>Finding a product that I can use that does not break me out and meets expectations and exceeds is rare.</li>
            <li>It makes the bath water a cool milky white, which I love.</li>
            <li>If I know I want a nice, long soak</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this product, I&#x27;m more than sure it will last me a long time :)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the effect, although I did the first time...</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the Muddy White bath salts and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to give them as a gift to a fellow bath lover.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have yet to give them a whirl myself, but when I do, I will make sure to have some windows open and a fan on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;1.Smell: at first I was a tiny bit put off by the near-citsry floral smell (not a fan of citrus) but once in the water it melded into a very floral scent that actually comes off as calming- very nice.</li>
            <li>They dissolve easily, and are completely unique (I&#x27;ve never seen or felt anything even remotely close).</li>
            <li>the smell is not overpowering, but strong enough.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very milky, and they really do help trap the heat in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There really isn&#x27;t too much of a difference between the colors except for smell.</li>
            <li>(depending on how much you put it).</li>
            <li>Very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you really must try these bath salts....</li>
            <li>I ordered this expecting it to really \\&quot;muddy up\\&quot; my bathtub.</li>
            <li>remember not to use too much each time.</li>
            <li>I bought these salts for my mother, and she said they are very soothing.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the red one is supposed to be more beneficial for women (although I can&#x27;t remember why)?</li>
            <li>I love the salts, but this box will only last you like 4-5 baths.</li>
            <li>At first the powder floats on the top, then sinks into a cloud of white and spans out into the water by itself.</li>
            <li>then I found these amazing Japanese &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; bath salts (they sounds dirty, but it&#x27;s NOT muddy at all..should be more like &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin I am very leery of everything.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t really care if they make his skin soft</li>
            <li>they are little pricey, but you get what you pay for (and really, how can you set a price an hour of relaxing bliss soaking with these lightly fragrant bath salts (they&#x27;re not feminine, or masculine...very neutral, but relaxing - like an aromatherapy).  </li>
            <li>The salts make the water completely opaque!</li>
            <li>It turned the water a milky white with only a small amount of product, which pleases me use wise.</li>
            <li>no foaming, no clogging, and certainly no messy ring around the tub when you&#x27;re done (like you get with bubble baths).</li>
            <li>No issues with itching, and for those of you who are sensitive to bath products for feminine reasons, no probs there either.</li>
            <li>, my tub has the air bubble feature (not jets, just small holes making the tub look like its at a &amp;#34;rolling boil&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve used these salts with the jets too) and these bath salts work just fine....</li>
            <li>I have a gigantic soaker tub, and I had used various bubble baths for years, but which all left a huge mess in the tub afterwards (and you generally need to rinse the bubbles off yourself in the shower</li>
            <li>It makes the bath water white and almost completely opaque.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is technically cheaper for me to buy these in a store (Mitsuwa near Chicago has them), but since that store is now 4 hours away from me, I consider the $5 increase on here as a shipping cost.</li>
            <li>So the smell was not exactly the same straight out of the can (thank goodness)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;It is technically cheaper for me to buy these in a store (Mitsuwa near Chicago has them), but since that store is now 4 hours away from me, I consider the $5 increase on here as a shipping cost.</li>
            <li> So the smell was not exactly the same straight out of the can (thank goodness)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not say it moisturized my skin, but pampered, less achy after a day doing yard work, and would say skin with my normal use of coconut oil after bath felt silkier.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been wanting to go to an onsen for a long time, but because a trip to Japan isn&#x27;t feasible at the moment I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give this a try</li>
            <li> Also, my skin felt soft as soon as I dried off</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive when it&#x27;s purchase price is almost doubled by shipping costs, but it lasts a long time, and I enjoy the fragrance when soaking on a Saturday morning.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was tired to buying the little sampler pack of Japanese and Chinese bath salts and wanted to get a larger amount.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot less</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t read the can, but someone who could said there are just some little suggestions for muscles, etc.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> like how you end up with irritating salt grains left over at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll grab one of these because they&#x27;ll prolong the heat by at least another 15 minutes or so than my other bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the &amp;#34;milky/muddy white&amp;#34; to start off, and then try some of the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the formula change.</li>
            <li> awful.</li>

            <li> Japanese perfectly mastered the art of relaxing bath. I&#x27;ve never been so relaxed after bathing in my life. I&#x27;ll buy again for sure !!</li>

This stuff will make your bath nice and white- it&#x27;s like taking a milk bath :D (depending on how much you put it). At first the powder floats on the top, then sinks into a cloud of white and spans out into the water by itself. Very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Texture: This salt isn&#x27;t grainy in the water at all :) it&#x27;s not like putting epsom salt into the tub- like how you end up with irritating salt grains left over at the bottom. Nope, it&#x27;s mostly powder like, a bit grainy in appearance but it blends into the water perfectly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Size: The size of the canister is pretty good- I was expecting a lot less but indeed it is a pretty good amount (and better be for $17!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this product, I&#x27;m more than sure it will last me a long time :) Thank you Japan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT****************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this bath powder again excited to be able to use it after a hiatus from baths- and while the seller was excellent and the item came well packaged and fast I realized that the formula for the product had changed. This new bath powder does NOT smell good. It smells really strong and almost manly. It burned my nostrils :(&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but I could tell the formula had changed because the canister changed as well- rather than a regular finish- the canister was metallic- it had the same pattern but it&#x27;s metallic red and orange. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the change was beautiful- but the smell? awful. Very disappointed in the formula change. I&#x27;d post a picture but I gave this away to a friend as soon as I had drained the bath water- I wasn&#x27;t even able to take my bath without my nose hurting.la change.

            <li> These are great if you&#x27;ve got family members or roommates who don&#x27;t quite get that whole privacy thing.  The salts make the water completely opaque!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of bath salts (replaces bubble baths)....I have a gigantic soaker tub, and I had used various bubble baths for years, but which all left a huge mess in the tub afterwards (and you generally need to rinse the bubbles off yourself in the shower afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I found these amazing Japanese &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; bath salts (they sounds dirty, but it&#x27;s NOT muddy at all..should be more like &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34;).  Now I&#x27;m hooked!  They dissolve easily, and are completely unique (I&#x27;ve never seen or felt anything even remotely close). I love this white color/fragrance, but my all time favorite is the &amp;#34;muddy blue&amp;#34;. They sooth muscles and make the water feel dreamy....but they don&#x27;t require rinsing afterwards (I find the diluted salt is good for my skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like soaking in a tub, you really must try these bath salts....they are little pricey, but you get what you pay for (and really, how can you set a price an hour of relaxing bliss soaking with these lightly fragrant bath salts (they&#x27;re not feminine, or masculine...very neutral, but relaxing - like an aromatherapy).  I feel like the Japanese Emperor when I&#x27;m soaking in these salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my tub has the air bubble feature (not jets, just small holes making the tub look like its at a &amp;#34;rolling boil&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve used these salts with the jets too) and these bath salts work just fine....no foaming, no clogging, and certainly no messy ring around the tub when you&#x27;re done (like you get with bubble baths). You can&#x27;t go wrong with the &amp;#34;milky/muddy white&amp;#34; to start off, and then try some of the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting it to really \\&quot;muddy up\\&quot; my bathtub. It didn&#x27;t. Instead, it has a wonderfully pleasant scent that it very calming and not perfumy at all. Also, my skin felt soft as soon as I dried off and I did not even need a moisturizer. A great remedy after a stressful work day. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the effect, although I did the first time... Now I used about 2 table spoons and it works just as well. A bit pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin I am very leery of everything. I read the reviews and no one mentioned break out on any of the bath roman products so I took a chance. I received the item 3 days before date promised. I opened the salts and first reaction was oh that is strong. What I found however was that was not the fact when in tub. It turned the water a milky white with only a small amount of product, which pleases me use wise. The scent was pleasant with undertone of citrus and roses. I would not say it moisturized my skin, but pampered, less achy after a day doing yard work, and would say skin with my normal use of coconut oil after bath felt silkier. No break out after two uses. No issues with itching, and for those of you who are sensitive to bath products for feminine reasons, no probs there either. I am going to be getting more of these bath salts from Bath Roman. Finding a product that I can use that does not break me out and meets expectations and exceeds is rare. This is a treat I shall indulge in often!</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong. remember not to use too much each time.</li>
            <li> I bought these bath salts on a whim. I was tired to buying the little sampler pack of Japanese and Chinese bath salts and wanted to get a larger amount. This is definitely a larger amount. It comes in a cute tin and in my opinion smells great. It makes the bath water a cool milky white, which I love. My only gripe is the price but you DO get a lot for your money. It has a nice lingering scent after you get out of the bath.</li>
            <li> makes a special bath. one of my favorite bath items. feels simple but luxurious. the smell is not overpowering, but strong enough. I like the milky water...</li>
            <li> I love the salts, but this box will only last you like 4-5 baths. Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive when it&#x27;s purchase price is almost doubled by shipping costs, but it lasts a long time, and I enjoy the fragrance when soaking on a Saturday morning.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the Muddy White bath salts and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to give them as a gift to a fellow bath lover.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a bit of bubbly, so it isn&#x27;t at the top of my list -- no fault of the bath salts, I understand that it isn&#x27;t bubbly.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a lovely relaxing scent and feels lovely on the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these bath salts for my husband.  He loves to soak in the tub while reading the newspaper.  I have not personally used these bath salts in the tub but I can tell you that the whole bathroom smells AMAZING when my husband is using them - and the smell lingers.  I would love to have an incense that smells like this so I can fill the house with this smell.  My husband enjoys these salts as well.  He doesn&#x27;t really care if they make his skin soft but he said they do indeed leave his skin feeling silky smooth.  They make a great gift and the tin they come in is decorative and pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought these salts for my mother, and she said they are very soothing.  I have yet to give them a whirl myself, but when I do, I will make sure to have some windows open and a fan on.  They are FRAGRANT.  If you have sensitivities to strong perfumes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just very strong.</li>
