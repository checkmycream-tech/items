            <li>This product is so great!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent service &amp; product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>wonderful product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Good, pliable hold, excellent control, perfect manageability, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make it shiny or waxy looking with great hold.</li>
            <li>Smells great too...</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>Dirt has the BEST smell out of any hair product I have tried, and provides a messier style, and has more separation (which sometimes is unwanted.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the look!  </li>
            <li>great stuff, perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li>Im sure this is good stuff if you know how to use it.</li>
            <li>I tried to warm it between my fingers which didn&#x27;t work too well - I even rubbed and rubbed it between my fingers to try and warm it up.</li>
            <li>you warm it with the hair dryer first?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying it out: I can&#x27;t believe it does not have more reviews and isn&#x27;t more popular.  </li>
            <li>Did not receive 5 stars because it could be more like Jonathan Dirt, with better smell, and feel like it wasn&#x27;t there, but I guess the makers traded that for longer-asting control and humidity resistance.  </li>
            <li>like this way better than products tried, which include:&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product never gets puffy and can allow you to have more sculpted hair-styles, while the FINISH is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trial &amp; error proved this to be the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>my favorite hair gunk of all time.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, too.</li>
            <li>And because I&#x27;d like to find something better than the Kenra #15</li>
            <li>some love it, and others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>some love it, and others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I would love to buy more of this line of styling line.</li>
            <li>Best to apply to dry</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even take a lot and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong in the tub, but fades in the hair.  </li>
            <li>However, this is a fine trade-off for the malleability and control it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Control: 10 - it allows fine hair to be managed and styled perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:</li>
            <li>great for my fine, shorter hair.gives it lift allowing you to actually &amp;#34;put&amp;#34; the hair where you want it.</li>
            <li>I find that description to be accurate -</li>
            <li>Was using the Artec Textureline Material which is no longer available.</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon and it really works terrific and smells great, too!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never dealt with &amp;#34; super waxy&amp;#34; hair products before), but I had to literally use a fingernail to scrape off some &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; because you&#x27;ll never be able to scoop any with your finger tips, and then there is NO WAY you can apply this stuff into your hair right from the jar!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS MOST CERTAINLY</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product has excellent hold (pliable and can be reshaped during the day), but never gets hard.  </li>
            <li>The hold is great, it textures my hair, and maintains a soft natural look after it is applied.</li>
            <li>Great on your hair, I bough this by mistake, wanted the clay and ended up getting the paste, this gives a somewhat of a wet look if applied right.</li>
            <li>First recommended to me by my stylist, who is a gay men&#x27;s barber, so you&#x27;d trust him too, right?</li>
            <li>Good for piecing &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; look hair without looking dry.</li>
            <li>The finish is matte, but not opaque like a clay - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s  more like a natural finish, than matte.  </li>
            <li>had to rate this with 3-stars, because I am not crazy about it and won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product for one use and it will last a good 3-4 months if managed correctly.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my short hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you get it a try!!</li>
            <li>i smear a tiny amount on my palms and mostly just do the crown of my head.  </li>

            <li>It is good to create messy style, with the hair sticking up where/if you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>She really likes it.  </li>
            <li>But it still was very waxy and there was no way to distribute it into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great paste, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>tried Matrix Vavoom hesitantly, as I rarely buy items like this online - if the product really doesn&#x27;t perform properly for me, I will return it, and buying at a store does enable an easier return process.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this on my new shorter hairstyle, but they did not sell it.  </li>
            <li>: 6 - More hold than pomades (but semi-matte/natural finish), less hold than clays and waxes, about the same hold as putties like BedHead Manipulator (but less oily and better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alterna Hemp Concrete (I like the hold and texture of Concrete better, but it builds up and is hard to wash of - see my review for that</li>
            <li>Love it, hard to imagine moving to anything else.</li>
            <li>- I was surprised how well this holds up to humidity -</li>
            <li>will likely keep this product in my arsenal for dressier/more styled and modern hair styles, and use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>for jeans/shorts or any time I desire a natural style.</li>
            <li>not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Can be piled on (re-applied at night, the next day, and the next night, even if you did not wash your hair) without any real buildup.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t take much so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>BedHead Manipulator - barely stands humidity, may spill when travelling&lt;br</li>
            <li>great for that slightly dirty bedhead look!</li>

            <li> But Dirt will eventually get puffy by the end of the day and you cannot use it to style your hair other than looking natural.</li>
            <li> Yes ... a brief heating from the dryer does soften the wax (or could melt it if you left heat on it long enough)</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as usual.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I&#x27;m having a hard time finding it and the price has become way too high.</li>
            <li> Rewind 06 - not impressed at all, too shiny, cheap feeling, chemical smelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I am female, have a very short hair style and have yet to find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; product to make my hair stay piecey, spiky and maintain a little &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; or body the way I&#x27;d like it to for all the years</li>
            <li> It is a manly smell, not necessarily like hair product, and a little musky.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Kenra #15 Working Wax for at least 4 years, as it&#x27;s the only product that suits my purposes, though I would rate it at an 80% satisfaction level for how it performs per MY personal</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak on the specifics of his item, but my husband had me hunt it down after trying a sample.</li>
            <li> : The product could feel a little drier on the hair - some products feel like you have nothing in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Crew Fiber - hard to manipulate, too thick, Grooming Cream - too shiny, not enough</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard and disgusting looking like a styling glue, it won&#x27;t darken your hair or make it have a wet look to it, and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy residue like many other molding pastes.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair bounce without weighing it down!!  </li>
            <li> The hair does feel like it has product in it, but is not greasy, nor does it get hard nor sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through at least 6 or 7 of these tubs now.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and doesn&#x27;t linger after it has been applied either.</li>
            <li> Probably not fair to compare this with Axe products, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m coming from.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gatsby Moving Rubber - hair feels unnatural and hard to wash off, hate the smell</li>
            <li> Hard to Get - hate the smell&lt;</li>
            <li> it clumps hair together (not not on a bad way), and allows you to \\&quot;mold\\&quot; the hair any way you want, with texture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aveda Control Paste - horrible smell, greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Fudge</li>
            <li> Head Men Matte Separation Wax - horrible smell,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works for me very well. I have used it before. Thank You</li>
            <li> A friend of mine swears by this product (says it is the ONLY thing he uses on his hair) and gave me what was left in the tub to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out: I can&#x27;t believe it does not have more reviews and isn&#x27;t more popular.  THIS PRODUCT IS MOST CERTAINLY UNDER-RATED!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is manly, but very non-descript.  It is a manly smell, not necessarily like hair product, and a little musky.  The smell has lemon undertones.  The smell is strong in the tub, but fades in the hair.  It can be slept-in.  Overall, I consider it to be a good smell, although not as good as Jonathan Dirt or Bedhead Manipulator - smell-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has excellent hold (pliable and can be reshaped during the day), but never gets hard.  The finish is matte, but not opaque like a clay - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s  more like a natural finish, than matte.  The hair does feel like it has product in it, but is not greasy, nor does it get hard nor sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product creates texture, but not separation or volume (which to me means puffiness), which I like.  It is described on the label as a \\&quot;molding paste.\\&quot;  I find that description to be accurate - it clumps hair together (not not on a bad way), and allows you to \\&quot;mold\\&quot; the hair any way you want, with texture.  It is good to create messy style, with the hair sticking up where/if you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s texture itself feels, in the hand, like an oily paste, but is not oily in the hair.  Best to apply to dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Makes hair easy to manage, natural finish, hair is not stiff. Can be piled on (re-applied at night, the next day, and the next night, even if you did not wash your hair) without any real buildup. The smell is agreeable and you can sleep on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The product could feel a little drier on the hair - some products feel like you have nothing in your hair.  This can be felt, ut is not gooey, sticky or had.  However, this is a fine trade-off for the malleability and control it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: 6 - More hold than pomades (but semi-matte/natural finish), less hold than clays and waxes, about the same hold as putties like BedHead Manipulator (but less oily and better finish).&lt;br /&gt;Control: 10 - it allows fine hair to be managed and styled perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 7 - Smell if agreeable, manly, and can be slept in.  It is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Washing Out: 8 - washes out easy but does requiere shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use: 10 - no science, just scoop, rub palms together, and apply.&lt;br /&gt;Feel in the hair: 7 - does not feel oily, hardened, or sticky, but you can tell it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;Humidity Resistance: 9 - I was surprised how well this holds up to humidity - no puffiness after the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good, pliable hold, excellent control, perfect manageability, lasts all day. Did not receive 5 stars because it could be more like Jonathan Dirt, with better smell, and feel like it wasn&#x27;t there, but I guess the makers traded that for longer-asting control and humidity resistance.  I used to think only clays could resist humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this way better than products tried, which include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tigi BedHead Manipulator - barely stands humidity, may spill when travelling&lt;br /&gt;Alterna Hemp Concrete (I like the hold and texture of Concrete better, but it builds up and is hard to wash of - see my review for that product)&lt;br /&gt;Aveda Control Paste - horrible smell, greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Fudge Hair Shaper - flakes&lt;br /&gt;Bumble &amp; Bumble SumoTech - not matte enough and only holds 1- 2 hrs&lt;br /&gt;Gatsby Moving Rubber - hair feels unnatural and hard to wash off, hate the smell&lt;br /&gt;BedHead Hard to Get - hate the smell&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax - horrible smell, too thick&lt;br /&gt;Got2B Glued Spiking Glue - won&#x27;t wash off, no texture&lt;br /&gt;Girl/Boy Spank - too oily, no hold, won&#x27;t wash off&lt;br /&gt;American Crew Fiber - hard to manipulate, too thick, Grooming Cream - too shiny, not enough hold - and ost ofthe American Crew line&lt;br /&gt;Redken for Men, Maneuver - yucky looking and feeling&lt;br /&gt;Redken Rewind 06 - not impressed at all, too shiny, cheap feeling, chemical smelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared to Jonathan Dirt, though, I am still undecided.  Dirt has the BEST smell out of any hair product I have tried, and provides a messier style, and has more separation (which sometimes is unwanted.  But Dirt will eventually get puffy by the end of the day and you cannot use it to style your hair other than looking natural. This product never gets puffy and can allow you to have more sculpted hair-styles, while the FINISH is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely keep this product in my arsenal for dressier/more styled and modern hair styles, and use [[ASIN:B000TZJVBK Jonathan Product Dirt Texturizing Paste - 1.7 oz.]] for jeans/shorts or any time I desire a natural style.</li>
            <li> great stuff, perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my short hair. It doesn&#x27;t make it shiny or waxy looking with great hold. The only problem is I&#x27;m having a hard time finding it and the price has become way too high. Unfortunately I will be looking for another product which is more affordable.</li>
            <li> Im sure this is good stuff if you know how to use it. I really dont. Shipping was fast as usual. No problems with the product I just dont really know what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Does not leave your hair greasy!</li>
            <li> Was using the Artec Textureline Material which is no longer available. Trial &amp; error proved this to be the next best thing.  Smells great too...doesn&#x27;t take much so it will last a long time. A micro dab of Chi Silk Infusion mixed with it will add even another dimension!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my new shorter hairstyle, but they did not sell it.  I found it on Amazon and it really works terrific and smells great, too!</li>
            <li> This product is so great!!  It gives my hair bounce without weighing it down!!  I highly recommend you get it a try!!</li>
            <li> My wife got this for her because she cut her hair short.  She really likes it.  I have even ended up using it myself when I feel like cleaning up my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t even take a lot and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair gunk of all time.  i smear a tiny amount on my palms and mostly just do the crown of my head.  great for that slightly dirty bedhead look!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak on the specifics of his item, but my husband had me hunt it down after trying a sample. He loves it and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I am female, have a very short hair style and have yet to find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; product to make my hair stay piecey, spiky and maintain a little &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; or body the way I&#x27;d like it to for all the years I&#x27;ve worn my hair super-short. I&#x27;ve tried many products, too. I have been using Kenra #15 Working Wax for at least 4 years, as it&#x27;s the only product that suits my purposes, though I would rate it at an 80% satisfaction level for how it performs per MY personal criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Matrix Vavoom hesitantly, as I rarely buy items like this online - if the product really doesn&#x27;t perform properly for me, I will return it, and buying at a store does enable an easier return process. Anyway, I decided to try it based on various reviews and purchased through Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally. And because I&#x27;d like to find something better than the Kenra #15 I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to rate this with 3-stars, because I am not crazy about it and won&#x27;t be buying it again. What turns me off about it first and foremost is that it has a consistency very close to candle wax! Maybe it&#x27;s me (I&#x27;ve never dealt with &amp;#34; super waxy&amp;#34; hair products before), but I had to literally use a fingernail to scrape off some &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; because you&#x27;ll never be able to scoop any with your finger tips, and then there is NO WAY you can apply this stuff into your hair right from the jar! I tried to warm it between my fingers which didn&#x27;t work too well - I even rubbed and rubbed it between my fingers to try and warm it up. But it still was very waxy and there was no way to distribute it into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mentioning this to my hair stylist, she said, &amp;#34;Did you warm it with the hair dryer first?&amp;#34; No, I didn&#x27;t - didn&#x27;t even think about that option! So, the next day I tried it. Yes ... a brief heating from the dryer does soften the wax (or could melt it if you left heat on it long enough) and then you can more easily get a little out of the jar, but what a hassle. I don&#x27;t always need to use a hair dryer, so just to get  it out to soften this stuff to enable it to be worked into my hair doesn&#x27;t thrill me. Once melted, I could distribute it into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the smell ... to me, it&#x27;s an aroma that I would expect in a mens product. Maybe Vavoom is geared to men? Plus, I could continue to smell it throughout the day. I don&#x27;t like constantly detecting the aroma of my hair products, especially not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, yes, it will keep your hair in a &amp;#34;stiffer&amp;#34; condition and I don&#x27;t see it losing it&#x27;s hold throughout the day. It has a waxy feeling in the hair, too. And I did find it dulled my hair a bit too, which is something else I don&#x27;t like in a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ... some love it, and others don&#x27;t. Your mileage may vary from mine. ;)he jar, but what a hassle.

            <li> Excellent service &amp; product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Good for piecing &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; look hair without looking dry.</li>
            <li> Great paste, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the look!  Great product. I would love to buy more of this line of styling line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this brand. Great on your hair, I bough this by mistake, wanted the clay and ended up getting the paste, this gives a somewhat of a wet look if applied right.</li>
            <li> Probably not fair to compare this with Axe products, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m coming from. I&#x27;ve gone through at least 6 or 7 of these tubs now. First recommended to me by my stylist, who is a gay men&#x27;s barber, so you&#x27;d trust him too, right? This stuff leaves your hair non-greasy, non-shiny, but has all day hold. Love it, hard to imagine moving to anything else.</li>
            <li> great for my fine, shorter hair.gives it lift allowing you to actually &amp;#34;put&amp;#34; the hair where you want it. not heavy or greasy. wonderful product. wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> I use this molding paste every day and for various styles. The hold is great, it textures my hair, and maintains a soft natural look after it is applied. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard and disgusting looking like a styling glue, it won&#x27;t darken your hair or make it have a wet look to it, and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy residue like many other molding pastes. I use it when I have short hair, for a faux-hawk or when my hair grows out and I want to maintain and keep it from blowing in the wind. The smell is subtle and doesn&#x27;t linger after it has been applied either. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years and can&#x27;t imagine going out without it. It doesn&#x27;t take much product for one use and it will last a good 3-4 months if managed correctly.</li>
