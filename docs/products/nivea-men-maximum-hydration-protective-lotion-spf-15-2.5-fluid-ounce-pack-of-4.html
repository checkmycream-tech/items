            <li>Really good</li>

            <li>Makes me feel good in the morning.</li>

            <li>It soothes my skin  and smells good which is a plus.</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Also good to use it in the summer since it has a SPF 15 in it to protect your face from the sun</li>
            <li>Since I am not in the sun all day, it might not be good the beach all day, but it protects me from the florescent lights overhead all day.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product after switching from Neutrogena.</li>

            <li>Has kind of a sporty smell.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion.</li>

            <li>It is good to me, I will buy it again when I use up, hope there are more likewise activity</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be light and pleasant, unlike the shaving balm which does have a stronger fragrance</li>
            <li>Pretty fantastic, lightweight feeling, smells nice, great product!</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, very light.</li>
            <li>Nivea does a great job with this product and it is fairly inexpensive with free Super Saver Shipping from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but it turns out that the smell is very very light.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for many years but was just happy this time to be able to buy it at buck at such great savings.</li>
            <li>runniness.&lt;br /&gt;I find the aroma pleasant and NOT overpowering when the right amount of product is applied.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not as overwhelming as some people say, it goes away after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was told by my dermatologist that I should have SPF 15 or greater in my moisturizer to protect my skin (as I write this review</li>
            <li>; but it&#x27;s better than none, which is what I used to wear every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can feel it throughout most of the day.      </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>Keep face glowing and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>subscription price on the four pack beats the best price I would find at my local drug stores and</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Seems like it provides much more protection than the 15 factor it advertises ...</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>thanks, Amazon, for continuing to carry this great after shave product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and so does my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I used to love Nivea for Men face lotion, but I think they must have changed their formula.</li>
            <li>Amazon has to do a better job describing these things.</li>
            <li>I love the protection</li>
            <li>Buying these in bulk on Amazon is a nobrainer and money saver :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>will buy again when more is needed.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion for my face.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Women seem to love the light fragrance and softness it brings to my face.</li>
            <li>I love this Light weight non greasy protective lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells great, and it offers some protection from the sun,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make me want to wash my face after putting it on.</li>
            <li>I like it, smells alright, smears and spreads easily and relieves my skin tightness all day.</li>
            <li>This skin cream, SPF 15, is so easy to apply and the smell isn&#x27;t over-powering</li>
            <li>It smells too strong.</li>
            <li>Great lotion to keep your face feeling good on these dry winter days that tend to zap the moisture right out of your skin.</li>
            <li>is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, does what it says it will, and cheap.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job</li>
            <li>It hydrates your face and makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It also keeps his skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product for regular use and after shave.</li>
            <li>Its worth a try for sure.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on evenly and dries without leaving your face greasy, but it smells like cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clot up and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great, with sunscreen, but I can&#x27;t ever find it locally.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy ...</li>
            <li>The old stuff was thicker and drier, if that makes sense, and my skin loved it.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for years and it is good for sensitive skin and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>A modest amount is fine, but it needs to be massaged deeply into the skin, for best reults.  </li>
            <li>actually used it as a hand/face moisturizer and it worked amazing!</li>
            <li>Its pretty okay.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as their Q10 lotion but definitely much cheaper and can be used for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li>Has a nice subtle scent, works great for post shave too.</li>
            <li>Good daily lotion with sunblock!</li>
            <li>This is true about \\&quot;runniness,\\&quot; too.  </li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs very well and I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li>Good product overall  </li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy, has a nice masculine scent that is not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for years, and can only find it on line, since stores no longer carry it.&lt;br /&gt;Great for after shave, and good sun protection too.</li>
            <li>The original version was light and pleasant -- this new formulation&#x27;s fragrance is nearly non-existent.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple; goes on easy, absorbs quickly, contains SPF and pleasant mild smell.</li>
            <li>Plus the lotion is SPF15 for mild sun protection.</li>
            <li>However in doing so you&#x27;ll run out quickly.</li>
            <li>Compared to  more high end brands, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin quickly, and leaves no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Using this lotion in combo with the balm soothes my skin after shaving, keeps the dry patches away, smells good.</li>
            <li>So I got a sample of this from Target, it really helped to keep my skin smooth and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If the correct amount is used it is absorbed and does not run.  </li>
            <li>If the SPF proves to hold up I would give this a 5 star rating.  </li>
            <li>It does double duty as my daily face, neck and ear sunscreen plus it has a pleasant scent that doubles as a very mild cologne.</li>
            <li>It should be applied when the facial skin is still supple after a shower, or slightly damp, for best absorbtion and protection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for the last several years and it&#x27;s always done a great job for me.  </li>
            <li>but I mostly use Nivea&#x27;s sensitive skin shave balm when I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to get much sun).  </li>
            <li>Last time I had a facial my therapist told me my skin looked great.</li>
            <li>is not only adds a bit of sunscreen (helpful for pale people like me), but is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>I actually like it WAY more.</li>
            <li>- this is my first after 55 years on this earth.</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased the Nivea Essential Protection Lotion is because it provides better comfort after shaving than their shaving balm.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin pretty shiny or oily though.</li>
            <li>addition, there exist many concerns regarding the human body’s percutaneous absorption of Oxybenzone.</li>
            <li>&amp; I am glad to have found this deeply discounted price on Amazon.com .</li>
            <li>I use this after the shower and my skin feels \\&quot;young\\&quot; and heavy (in a good way).  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>4-pack is actually kind of nice, even though a little of this stuff goes a long way, having one in my travel bag, another in the bathroom, and a couple under the sink</li>
            <li>Best product for men with sensitive skin, no breakout or irritating rash after use.</li>
            <li>so I do get positive comments when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent low cost alternative to other lux brand men&#x27;s moisturizers - could do with a larger size!</li>
            <li>It never clogs pores and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need that much and it spreads well.</li>
            <li>Convenient and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>A much cheaper alternative</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>I use Nivea men face products and really like them.</li>
            <li>As a photocarcinogen, it has demonstrated an increase in the production of harmful free radicals and an ability to attack DNA cells; for this reason, it is believed to be a contributing factor in the recent rise of Melanoma cases with sunscreen users.</li>
            <li>High recommendation from me!</li>
            <li>The 15 SPF is great and does its job except as long as you&#x27;re not swimming or in direct sun for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about the smell, but overall I&#x27;ve found it great.</li>
            <li>In general I really love Nivea lotions as I find them to last on my skin and leave it smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The newer formulation still smells great (very subtle, but my fiance loves it)</li>
            <li>This so far has been exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many lotions on my face and they tend to cause black heads and pimples even though I&#x27;m beyond the age of that.</li>
            <li>better than more expensive stuff like kiehl&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I go back and forth between this product and the Neutrogena equivalent, but Nivea is typically a much better price for a larger quantity.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, it is scented but not too over powering.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for like 10 years and my face looks pretty much the same</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily, is not at all runny, and I really like the light scent.  </li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas where it is dry and hot!</li>
            <li>What I have found in the past is that most of them leave and oily feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li>(I was a bit worried it would as I have clear skin).</li>
            <li>This product has lasted me 6 months so far</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount to moisturize and your skin will feel moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li>Not a strong scent, very useful.</li>
            <li>Lastly it provides decent UV</li>
            <li>Consistently one of the best face lotions without spending an outrageous amount of cash for it.</li>
            <li>I realize that it states SPF15 on it, but the main part of the description was mainly facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy any other lotion as long as this one is available.</li>
            <li>This stuff is not too bad, but you really need to apply it twice to get a good effect.</li>
            <li>Basically I&#x27;m using my daily post-shave routine to help avoid sun damage without really taking extra time or forgetting to put on sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Has a slight fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I barely can.</li>
            <li>I had some problems with dry skin and rosacea, particularly in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose and can really get triggered by heavy fragrances as far as sneezing and such but no problems here.</li>
            <li>After the shower, I first use witch hazel, then splash a little water on my face, then put this on.  </li>
            <li>but if I use it multiple days in a row it makes me break out a little, especially if i apply right after shaving.</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Also good to use it in the summer since it has a SPF 15 in it to protect your face from the sun</li>
            <li> Since I am not in the sun all day, it might not be good the beach all day, but it protects me from the florescent lights overhead all day.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice non-greasy feel with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product after switching from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> , light scent smells great</li>
            <li> the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> nice lotion with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy, nice aroma, SPF 15,</li>
            <li> Product is nice.  </li>
            <li> Has kind of a sporty smell.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s handy to use whenever I feel the need to block some rays or perhaps just refresh my face a bit.</li>
            <li> It is good to me, I will buy it again when I use up, hope there are more likewise activity</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be light and pleasant, unlike the shaving balm which does have a stronger fragrance</li>
            <li> Pretty fantastic, lightweight feeling, smells nice, great product!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, very light.</li>
            <li> Nivea does a great job with this product and it is fairly inexpensive with free Super Saver Shipping from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but it turns out that the smell is very very light.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for many years but was just happy this time to be able to buy it at buck at such great savings.</li>
            <li> runniness.&lt;br /&gt;I find the aroma pleasant and NOT overpowering when the right amount of product is applied.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not as overwhelming as some people say, it goes away after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was told by my dermatologist that I should have SPF 15 or greater in my moisturizer to protect my skin (as I write this review</li>
            <li> ; but it&#x27;s better than none, which is what I used to wear every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can feel it throughout most of the day.      </li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> Keep face glowing and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> subscription price on the four pack beats the best price I would find at my local drug stores and</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Seems like it provides much more protection than the 15 factor it advertises ...</li>
            <li> Refreshing.</li>
            <li> thanks, Amazon, for continuing to carry this great after shave product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and so does my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I used to love Nivea for Men face lotion, but I think they must have changed their formula.</li>
            <li> Amazon has to do a better job describing these things.</li>
            <li> I love the protection</li>
            <li> Buying these in bulk on Amazon is a nobrainer and money saver :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li> will buy again when more is needed.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion for my face.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Women seem to love the light fragrance and softness it brings to my face.</li>
            <li> I love this Light weight non greasy protective lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells great, and it offers some protection from the sun,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make me want to wash my face after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I like it, smells alright, smears and spreads easily and relieves my skin tightness all day.</li>
            <li> This skin cream, SPF 15, is so easy to apply and the smell isn&#x27;t over-powering</li>
            <li> It smells too strong.</li>
            <li> Great lotion to keep your face feeling good on these dry winter days that tend to zap the moisture right out of your skin.</li>
            <li> is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, does what it says it will, and cheap.</li>
            <li> It does a fine job</li>
            <li> It hydrates your face and makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It also keeps his skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product for regular use and after shave.</li>
            <li> Its worth a try for sure.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on evenly and dries without leaving your face greasy, but it smells like cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clot up and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great, with sunscreen, but I can&#x27;t ever find it locally.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy ...</li>
            <li> The old stuff was thicker and drier, if that makes sense, and my skin loved it.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years and it is good for sensitive skin and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> A modest amount is fine, but it needs to be massaged deeply into the skin, for best reults.  </li>
            <li> actually used it as a hand/face moisturizer and it worked amazing!</li>
            <li> Its pretty okay.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as their Q10 lotion but definitely much cheaper and can be used for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Has a nice subtle scent, works great for post shave too.</li>
            <li> Good daily lotion with sunblock!</li>
            <li> This is true about \\&quot;runniness,\\&quot; too.  </li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs very well and I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li> Good product overall  </li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy, has a nice masculine scent that is not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for years, and can only find it on line, since stores no longer carry it.&lt;br /&gt;Great for after shave, and good sun protection too.</li>
            <li> The original version was light and pleasant -- this new formulation&#x27;s fragrance is nearly non-existent.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple; goes on easy, absorbs quickly, contains SPF and pleasant mild smell.</li>
            <li> Plus the lotion is SPF15 for mild sun protection.</li>
            <li> However in doing so you&#x27;ll run out quickly.</li>
            <li> Compared to  more high end brands, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin quickly, and leaves no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Using this lotion in combo with the balm soothes my skin after shaving, keeps the dry patches away, smells good.</li>
            <li> So I got a sample of this from Target, it really helped to keep my skin smooth and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If the correct amount is used it is absorbed and does not run.  </li>
            <li> If the SPF proves to hold up I would give this a 5 star rating.  </li>
            <li> It does double duty as my daily face, neck and ear sunscreen plus it has a pleasant scent that doubles as a very mild cologne.</li>
            <li> It should be applied when the facial skin is still supple after a shower, or slightly damp, for best absorbtion and protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for the last several years and it&#x27;s always done a great job for me.  </li>
            <li> but I mostly use Nivea&#x27;s sensitive skin shave balm when I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to get much sun).  </li>
            <li> Last time I had a facial my therapist told me my skin looked great.</li>
            <li> is not only adds a bit of sunscreen (helpful for pale people like me), but is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I actually like it WAY more.</li>
            <li> - this is my first after 55 years on this earth.</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased the Nivea Essential Protection Lotion is because it provides better comfort after shaving than their shaving balm.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin pretty shiny or oily though.</li>
            <li> addition, there exist many concerns regarding the human body’s percutaneous absorption of Oxybenzone.</li>
            <li> &amp; I am glad to have found this deeply discounted price on Amazon.com .</li>
            <li> I use this after the shower and my skin feels \\&quot;young\\&quot; and heavy (in a good way).  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> 4-pack is actually kind of nice, even though a little of this stuff goes a long way, having one in my travel bag, another in the bathroom, and a couple under the sink</li>
            <li> Best product for men with sensitive skin, no breakout or irritating rash after use.</li>
            <li> so I do get positive comments when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Excellent low cost alternative to other lux brand men&#x27;s moisturizers - could do with a larger size!</li>
            <li> It never clogs pores and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need that much and it spreads well.</li>
            <li> Convenient and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> A much cheaper alternative</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> I use Nivea men face products and really like them.</li>
            <li> As a photocarcinogen, it has demonstrated an increase in the production of harmful free radicals and an ability to attack DNA cells; for this reason, it is believed to be a contributing factor in the recent rise of Melanoma cases with sunscreen users.</li>
            <li> High recommendation from me!</li>
            <li> The 15 SPF is great and does its job except as long as you&#x27;re not swimming or in direct sun for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about the smell, but overall I&#x27;ve found it great.</li>
            <li> In general I really love Nivea lotions as I find them to last on my skin and leave it smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The newer formulation still smells great (very subtle, but my fiance loves it)</li>
            <li> This so far has been exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many lotions on my face and they tend to cause black heads and pimples even though I&#x27;m beyond the age of that.</li>
            <li> better than more expensive stuff like kiehl&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between this product and the Neutrogena equivalent, but Nivea is typically a much better price for a larger quantity.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, it is scented but not too over powering.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for like 10 years and my face looks pretty much the same</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily, is not at all runny, and I really like the light scent.  </li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas where it is dry and hot!</li>
            <li> What I have found in the past is that most of them leave and oily feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li> (I was a bit worried it would as I have clear skin).</li>
            <li> This product has lasted me 6 months so far</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount to moisturize and your skin will feel moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li> Not a strong scent, very useful.</li>
            <li> Lastly it provides decent UV</li>
            <li> Consistently one of the best face lotions without spending an outrageous amount of cash for it.</li>
            <li> I realize that it states SPF15 on it, but the main part of the description was mainly facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy any other lotion as long as this one is available.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not too bad, but you really need to apply it twice to get a good effect.</li>
            <li> Basically I&#x27;m using my daily post-shave routine to help avoid sun damage without really taking extra time or forgetting to put on sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Has a slight fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I barely can.</li>
            <li> I had some problems with dry skin and rosacea, particularly in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose and can really get triggered by heavy fragrances as far as sneezing and such but no problems here.</li>
            <li> After the shower, I first use witch hazel, then splash a little water on my face, then put this on.  </li>
            <li> but if I use it multiple days in a row it makes me break out a little, especially if i apply right after shaving.</li>
            <li> so no complaints other than the days I have to wait for this to clear up again.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like how thick this was compared to my last lotion, but after using it for a while</li>
            <li> This is not available in the local stores where I live.</li>
            <li> I typically use it after I shave and after I&#x27;ve used the Nivea double action balm.</li>
            <li> Not oily, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Scent does not last long so nobody is offended.  </li>
            <li> Why is it that every lotion I try for dry facial skin, it ends up being sunscreen?</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a few days until it cleared up, then tried it again today with the same results, only the rash came back the same day.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t stink and it certainly won&#x27;t clash with any cologne I choose to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the winter months, the Nivea Q10 is a better choice for me as a cold weather moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this and was pleasantly surprised when i  received 4 small individual bottles.</li>
            <li> Each tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way, too..</li>
            <li> Have been looking for something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of this product for a long time, but fell out of using it in favor of Nivea&#x27;s Q10 lotion for men.</li>
            <li> I have not had this issue with any other spray or lotion sunscreen on my face, nor with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Men&#x27;s Expert Vita Lift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Moisturizer, a similar product I was using before trying this Nivea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had noticed my face was getting rather dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> seems to be dry cream.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be rubbing for a while to get the lotion dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product nearly every day for the past 5 or so years.</li>
            <li> , you can wet your face slightly, like get your hands a little wet and rub your face, and then put this on, it will do your whole face with even less product.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado where we can get some serious lack of humidity which tends to cause quite a bit of dry skin.</li>
            <li> But, of course, you can use it year round for daily skin care.</li>
            <li> After using this for just a few days, I broke out in a red, itchy rash all over my face.</li>
            <li> little seems to go a long ways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the other reviewers about the aroma and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or sweat like other lotions do.</li>
            <li> Should Include the Active Ingredients in the description, I would not have purchased:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does smell slightly like sunscreen, and ever so slightly like a Nivea Men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product works well to moisturize my skin as well as provide a little bit of protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  </li>
            <li> I went through all 4 of the little 2.5oz bottles in just over a month.</li>
            <li> The wind and cold can really sap your skin of moisture and this lotion helps restore it.</li>
            <li> Few aftershaves also contain SPF.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about too heavy of a fragrance</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve used it everyday.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> Very little fragrance (almost none)</li>
            <li> I put lotion on every time I get out of the shower on the rest of my body, I am not sure why I have not been putting lotion on my face as well.</li>
            <li> This one is small and compact, but you get like 4 in this order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small tube</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Not every store has it so sometimes it can be hard to find, but I stock up when I do.</li>
            <li> You must use lots of face lotion, and this has hardly any scent, and also provides spf15 protection.  </li>
            <li> I get at least 4 months per tube.</li>
            <li> So while it might seem expensive, a 4 pack is going to give you a year and half to 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to wear sunscreen every day and don&#x27;t want to use an expensive product which would prevent me from doing so.</li>
            <li> SPF15, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy/oily like sunscreen - and has glycerin in it, so my face doesn&#x27;t get nasty and cracked when I&#x27;m out skiing or winter hiking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in Colorado where we can get some serious lack of humidity which tends to cause quite a bit of dry skin. I put lotion on every time I get out of the shower on the rest of my body, I am not sure why I have not been putting lotion on my face as well. Chalk it up to being a guy and not thinking I needed to. I purchased this because I had noticed my face was getting rather dry in the winter. I put it on before I go to bed and sometimes in the morning. It does not cause my face to break out (I was a bit worried it would as I have clear skin). The scent is not as overwhelming as some people say, it goes away after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many lotions on my face and they tend to cause black heads and pimples even though I&#x27;m beyond the age of that. This lotion however does not. I have been using it for about 2 years and it&#x27;s great. Highly recommend it, it is scented but not too over powering.</li>
            <li> Good daily lotion with sunblock!</li>
            <li> The UV index is going up in Austin and this is my go to daily protection for face and neck. But, of course, you can use it year round for daily skin care. I have used this product for years because it does not have, to me, a discernible scent. It never clogs pores and absorbs very well. It hydrates your face and makes your skin smooth. I get fewer nicks and cuts when shaving if I remember to use it. Lastly it provides decent UV protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a good value. Each tube lasts a long time. You don&#x27;t need that much and it spreads well. I get at least 4 months per tube. So while it might seem expensive, a 4 pack is going to give you a year and half to 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for the last several years and it&#x27;s always done a great job for me.  As a redhead in Arizona I was told by my dermatologist that I should have SPF 15 or greater in my moisturizer to protect my skin (as I write this review it is 115+ degrees outside).  Melanoma also runs in my family so sun block is a necessity almost the moment I leave the house.  Nivea does a great job with this product and it is fairly inexpensive with free Super Saver Shipping from Amazon.  Five stars all the way!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like how thick this was compared to my last lotion, but after using it for a while I actually like it WAY more. It seems to help my face stay hydrated for way longer.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the other reviewers about the aroma and runniness.&lt;br /&gt;I find the aroma pleasant and NOT overpowering when the right amount of product is applied.  Don&#x27;t overapply ! A modest amount is fine, but it needs to be massaged deeply into the skin, for best reults.  This is true about \\&quot;runniness,\\&quot; too.  If the correct amount is used it is absorbed and does not run.  It should be applied when the facial skin is still supple after a shower, or slightly damp, for best absorbtion and protection.</li>
            <li> Best product for men with sensitive skin, no breakout or irritating rash after use. Absorbs without leaving oily greasy skin. It&#x27;s all I use, in my bathroom drawer,travel bag and gym bag. Nivea is with me daily wherever life takes me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product after switching from Neutrogena. This product doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen (like the Neutrogena equivalent does). It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make me want to wash my face after putting it on. Compared to  more high end brands, you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;d like to wear sunscreen every day and don&#x27;t want to use an expensive product which would prevent me from doing so.</li>
            <li> nice lotion with sunscreen.  better than more expensive stuff like kiehl&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Convenient and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Update: After using this for just a few days, I broke out in a red, itchy rash all over my face. I stopped using it for a few days until it cleared up, then tried it again today with the same results, only the rash came back the same day. If not for this issue, I had given it a five star rating, but now I must downgrade my rating. I have not had this issue with any other spray or lotion sunscreen on my face, nor with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Men&#x27;s Expert Vita Lift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Moisturizer, a similar product I was using before trying this Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is great to work with on returns so no complaints other than the days I have to wait for this to clear up again. I will try amazon.com/Eucerin-Anti-Wrinkle-Sensitive-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B00005B9FV next...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: The scent is very subtle. It does smell slightly like sunscreen, and ever so slightly like a Nivea Men&#x27;s fragrance. My wife said she &amp;#34;couldn&#x27;t smell anything&amp;#34; after I used it. I barely can. At least it doesn&#x27;t stink and it certainly won&#x27;t clash with any cologne I choose to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I use it after shaving and I use it on my face, nose, neck, ears... Basically I&#x27;m using my daily post-shave routine to help avoid sun damage without really taking extra time or forgetting to put on sunscreen. It&#x27;s SPF 15 and it might not last &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s better than none, which is what I used to wear every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little seems to go a long ways. If you aren&#x27;t using it for the SPF and you just want to help treat your skin after all the effects of shaving, you can wet your face slightly, like get your hands a little wet and rub your face, and then put this on, it will do your whole face with even less product.</li>
            <li> After being told by the doctor to start using sunscreen regularly, I found this stuff. SPF15, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy/oily like sunscreen - and has glycerin in it, so my face doesn&#x27;t get nasty and cracked when I&#x27;m out skiing or winter hiking. Goes on easy, does what it says it will, and cheap. How can you beat that? Great product. 4-pack is actually kind of nice, even though a little of this stuff goes a long way, having one in my travel bag, another in the bathroom, and a couple under the sink so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This product works well to moisturize my skin as well as provide a little bit of protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  I have never been one to use any skin care products - this is my first after 55 years on this earth.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple; goes on easy, absorbs quickly, contains SPF and pleasant mild smell.</li>
            <li> Not a strong scent, very useful. Recommend this utilitarian, man product. Works well while chopping wood or working on the car.</li>
            <li> I use this after the shower and my skin feels \\&quot;young\\&quot; and heavy (in a good way).  After the shower, I first use witch hazel, then splash a little water on my face, then put this on.  I don&#x27;t think it matters whether you&#x27;ve shaven or not.  I don&#x27;t shave every day but it also makes a great balm (but I mostly use Nivea&#x27;s sensitive skin shave balm when I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to get much sun).  It absorbs easily, is not at all runny, and I really like the light scent.  I only put it on in the morning but I can feel it throughout most of the day.      I wrote this review after looking out of curiosity for similar products and saw their prices.  I&#x27;ll happily stick with this.</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased the Nivea Essential Protection Lotion is because it provides better comfort after shaving than their shaving balm. Since it is a moisturizer, it does just that without the alcohol sting of the shaving balm. Plus the lotion is SPF15 for mild sun protection. I found the scent to be light and pleasant, unlike the shaving balm which does have a stronger fragrance and I did receive comments about it&#x27;s scent. Lastly, online seems to be the only place to find this product as it has been removed from the shelves every retail drugstore where I used to buy it. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He loves it and I like that it protects him from the sun.  It also keeps his skin smooth. I wish it came in jug size!</li>
            <li> Excellent low cost alternative to other lux brand men&#x27;s moisturizers - could do with a larger size!</li>
            <li> Great Product and wonderful aroma...</li>
            <li> Very little fragrance (almost none), it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin quickly, and leaves no greasy feeling. It goes a long way, too..</li>
            <li> I love the product but I was only delivered 3 not four like the seller claims. This review is about 3 months after the product was delivered. The holiday season was so hectic so I&#x27;m just getting around to addressing some of the lesser considerations; buyer be ware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ED</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. Not oily, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to use as an after shave balm or as a moisturizer and the SPF-15 sun protection is a bonus. Women seem to love the light fragrance and softness it brings to my face.</li>
            <li> Great product for regular use and after shave. Using since last 6 years. Keep face glowing and healthy looking. Really good</li>
            <li> This is the cream which leaves white powder when applied.. i don&#x27;t recommend this.. seems to be dry cream. do&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about 10 years now. I typically use it after I shave and after I&#x27;ve used the Nivea double action balm. I had some problems with dry skin and rosacea, particularly in the winter. Using this lotion in combo with the balm soothes my skin after shaving, keeps the dry patches away, smells good. I also like using a spf daily, even it is only 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subscription price on the four pack beats the best price I would find at my local drug stores and the expiration date on the product was a good 20 months out from the time I purchased it. Overall, a good product at a good price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, lightweight, and with a pleasant but not-too-strong scent.  The 15 SPF is great and does its job except as long as you&#x27;re not swimming or in direct sun for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this Light weight non greasy protective lotion. Have been looking for something like this for a long time. This is not available in the local stores where I live. Would buy it again</li>
            <li> This so far has been exactly what I was looking for.  A face lotion that feels like a lotion and has SPF in it.  What I have found in the past is that most of them leave and oily feeling on the skin.  What I don&#x27;t know yet is how well the SPF works.  As a lotion it is very good and I plan to use it daily.  If the SPF proves to hold up I would give this a 5 star rating.  Its worth a try for sure.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff every day for 10 years--have tried them all ---this  is the best.  Non greasy, doesn&#x27;t sting if you get some in your eyes, good sunscreen, light scent smells great</li>
            <li> Best face cream you can buy!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price on this stock up on it!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to any one that is looking for a face cream that has some spf and is great for your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for like 10 years and my face looks pretty much the same so... it works.</li>
            <li> Consistently one of the best face lotions without spending an outrageous amount of cash for it. It absorbs well, especially considering the included sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or sweat like other lotions do.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about the smell, but overall I&#x27;ve found it great. Plus, with the multi-pack its honestly a great deal. I&#x27;ve tried a handful of different face lotions and I like this the best.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Few aftershaves also contain SPF.  This one fits the bill.  A much cheaper alternative that Kehl&#x27;s.  So if you aren&#x27;t on a Kehl&#x27;s budget -- this is a must-have.  Relief after shaving + quality SPF protection.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, nice aroma, SPF 15, what&#x27;s not to like. I get it in bulk and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about too heavy of a fragrance but it turns out that the smell is very very light. I have a very sensitive nose and can really get triggered by heavy fragrances as far as sneezing and such but no problems here. The lotion absorbs very well and I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li> My husband uses this daily and could not be happier.  Everyone should use sunscreen and hydrate the skin.  This does both.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! In general I really love Nivea lotions as I find them to last on my skin and leave it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This is not only adds a bit of sunscreen (helpful for pale people like me), but is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on evenly and dries without leaving your face greasy, but it smells like cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face treatments for men! Non oily ... Non greasy. Seems like it provides much more protection than the 15 factor it advertises ... I often use only this when spending several hours on my Harley Davidson (no helmet law here in Colorado)</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! The smell, the moisturizing, everything about it!&lt;br /&gt;I actually used it as a hand/face moisturizer and it worked amazing! However in doing so you&#x27;ll run out quickly. I went through all 4 of the little 2.5oz bottles in just over a month. If you just want to test it out, or want a portable bottle, this is great! However, if you want something to keep at home, get a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product and value</li>
            <li> I was a fan of this product for a long time, but fell out of using it in favor of Nivea&#x27;s Q10 lotion for men. I decided to give it another try, but was dismayed that the fragrance has been changed. The original version was light and pleasant -- this new formulation&#x27;s fragrance is nearly non-existent. All in all, it suits my skin for warmer, milder temperatures. For the winter months, the Nivea Q10 is a better choice for me as a cold weather moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff in the morning after shaving.  Doesn&#x27;t clot up and goes on smooth.  Refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It does double duty as my daily face, neck and ear sunscreen plus it has a pleasant scent that doubles as a very mild cologne.</li>
            <li> Great, with sunscreen, but I can&#x27;t ever find it locally.  thanks, Amazon, for continuing to carry this great after shave product.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, does not cause any breakouts and does not have any noticeable scent.  Good product overall  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for daily use.  Like that it has some sunscreen in it and does help keep skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> This is the best face lotion for men that I have ever used. I have been using this product nearly every day for the past 5 or so years. Not every store has it so sometimes it can be hard to find, but I stock up when I do. It has 15spf which is great, moisturizers great, and the scent is amazing. I love the smell and so does my girlfriend. Wouldn&#x27;t buy any other lotion as long as this one is available.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Good smell, moisturizes well, inexpensive, applies and absorbs well, and also has SPF which is why I got it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product perfect for my skin type.  Doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy. Best men&#x27;s face lotion with SPF I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  For some reason, I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this and was pleasantly surprised when i  received 4 small individual bottles. This product has lasted me 6 months so far and i&#x27;ve used it everyday. You only need a tiny amount to moisturize and your skin will feel moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li> I used to love Nivea for Men face lotion, but I think they must have changed their formula. The old stuff was thicker and drier, if that makes sense, and my skin loved it. The newer formulation still smells great (very subtle, but my fiance loves it) but if I use it multiple days in a row it makes me break out a little, especially if i apply right after shaving.</li>
            <li> Bought this expecting it to be face lotion. Why is it that every lotion I try for dry facial skin, it ends up being sunscreen? Amazon has to do a better job describing these things. I realize that it states SPF15 on it, but the main part of the description was mainly facial moisturizer. This stuff is not too bad, but you really need to apply it twice to get a good effect.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel good in the morning. I love the protection</li>
            <li> I use Nivea men face products and really like them. Last time I had a facial my therapist told me my skin looked great.</li>
            <li> This used to be a great moisturizer but after they changed the formula it goes on greasy and causes my skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> So I got a sample of this from Target, it really helped to keep my skin smooth and moisturized throughout the day. Living in Florida, you need to lotion up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nivea products, when I saw this, I needed to get it. This one is small and compact, but you get like 4 in this order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and it offers some protection from the sun, a must have if you&#x27;re always traveling distances in a car, under the sun. It acts as a great lotion for your body and a protective lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for over 10 years on my face and neck after I shave. Leaves a nice non-greasy feel with a pleasant scent. The SPF 15 protection is an added bonus for summertime.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years and it is good for sensitive skin and does not irritate my eyes. Buying these in bulk on Amazon is a nobrainer and money saver :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for more than 5 years. The best lotion any guy can get. Doesn&#x27;t make your face feel oily.</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas where it is dry and hot! You must use lots of face lotion, and this has hardly any scent, and also provides spf15 protection.  Great for my face and great for my bald head!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 years daily and it works great. Has a nice subtle scent, works great for post shave too.</li>
            <li> I always like to have SPF protection in my after shave lotion.  I use this whenever I shave and it definitely soothes and cools irritated skin.  The SPF protection is an added bonus for those days where I&#x27;m outdoors golfing, working in the yard, etc.  It has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.  I go back and forth between this product and the Neutrogena equivalent, but Nivea is typically a much better price for a larger quantity.  I find it to be every bit as good as the Neutrogena product with SPF.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, has a nice masculine scent that is not overbearing.  I use this daily and it really makes a difference.  The wind and cold can really sap your skin of moisture and this lotion helps restore it.</li>
            <li> It is a great deal for its price. Nivea is a very good brand and it has Perfect feeling when applying.  Its texture is not oily at all.</li>
            <li> This product provides moisturizing lotion without causing greasiness or blemishes. It soothes my skin  and smells good which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This is the only soothing cream that I used on my face after shaving. I have used this brand for many years but was just happy this time to be able to buy it at buck at such great savings.I will repeat this purchase when they are all used up.</li>
            <li> same product that I buy locally but at a 25% savings.  will buy again when more is needed. the end</li>
            <li> I never break out from my lotion after switching to this. Apply liberally and your skin will feel great. It is not as good as their Q10 lotion but definitely much cheaper and can be used for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Its pretty okay. Leaves your skin pretty shiny or oily though. Didn&#x27;t like that aspect. Only use a tiny portion cause it&#x27;s heavy you&#x27;ll be rubbing for a while to get the lotion dry.</li>
            <li> Small tube so it is good at the gym or when traveling. Scent does not last long so nobody is offended.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Should Include the Active Ingredients in the description, I would not have purchased:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxybenzone: &amp;#34;According to the Environmental Working Group, there are several suspected dangers associated with Oxybenzone. Despite its sun protective abilities, it has been shown to penetrate the skin and cause photo-sensitivity. As a photocarcinogen, it has demonstrated an increase in the production of harmful free radicals and an ability to attack DNA cells; for this reason, it is believed to be a contributing factor in the recent rise of Melanoma cases with sunscreen users. Some studies have shown it to behave similarly to the hormone estrogen, suggesting that it may cause breast cancer. It has also been linked to contact eczema and allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there exist many concerns regarding the human body’s percutaneous absorption of Oxybenzone. In one study, individuals applied a sunscreen with 4% Oxybenzone and submitted urine samples 5 days after topical application. All the subjects’ urine secretions were found to contain Oxybenzone, suggesting the body’s ability to store the substance (Source).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Pretty fantastic, lightweight feeling, smells nice, great product!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lotion for after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years . It does a fine job &amp; I am glad to have found this deeply discounted price on Amazon.com . Enjoy ...</li>
            <li> Product is nice.  Lotion works as intneded.  My boyfriend uses it after his shave and/or before night-time.  Nice fragrance, very light.</li>
            <li> Great lotion to keep your face feeling good on these dry winter days that tend to zap the moisture right out of your skin. Also good to use it in the summer since it has a SPF 15 in it to protect your face from the sun and it is not greasy like some lotions tend to be.</li>
            <li> Has kind of a sporty smell. Nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, and can only find it on line, since stores no longer carry it.&lt;br /&gt;Great for after shave, and good sun protection too. Has a slight fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I have relatively sensitive skin and I wanted something with spf.  I use this after shaving and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good moisturizer plus UV protection. It&#x27;s not greasy and a little goes a long way. I use it every time I was my face.</li>
            <li> Feel greasy. It smells too strong.</li>
            <li> I like it, smells alright, smears and spreads easily and relieves my skin tightness all day. Also like the SPF.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion for my face. keeps it moisturized without feeling oily and helps keep my face protected all day. Since I am not in the sun all day, it might not be good the beach all day, but it protects me from the florescent lights overhead all day.</li>
            <li> This skin cream, SPF 15, is so easy to apply and the smell isn&#x27;t over-powering so I do get positive comments when I use it.  Per my dermatologist&#x27;s orders, I keep a bottle(?) of it in the convertible. as it&#x27;s handy to use whenever I feel the need to block some rays or perhaps just refresh my face a bit. High recommendation from me!</li>
            <li> Works well in place of shave lotion. That&#x27;s how I use it.</li>
            <li> It is good to me, I will buy it again when I use up, hope there are more likewise activity</li>
