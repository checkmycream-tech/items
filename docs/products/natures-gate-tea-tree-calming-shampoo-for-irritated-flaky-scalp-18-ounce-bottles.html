            <li>Speaking of, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m always happy to feel the calming effects of the tea tree oil on my scalp</li>
            <li>My SLS brand tea tree shampoo from the salon never caused pimples on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE :after using for a week the sores stopped...now my scalp is happy.</li>
            <li>This feels great, stops itching.</li>
            <li>most of my life I never had my scalp perfect...</li>
            <li>Twice a week would be good, if you color your hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>I think I saw this mentioned in Youtube review and bought it from the good reviews off</li>
            <li>Did not use yet, but considering the maker, it will be good.</li>
            <li>Gist of the story is its seems to be a good product that is getting the job done in terms of reducing scalp itch and dandruff.  </li>
            <li>A good shampoo to use.</li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>It gives good lather.</li>
            <li>that shampoo loved my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Also, the tingling on my scalp from the mint was very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is a treat that I thoroughly enjoy!!  </li>
            <li>I love the pleasant scent, it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Smells good too (but who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of tea tree oil)?</li>
            <li>It also gave my scalp a slightly warm soothing feeling until I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>It smells good, not like SUPER tea tree but still nice!</li>
            <li>And I just loved the nice, clean smell.</li>
            <li>if you want a good natural dandruff shampoo this is a great option.</li>
            <li>its a good all around shampoo with a mild tea tree scent.</li>
            <li>It smells nice (some tea tree shampoos are strong).</li>
            <li>The best product for my husband, he loves it super clean feeling and smells really good, I highly recommend for all types of hair...</li>
            <li>Thanks,Nature&#x27;s Gate, for my Tea Tree Calming Shampoo, I love it.</li>
            <li>After a week of using the tea tree shampoo my hair became incredibly shiny, soft and stopped itching.  </li>
            <li>His itching and dandruff are both gone :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I guess the most I can say is that like most things it wont work for everyone.</li>
            <li>:) I am very happy with this shampoo (I follow it up with the matching conditioner, and use both almost daily), and would recommend that anyone suffering from mystery (or known)</li>
            <li>i love the smell of this shampoo and can feel it tingling my head.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps dandruff at bay for sure.</li>
            <li>This along with Emu oil on my ears, and my eczema is more under control than when I used the prescriptions.</li>
            <li>Overall though this is an excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have been using Nature&#x27;s Gate Shampoos and Conditioners for many years.</li>
            <li>this brand is not as drying as the Jason brand but the Jason brand works better for dandruff.</li>
            <li>I rotate between the two brands to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>so I knew if the brand was okay</li>
            <li>shampoo that I&#x27;m looking for but it seems to be better than most, judging from the ingredient list..)</li>
            <li>Also more drying on my longer hair.</li>
            <li>I love all the Nature&#x27;s Gate hair and skin products.</li>
            <li>But I got on this healthy living kick and threw all of my SLS products away.</li>
            <li>Ok my point......</li>
            <li>ok...</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>This has worked soooo much better than Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
            <li>I was better off with some Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells fresh and clean but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is a nice clean feeling after I wash my hair with</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree Oil in the shampoo is excellent for dry skin and flaking.</li>
            <li>As a plus, it smells nice and hair looks good with a natural shine, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>a while after using this shampoo, she said her scalp still felt fine. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great, natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After scouring the internet for a good tea tree shampoo that would help alleviate the symptoms of my on again/off again itchy scalp (which may very well be stress-related, but oh well) I found Nature&#x27;s Gate and used both the Tea Tree Calming shampoo and conditioner for about three weeks.</li>
            <li>After their Original Hair Conditioner, this is one of my favorite shampoos.</li>
            <li>It also rinses out quite easily-</li>
            <li>After the haircut, I let it finish air drying and my hair was easily managed during straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is, hands down, the best one I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>As to other reviews stating this had worked to get rid of dandruff, but worked for me too! :D</li>
            <li>Tea tree is not my favorite scent, but overall this shampoo smells pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>When i use, i do a light rinse in hopes the 5% or so remaining continues to work into scalp after drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>there are 2 ounce bottles available for air travel, as well as the 18 ounce size.</li>
            <li>A gentle yet effective cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells nice and really gives you a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>hair felt very nice afterwards and had no bad tangles despite bring brushed and separated with a comb while she cut my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a light cool minty feeling on your scalp when you massage it in.</li>
            <li>Usually I use it with the Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner-another wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is super smooth</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I was rinsing my hair after washing with the shampoo I realized that my hair was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I liked the shampoo, only it does dry the hair by stripping away the oils, so a good conditioner is very important after using it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this shampoo, have used it for a few years, and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser asked what I was using because my hair was in such good shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;ve read so many people keep saying that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo, you really need to ask yourself, \\&quot;what am I putting on my head?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up really nice, makes my scalp fell tingly and gets my hair completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today it feels cool.</li>
            <li>While this shampoo did lather well, have an okay scent and made my hair look decent</li>
            <li>I have a mildly flaky scalp</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a long accepted fact that tea tree oil is good for flaky scalps and this one holds true.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is about 80% white and very easily tangled.  </li>
            <li>Within the first 2-3 times I used this product I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It worked the very first day I used it.  </li>
            <li>No unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Bueno de ver todos estos good reviews y teniendo en cuenta que tengo problemas de toda la vida con mi scalp dry, cuero cabelludo seco,y haber usado de todo, decidi pedirlo y estoy esperando</li>
            <li>I only wish that it was more minty!</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean after use on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell...</li>
            <li>Because I haven&#x27;t used conditioner my hair stays cleaner longer and has more natural body.  </li>
            <li>My sister-in-law picked this up at the store while she was visiting because she was looking for something more natural to help with her itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>This shampoo touts itself as natural in many ways</li>
            <li>If for some reason I have to use another product, my scalp lets me know it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s pretty natural too.</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t mind very strongly-smelling menthol-esque shampoos, this is a much more subtle/softer smell but still nice.</li>
            <li>The odds are very much in Nature&#x27;s Gate favor on this one.</li>
            <li>I like their products very much.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>for several years now, and have not been able to find a remedy for this, even after seeing a dermatologist, until I tried this product about 1 1/2 months ago.</li>
            <li>It cleans pretty well without leaving my hair feeling overly stripped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and the shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I had the chance to try it out first that night</li>
            <li>already ordered a shampoo from another brand (Shea Moisture), but if that one doesn&#x27;t work out then I&#x27;ll most likely try out the Nature&#x27;s Gate Hemp shampoo or one of their organic shampoos.</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Shampoo has been a staple in my shower for many years now, and my scalp simply can&#x27;t do without it.  </li>
            <li>I use them consistently, and even take travel bottles on vacation.  </li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t work as well as some more chemically inclined products such as T-Gel.</li>
            <li>that I gave a sign of relief after i used it the first time.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries out your hair follicles and scalp and and cause a reaction which actually creates more dandruff and sebum.</li>
            <li>Works well for dandruff and leaves hair with a squeaky clean, soft and shiny feel!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean scent, suitable for male or female.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this shampoo and matching conditioner, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>The product smells great, and you can tell it&#x27;s different from other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair isn&#x27;t clean if I don&#x27;t have a lot of suds (strange, but true).</li>
            <li>have scalp psoriasis and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner that really helped minimize the itching, inflammations and flakes.</li>
            <li>it still really did nothing to help with MY itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Which was the whole reason I bought it :</li>
            <li>It foams up really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>I find that this lathers up much nicer than the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo.</li>
            <li>, this doesn&#x27;t really bother me as I have yet to find a product that helps.</li>
            <li>I have found all of them to perform very well.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil shampoos are very drying on my hair</li>
            <li>Again, her scalp gets very itchy but</li>
            <li>and there aren&#x27;t enough quality products available with those two criteria.</li>
            <li>Does not provide the quality tingle I was looking for which helps my scalp which gets very irritated in 90% humidity all summer.</li>
            <li>My doctor gave me a Rx for Eczema to use on my scalp which was in liquid form and very greasy.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner didn&#x27;t do much to help it.</li>
            <li>Awesome shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Scalp feels cold and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I do use a deep rich creamy conditioner or leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>On a rare occasion, I still find a flake or two, but compared to life prior to this product, I&#x27;m a much happier girl!</li>
            <li>Nothing special, definitely will not use again.</li>
            <li>At last, the right shampoo!</li>
            <li>For him the product is (so far) working pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it that one time, but it lathered up very well (more so than regular shampoos, but then again I had washed my hair that morning</li>
            <li>I normally wash every other day at the MOST, normally about 2-3 times a week).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It soaps up much better than other natural products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The combo makes my hair really shiny and soft too.  </li>
            <li>Tries as a substitute because it was sulfite free,</li>
            <li>It says that its okay to use everyday, but I wouldnt recommend it.</li>
            <li>Especially since so many reviewers online ranted about how their dry scalp went away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for it that much myself, but I don&#x27;t think this shampoo smells too strongly of it, and once my hair has dried, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore, anyway.</li>
            <li>Even when the boys&#x27; friends got live, we didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This fixed it!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you the last time I used a shampoo that actually made my hair feel that clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 or 4 days, but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I tried phasing out the shampoo and started just using the conditioner in combination with one of my old anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>my scalp was very itchy and I was so self-conscious about the white flakes that covered my collar and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with my scalp feeling itchy with the shampoos I was using and that is completely gone now.</li>
            <li>my uncontrollable frizz calmed itself considerably.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is completely all nature and doesn&#x27;t contain laureth sulfate.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use a shampoo that&#x27;s natural and could also help relieve my itchiness.</li>
            <li>far I like it.</li>
            <li>so I chose to try this natural shampoo with tea tree oil for its anti-flake capabilities.</li>
            <li>You can find it at Fred Meyer in the natural aisle for about $7 per 18 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>shampoo is as described calming and all natural.</li>
            <li>Got rid of some dryness I&#x27;ve had on my scalp for what seems like 15 years, so that was an unexpected surprise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using  Jaons Natural Cosmetic Dandruff Relief Shampoo.</li>
            <li>So, though it may not be \\&quot;as good\\&quot; as Paul Mitchell shampoo, it certainly is less toxic and far better for you in the long run.  </li>
            <li>At first, it seemed like my itchiness had subsided but just about the third week, the itchiness came back</li>
            <li>Not wanting the bottles to go to waste, I gave them to my boyfriend, who will pretty much use any shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have had eczema on my scalp and ears for most of my life, and have had a few different kinds of prescriptions that never worked consistently, so I have been trying a few natural remedies.</li>
            <li>thank my lucky stars that I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Shampoo instead of continuing to be dissatisfied with medically prescribed and other over-the-counter</li>
            <li>and my hair lathers up easily when it&#x27;s clean compared to when it&#x27;s dirty</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for dry scalp, in fact it irritated me.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I have used them my last three hair washes.&lt;br /&gt;While I do notice a positive change in the texture of my hair (it is also shinier and easier to manage) there is minimal difference in my scalp</li>
            <li>I had developed dandruff/ itchy scalp when I was about 25 and for the last 4 years I&#x27;ve been trying everything.  </li>
            <li>I would reccomend for anyone looking for a natural shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li>The calming, pure and natural ingredients promote a healthy scalp and it never leaves my long, thick hair feeling dry or stripped as some other products have.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the shampoo and conditioner did the exact opposite of what they were supposed to do as my scalp remained both irritated and flaky and far from calm.</li>
            <li>occasionally like twice a year is normal for for the other named brand shampoos.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells good too (but who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of tea tree oil)?</li>
            <li> It also gave my scalp a slightly warm soothing feeling until I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> It smells good, not like SUPER tea tree but still nice!</li>
            <li> And I just loved the nice, clean smell.</li>
            <li> if you want a good natural dandruff shampoo this is a great option.</li>
            <li> its a good all around shampoo with a mild tea tree scent.</li>
            <li> It smells nice (some tea tree shampoos are strong).</li>
            <li> The best product for my husband, he loves it super clean feeling and smells really good, I highly recommend for all types of hair...</li>
            <li> Thanks,Nature&#x27;s Gate, for my Tea Tree Calming Shampoo, I love it.</li>
            <li> After a week of using the tea tree shampoo my hair became incredibly shiny, soft and stopped itching.  </li>
            <li> His itching and dandruff are both gone :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I guess the most I can say is that like most things it wont work for everyone.</li>
            <li> :) I am very happy with this shampoo (I follow it up with the matching conditioner, and use both almost daily), and would recommend that anyone suffering from mystery (or known)</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this shampoo and can feel it tingling my head.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps dandruff at bay for sure.</li>
            <li> This along with Emu oil on my ears, and my eczema is more under control than when I used the prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Overall though this is an excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Nature&#x27;s Gate Shampoos and Conditioners for many years.</li>
            <li> this brand is not as drying as the Jason brand but the Jason brand works better for dandruff.</li>
            <li> I rotate between the two brands to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> so I knew if the brand was okay</li>
            <li> shampoo that I&#x27;m looking for but it seems to be better than most, judging from the ingredient list..)</li>
            <li> Also more drying on my longer hair.</li>
            <li> I love all the Nature&#x27;s Gate hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> But I got on this healthy living kick and threw all of my SLS products away.</li>
            <li> Ok my point......</li>
            <li> ok...</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> This has worked soooo much better than Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
            <li> I was better off with some Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells fresh and clean but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It is a nice clean feeling after I wash my hair with</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil in the shampoo is excellent for dry skin and flaking.</li>
            <li> As a plus, it smells nice and hair looks good with a natural shine, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> a while after using this shampoo, she said her scalp still felt fine. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a great, natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After scouring the internet for a good tea tree shampoo that would help alleviate the symptoms of my on again/off again itchy scalp (which may very well be stress-related, but oh well) I found Nature&#x27;s Gate and used both the Tea Tree Calming shampoo and conditioner for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> After their Original Hair Conditioner, this is one of my favorite shampoos.</li>
            <li> It also rinses out quite easily-</li>
            <li> After the haircut, I let it finish air drying and my hair was easily managed during straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is, hands down, the best one I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> As to other reviews stating this had worked to get rid of dandruff, but worked for me too! :D</li>
            <li> Tea tree is not my favorite scent, but overall this shampoo smells pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> When i use, i do a light rinse in hopes the 5% or so remaining continues to work into scalp after drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> there are 2 ounce bottles available for air travel, as well as the 18 ounce size.</li>
            <li> A gentle yet effective cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice and really gives you a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> hair felt very nice afterwards and had no bad tangles despite bring brushed and separated with a comb while she cut my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a light cool minty feeling on your scalp when you massage it in.</li>
            <li> Usually I use it with the Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner-another wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean.</li>
            <li> My hair is super smooth</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I was rinsing my hair after washing with the shampoo I realized that my hair was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo, only it does dry the hair by stripping away the oils, so a good conditioner is very important after using it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shampoo, have used it for a few years, and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser asked what I was using because my hair was in such good shape.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;ve read so many people keep saying that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo, you really need to ask yourself, \\&quot;what am I putting on my head?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up really nice, makes my scalp fell tingly and gets my hair completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today it feels cool.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo did lather well, have an okay scent and made my hair look decent</li>
            <li> I have a mildly flaky scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long accepted fact that tea tree oil is good for flaky scalps and this one holds true.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is about 80% white and very easily tangled.  </li>
            <li> Within the first 2-3 times I used this product I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It worked the very first day I used it.  </li>
            <li> No unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Bueno de ver todos estos good reviews y teniendo en cuenta que tengo problemas de toda la vida con mi scalp dry, cuero cabelludo seco,y haber usado de todo, decidi pedirlo y estoy esperando</li>
            <li> I only wish that it was more minty!</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean after use on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell...</li>
            <li> Because I haven&#x27;t used conditioner my hair stays cleaner longer and has more natural body.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law picked this up at the store while she was visiting because she was looking for something more natural to help with her itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo touts itself as natural in many ways</li>
            <li> If for some reason I have to use another product, my scalp lets me know it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s pretty natural too.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t mind very strongly-smelling menthol-esque shampoos, this is a much more subtle/softer smell but still nice.</li>
            <li> The odds are very much in Nature&#x27;s Gate favor on this one.</li>
            <li> I like their products very much.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> for several years now, and have not been able to find a remedy for this, even after seeing a dermatologist, until I tried this product about 1 1/2 months ago.</li>
            <li> It cleans pretty well without leaving my hair feeling overly stripped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and the shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I had the chance to try it out first that night</li>
            <li> already ordered a shampoo from another brand (Shea Moisture), but if that one doesn&#x27;t work out then I&#x27;ll most likely try out the Nature&#x27;s Gate Hemp shampoo or one of their organic shampoos.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Shampoo has been a staple in my shower for many years now, and my scalp simply can&#x27;t do without it.  </li>
            <li> I use them consistently, and even take travel bottles on vacation.  </li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t work as well as some more chemically inclined products such as T-Gel.</li>
            <li> that I gave a sign of relief after i used it the first time.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries out your hair follicles and scalp and and cause a reaction which actually creates more dandruff and sebum.</li>
            <li> Works well for dandruff and leaves hair with a squeaky clean, soft and shiny feel!</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean scent, suitable for male or female.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this shampoo and matching conditioner, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> The product smells great, and you can tell it&#x27;s different from other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair isn&#x27;t clean if I don&#x27;t have a lot of suds (strange, but true).</li>
            <li> have scalp psoriasis and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner that really helped minimize the itching, inflammations and flakes.</li>
            <li> it still really did nothing to help with MY itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Which was the whole reason I bought it :</li>
            <li> It foams up really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> I find that this lathers up much nicer than the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo.</li>
            <li> , this doesn&#x27;t really bother me as I have yet to find a product that helps.</li>
            <li> I have found all of them to perform very well.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil shampoos are very drying on my hair</li>
            <li> Again, her scalp gets very itchy but</li>
            <li> and there aren&#x27;t enough quality products available with those two criteria.</li>
            <li> Does not provide the quality tingle I was looking for which helps my scalp which gets very irritated in 90% humidity all summer.</li>
            <li> My doctor gave me a Rx for Eczema to use on my scalp which was in liquid form and very greasy.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner didn&#x27;t do much to help it.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Scalp feels cold and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I do use a deep rich creamy conditioner or leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> On a rare occasion, I still find a flake or two, but compared to life prior to this product, I&#x27;m a much happier girl!</li>
            <li> Nothing special, definitely will not use again.</li>
            <li> At last, the right shampoo!</li>
            <li> For him the product is (so far) working pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it that one time, but it lathered up very well (more so than regular shampoos, but then again I had washed my hair that morning</li>
            <li> I normally wash every other day at the MOST, normally about 2-3 times a week).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It soaps up much better than other natural products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The combo makes my hair really shiny and soft too.  </li>
            <li> Tries as a substitute because it was sulfite free,</li>
            <li> It says that its okay to use everyday, but I wouldnt recommend it.</li>
            <li> Especially since so many reviewers online ranted about how their dry scalp went away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it that much myself, but I don&#x27;t think this shampoo smells too strongly of it, and once my hair has dried, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore, anyway.</li>
            <li> Even when the boys&#x27; friends got live, we didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This fixed it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you the last time I used a shampoo that actually made my hair feel that clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 or 4 days, but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I tried phasing out the shampoo and started just using the conditioner in combination with one of my old anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> my scalp was very itchy and I was so self-conscious about the white flakes that covered my collar and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my scalp feeling itchy with the shampoos I was using and that is completely gone now.</li>
            <li> my uncontrollable frizz calmed itself considerably.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is completely all nature and doesn&#x27;t contain laureth sulfate.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use a shampoo that&#x27;s natural and could also help relieve my itchiness.</li>
            <li> far I like it.</li>
            <li> so I chose to try this natural shampoo with tea tree oil for its anti-flake capabilities.</li>
            <li> You can find it at Fred Meyer in the natural aisle for about $7 per 18 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> shampoo is as described calming and all natural.</li>
            <li> Got rid of some dryness I&#x27;ve had on my scalp for what seems like 15 years, so that was an unexpected surprise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using  Jaons Natural Cosmetic Dandruff Relief Shampoo.</li>
            <li> So, though it may not be \\&quot;as good\\&quot; as Paul Mitchell shampoo, it certainly is less toxic and far better for you in the long run.  </li>
            <li> At first, it seemed like my itchiness had subsided but just about the third week, the itchiness came back</li>
            <li> Not wanting the bottles to go to waste, I gave them to my boyfriend, who will pretty much use any shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema on my scalp and ears for most of my life, and have had a few different kinds of prescriptions that never worked consistently, so I have been trying a few natural remedies.</li>
            <li> thank my lucky stars that I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Shampoo instead of continuing to be dissatisfied with medically prescribed and other over-the-counter</li>
            <li> and my hair lathers up easily when it&#x27;s clean compared to when it&#x27;s dirty</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for dry scalp, in fact it irritated me.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I have used them my last three hair washes.&lt;br /&gt;While I do notice a positive change in the texture of my hair (it is also shinier and easier to manage) there is minimal difference in my scalp</li>
            <li> I had developed dandruff/ itchy scalp when I was about 25 and for the last 4 years I&#x27;ve been trying everything.  </li>
            <li> I would reccomend for anyone looking for a natural shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li> The calming, pure and natural ingredients promote a healthy scalp and it never leaves my long, thick hair feeling dry or stripped as some other products have.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the shampoo and conditioner did the exact opposite of what they were supposed to do as my scalp remained both irritated and flaky and far from calm.</li>
            <li> occasionally like twice a year is normal for for the other named brand shampoos.</li>
            <li> Growing up with dry scalp, i normally have to use specific conditioners and not really feeling like i was getting to the problem but actually keeping my dandruff at bay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re not the cheapest products on the market, but are comparable to the other natural shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> By the second week the flaking died down, my hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as oily and</li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair manageable and soft without feeling like it was coated or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I suppose everyone&#x27;s body and symptoms of dry scalp are a bit different as is remedy, but this products worked for my condition personally.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your hair, and I like it!</li>
            <li> Lathers well, cleans thoroughly without stripping hair, leaves hair soft and shiny, a natural product minus the harsh chemicals,</li>
            <li> However, after a few days, his normally flake-free scalp started getting itchy and flaky as well.</li>
            <li> Then I dug in to some research and discovered that dandruff and dry scalp are not at all the same thing.</li>
            <li> This one actually worked albeit scalp felt a tad dry after using, i have no dandruff problems anymore.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and tea tree oil shampoo is the only shampoo that helps that.  </li>
            <li> Although I do always deep condition because my hair is on the dry side naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  bought the shampoo because people said in other reviews that it dried their hair out, and I have a very oily scalp</li>
            <li> So far, I have noticed little improvement in this.&lt;br /&gt;While I do feel some relief while I am washing my hair, since the product leaves a \\&quot;cool\\</li>
            <li> Those terms are commonly interchanged on consumer products, and it is really misleading.</li>
            <li> All the same ingredients minus the SLS.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry scalp but not to an extreme, yet enough to cause dandruff and was ready to remedy this problem without tars or other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a few occasional flakes on my scalp since using this product on a regular basis, but they are few and far between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, with other shampoos I felt like there was a residue left on my hair, not with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> If anyone has a problem with dry faky scalps, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> What I had was dry scalp and</li>
            <li> I sneezed a lot with it and it made my skin very red from dripping down my body.</li>
            <li> : Has a slight synthetic smell similar to a medicine</li>
            <li> While not totally cured, my scalp is definitely improved, to where the breakouts are occuring much less than before, my head doesn&#x27;t feel itchy and annoyed all the time, and as an added benefit, my usually dry, straw-like hair has become SO soft!</li>
            <li> Made my hear very dry and tangly.</li>
            <li> It helped a little, but not enough.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> , I use it everytime I wash my hair, and my hair feels softer, more manageable, my hair was horrible before this, maybe the new combination of this shampoo with another brand of conditioner is the difference and my dandruff problem has somewhat been reduced.</li>
            <li> I tried five or six other &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoos without seeing any improvement.</li>
            <li> These shampoos and conditioners are sold on Amazon and other web sites by a variety of vendors.</li>
            <li> and I could decide if I wanted to try their other products (since I don&#x27;t have a scalp issue).</li>
            <li> I had allergic reactions to it ( not just the Tea Tree, I&#x27;ve used their other scents )</li>
            <li> be careful if you have allergies and asthma!</li>
            <li> I realized and figured that half of the time, my acne was caused by my shampoo having salt, lauryl sulfates, and other ingredients that clog my pores after reviewing acne detective article on sageskincare.com</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> For me, this shampoo moisturizes my scalp while leaving my hair shiny and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> Half the 1st grade seemed to have it and we seemed immuned.</li>
            <li> this shampoo knocked it out in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo with the hopes that it would relieve my slightly itchy scalp (though I have no dandruff).</li>
            <li> is less fly-away, and I&#x27;m not bothered with itchy scalp from dryness and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have dry hair, and every day use of this product does make my dry condition worse.</li>
            <li> I bought natures gate tea tree thinking if it messes up my scalp a little</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff about 6 months ago and it worked for a little while.</li>
            <li> Also, this shampoo is not made with toxic ingredients and is one of the few shampoos that do not affect my daughters chemical sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product known to man to try and tame the oil and flakiness of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> so it itches all the time and flares up pretty bad from time to time.</li>
            <li> No more harsh chemical shampoo for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A TODOS (as) SORRY ONLY ESPA&amp;Ntilde;OL.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> But after entering into the worst time of year for me, winter, where my skin is usually more flaky than usual, and going a week or so of vacation without it, I am a believer.</li>
            <li> This past winter I made an effort to not take longer and/or hotter showers and I purchased this conditioner along with the shampoo to help.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because it really seemed like it was doing it&#x27;s job for a while.</li>
            <li> I use this product at least once a week-it has been years since I have had any dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather thin, and I have to wash it almost everyday</li>
            <li> and it was worse than it had been before.</li>
            <li> In fact they made it worse...</li>
            <li> or it looks like a big grease pit and itches horribly.  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy but the regimen works.</li>
            <li> I had REALLY bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> Laureth sulfate is in almost everything that foams (from soap to toothpaste to shampoos), and it&#x27;s really bad for you.  </li>

            <li> I wish this product would have worked for me. After scouring the internet for a good tea tree shampoo that would help alleviate the symptoms of my on again/off again itchy scalp (which may very well be stress-related, but oh well) I found Nature&#x27;s Gate and used both the Tea Tree Calming shampoo and conditioner for about three weeks. At first, it seemed like my itchiness had subsided but just about the third week, the itchiness came back and it was worse than it had been before. I tried phasing out the shampoo and started just using the conditioner in combination with one of my old anti-dandruff shampoos. It helped a little, but not enough. I soon had to scrap both the shampoo and conditioner and try something entirely different. Not wanting the bottles to go to waste, I gave them to my boyfriend, who will pretty much use any shampoo. However, after a few days, his normally flake-free scalp started getting itchy and flaky as well. He ended up just throwing them out. I was so disappointed because it really seemed like it was doing it&#x27;s job for a while. And I just loved the nice, clean smell. If there were a lotion that smelled like this, I would snatch it up in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, the shampoo and conditioner did the exact opposite of what they were supposed to do as my scalp remained both irritated and flaky and far from calm.</li>
            <li> Works well for dandruff and leaves hair with a squeaky clean, soft and shiny feel! Smells minty!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair so soft and manageable. It is a treat that I thoroughly enjoy!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo, only it does dry the hair by stripping away the oils, so a good conditioner is very important after using it. I have noticed a decrease in the flaking in my head. It says that its okay to use everyday, but I wouldnt recommend it. Twice a week would be good, if you color your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is so great.  It worked the very first day I used it.  I would definitely recommend using the conditioner as well since it has a cooling effect to the scalp.  The combo makes my hair really shiny and soft too.  If anyone has a problem with dry faky scalps, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I had REALLY bad dandruff. This worked for me after 2 applications. I tend to have dry hair, and every day use of this product does make my dry condition worse. I alternate with a regular shampoo. I also use the conditioner. Some reports say tea tree oil shampoo fades coloring jobs, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that happening with my coloring. I now order 3-4 bottles at a time, so I won&#x27;t run out and have my teenage son using it. Terrific product.</li>
            <li> You can feel this working on you scalp. It is a good product. Of course always check your ingredients of anything that you eat and put on your body. Just a suggestion. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these for the family (especially children)when there was a lice outbreak. I heard from a naturopath that it helped prevent infestation. I am a TOTAL believer now. Even when the boys&#x27; friends got live, we didn&#x27;t. Half the 1st grade seemed to have it and we seemed immuned. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also its a good all around shampoo with a mild tea tree scent.</li>
            <li> Bueno de ver todos estos good reviews y teniendo en cuenta que tengo problemas de toda la vida con mi scalp dry, cuero cabelludo seco,y haber usado de todo, decidi pedirlo y estoy esperando&lt;br /&gt;que me llegue para empezar a usarlo imediatamente. Ya pondre aqui mi relacion con tea tree shampoo de Natures Gate. Ojala me funcione ! Ya de antemano le puse 5 stars pues estoy anticipando que sera un exito, para de esta manera atraerlo ! GRACIAS A TODOS (as) SORRY ONLY ESPA&amp;Ntilde;OL.</li>
            <li> I tried five or six other &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoos without seeing any improvement. In fact they made it worse... my scalp was very itchy and I was so self-conscious about the white flakes that covered my collar and shoulders. Then I dug in to some research and discovered that dandruff and dry scalp are not at all the same thing. Those terms are commonly interchanged on consumer products, and it is really misleading. What I had was dry scalp and this shampoo knocked it out in less than a week. Tea tree is not my favorite scent, but overall this shampoo smells pleasant and not too strong. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ... As to other reviews stating this had worked to get rid of dandruff, but worked for me too! :D Growing up with dry scalp, i normally have to use specific conditioners and not really feeling like i was getting to the problem but actually keeping my dandruff at bay. This one actually worked albeit scalp felt a tad dry after using, i have no dandruff problems anymore. When i use, i do a light rinse in hopes the 5% or so remaining continues to work into scalp after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it worked for my dandruff condition which was bothersome. I suppose everyone&#x27;s body and symptoms of dry scalp are a bit different as is remedy, but this products worked for my condition personally. I have always had dry scalp but not to an extreme, yet enough to cause dandruff and was ready to remedy this problem without tars or other harsh chemicals. This formula seemed milder in it&#x27;s approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy it&#x27;s no longer snowing in the summer!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. It leaves my hair clean. Also, with other shampoos I felt like there was a residue left on my hair, not with this shampoo. I had a problem with my scalp feeling itchy with the shampoos I was using and that is completely gone now. Even my hairdresser asked what I was using because my hair was in such good shape. Thanks,Nature&#x27;s Gate, for my Tea Tree Calming Shampoo, I love it.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo (along with the conditioner) a week ago. Thus far, I have used them my last three hair washes.&lt;br /&gt;While I do notice a positive change in the texture of my hair (it is also shinier and easier to manage) there is minimal difference in my scalp condition.&lt;br /&gt;I have scalp psoriasis and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner that really helped minimize the itching, inflammations and flakes. So far, I have noticed little improvement in this.&lt;br /&gt;While I do feel some relief while I am washing my hair, since the product leaves a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; feeling on your scalp, afterwards, the itching is still there.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that by now, I would start to notice a change in this aspect. Maybe I should give it a while longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product known to man to try and tame the oil and flakiness of my scalp.  My hair is rather thin, and I have to wash it almost everyday or it looks like a big grease pit and itches horribly.  That all changed when I started using this shampoo.  After a week of using the tea tree shampoo my hair became incredibly shiny, soft and stopped itching.  I even had a co-worker comment on how beautiful my hair looked.  By the second week the flaking died down, my hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as oily and my uncontrollable frizz calmed itself considerably.  I can now go two days between washings without looking stringy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve read so many people keep saying that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo, you really need to ask yourself, \\&quot;what am I putting on my head?\\&quot;.  This shampoo is completely all nature and doesn&#x27;t contain laureth sulfate.  Laureth sulfate is in almost everything that foams (from soap to toothpaste to shampoos), and it&#x27;s really bad for you.  It can cause follicle damage, liver toxicity and it will ruin your hair, if you want to think about it that way.  So, though it may not be \\&quot;as good\\&quot; as Paul Mitchell shampoo, it certainly is less toxic and far better for you in the long run.  The odds are very much in Nature&#x27;s Gate favor on this one.</li>
            <li> I had developed dandruff/ itchy scalp when I was about 25 and for the last 4 years I&#x27;ve been trying everything.  Within the first 2-3 times I used this product I noticed a huge difference.  Not only did the itch go away, but my flakes were about 95% gone.  I do let the product sit on my scalp for about a minute before rinsing and I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell... it&#x27;s has done wonders for my hair!!  On a rare occasion, I still find a flake or two, but compared to life prior to this product, I&#x27;m a much happier girl!</li>
            <li> It lathers up really nice, makes my scalp fell tingly and gets my hair completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent shampoo!</li>
            <li> I get this product for my kids and  they use it all the time. It helps with any dandruff problems and helps keeping away lice for when they go to camp. I would reccomend for anyone looking for a natural shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li> After a face wash containing tea tree oil got rid of my facial dermatitis, I figured a tea tree oil shampoo might do the same for my dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis. I had been using a regular dandruff shampoo from Jason which kept it 80 to 90 percent under control. This stuff, combined with the tea tree conditioner from Nature&#x27;s Gate, had it under control 100 percent after two weeks. As a plus, it smells nice and hair looks good with a natural shine, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> if you want a good natural dandruff shampoo this is a great option. i use it regularly with &#x27;dandruff-less&#x27; results.</li>
            <li> We are used to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree and the Sally&#x27;s Tea Tree that smells and works like Paul Mitchell so thought we&#x27;d give this a shot. This is just \\&quot;okay\\&quot;. Nothing special, definitely will not use again.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo with the hopes that it would relieve my slightly itchy scalp (though I have no dandruff). Especially since so many reviewers online ranted about how their dry scalp went away. While this shampoo did lather well, have an okay scent and made my hair look decent it still really did nothing to help with MY itchy scalp. Which was the whole reason I bought it :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I let my boyfriend borrow the shampoo since he has also been suffering with itchy scalp ALONG WITH dandruff. For him the product is (so far) working pretty well. His itching and dandruff are both gone :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess the most I can say is that like most things it wont work for everyone. :/</li>
            <li> I have had an irritated, whitehead-prone scalp (ew, gross! I know!) for several years now, and have not been able to find a remedy for this, even after seeing a dermatologist, until I tried this product about 1 1/2 months ago. While not totally cured, my scalp is definitely improved, to where the breakouts are occuring much less than before, my head doesn&#x27;t feel itchy and annoyed all the time, and as an added benefit, my usually dry, straw-like hair has become SO soft! I didn&#x27;t know that was possible! :) I am very happy with this shampoo (I follow it up with the matching conditioner, and use both almost daily), and would recommend that anyone suffering from mystery (or known) scalp problems give it a try! And don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t care for tea tree fragrance. I don&#x27;t care for it that much myself, but I don&#x27;t think this shampoo smells too strongly of it, and once my hair has dried, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore, anyway.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this shampoo and can feel it tingling my head. at the time of using, it makes my head feel real good. afterwards i still get some itching and i have been using it every time i shampoo since i got it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice and really gives you a clean feeling. It goes well with the conditioner. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the only one I found that worked for me. The Tea Tree Oil in the shampoo is excellent for dry skin and flaking.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my scalp so it itches all the time and flares up pretty bad from time to time. I switch uses of Selsun blue, Head &amp; Shoulders &amp; Neutrogena T-Gel in between washes to help maintain my psoriasis. I wanted to use a shampoo that&#x27;s natural and could also help relieve my itchiness. I think I saw this mentioned in Youtube review and bought it from the good reviews off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I like it. It foams up really well. It has a light cool minty feeling on your scalp when you massage it in. It cleans pretty well without leaving my hair feeling overly stripped. I love how it&#x27;s pretty natural too. I only wish that it was more minty! But that&#x27;s to each it&#x27;s own. Overall I recommend this product. It&#x27;s pretty affordable too. $5.99 for 18 oz for a \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; product isn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note that this product is not a HOLY GRAIL product in my book and it hasn&#x27;t \\&quot;cured\\&quot; my psoriasis, but it helps it a lot. I see myself repurchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo. It is a nice clean feeling after I wash my hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps dandruff at bay for sure.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema on my scalp and ears for most of my life, and have had a few different kinds of prescriptions that never worked consistently, so I have been trying a few natural remedies. When I first tried this shampoo and matching conditioner, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much. It didn&#x27;t tingle like people said it would. But after entering into the worst time of year for me, winter, where my skin is usually more flaky than usual, and going a week or so of vacation without it, I am a believer. For me, this shampoo moisturizes my scalp while leaving my hair shiny and not weighed down. It soaps up much better than other natural products I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t plan on switching any time soon. This along with Emu oil on my ears, and my eczema is more under control than when I used the prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoos off and on since the 80s and this is, hands down, the best one I&#x27;ve tried.  I have fine hair that is about 80% white and very easily tangled.  With this shampoo I haven&#x27;t needed conditioner at all.  My hair combs out well after washing, is less fly-away, and I&#x27;m not bothered with itchy scalp from dryness and chemicals.  Because I haven&#x27;t used conditioner my hair stays cleaner longer and has more natural body.  The results have been the same for my husband, whose hair is even finer than mine.  At last, the right shampoo!</li>
            <li> I use this product at least once a week-it has been years since I have had any dandruff problems. It has a fresh, clean scent, suitable for male or female. It also rinses out quite easily-I go camping from March through October, and in some of the primative sites, I know it will rinse out with the solar shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is something I would reccomend for anyone looking for a \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; shampoo that works, and does not smell of chemicals. Usually I use it with the Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner-another wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Gentle. Can use every day.No unpleasant smell. No SLS. Eliminates scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and it is awesome. My hair is super smooth (that may also be because I am using the tea tree conditioner from nature&#x27;s gate in addition to the shampoo). I love the pleasant scent, it&#x27;s not overbearing. I find that this lathers up much nicer than the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo. I feel like my hair isn&#x27;t clean if I don&#x27;t have a lot of suds (strange, but true). I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 or 4 days, but so far I really like it. I gave this review a four because I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my scalp condition yet, this doesn&#x27;t really bother me as I have yet to find a product that helps. Overall though this is an excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
            <li> Did not use yet, but considering the maker, it will be good. I am waiting for the conditioner and then will use</li>
            <li> I think I accidentally wrote the review for this shampoo under its partner conditioner, but doesn&#x27;t matter, the review would be the same.  Gist of the story is its seems to be a good product that is getting the job done in terms of reducing scalp itch and dandruff.  Smells good too (but who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of tea tree oil)? :)</li>
            <li> I realized and figured that half of the time, my acne was caused by my shampoo having salt, lauryl sulfates, and other ingredients that clog my pores after reviewing acne detective article on sageskincare.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo outperforms Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo when it comes to preventing acne</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and the shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I love this stuff and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nature&#x27;s Gate Shampoos and Conditioners for many years. I have used a variety of Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoos. I have found all of them to perform very well. I like their products very much. This one is no exception. It leaves my hair clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there are 2 ounce bottles available for air travel, as well as the 18 ounce size. These shampoos and conditioners are sold on Amazon and other web sites by a variety of vendors. Prices for the products and for shipping vary in time and with the vendor. I suggest doing a search to find the lowest price.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil shampoos are very drying on my hair that&#x27;s my only complaint. This works great for a dandruff shampoo for cleansing the scalp this brand is not as drying as the Jason brand but the Jason brand works better for dandruff. I rotate between the two brands to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law picked this up at the store while she was visiting because she was looking for something more natural to help with her itchy scalp. I had the chance to try it out first that night so I knew if the brand was okay and I could decide if I wanted to try their other products (since I don&#x27;t have a scalp issue). I&#x27;ve only used it that one time, but it lathered up very well (more so than regular shampoos, but then again I had washed my hair that morning and my hair lathers up easily when it&#x27;s clean compared to when it&#x27;s dirty so take that with a grain of salt. I normally wash every other day at the MOST, normally about 2-3 times a week). It also gave my scalp a slightly warm soothing feeling until I rinsed it out. I used the matching conditioner on the length of my hair and worked it upwards with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt very nice afterwards and had no bad tangles despite bring brushed and separated with a comb while she cut my hair. After the haircut, I let it finish air drying and my hair was easily managed during straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister-in-law used it next. Again, her scalp gets very itchy but a while after using this shampoo, she said her scalp still felt fine. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already ordered a shampoo from another brand (Shea Moisture), but if that one doesn&#x27;t work out then I&#x27;ll most likely try out the Nature&#x27;s Gate Hemp shampoo or one of their organic shampoos. I give this one 5 stars for what it is (probably not the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; shampoo that I&#x27;m looking for but it seems to be better than most, judging from the ingredient list..)</li>
            <li> A good shampoo to use. My hair felt clean after use on a consistent basis. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner. I have a mildly flaky scalp so I chose to try this natural shampoo with tea tree oil for its anti-flake capabilities. It&#x27;s been a long accepted fact that tea tree oil is good for flaky scalps and this one holds true. While I was rinsing my hair after washing with the shampoo I realized that my hair was squeaky clean. I couldn&#x27;t tell you the last time I used a shampoo that actually made my hair feel that clean. Also, the tingling on my scalp from the mint was very refreshing. The conditioner left my hair manageable and soft without feeling like it was coated or weighed down. I have noticed a few occasional flakes on my scalp since using this product on a regular basis, but they are few and far between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not the cheapest products on the market, but are comparable to the other natural shampoos and conditioners. You can find it at Fred Meyer in the natural aisle for about $7 per 18 oz bottle. Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoo and conditioner is manufactured by Levlad, LLC and made in the USA. It claims to have no parabens, colorants, or alcohol, and is ph-balanced.</li>
            <li> I just want to say one word. BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;I used it yesterday. Today it feels cool. For best result, leave it for 2-4 mins on your hair. Then rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;This product Made in USA.</li>
            <li> Tries as a substitute because it was sulfite free, tea tree and there aren&#x27;t enough quality products available with those two criteria. Does not provide the quality tingle I was looking for which helps my scalp which gets very irritated in 90% humidity all summer. Also more drying on my longer hair. Will finish but not buy again.</li>
            <li> My doctor gave me a Rx for Eczema to use on my scalp which was in liquid form and very greasy.  So I happened to see Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Shampoo on a shelf and decided to use it and now I only get the itching occasionally.</li>
            <li> This item works! I use it about two to three times a week in conjunction with my ketacanozole for dermatitis. It smells nice (some tea tree shampoos are strong). I do use a deep rich creamy conditioner or leave in conditioner. I put some jojoba oil on my scalp (the irritated spots) and do olive oil soaks once a month. I know it sounds crazy but the regimen works. This is a supplement to my routine.</li>
            <li> I  bought the shampoo because people said in other reviews that it dried their hair out, and I have a very oily scalp so I was eager to see if it could help. I did not find that it reduce the oil in my hair like I had hoped. Otherwise, it was a sufficient shampoo, but just didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Pros: Lathers well, cleans thoroughly without stripping hair, leaves hair soft and shiny, a natural product minus the harsh chemicals, good price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Has a slight synthetic smell similar to a medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great, natural shampoo.  A gentle yet effective cleanser.  Good value.</li>
            <li> This shampoo touts itself as natural in many ways but it&#x27;s really not. I had allergic reactions to it ( not just the Tea Tree, I&#x27;ve used their other scents ) Speaking of, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. Didn&#x27;t do much for dry scalp, in fact it irritated me. Made my hear very dry and tangly. The conditioner didn&#x27;t do much to help it. I sneezed a lot with it and it made my skin very red from dripping down my body. There is FRAGRANCE in it! be careful if you have allergies and asthma!</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and tea tree oil shampoo is the only shampoo that helps that.  Also, this shampoo is not made with toxic ingredients and is one of the few shampoos that do not affect my daughters chemical sensitivity issues.  I also use the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo works. No more harsh chemical shampoo for me.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is as described calming and all natural. Thank You</li>
            <li> Works great, smells fresh and clean but not overpowering. I typically don&#x27;t mind very strongly-smelling menthol-esque shampoos, this is a much more subtle/softer smell but still nice. Got rid of some dryness I&#x27;ve had on my scalp for what seems like 15 years, so that was an unexpected surprise. Will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Scalp feels cold and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Shampoo has been a staple in my shower for many years now, and my scalp simply can&#x27;t do without it.  When my dermatologist prescribed various products to help my chronic scalp problem, none of them performed as well as Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Shampoo.  The calming, pure and natural ingredients promote a healthy scalp and it never leaves my long, thick hair feeling dry or stripped as some other products have. Although I do always deep condition because my hair is on the dry side naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase Nature&#x27;s Gate products in bulk because I never want to be without them.  I use them consistently, and even take travel bottles on vacation.  If for some reason I have to use another product, my scalp lets me know it pretty quickly.  So I&#x27;m always happy to feel the calming effects of the tea tree oil on my scalp again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thank my lucky stars that I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Oil Shampoo instead of continuing to be dissatisfied with medically prescribed and other over-the-counter products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Victoria Austin</li>
            <li> I love all the Nature&#x27;s Gate hair and skin products. They smell great, work wonderfully, and revitalize the skin. After their Original Hair Conditioner, this is one of my favorite shampoos. It gives good lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so. I would not go out and buy it again.  It&#x27;s alright as an every day shampoo to use</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, I use it everytime I wash my hair, and my hair feels softer, more manageable, my hair was horrible before this, maybe the new combination of this shampoo with another brand of conditioner is the difference and my dandruff problem has somewhat been reduced. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shampoo, have used it for a few years, and it is amazing.  I have psoriasis and it helps with my scalp.  Will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> The product smells great, and you can tell it&#x27;s different from other shampoos. However, it didn&#x27;t work as well as some more chemically inclined products such as T-Gel. If you don&#x27;t want those chemicals, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo. My tea tree shampoo I used before this product worked perfectly...that I gave a sign of relief after i used it the first time. But I got on this healthy living kick and threw all of my SLS products away. I bought natures gate tea tree thinking if it messes up my scalp a little so what.....most of my life I never had my scalp perfect...bouncing from pantene,  herbal essences,  pert plus,  infussium, suave,  Paul Mitchell etc. I found a tea tree shampoo from a corporate chain hair salon that my mother in law works at....that shampoo loved my hair and scalp. Ok my point......this shampoo caused pimples on my scalp.....ok...occasionally like twice a year is normal for for the other named brand shampoos. But natures gate was different...these pimples had an oozing crust over them...and it hurt. I wish it worked. My SLS brand tea tree shampoo from the salon never caused pimples on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE :after using for a week the sores stopped...now my scalp is happy. Changing to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because it was recommended by a friend! I love this shampoo, it&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your hair, and I like it! It smells good, not like SUPER tea tree but still nice!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff about 6 months ago and it worked for a little while. It has some helpful ingredients (jojoba, tea tree oil etc.) but it also contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). This stuff dries out your hair follicles and scalp and and cause a reaction which actually creates more dandruff and sebum. I&#x27;ve started using  Jaons Natural Cosmetic Dandruff Relief Shampoo. All the same ingredients minus the SLS. This has worked soooo much better than Nature&#x27;s Gate. Write me if you have questions.</li>
            <li> The best product for my husband, he loves it super clean feeling and smells really good, I highly recommend for all types of hair...</li>
            <li> This feels great, stops itching.</li>
            <li> My scalp was an itchy, pimply disaster. This fixed it! Not sure how well it works for other scalp conditions, but it&#x27;s worth trying!</li>
            <li> In the winter I tend to get dryer skin, scalp included.  This past winter I made an effort to not take longer and/or hotter showers and I purchased this conditioner along with the shampoo to help.  It did nothing for me.  I was better off with some Head and Shoulders.</li>
