            <li> This product is amazing.. I  been looking for a good cleanser that will not harsh my skin type. I been dealing with sensitive and acne prone skin since I was in high-school. My dermatologist recommend a vivite product for me to use. amazingly it works, my skin is glowing and my skin pores got smaller. Sometimes I will have a break-outs but not like before. What I love about ordering in amazon is it&#x27;s a lot cheaper comparing to MSRP. I will rate this product as 5 without a doubt.</li>
            <li> All Vivite products are top quality.  But this is by far their BEST product....does an amazing job of exfoliating your skin.  I have very sensitive skin and it still works great for me.  I look 10 years younger!  Great for sun spots, wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and it is really amazing. I use it weekly 3 times and it made my skin so smooth I can&#x27;t stop feeling my skin... and I really love this product. I would highly recommend this product. Vivite product rocks!! This retailer has this product really low price compared to doctor&#x27;s office.I would buy next time from the same merchant.</li>
            <li> Originally introduced to this cleanser by my dermatologist. I love the results! I have used this product in my daily routine for quite some time and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and have that wicked combination of oily/acne prone skin and middle age wrinkle onset (crows feet, etc).  It&#x27;s tough to find a product that isn&#x27;t too greasy, cleans away the makeup, doesn&#x27;t have fragrance, and exfoliates while you cleanse.  This does all that.  It&#x27;s expensive but not as expensive as bad skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every couple of days.  Like the feel when you rinse it off.  Will continue to purchase.  I have been using it for about 6 months.  I don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations of beauty products.  I just want to maintain my skin as I am older.</li>
            <li> Product is counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Used Vivite products for several years. Recommended by a dermatologist. Gave my daughter (44) the serum, daily and exfoliating cleaner and daily moisturizer 2 years ago for her birthday. She, like her mother, love the Vivite line.</li>
            <li> Face looks awful since using this line of products, breaking out no glow to skin, my skin wasn&#x27;t bad before but now dull</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skincare line, I&#x27;ve been using this over a year now and my face has never looked better. I get compliments on my skin all the time and it&#x27;s because of the glycolic acid. I highly recommend Vivite&#x27;</li>
            <li> Again, I have used Vivite skincare products for a few years now and am still pleases by them. This is a great facial exfoliator that leaves the face cleans and smooth. I will def continue to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial wash out there for aging and troubled skin. It is the perfect combination of chemical and physical exfoliation and I use it twice a day with no problems.  I&#x27;m 54 (yikes) and have used this product for about 8 years and enjoy the compliments on my &amp;#34;beautiful skin.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t take credit for my skin because I know it&#x27;s the Vivite exfoliating cleanser that does all the work keeping my skin smooth and even. Thanks Vivite! :-)</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best exfoliates I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s very effective in keeping my acne-prone skin clear and fresh. My skins feel much smoother after using it. I use it before bed every night and wake up looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> Perfect size exfoliation beads; very gentle on skin. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell - so nothing is unpleasant. It really is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Vivite line.  I constantly have people asking me what I use on my face to keep it so smooth.  I use the whole line of VIvite, including this cleanser twice a day.</li>
            <li> Ive had really bad skin for about ten years and it finally cleared up it is also slowly removing all the scarring on my face. A little bit goes a long way!!</li>

            <li> This one is an absolute must-have! It exfoliates the best and leaves my skin super soft. I would reccoment this product to anyone with acne prone, oily skin type</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a great exfoliant and really freshens up your skin. For anyone who is having issues with it, it is NOT to be used as a DAILY cleanser. This is something you should use only a few times a week, as instructed, for the best results. It&#x27;s meant as a compliment to your regular routine. I actually use it only once a week during the winter and maybe 2 or 3x a week when the weather is warmer and more humid. I never use it 2 days in a row. I have noticed a significant difference in the softness of my skin. It&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use all of the VIVITE Line with wonderful results. This facial cleanser leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Great for all types of skin</li>
            <li> Since its the middle of winter I am curious as to whether my dry skin is weather related or due to this face wash. I like it a lot, but wish it didn&#x27;t make my face so dry. And there is a warning that you must wear a really high SPF every day because this makes your face so sensitive. That kind of worries me...</li>
            <li> awesome exfoliating cleanser! all vivite products work great to fade spots and fill wrinkles and give skin a healthier younger appearance.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years and happy to find it on Amazon at a more reasonable price. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Last forever because a small amount is needed.  I bought some for xmas gifts.  Quality and price is very good.</li>
            <li> I am nearly 64, and have been using this product for 5 years.  No one can believe that I am that age!  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to maintain the youthful appearance of her skin.</li>
