            <li>I also love the way the tools lift up to reveal a mirror, very handy!  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand why people wrote soany good reviews on the product, i suppose they get paid for it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the light kit and it is perfect for my strawberry blond coloring.</li>
            <li>Fair price considering</li>
            <li>It is a really good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you have a tendency to rub around the brow area this powder manage to stay put until bedtime when one presumably washes their face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good set that has everything I need to fill in my over plucked eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>The seller was so quick to deliver the product which was really great!</li>
            <li>I love love love it !!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great, but the product crumbles more than I want it too.</li>
            <li>Love it great item.</li>
            <li>The white/off-white color pigment is nice and bright on my eyelids</li>
            <li>Really nice colors and good quality.</li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Easy to carry around, great color for lighter eyebrows</li>
            <li>Very light, good for filling eyebrow gaps, but you still need a liner for the outline.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this product and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>and they said they thought my brows just got darker on their own.</li>
            <li>These colors are nice shades.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Milani products and this one did not disappoint me.</li>
            <li>And the colors are nice touch too</li>
            <li>I found that it went on nicely</li>
            <li>it all blends nicely.</li>
            <li>but it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>I loved this :)  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and nice looking!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and makes my sparse eyebrows look nice.</li>
            <li>Looks good and is easy to apply</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>This is the PERFECT product to create a natural look.</li>
            <li>I just started doing my brows and this is easy for a beginner!</li>
            <li>Easy to use too!</li>
            <li>Shipper sent in a very appropriately sized bubble wrapped package; not one of those hugely inappropriate boxes.</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The two colors make it easy to get the perfect shade to match your natural brow.</li>
            <li>The colors are perfect and easy to blend for a natural color.</li>
            <li>She loves it and is so pleased with how easy it is to use and how nice it looks.</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>This has higher pigments than the Anastasia powder, amazing!</li>
            <li>I hope to learn to use the powder better the more that I use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, use it every day.</li>
            <li>Not only is it inexpensive, but the colors are perfect for blending or using alone.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Love the powder.  </li>
            <li>Suprisingly, the middle color is actually perfect for my eyebrows and I use the darkest color with a seperate brush as lid liner.</li>
            <li>I like the way it looks on my eyebrows better than an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I could ask for nothing more.</li>
            <li>For a powder, it goes on nice and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It is okay -</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it, it has NO red tones and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>For example I bought the lightest shade of the NYX cake powder for your eyebrows and I like this Milani set wayyyy better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have ash blonde brows and a mix of the two works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with how this order went out and would buy again.</li>
            <li>And delivered in more than timely fashion</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect neutral tones for me, but still obvious I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>so I did purchase a better angle brush for this.</li>
            <li>It works better than a brow pencil.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love how everything is so compact.</li>
            <li>I love the tweezers too.</li>
            <li>This kit gives me the ability to create natural-looking brows, and I feel much more &#x27;presentable&#x27; as a result.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this great product for such a great price, definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Applies very nicely and blends very well.</li>
            <li>I am blonde so the colors fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde with very fair features.</li>
            <li>This was perfect to just give a little definition to my brows.  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s important so that you can gauge when trying to figure out the correct number to buy.  </li>
            <li>#1 is called Light....</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, most much more expensive, but your is the BEST.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use cheap tweezers anyways.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are not that light either,</li>
            <li>Colors match my light brown brows.</li>
            <li>i have light brown but sparse eyebrows and this color</li>
            <li>The brow colors are a light neutral tan and a medium neutral brown, and the highlighter is a light shimmery ivory.  </li>
            <li>They apply smoothly with the enclosed applicator and brush.  </li>
            <li>I have ombre hair and light medium skin</li>
            <li>The lighter filler works fairly well filling in thin brows and the darker brow filler is just a touch off brown and is ideally suited for blondes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased the Medium Shade for my brown brows, however I found the color in the Medium a bit too reddish, thus ordered Light.</li>
            <li>Awesome little kit!</li>
            <li>I found a mineral powder by bare essentuals that I loved and used for years before it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>My natural brows are ash blond so that middle color is perfect.</li>
            <li>Good light brown color with no red undertones.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with light hair and most of the eyebrow powders at the store are dark.</li>
            <li>this one is nice and vivid-</li>
            <li>This fills in nicely and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Especially when used with a good brow brush.</li>
            <li>However, please note thatt his particular coloration works best on natural blondes who have light eyebrows in the blonde spectrum.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, looks natural</li>
            <li>So easy to use and the perfect color for someone with dark blonde brows!</li>
            <li>This is kit does very well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The kit came pretty early after buying it and the powders came compact, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I tend to not use the brow filler (which is very light) as much as I use the darker brow filler which gives an overall better result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was no reddish tint to it, like I found in others, so it looks more natural for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the buy..</li>
            <li>Before I would just pencil them in but this eyebrow pallete makes my eyebrows look more natural.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the brushes inside useful</li>
            <li>Very nice little kit.</li>
            <li>The packaging is so convenient, keeping the brushes and tweezers right along with the powders.</li>
            <li>it turned out just right.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I actually have nice eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I find this little case easy to use..............a very light color for a shadow under the brown and light brown for you first part of your brow and a darker color for you to lengthen the brow.............</li>
            <li>Great little tools!</li>
            <li>Too easy, too natural!</li>
            <li>I only use the light and the medium shades as I have fair skin and blonde hair</li>
            <li>and for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>It comes with little tweasers and brushes to make your eyebrows look good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually been using it as an eyeshadow, and I love the colors.  </li>
            <li>If I could give a higher rating I would.  </li>
            <li>I really love it and will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>First brow kit I have bought.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used Milani Brow fix</li>
            <li>This is the first powder eyebrow makeup I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a highlighter and the brushes and tweezers (and the tweezers actually DO work)</li>
            <li>I tend to use them more than my regular sized ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable; I suggest outlining your brow first.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what was represented and what I have been using for eons.  </li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Love this product- was worried the color would be too dark or too light-</li>
            <li>(46, shh;).&lt;br /&gt;The high light color, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;The tools, such a handy little treat</li>
            <li>Colors are just what I expected and the little brushes are the perfect tool for the job.</li>
            <li>My favorite daily eyebrow material - I have lost a lot of eyebrow as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li>It easy to apply instructions on the back</li>
            <li>All the little utensils are nice too.</li>
            <li>Works amazing with my white skin and blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like when I spread on a cream eyeshadow and you can&#x27;t really see it-</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>I love the product and was surprised they were in the box because one side of the box open.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brow powders, I have dark blonde hair but dark eyebrows and the light was still perfect match.</li>
            <li>also looks very natural unlike others I have bought, I would recomend this product!</li>
            <li>My coloring is fair with about half grey hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the brushes are tiny but easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>I love this little kit!  </li>
            <li>However the highlight works very well with my brows and the small tweezers were very helpful and useful!</li>
            <li>They said my brows look very natural.</li>
            <li>waxing might miss, and the brush is very soft hair.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural on sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the light and it&#x27;s still way too dark for my brows.  </li>
            <li>Light #01 won&#x27;t work for most people with even slightly darker hair bordering on brown or dark ash blonde.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look natural and the color lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old for sparkly makeup.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The colors are natural and one kit with everything in it.</li>
            <li>So soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>Creates natural soft brows</li>
            <li>and I think looks quite natural.  </li>
            <li>Blends wells, looks natural.</li>
            <li>The colors are subtle and blendable with cute, very usable brushes included, and it&#x27;s compact enough for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I use this on a daily basis, it has cute little tools like tweezers!</li>
            <li>Love that tweezers very usual.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this especially for those who are new to filling in their eyebrows or adding shape to their brows!</li>
            <li>Fabulous little kit!  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as easy to use and long lasting as I expected</li>
            <li>The tweezers are surprisingly very useful even though they are small.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are so light you can hardly see them.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers are so tiny you can really get to those stubborn little hairs</li>

            <li> It fills in my eyebrows, makes them look great</li>
            <li> but the option of having 2 colors is great.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your great product and expedient shipping.</li>

            <li> Perfect kit for the girls who love to do their brows.</li>
            <li> I also love the way the tools lift up to reveal a mirror, very handy!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand why people wrote soany good reviews on the product, i suppose they get paid for it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the light kit and it is perfect for my strawberry blond coloring.</li>
            <li> Fair price considering</li>
            <li> It is a really good product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you have a tendency to rub around the brow area this powder manage to stay put until bedtime when one presumably washes their face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good set that has everything I need to fill in my over plucked eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> The seller was so quick to deliver the product which was really great!</li>
            <li> I love love love it !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great, but the product crumbles more than I want it too.</li>
            <li> Love it great item.</li>
            <li> The white/off-white color pigment is nice and bright on my eyelids</li>
            <li> Really nice colors and good quality.</li>
            <li> Love this brow kit!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Easy to carry around, great color for lighter eyebrows</li>
            <li> Very light, good for filling eyebrow gaps, but you still need a liner for the outline.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> and they said they thought my brows just got darker on their own.</li>
            <li> These colors are nice shades.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Milani products and this one did not disappoint me.</li>
            <li> And the colors are nice touch too</li>
            <li> I found that it went on nicely</li>
            <li> it all blends nicely.</li>
            <li> but it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> I loved this :)  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and nice looking!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and makes my sparse eyebrows look nice.</li>
            <li> Looks good and is easy to apply</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT product to create a natural look.</li>
            <li> I just started doing my brows and this is easy for a beginner!</li>
            <li> Easy to use too!</li>
            <li> Shipper sent in a very appropriately sized bubble wrapped package; not one of those hugely inappropriate boxes.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The two colors make it easy to get the perfect shade to match your natural brow.</li>
            <li> The colors are perfect and easy to blend for a natural color.</li>
            <li> She loves it and is so pleased with how easy it is to use and how nice it looks.</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> This has higher pigments than the Anastasia powder, amazing!</li>
            <li> I hope to learn to use the powder better the more that I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, use it every day.</li>
            <li> Not only is it inexpensive, but the colors are perfect for blending or using alone.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> Love the powder.  </li>
            <li> Suprisingly, the middle color is actually perfect for my eyebrows and I use the darkest color with a seperate brush as lid liner.</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks on my eyebrows better than an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I could ask for nothing more.</li>
            <li> For a powder, it goes on nice and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It is okay -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it, it has NO red tones and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> For example I bought the lightest shade of the NYX cake powder for your eyebrows and I like this Milani set wayyyy better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have ash blonde brows and a mix of the two works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with how this order went out and would buy again.</li>
            <li> And delivered in more than timely fashion</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect neutral tones for me, but still obvious I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> so I did purchase a better angle brush for this.</li>
            <li> It works better than a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love how everything is so compact.</li>
            <li> I love the tweezers too.</li>
            <li> This kit gives me the ability to create natural-looking brows, and I feel much more &#x27;presentable&#x27; as a result.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this great product for such a great price, definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Applies very nicely and blends very well.</li>
            <li> I am blonde so the colors fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde with very fair features.</li>
            <li> This was perfect to just give a little definition to my brows.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s important so that you can gauge when trying to figure out the correct number to buy.  </li>
            <li> #1 is called Light....</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, most much more expensive, but your is the BEST.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use cheap tweezers anyways.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are not that light either,</li>
            <li> Colors match my light brown brows.</li>
            <li> i have light brown but sparse eyebrows and this color</li>
            <li> The brow colors are a light neutral tan and a medium neutral brown, and the highlighter is a light shimmery ivory.  </li>
            <li> They apply smoothly with the enclosed applicator and brush.  </li>
            <li> I have ombre hair and light medium skin</li>
            <li> The lighter filler works fairly well filling in thin brows and the darker brow filler is just a touch off brown and is ideally suited for blondes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the Medium Shade for my brown brows, however I found the color in the Medium a bit too reddish, thus ordered Light.</li>
            <li> Awesome little kit!</li>
            <li> I found a mineral powder by bare essentuals that I loved and used for years before it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> My natural brows are ash blond so that middle color is perfect.</li>
            <li> Good light brown color with no red undertones.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with light hair and most of the eyebrow powders at the store are dark.</li>
            <li> this one is nice and vivid-</li>
            <li> This fills in nicely and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Especially when used with a good brow brush.</li>
            <li> However, please note thatt his particular coloration works best on natural blondes who have light eyebrows in the blonde spectrum.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, looks natural</li>
            <li> So easy to use and the perfect color for someone with dark blonde brows!</li>
            <li> This is kit does very well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The kit came pretty early after buying it and the powders came compact, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I tend to not use the brow filler (which is very light) as much as I use the darker brow filler which gives an overall better result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was no reddish tint to it, like I found in others, so it looks more natural for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the buy..</li>
            <li> Before I would just pencil them in but this eyebrow pallete makes my eyebrows look more natural.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the brushes inside useful</li>
            <li> Very nice little kit.</li>
            <li> The packaging is so convenient, keeping the brushes and tweezers right along with the powders.</li>
            <li> it turned out just right.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I actually have nice eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I find this little case easy to use..............a very light color for a shadow under the brown and light brown for you first part of your brow and a darker color for you to lengthen the brow.............</li>
            <li> Great little tools!</li>
            <li> Too easy, too natural!</li>
            <li> I only use the light and the medium shades as I have fair skin and blonde hair</li>
            <li> and for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I like this very much.  </li>
            <li> It comes with little tweasers and brushes to make your eyebrows look good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using it as an eyeshadow, and I love the colors.  </li>
            <li> If I could give a higher rating I would.  </li>
            <li> I really love it and will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li> First brow kit I have bought.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> The first time I used Milani Brow fix</li>
            <li> This is the first powder eyebrow makeup I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a highlighter and the brushes and tweezers (and the tweezers actually DO work)</li>
            <li> I tend to use them more than my regular sized ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable; I suggest outlining your brow first.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what was represented and what I have been using for eons.  </li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Love this product- was worried the color would be too dark or too light-</li>
            <li> (46, shh;).&lt;br /&gt;The high light color, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;The tools, such a handy little treat</li>
            <li> Colors are just what I expected and the little brushes are the perfect tool for the job.</li>
            <li> My favorite daily eyebrow material - I have lost a lot of eyebrow as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li> It easy to apply instructions on the back</li>
            <li> All the little utensils are nice too.</li>
            <li> Works amazing with my white skin and blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like when I spread on a cream eyeshadow and you can&#x27;t really see it-</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> I love the product and was surprised they were in the box because one side of the box open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brow powders, I have dark blonde hair but dark eyebrows and the light was still perfect match.</li>
            <li> also looks very natural unlike others I have bought, I would recomend this product!</li>
            <li> My coloring is fair with about half grey hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the brushes are tiny but easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> I love this little kit!  </li>
            <li> However the highlight works very well with my brows and the small tweezers were very helpful and useful!</li>
            <li> They said my brows look very natural.</li>
            <li> waxing might miss, and the brush is very soft hair.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural on sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the light and it&#x27;s still way too dark for my brows.  </li>
            <li> Light #01 won&#x27;t work for most people with even slightly darker hair bordering on brown or dark ash blonde.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look natural and the color lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old for sparkly makeup.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The colors are natural and one kit with everything in it.</li>
            <li> So soft and durable.  </li>
            <li> Creates natural soft brows</li>
            <li> and I think looks quite natural.  </li>
            <li> Blends wells, looks natural.</li>
            <li> The colors are subtle and blendable with cute, very usable brushes included, and it&#x27;s compact enough for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis, it has cute little tools like tweezers!</li>
            <li> Love that tweezers very usual.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this especially for those who are new to filling in their eyebrows or adding shape to their brows!</li>
            <li> Fabulous little kit!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as easy to use and long lasting as I expected</li>
            <li> The tweezers are surprisingly very useful even though they are small.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are so light you can hardly see them.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are so tiny you can really get to those stubborn little hairs</li>
            <li> would recommend this to everybody that wants fuller, or less bald eyebrows!</li>
            <li> The tweezers work well for stray hairs, but are probably too small to do the whole brow.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different products for my blonde eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde with dark eyebrows</li>
            <li> fills in where i need but not took dark for my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> so I use the darker brown and brush the brows to remove any loose powder.</li>
            <li> I spent under $10.00 at Wall Mart for this brow kit.  </li>
            <li> What you get with this set is a small angled tweezer, a foam highlighting applicator, a slanted brow brush, a high light base color, and two brow fillers.</li>
            <li> Tiny angled brush, small tweezers and applicator.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;ve bought this product before, you&#x27;re not really aware how small it actually is.</li>
            <li> &amp; if you manage to mess up &amp; go to heavily with color in 1 area, you can use the brushes that come with it to blend it down - especially for people like me who once upon a time over plucked.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too dark</li>
            <li> I have also used the medium and find that it&#x27;s just a tad to dark for me.</li>
            <li> I got my set at Meijer for less than $7.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because this one little case does everything......</li>
            <li> Eyebrow pencils, even professional tinting, always looked fake.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bound to stay on all day, though it may need a few touch ups.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pencils for my brows and disliked their harsh appearance.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for my eyeshadow and brows for the past 3 years</li>
            <li> They work well and they are so small.</li>
            <li> The tools pop up to reveal a small mirror.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the blonde, because I have a &amp;#34;dirty blonde&amp;#34; hair color, but</li>
            <li> Being blonde, it is very difficult to find a brow powder that doesn&#x27;t look too harsh.</li>
            <li> it ends up hard to find.  </li>
            <li> The brush used to outline is very small but workable.</li>
            <li> I can make them thin or thicker, depending what mood I am in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I started using this people started complimenting me on my eyebrows which was really strange because I used to hate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus offering 3 shades helps for how dramatic you want your brows.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I had called up another vendor about a product they had cheated me, and would not respond to my emails.  </li>
            <li> The brow powder does not show up on me at all, maybe I got the wrong color</li>
            <li> The simplistic process has made this my go to eyebrow fix kit.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for after being disappointed by gel fillers, that were either extremely thick and gloppy or just plain awful.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows are sparse and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would make them look fuller without looking fake and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Again, I am so sorry I took my anger and disgust for another vendor</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t work for my color</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest buying a wax base to put it on with tho</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My eyebrows are so light you can hardly see them.  Eyebrow pencils, even professional tinting, always looked fake.  I&#x27;m still learning how to apply this but I love it.  My eyebrows look natural and the color lasts all day.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this brow kit!  There was no reddish tint to it, like I found in others, so it looks more natural for me.  I also love the way the tools lift up to reveal a mirror, very handy!  Good price for a great brow kit.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry around, great color for lighter eyebrows and i can find an use of everything inside, especially the Hi-Lite.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors, and beautifully matte.  I&#x27;ve actually been using it as an eyeshadow, and I love the colors.  I&#x27;m too old for sparkly makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great, but the product crumbles more than I want it too. Like, every time I dip a brush in one of the colors, I lose a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different products for my blonde eyebrows. This is the best I have tried. My best friend and sister noticed a difference in my appearance but couldn&#x27;t pick out what it was. I told them and they said they thought my brows just got darker on their own. They said my brows look very natural.</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> This is kit does very well and easy to use.  The kit brightens the eyes and its all together .</li>
            <li> Great Gift! Very Nice!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works well and doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too dark which is something I worried about.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in any store around me anymore. It&#x27;s a shame because this one little case does everything......and for a very reasonable price.  I mix the bottom 2 colors (one swipe on each palette) and apply.  The brush comes with it and is perfect for applying. My coloring is fair with about half grey hair. I mention this because no one else has and I think it&#x27;s important so that you can gauge when trying to figure out the correct number to buy.  #1 is called Light....#2 is called Medium. I have also used the medium and find that it&#x27;s just a tad to dark for me.</li>
            <li> Tried this product when the former one I used was no longer manufactured.  I like this very much.  Looks good and is easy to apply</li>
            <li> I like this powder better than the Anastasia brow duo! This has higher pigments than the Anastasia powder, amazing! I got my set at Meijer for less than $7. The hi-lite powder is great too. I want to watch a couple YouTube videos to see how others apply this. I had to fill in gaps with my Anastasia brow wiz pencil. I hope to learn to use the powder better the more that I use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, looks natural</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The two colors make it easy to get the perfect shade to match your natural brow. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I had called up another vendor about a product they had cheated me, and would not respond to my emails.  I thought I was reviewing them, not you. I love this product, use it every day. People who know me know I lost all my brow hair as a result of chemo treatments. I have tried many products, most much more expensive, but your is the BEST. Again, I am so sorry I took my anger and disgust for another vendor&lt;br /&gt;out on you. If I could give a higher rating I would.  Thank You for your product and time.</li>
            <li> My teenager loves this product.  The colors are subtle and blendable with cute, very usable brushes included, and it&#x27;s compact enough for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why people wrote soany good reviews on the product, i suppose they get paid for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago and still have plenty left. Not only is it inexpensive, but the colors are perfect for blending or using alone. I especially love the highlighting powder. The tweezers are so tiny you can really get to those stubborn little hairs waxing might miss, and the brush is very soft hair. I did not purchase this on amazon, but at a local store, pricing is the same , I will definitely be purchasing from amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this product.. It&#x27;s worth the buy.. It easy to apply instructions on the back also looks very natural unlike others I have bought, I would recomend this product!</li>
            <li> Best brow kit yet. Love the powder.  Only used Mary Kay brow stick but after trying this I would never go back.</li>
            <li> Very nice little kit. I purchased the light kit and it is perfect for my strawberry blond coloring. Suprisingly, the middle color is actually perfect for my eyebrows and I use the darkest color with a seperate brush as lid liner. The compact mirror is magnified and the included tweezers very handy. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I would think of this but I must admit it was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  I really love it and will definitely order again.  It fills in my eyebrows, makes them look great and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I just started doing my brows and this is easy for a beginner!</li>
            <li> Perfect kit for the girls who love to do their brows. My natural brows are ash blond so that middle color is perfect.</li>
            <li> First brow kit I have bought.</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks on my eyebrows better than an eyebrow pencil.  I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Fabulous little kit!  Use it at home and perfect size for travel.  Colors are just what I expected and the little brushes are the perfect tool for the job.</li>
            <li> Got mine months ago and I&#x27;m in love! This is a definite, would purchase again. 😍</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t work for my color but the option of having 2 colors is great. You can also mix them to get the perfect color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I started using this people started complimenting me on my eyebrows which was really strange because I used to hate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everybody that wants fuller, or less bald eyebrows! It really works!</li>
            <li> Love it great item. I&#x27;ve bought it before and it&#x27;s something I use whenever I do my makeup. I would suggest buying a wax base to put it on with tho so it lasts. The tweezers suck, but that&#x27;s understandable. I don&#x27;t use cheap tweezers anyways.</li>
            <li> I love the colors! Perfect for my age (46, shh;).&lt;br /&gt;The high light color, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;The tools, such a handy little treat this purchase was.</li>
            <li> A perfect brow kit! I could ask for nothing more.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I actually have nice eyebrows. I can make them thin or thicker, depending what mood I am in. For a powder, it goes on nice and smoothly.  When I am finished I use a wax stick over them to make them stay in place.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Looks very natural on sparse eyebrows.  I&#x27;m blonde with dark eyebrows so I use the darker brown and brush the brows to remove any loose powder.</li>
            <li> It is okay - I only use the darker color to color in my very blonde brows.</li>
            <li> My favorite daily eyebrow material - I have lost a lot of eyebrow as I have gotten older.  This fills in nicely and looks natural.</li>
            <li> The first time I used Milani Brow fix I was impressed. Applies very nicely and blends very well. What a great product!  The color is perfect and the brush, applicator and the tweezers are an added bonus all compact in one case.  I will definately purchase this again. Amazon seems to be the only place I&#x27;ve found it and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome I love it</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my eyebrows.  Thank you for your great product and expedient shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the first powder eyebrow makeup I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it! Before I would just pencil them in but this eyebrow pallete makes my eyebrows look more natural. I love that it comes with a highlighter and the brushes and tweezers (and the tweezers actually DO work) I also have sensitive skin and I have acne prone skin and this product doesn&#x27;t break me out which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Especially when used with a good brow brush. The colors are perfect and easy to blend for a natural color.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and the perfect color for someone with dark blonde brows! The colors blend together so well</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this.  It wasn&#x27;t as easy to use and long lasting as I expected</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the Medium Shade for my brown brows, however I found the color in the Medium a bit too reddish, thus ordered Light. I love it, it has NO red tones and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> The brow powder does not show up on me at all, maybe I got the wrong color but it doesn&#x27;t show. However the highlight works very well with my brows and the small tweezers were very helpful and useful!</li>
            <li> I am happy I found this product as it is very good</li>
            <li> I purchased the light and it&#x27;s still way too dark for my brows.  I have blonde hair.  My eyebrows are not that light either,</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> I love this it works great!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for a teenager. She loves it and is so pleased with how easy it is to use and how nice it looks. Would recommend and may even buy some for myself.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and nice looking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brow powders, I have dark blonde hair but dark eyebrows and the light was still perfect match. I can go out without makeup on but my brows are a must and this kit makes them perfect!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I am fair skinned with light hair and most of the eyebrow powders at the store are dark. For example I bought the lightest shade of the NYX cake powder for your eyebrows and I like this Milani set wayyyy better. It comes with little tweasers and brushes to make your eyebrows look good. Yes.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow kit has just what you need to shape your brows and fill them in without being overdone: Tiny angled brush, small tweezers and applicator. The tweezers are surprisingly very useful even though they are small. I tend to use them more than my regular sized ones. These colors are nice shades. Shipper sent in a very appropriately sized bubble wrapped package; not one of those hugely inappropriate boxes. Fair price considering I cannot find Milani in any stores recently.</li>
            <li> Being blonde, it is very difficult to find a brow powder that doesn&#x27;t look too harsh. This is the PERFECT product to create a natural look. The packaging is so convenient, keeping the brushes and tweezers right along with the powders. I am so glad I found this great product for such a great price, definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!! I love this palette! It&#x27;s PERFECT if you have very light eyebrows!! I would recommend this especially for those who are new to filling in their eyebrows or adding shape to their brows!</li>
            <li> I have always liked Milani products and this one did not disappoint me. The colors are natural and one kit with everything in it. The seller was so quick to deliver the product which was really great!</li>
            <li> Keeps your eyebrows looking perf</li>
            <li> Love that tweezers very usual. And the colors are nice touch too</li>
            <li> Love this! Really nice colors and good quality.</li>
            <li> great color match &amp; that each color pad tells you what it&#x27;s used for.  I found that it went on nicely &amp; if you manage to mess up &amp; go to heavily with color in 1 area, you can use the brushes that come with it to blend it down - especially for people like me who once upon a time over plucked.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s awsome</li>
            <li> This is one of the easiest eyebrow fix kits I&#x27;ve used. The simplistic process has made this my go to eyebrow fix kit. I use it daily, and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Awesome little kit! I have ash blonde brows and a mix of the two works perfectly!</li>
            <li> The kit came pretty early after buying it and the powders came compact, which was a nice surprise. Unless you&#x27;ve bought this product before, you&#x27;re not really aware how small it actually is. It&#x27;s durable; I suggest outlining your brow first. If you want it to stay on all day, spray your spoolie/brush with hairspray and brush how you want. It&#x27;s bound to stay on all day, though it may need a few touch ups. I&#x27;m pleased with how this order went out and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I find this little case easy to use..............a very light color for a shadow under the brown and light brown for you first part of your brow and a darker color for you to lengthen the brow.............the brushes are tiny but easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what was represented and what I have been using for eons.  Great product.  And delivered in more than timely fashion</li>
            <li> I have been using this for my eyeshadow and brows for the past 3 years and I love it. It&#x27;s the perfect neutral tones for me, but still obvious I&#x27;m wearing makeup. The white/off-white color pigment is nice and bright on my eyelids which is what I like- I don&#x27;t like when I spread on a cream eyeshadow and you can&#x27;t really see it- this one is nice and vivid- I guess that means it&#x27;s pigmented well.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with this product. Colors match my light brown brows. I didn&#x27;t find the brushes inside useful so I did purchase a better angle brush for this.</li>
            <li> i have light brown but sparse eyebrows and this color is perfect for me. fills in where i need but not took dark for my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow fix I have ever used. I am blonde so the colors fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is a really good product.  Using it takes some getting used to.  That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love love love it !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works perfect for me! Too easy, too natural! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis, it has cute little tools like tweezers!</li>
            <li> It works better than a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Love this. Best eyebrow system I have ever used. I love how everything is so compact. It also has all the tools you need for perfect brows. Plus offering 3 shades helps for how dramatic you want your brows. I love the tweezers too. They work well and they are so small. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It really works!  Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> 2nd set.  Still awesome.  So soft and durable.  Great sheets for a great price. Going to keep ordering for family.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Creates natural soft brows</li>
            <li> I love this little kit!  The brow colors are a light neutral tan and a medium neutral brown, and the highlighter is a light shimmery ivory.  They apply smoothly with the enclosed applicator and brush.  The tweezers work well for stray hairs, but are probably too small to do the whole brow.The tools pop up to reveal a small mirror.  All in all, a great value for the money</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are sparse and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would make them look fuller without looking fake and unpleasant.  This kit gives me the ability to create natural-looking brows, and I feel much more &#x27;presentable&#x27; as a result.</li>
            <li> What you get with this set is a small angled tweezer, a foam highlighting applicator, a slanted brow brush, a high light base color, and two brow fillers. The lighter filler works fairly well filling in thin brows and the darker brow filler is just a touch off brown and is ideally suited for blondes.&lt;br /&gt;To use this I found a Michelle Phan video on the internet which made this a snap to apply. I tend to not use the brow filler (which is very light) as much as I use the darker brow filler which gives an overall better result.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have a tendency to rub around the brow area this powder manage to stay put until bedtime when one presumably washes their face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good set that has everything I need to fill in my over plucked eyebrows. However, please note thatt his particular coloration works best on natural blondes who have light eyebrows in the blonde spectrum. Light #01 won&#x27;t work for most people with even slightly darker hair bordering on brown or dark ash blonde.</li>
            <li> Very nice! I was skeptical about the blonde, because I have a &amp;#34;dirty blonde&amp;#34; hair color, but it all blends nicely. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The brush used to outline is very small but workable. I suppose that is what makes it compact.  Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy. It&#x27;s compact. Very light, good for filling eyebrow gaps, but you still need a liner for the outline.</li>
            <li> I am very fair (the fairest of the fair) and was concerned about using a brow kit.  (I&#x27;ve never &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; my eyebrows before.)  This kit is just what I wanted and I think looks quite natural.  Easy to use too!</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my eyebrows and utube has video on how to use it. All the little utensils are nice too.</li>
            <li> Have bought this before.  Perfect for my brow needs.  I didn&#x27;t like some of the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brow kit. I&#x27;m a blonde with very fair features. I&#x27;ve used pencils for my brows and disliked their harsh appearance. I found a mineral powder by bare essentuals that I loved and used for years before it was discontinued. I stumbled across this product and it is amazing. I absolutely love it. Blends wells, looks natural. I&#x27;m very happy to have found this brow kit!</li>
            <li> Good light brown color with no red undertones. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product- was worried the color would be too dark or too light- it turned out just right.  No issues with anything.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and makes my sparse eyebrows look nice.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and knew what I am getting.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! Works amazing with my white skin and blonde hair. Having 2 shades of brown and lighter-brown is great, depending on my mood I change my looks every day.</li>
            <li> Love this! Works great. Great little tools!</li>
            <li> I spent under $10.00 at Wall Mart for this brow kit.  It was just what I was looking for after being disappointed by gel fillers, that were either extremely thick and gloppy or just plain awful.  Buy this.</li>
            <li> I love the product and was surprised they were in the box because one side of the box open.</li>
            <li> This was perfect to just give a little definition to my brows.  I only use the light and the medium shades as I have fair skin and blonde hair but it does a nice job.  I purchased additional to have as I know sometimes when I find something I like it ends up hard to find.  I hope this sticks around.</li>
            <li> I loved this :)  I have ombre hair and light medium skin and this looked great! Lasts all day</li>
