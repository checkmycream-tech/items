            <li> This shampoo is a new favorite of mine and, to me, worth the price. I always had dry, damaged, split-end hair but after using this shampoo for just a month, my hair looks and feels a lot healthier. Everyone who knows me has noticed this and pointed it out. I love the scent and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Can use everyday does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated this shampoo. I knew right when I stepped out of the shower that I should just get in and wash it again with a different shampoo. The lack of lather is to be expected but because of this it just sits in your hair and makes it feel so oily once it&#x27;s styled. I did not feel clean at all and my already oily hair was disgusting by day two.</li>
            <li> I love love love this shampoo!!  It smells fab, works amazing on fine hair, great for the scalp.  Did I mention I love this shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(By the way, this seller is great. They have the lowest prices and are quick to remedy any order issues.)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo, but the product really dried my scalp out after a week or so of use. I found that I like the Loreal shampoo with no sulfites in the pinkish bottle, though I just started using it.</li>
            <li> A few years back when I got my hair cut, they used Shampure.  The fragrance was out of this world.  I could smell it all day at work.  I bought a bottle instantly and loved it, loved it, loved it.  Now it seems the last year or more the fragrance is so weak.  I can smell it a little bit when I use it, but then there is nothing.  I thought maybe I was getting too use to the smell, so I switched to something else for awhile.  Then I went back and it was still way too weak.  I think they put less fragrance in it now.  It&#x27;s very disappointing, and even more so, because the stuff is so expensive.  Giving less and still costing way too much.  I&#x27;m not as happy with this product like I was in the beginning.  Hopefully they will bring it back to what it was before.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Leaves my hair so shiny and soft.  Smells wonderful. I will keep ordering this</li>
            <li> I normally love Aveda Shampure but the bottle I received does not smell like true Aveda.  It smells like it&#x27;s half strength Aveda mixed with something else.  I also found out, too late albeit, that I paid way too much for this bottle.  I will be purchasing from the Aveda website from now on.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very clean when I use this shampoo. But I love the smell because it creates an aromatherapy experience in the shower. And being a lover of aromatherapy, I feel more calm and content with this smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the shampoo and the conditioner have such similar bottles that I get them mixed us easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this shampoo if you have dry or damaged hair that requires a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> Excellent great fragrance</li>

Left my hair really clean feeling and light but it was a bit too much as my hair looks and feels drier/frizzier now. I probably won&#x27;t be able to wash my hair for 3 days now.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty disappointed as I saw a lot of great reviews on it, will return I think for something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for the smell. Now I think it&#x27;s a little overpowering and too herby for me. Some days I still feel like using it though, definitely unique.</li>
            <li> works well on hair that  is a little bit dry and oily at the top. smell is clean and herbal.</li>
