            <li>Really feel it working and color matches great!</li>
            <li>You push the body and the concealer comes out through the brush, making it very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Great Product, Arrived Fast.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love what this has done.</li>
            <li>So I take my finger and blend it in, and then the gross color goes away and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Extemley to light!</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>I love about this Almay concealer:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>none of the makeup creases I get with many others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use the brush part...</li>
            <li>Hardly an OK concealer.</li>
            <li>Good coverage and a great color - but creamier, thinner and goo-eyer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, very easy to blend, and glides right</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>

            <li>and they are always perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>The concealer is fine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product a lot.</li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth...</li>
            <li>A brush to clean?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply the right amount.</li>
            <li>I find that the liquid concealers don&#x27;t quite cover as much, but they brighten the under eye area much better.</li>
            <li>It works great at covering my dark circles, which are always there thanks to my very light skin.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it is in a squeeze tube and not the type that cranks because I feel like there is a lot of wasted space that could be used for more product!</li>
            <li>and my whole family said there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Not a good idea for someone with very fair skin.</li>
            <li>My new favorite concealer for early classes!</li>
            <li>Undereye circles are my biggest beauty insecurity, so I&#x27;ve tried so many different formulas.</li>
            <li>I just hope they package it better sometime in the future!</li>
            <li>I just recently started using Almay makeup (from Covergirl) and so far I have been very pleased with all of the purchases I have made.</li>
            <li>This is something I&#x27;ve always had problems with, so when I bought this without even testing the color first, I was pretty excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the FIRST use, the bottle cracked, leaving the makeup to squirt out of the crack.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use powder over it and it looks fine if it&#x27;s the only thing on my face</li>
            <li>The actual formula is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This product really just puts visible yellowish brush strokes under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use but have to be careful when squeezing the tube</li>
            <li>High Quality</li>
            <li>As a sleep deprived high school student with finals this upcoming week, i deffinitley need eye concealer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The price is not too high either.</li>
            <li>IT has helped brighten my eyes, and make them seem to pop a little bit more.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something new for every day wear.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on with the brush it seems like a yellowy gross color.</li>
            <li>almost always the same exact price as the ones on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>After I used it, I actually saw a difference, and that&#x27;s from someone that doesn&#x27;t get too much puffiness......</li>
            <li>Recently, however, I&#x27;ve moved to a very humid environment and can&#x27;t wear it like I used to.  </li>
            <li>I have bad under eye circles and this really brightens the area and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I shower in the morning, and yes I can tell some puffiness going down.</li>
            <li>It does conceal the dark circles pretty well, but does nothing for the puffiness/bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, but the tube was broken and the concealer comes out the side instead of making it to the brush.  </li>

            <li> Love the product, but the tube was broken and the concealer comes out the side instead of making it to the brush.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this item, however during my first use of the product, I found that the base of the applicator leaked concealer.</li>
            <li> It covered well and was long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to using a regular concealer once I run out of this, since this product offered no significant benefit for the extra cost.</li>
            <li> By the time a blended it, it went outside the area where I wanted concealer (trying to cover dark circles under eyes, but ended up with white cheekbones).</li>
            <li> When I squeezed the container too much came out and it was just plain messy, with extra product all over my fingertips to wipe on a tissue.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY gets rids of the dark circles under my eyes, and being a college student</li>
            <li> I open the cap to a mess</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even make it to the brush, unless I attempt to cover up the crack by jamming my finger into it (which only makes a mess.)</li>
            <li> This specific type of cosmetic are not available in our the CR Market</li>
            <li> No, thanks.</li>
            <li> It will get the job done, but not very well.</li>
            <li> Not quite as pale as in the photo, but as I had bought this in a store previously, it was the same color I expected.</li>
            <li> MAYBE this would work with some sort of applicator other than my fingers, but</li>
            <li> like some other reviewers on here, I too received my bottle with a crack on the side, so now the tip brush doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m chronically sleep deprived, and so I always have bags and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use the last half...</li>
            <li> It brightens... seriously counteracts the blue tones of my circles</li>
            <li> I took a few \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos, and the photos tell the story.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t conceal under eye circles, rather it just make my under eye area look messy and yellowish.</li>
            <li> , I have pretty bad</li>
            <li> The brush gets hard and it hurts to apply.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get the make up to come out at all</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s usually hard to match.</li>
            <li> Some concealers are too thick and cakey.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY small amount of makeup considering the cost.  </li>
            <li> Be wary, because if you&#x27;re pale, this will leave that not blended in look, and like you chose the wrong color for you</li>
            <li> I just hate having to mess with stuff that&#x27;s wrapped like a mummy from King Tut&#x27;s tomb, and this stuff qualifies.</li>
            <li> So be a bit wary if you have acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> The container was broken and all the content exits by one side !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still useable, but it&#x27;s annoying and makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Bloody annoying.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is TERRIBLE</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked it.  It covered well and was long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Arrived Fast. High Quality</li>
            <li> Another great Almay product!</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Brush dries up-hard to squeeze.  Concealer is watery.  Dont bother.</li>
            <li> You squeeze the liquid makeup/concealer up through the brush tip to apply it.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks now. I&#x27;m chronically sleep deprived, and so I always have bags and dark circles under my eyes.  I took a few \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos, and the photos tell the story.  It does conceal the dark circles pretty well, but does nothing for the puffiness/bags under my eyes.  This is a VERY small amount of makeup considering the cost.  This one is listed for about $3.50 for .22 ounces, so an ounce would cost you about $17.50!   I&#x27;ll go back to using a regular concealer once I run out of this, since this product offered no significant benefit for the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but have to be careful when squeezing the tube othewise you get a big glob on the end but then I just use my finger to apply.</li>
            <li> As a sleep deprived high school student with finals this upcoming week, i deffinitley need eye concealer. Personally, I love what this has done. IT has helped brighten my eyes, and make them seem to pop a little bit more. The only issue I have is with the brush, for me it doesnt rub in fully. When you first put it on with the brush it seems like a yellowy gross color. So I take my finger and blend it in, and then the gross color goes away and it looks great! i compared one eye to another and my whole family said there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product a lot. I think I would prefer a roll on type of concealer but this does the job for tiny blemishes. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not quite as pale as in the photo, but as I had bought this in a store previously, it was the same color I expected.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this item, however during my first use of the product, I found that the base of the applicator leaked concealer. The color and texture of the product seem to be great though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a bunch of these over the years, and about 75% of them have a crack on the side, so that the liquid comes out the side instead of the brush. It&#x27;s still useable, but it&#x27;s annoying and makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the tube was broken and the concealer comes out the side instead of making it to the brush.  These must be seconds purchased from the manufacturer because I have bought in my local Walgreens and they are always perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> The brush gets hard and it hurts to apply.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This specific type of cosmetic are not available in our the CR Market so , my mother is very happy to have the chance and get ti throut you thanks</li>
            <li> This is one of those places where packaging is a deterrent to me purchasing an item in the future. I just hate having to mess with stuff that&#x27;s wrapped like a mummy from King Tut&#x27;s tomb, and this stuff qualifies. No, thanks.</li>
            <li> The concealer is fine. What I do not like is the brush to apply the make up. It is hard to get the make up to come out at all and when it does a lot comes outs in one clump on the brush.</li>
            <li> This product really just puts visible yellowish brush strokes under my eyes. It didn&#x27;t conceal under eye circles, rather it just make my under eye area look messy and yellowish. Not a good idea for someone with very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product already at the pharmacy store and was already using the almay blemisheal foundation. I put it on right after I shower in the morning, and yes I can tell some puffiness going down. I highly recommend. I never thought of my eyes being puffy, but I see everyone uses them. After I used it, I actually saw a difference, and that&#x27;s from someone that doesn&#x27;t get too much puffiness......</li>
            <li> Extemley to light! No color choices</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for my skin and it&#x27;s easy to apply the right amount. I have bad under eye circles and this really brightens the area and provides good coverage. Some concealers are too thick and cakey. I find that the liquid concealers don&#x27;t quite cover as much, but they brighten the under eye area much better. I like that this concealer emphasizes &amp;#34;waking up&amp;#34; rather than anti aging like a lot of brands now. The price is not too high either. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is okay. Good coverage and a great color - but creamier, thinner and goo-eyer than I expected. When I squeezed the container too much came out and it was just plain messy, with extra product all over my fingertips to wipe on a tissue. By the time a blended it, it went outside the area where I wanted concealer (trying to cover dark circles under eyes, but ended up with white cheekbones). This product has since migrated to the bottom of my makeup box. MAYBE this would work with some sort of applicator other than my fingers, but what? A brush to clean? A wasteful Q-tip with fibers sticking in it?</li>
            <li> The actual formula is great for everyday use. Undereye circles are my biggest beauty insecurity, so I&#x27;ve tried so many different formulas. I have a nighttime-working (I&#x27;m an actor)- event concealer (Stila Perfecting Concealer http://amzn.com/B000BIRHH0 ) but I wanted something new for every day wear. I have fair, nearly-porcelain skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this Almay concealer:&lt;br /&gt;- It brightens... seriously counteracts the blue tones of my circles&lt;br /&gt;- The consistency is smooth... none of the makeup creases I get with many others&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s great on it&#x27;s own... I don&#x27;t need to use powder over it and it looks fine if it&#x27;s the only thing on my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging is TERRIBLE&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve never been able to use the brush part... it likes to project splats onto my face. I use my finger.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush tends to leak... I open the cap to a mess&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s hard to use the last half... it needs to be squeezed out like toothpaste, but the packaging isn&#x27;t flexible enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used three tubes and they&#x27;ve all had the same pros and cons. Ordering this via Subscribe and Save makes it so inexpensive, that I&#x27;ll keep using it for now. I just hope they package it better sometime in the future!</li>
            <li> Hardly an OK concealer. It will get the job done, but not very well. Be wary, because if you&#x27;re pale, this will leave that not blended in look, and like you chose the wrong color for you skin.. but it only does that when it dries which is odd.&lt;br /&gt;Just like some other reviewers on here, I too received my bottle with a crack on the side, so now the tip brush doesn&#x27;t work and I can only get concealer out of that crack. Bloody annoying. Read your reviews and fix it! If you find yourself actually liking this concealer, go buy it in the stores because they are never cracked and almost always the same exact price as the ones on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to figure out if this concealer is making me break out. So be a bit wary if you have acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and I love that it is in a squeeze tube and not the type that cranks because I feel like there is a lot of wasted space that could be used for more product! The shade matched me perfectly. I just recently started using Almay makeup (from Covergirl) and so far I have been very pleased with all of the purchases I have made.</li>
            <li> Excelente for my skin color and also it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! The container was broken and all the content exits by one side !</li>
            <li> I used to wear this all the time as an undereye concealer and highlighter.  It works great at covering my dark circles, which are always there thanks to my very light skin.  You push the body and the concealer comes out through the brush, making it very easy to apply.  Recently, however, I&#x27;ve moved to a very humid environment and can&#x27;t wear it like I used to.  Almost instantly I sweat if off, which isn&#x27;t a problem with the product itself. If I wasn&#x27;t living in this environment I would be wearing this product all the time!</li>
            <li> My new favorite concealer for early classes! Really feel it working and color matches great! I&#x27;m fairskinned with a neutral skintone so it&#x27;s usually hard to match.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I recommend it</li>
            <li> I think I received one Out Dated</li>
            <li> The actual makeup is great:&lt;br /&gt;1) It matches my skin tone PERFECTLY. This is something I&#x27;ve always had problems with, so when I bought this without even testing the color first, I was pretty excited.&lt;br /&gt;2) Very smooth, very easy to blend, and glides right on.&lt;br /&gt;3) Doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all&lt;br /&gt;4) TOTALLY gets rids of the dark circles under my eyes, and being a college student who&#x27;s sleep deprived 90% of the time, I have pretty bad ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle, however, totally blows. On the FIRST use, the bottle cracked, leaving the makeup to squirt out of the crack. It doesn&#x27;t even make it to the brush, unless I attempt to cover up the crack by jamming my finger into it (which only makes a mess.) Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve shared a picture to show what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
