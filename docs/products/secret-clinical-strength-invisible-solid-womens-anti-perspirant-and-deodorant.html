            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent it is perfect and at the end of the day</li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t be impressed by &#x27;60% more value&#x27;, because it&#x27;s also that much more in price!  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful deodorant, and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so impressed at how well this product works to keep me dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I work in a kitchen this is by far the best deodorant out they.</li>
            <li>deodorant smells heavenly too----so nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>deodorant did a great job with not leaving marks on my clothes, leaving me smelling fresh, and protecting odors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>while all of them smell great the lavender is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>With both my job and my photography business i find myself in many sweaty situations.</li>
            <li>With the onset of menopause I am literally sweating more and more.  </li>
            <li>I am totally in love .</li>
            <li>When I saw that you are supposed to apply this at night, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.</li>
            <li>and I loved the fresh scent!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And who says you can&#x27;t love deodorant:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I was provided a free sample from stresssweatchallenge.com to review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Love the gel option and doesn&#x27;t get all smeared on clothing.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I contacted them, they NEVER responded.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about any unwanted odor when I am out, especially on hot Florida days.  </li>

            <li>I love love love this.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be buying this one again.</li>
            <li>The directions say its actually best to apply at night, and then it works even into the next day.</li>
            <li>I did receive this as a sample to try for free, however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>And boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li>This is my newest favorite, and I will be continuing to use this</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not to overpowering.</li>
            <li>i wish i had bought more.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many brands of deoderants---but not this product.</li>
            <li>(Unless of course you lose the top and can not find it or a child or pe gets a hold of it</li>

            <li>Love.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this type of antiperspirant / deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Most of my rating comes from the fact that when I roll it up from the bottom, the piece that anchors the bottom of the stick pushes out the bottom - then if I try to replace that, the protective piece that surrounds the deodorant itself pops up</li>
            <li>This invisible solid is great!!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s sweat proof</li>
            <li>They also have a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>

            <li>Overall, I am highly impressed.</li>
            <li>Not only am I not sweating but I smell great!</li>
            <li>There are so many things that I love about it, first the deodorant smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The product is okay - doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as the original.</li>
            <li>Oh btw, I didn&#x27;t have to put it on for 2 days after first applying it!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing when you are working out and still smell fresh!</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent, I don&#x27;t have marks on my clothes or sweat spots, it lasts all day</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that works all day long!</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance when it goes on, which fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, feels refreshing, and is not noticeable deodorant.</li>
            <li>I am sure variety is fine, but something about it made me break out and irritated in the underarm area.  </li>
            <li>twice.)&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice that was very cool</li>
            <li>I promise you ladies will enjoy this fantastic invention!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t used to have any issues with sweating, but after becoming a mother that all changed.</li>
            <li>I received it for free from stresssweatchallenge.com and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no need to reapply.  </li>
            <li>This product went on easy and worked for me all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy fix although it seems you do lose a couple of applications each time it happens</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy fix although it seems you do lose a couple of applications each time it happens</li>
            <li>I love how great the product worked and that it was invisible so no stains or product left on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I am proud to say that on top of the pleasant scent it held up to the challenge of both keeping me odor free all day long and by not irritating my skin.</li>

            <li>It smells great and keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and I have to say that this one was by far the most impressive product, it kept up with me and my busy day</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps me dry and smelling great</li>
            <li>Smells great, leaves my underarms feeling fresh and clean all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a full size product ASAP</li>

            <li>It goes one smooth keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and clear and has a light scent that I love.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s no Secret that I love this</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a pleasant, clean smell and keeps me dry all day even if I don&#x27;t use it as directed (supposed to apply at night).</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well and goes on super clear.  </li>
            <li>I received my free sample and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and I am totally impressed .  </li>
            <li>and it dries up in the container fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and it was one of the best samples I received.</li>
            <li>A couple clicks and two quick rubs under each arm</li>
            <li>It seems to melt , it feels creamy and quickly dries onto my skin.</li>
            <li>This helped tremendously and kept the stink away.</li>
            <li>I need protection and it is something that I am super self-conscious about.  </li>
            <li>and I just finished completing 13 miles of running, quickly changed shirts in the car, and showed up for lunch with my friends.</li>
            <li>Wish they were still using the kind that you pushed up from the bottom through holes in the top; now it&#x27;s a solid, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have as much control, but I still like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people always trying to find a deodorant that is dependable, smells nice and works great at keeping me dry all day long.  </li>
            <li>I am often outside for most of the day and being sweaty is just gaurenteed!</li>
            <li>I was using a different clinical brand, but now that I&#x27;m in menopause, I find that I am sweating more and smelling stronger than ever before (ew!).</li>
            <li>I am dry and fresh feeling in a good way.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample that I suspect will last me quite a while, but I will absolutely be buying more when it runs out!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to those that cannot seem to find the right deodorant to keep themselves feeling and smelling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>A nice solid that lasts longer than the gel type products.</li>
            <li>Kept me fresh all day without breaking a sweat.</li>
            <li>and i love the scent of The Clinical Strength in Clear Gel, however, this deodorant is not for me.</li>
            <li>It kept me fresh through the day</li>
            <li>I will be fresh all day lone.</li>
            <li>This Secret Clinical Strength deodorant is the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>but i also smelled fresh</li>
            <li>It is worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>It is worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use a smooth solid, but this one was ideal!  </li>
            <li>Does not work well at all &amp; whoever heard of an anti-persirant  that you had to put on right before bed.</li>
            <li>but, if the weather is right, who knows.</li>
            <li>but, if the weather is right, who knows.</li>
            <li>Both are amazing at keeping me fresh, and dry all day.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do and keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>This will now be the only deodorant I use, I loved it that much.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Clinical Strength Invisible Solid as a member of One2One Network</li>
            <li>Thanks to this amazing product from Secret, my pits smell good</li>
            <li>It went on smooth, kept me smelling great and dry all day long even in 100 degree temperatures here in Houston!  </li>
            <li>Great scent!I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li>and I need something strong by soft.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, albeit a bit strong, but it&#x27;s ability to keep me dry with even minimal exertion was none.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling clean all day, even in high humidity.</li>
            <li>But it works very well for me, even in very hot weather and during beach time.  </li>
            <li>With Secret Clinical Strength, I am confident that I will look, feel and smell my best all day long.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to try out the invisible solid deodorant (vs. clear gel deodorant), as it seems that most “invisible solid” deodorants don’t really do a good job at being “invisible”.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>Clinical strength’s, completely clean invisible solid deodorant, provides wetness protection and helps you lead a sweat free life.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell lovely, but it combats sweat and body odor for a majority of the day.  </li>
            <li>But... after having my daughters I suddenly found myself sweating a lot more.</li>
            <li>even when it wasn&#x27;t extremely hot.</li>
            <li>I wear it &amp; it last for more than 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>Nothing sexy about those white marks---gross!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if this is just a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; with Clinical Strength deodorants, but it did seem that I had to reapply a bit more then a regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>My pits can get pretty funky.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s HOT...</li>
            <li>like heat index 112 HOT.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a clinical strength deodorant</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely hooked!</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and I am loving it!</li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot here in the summers, and I tend to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>Much much better than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you want to sample it first, got to there website and try a sample, just pay shipping.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well!</li>
            <li>It smells good and lasts even during a workout with heavy sweating.</li>
            <li>Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Completely Clean scent because it does a great job at keeping me not only feeling but smelling clean and dry all day.</li>
            <li>Overall this deodorant works amazingly, and I was surprised that it helped with razor burn too!</li>
            <li>It works well in the Texas heat, I smell nice, and I&#x27;m not having wet marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li>After putting this to a full days test of hot weather and running after my 5 year old.</li>
            <li>I live in a very hot humid city, and I tend to have problematic stress induced sweat.</li>
            <li>I like the Clear Gel because it feels cool when you apply it</li>
            <li>I get hot fast</li>
            <li>I felt confident all day long.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>There is not any yucky residue or stain left on any of my clothing, which I&#x27;m sure many of you would agree can be an issue with other deodorants.</li>
            <li>There is not any yucky residue or stain left on any of my clothing, which I&#x27;m sure many of you would agree can be an issue with other deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I stay dry and feel better now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a solid deodorant and the scent is not too strong but it is strong enough you will smell it.</li>
            <li>strong enough for a man...</li>
            <li>The clinical strength keeps you dry all day and even through the most intense workouts</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant from stresssweatchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>Network.**gth is that even when my sample wasn&#x27;t dialed up very high, it had a tendency to break off</li>
            <li>This deodorant helps keep me smelling fresh and clean even after a long workout!  </li>
            <li>This stuff keeps your fresh, clean and dry.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It really is there, I speak the truth.</li>
            <li>I am a very strict, use the deodorant in the morning, type of person.</li>
            <li>So much for customer service.</li>
            <li>it is very visible that I am sweating a lot.</li>
            <li>This clinical strength Secret deodorant worked great for me.</li>
            <li>I really like that it was invisible</li>
            <li>I just turn the crank a couple times and I&#x27;m ready to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue, which is great.</li>
            <li>I really like how the scent stays and doesn&#x27;t disappear.</li>

            <li>I received the Stress Response Smooth Solid Deodorant, and Clinical Strength.</li>
            <li>Nothing really seemed to work that</li>
            <li>The price point, for the quality of this deodorant seems highly reasonable, as well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Does not work as well as the smooth solid that I have been using for years - which I can&#x27;t find anywhere anymore.</li>
            <li>I tried Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid deodorant, and I have been quite impressed with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Secret Clinical Strength deodorant, I was able to apply the deodorant to my underarms, and I was pleased to see that it didn’t rub off onto my clothes.</li>
            <li>Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant is the best deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network, however all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>My skin got super irritated and I had a major breakout with just one use.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry all day long and smells good too.</li>
            <li>It kept me feeling fresh and dry and sweet smelling</li>
            <li>I live in Phoenix, which as you probably know, gets to be pretty toasty in the summers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to put on, and it stays put all day long.  </li>
            <li>I was able to replace the other brand that I used for this.</li>
            <li>Suggest buying a container in the store first and make sure you like it, because it&#x27;s not cheap.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant works great at keeping me dry everyday no matter what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>After trying multiple brands, Secret Clinical Strength Clinical is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to purchase a full size Invisible Solid</li>
            <li>I have yet to purchase a full size Invisible Solid</li>
            <li>only was I happy to see that Secret Clinical Strength deodorant stayed in place, but it really gave me the protection I needed to get through a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and really need something that can be relied on.</li>
            <li>one of the days I tried the deodorant, I was headed out for a summer party, and I was wearing a black tank top.</li>
            <li>:) I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li>The gel absorbs quickly, and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks staining my clothes anymore.</li>
            <li>my main</li>
            <li>and when you wash up or are getting up for the next day, you most likely still won&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day and really protects me...and those near me!</li>
            <li>I stayed cool and dry my whole shift.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.   </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>From high humidity to scorching temps, the weather can cause stress (and stink).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking a deodorant that will keep up with them.</li>
            <li>trying my sample, I was highly impressed!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you buy this product.</li>
            <li>There are other clinical strength options out there,  but Secret smells and works the best!  </li>
            <li>So happy I found Secret Clinical Strength!</li>
            <li>It has the dependable and powerful odor and wetness control I expect from Secret, with a fabulous fresh scent that makes me think I can skip the perfume today.</li>
            <li>It did not leave me with those hideous white marks, it lasted all day long, and I really enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>I have always loved using Secret as my deodorant of choice, and this product is one that I&#x27;ll always have on hand.</li>
            <li>I feel more dry and can go on about my business without worrying where my extra stick of deodorant is in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Extreme heat and circumstances are sometimes too much (like a hot day in the parks) but it holds up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>recommend it to anyone who might be looking for something new.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m a product junkie, I have never even thought of trying something new.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Secret  Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant and was instantly amazed by how much more effective it is compared to my old brand.</li>
            <li>As a huge fan of Secret products I was excited to try is.</li>
            <li>but occasionally when it&#x27;s really hot</li>
            <li>I apply it once in the morning after showering, and I&#x27;m fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>As a busy mom, I am always running around after my kids and feel like I am sweaty and smelly!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing, and last the whole day!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live w/o this deodorant during the summer, complete wetness and odor protection.</li>
            <li>It keeps you dry and fresh</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and smelling fresh</li>
            <li>Not only do I smell nice but no more feeling like I am just sweating out buckets.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it because there are always coupons available for it and it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>It does go on clear, and stay on clear!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Living in the mountains, especially during the summer, it gets very humid.  </li>
            <li>But be aware, it&#x27;s not completely &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Secret products and they always did their job for me.</li>
            <li>The product proved to do just as it stated and kept my underarms dry in this hot humid Georgia weather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other clinical strength products that worked great, Secret&#x27;s clinical</li>
            <li>After being a Secret &amp;#34;admirer&amp;#34; for years, I was pleased to try something new!</li>
            <li>This solid seems to not only work better for perspiration, but it leaves less streaking.</li>
            <li>working a long shift i was amzed to find that not only did i feel fresh</li>
            <li>The main thing that would make me not repurchase is the price, but it works so well that I may be tempted to buy one for times when I need the extra strength.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product in any form - solid, cream, etc.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nothing major!</li>
            <li>I typically need the Smooth Solid.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it keep me dry and fresh but it did so without smear my clothes.</li>
            <li>soft smell, lasts all day, no wet pits</li>
            <li>With the heat here reaching 106 or more it&#x27;s hard to find a deodorant that will last all</li>
            <li>I no longer have to worry about reapplying throughout the day, if I have sweat stains on my brand new white shirt or even odor.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my new go to deodorant for several reasons.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to those with mild to moderate active lifestyles.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to those with mild to moderate active lifestyles.</li>
            <li>No flakes, no powder all over the place, just major protection.</li>
            <li>If the store I am shopping in does not have it, I will go to another store because there is no other Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant that  can compare.</li>
            <li>white marks on my clothing that I have found thus far, which is a plus in my book!</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t need clinical strength deoderant products but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>and I think, (I hope) that some of the concerns I have will be fixed when I have a larger product to work</li>
            <li>and I think, (I hope) that some of the concerns I have will be fixed when I have a larger product to work</li>
            <li>I Love the Secret Brand.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Secret</li>
            <li>love Secret.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their product and I like Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant, it&#x27;s my new go to deodorant for several reasons.</li>
            <li>though is a huge disappointment in a brand that I&#x27;ve been loyal to.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever thought that I would need Clinical Strength but this particular summer in Pennsylvania, has been a very humid, hot, sticky time and after trying, Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid, I will be adding this product to my summer regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but i don&#x27;t really care for that feeling, which had me reaching for my other deodorant.</li>
            <li>It could have been due to the sample/trial size, which, by the way, are very generous samples.</li>
            <li>It could have been due to the sample/trial size, which, by the way, are very generous samples.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has such a light inviting smell that you hardly notice, but once in awhile you catch the drift of scent and makes me happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now with this new formulation of a clear solid I am IN LOVE&amp;#62; Np more white marks on dark clothing and especially my dark blue bra.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid.  </li>
            <li>I have always been pleased with Secret products and this was no different.  </li>
            <li>(It is just a little higher priced then</li>
            <li>With only 2 swipes of the deodorant, it goes on dry, and stays dry all day long to allow me to feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It really does go on dry and stay dry but gives you the protection you need.</li>
            <li>Secret Clinical Strength deodorant was not only helpful for the excessive perspiration, but also had a pleasant smell that kept odor away.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin in general especially in my arm pit area, so my problem is usually a deodorant is either sensitive enough for my skin but not strong enough to last all day, or its strong enough to last all day but irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty active and it even keeps me relatively dry when I workout - as in, my face is dripping sweat</li>

            <li> I will for sure be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> The directions say its actually best to apply at night, and then it works even into the next day.</li>
            <li> I did receive this as a sample to try for free, however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> And boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this type of antiperspirant / deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Most of my rating comes from the fact that when I roll it up from the bottom, the piece that anchors the bottom of the stick pushes out the bottom - then if I try to replace that, the protective piece that surrounds the deodorant itself pops up</li>
            <li> This invisible solid is great!!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s sweat proof</li>

            <li> Amazing when you are working out and still smell fresh!</li>

            <li> It has a nice fragrance when it goes on, which fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, feels refreshing, and is not noticeable deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am sure variety is fine, but something about it made me break out and irritated in the underarm area.  </li>
            <li> twice.)&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice that was very cool</li>

            <li> So it&#x27;s no Secret that I love this</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a pleasant, clean smell and keeps me dry all day even if I don&#x27;t use it as directed (supposed to apply at night).</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well and goes on super clear.  </li>
            <li> I received my free sample and used it right away.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and I am totally impressed .  </li>
            <li> and it dries up in the container fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and it was one of the best samples I received.</li>
            <li> A couple clicks and two quick rubs under each arm</li>
            <li> It seems to melt , it feels creamy and quickly dries onto my skin.</li>
            <li> This helped tremendously and kept the stink away.</li>
            <li> I need protection and it is something that I am super self-conscious about.  </li>
            <li> and I just finished completing 13 miles of running, quickly changed shirts in the car, and showed up for lunch with my friends.</li>
            <li> Wish they were still using the kind that you pushed up from the bottom through holes in the top; now it&#x27;s a solid, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have as much control, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people always trying to find a deodorant that is dependable, smells nice and works great at keeping me dry all day long.  </li>
            <li> I am often outside for most of the day and being sweaty is just gaurenteed!</li>
            <li> I was using a different clinical brand, but now that I&#x27;m in menopause, I find that I am sweating more and smelling stronger than ever before (ew!).</li>
            <li> I am dry and fresh feeling in a good way.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample that I suspect will last me quite a while, but I will absolutely be buying more when it runs out!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to those that cannot seem to find the right deodorant to keep themselves feeling and smelling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> A nice solid that lasts longer than the gel type products.</li>
            <li> Kept me fresh all day without breaking a sweat.</li>
            <li> and i love the scent of The Clinical Strength in Clear Gel, however, this deodorant is not for me.</li>
            <li> It kept me fresh through the day</li>
            <li> I will be fresh all day lone.</li>
            <li> This Secret Clinical Strength deodorant is the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> but i also smelled fresh</li>
            <li> It is worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> It is worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use a smooth solid, but this one was ideal!  </li>
            <li> Does not work well at all &amp; whoever heard of an anti-persirant  that you had to put on right before bed.</li>
            <li> but, if the weather is right, who knows.</li>

            <li> Great scent!I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> and I need something strong by soft.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, albeit a bit strong, but it&#x27;s ability to keep me dry with even minimal exertion was none.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling clean all day, even in high humidity.</li>
            <li> But it works very well for me, even in very hot weather and during beach time.  </li>
            <li> With Secret Clinical Strength, I am confident that I will look, feel and smell my best all day long.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try out the invisible solid deodorant (vs. clear gel deodorant), as it seems that most “invisible solid” deodorants don’t really do a good job at being “invisible”.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Clinical strength’s, completely clean invisible solid deodorant, provides wetness protection and helps you lead a sweat free life.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell lovely, but it combats sweat and body odor for a majority of the day.  </li>
            <li> But... after having my daughters I suddenly found myself sweating a lot more.</li>
            <li> even when it wasn&#x27;t extremely hot.</li>
            <li> I wear it &amp; it last for more than 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> Nothing sexy about those white marks---gross!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if this is just a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; with Clinical Strength deodorants, but it did seem that I had to reapply a bit more then a regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> My pits can get pretty funky.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s HOT...</li>
            <li> like heat index 112 HOT.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a clinical strength deodorant</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely hooked!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and I am loving it!</li>

            <li> This stuff works very well!</li>
            <li> It smells good and lasts even during a workout with heavy sweating.</li>
            <li> Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Completely Clean scent because it does a great job at keeping me not only feeling but smelling clean and dry all day.</li>
            <li> Overall this deodorant works amazingly, and I was surprised that it helped with razor burn too!</li>
            <li> It works well in the Texas heat, I smell nice, and I&#x27;m not having wet marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li> After putting this to a full days test of hot weather and running after my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot humid city, and I tend to have problematic stress induced sweat.</li>
            <li> I like the Clear Gel because it feels cool when you apply it</li>
            <li> I get hot fast</li>
            <li> I felt confident all day long.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and is exactly what I wanted.</li>

            <li> I apply it once in the morning after showering, and I&#x27;m fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> As a busy mom, I am always running around after my kids and feel like I am sweaty and smelly!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing, and last the whole day!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live w/o this deodorant during the summer, complete wetness and odor protection.</li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and fresh</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and smelling fresh</li>
            <li> Not only do I smell nice but no more feeling like I am just sweating out buckets.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it because there are always coupons available for it and it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It does go on clear, and stay on clear!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Living in the mountains, especially during the summer, it gets very humid.  </li>
            <li> But be aware, it&#x27;s not completely &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Secret products and they always did their job for me.</li>
            <li> The product proved to do just as it stated and kept my underarms dry in this hot humid Georgia weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other clinical strength products that worked great, Secret&#x27;s clinical</li>
            <li> After being a Secret &amp;#34;admirer&amp;#34; for years, I was pleased to try something new!</li>
            <li> This solid seems to not only work better for perspiration, but it leaves less streaking.</li>
            <li> working a long shift i was amzed to find that not only did i feel fresh</li>
            <li> The main thing that would make me not repurchase is the price, but it works so well that I may be tempted to buy one for times when I need the extra strength.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product in any form - solid, cream, etc.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nothing major!</li>
            <li> I typically need the Smooth Solid.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it keep me dry and fresh but it did so without smear my clothes.</li>
            <li> soft smell, lasts all day, no wet pits</li>
            <li> With the heat here reaching 106 or more it&#x27;s hard to find a deodorant that will last all</li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about reapplying throughout the day, if I have sweat stains on my brand new white shirt or even odor.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my new go to deodorant for several reasons.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to those with mild to moderate active lifestyles.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to those with mild to moderate active lifestyles.</li>
            <li> No flakes, no powder all over the place, just major protection.</li>
            <li> If the store I am shopping in does not have it, I will go to another store because there is no other Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant that  can compare.</li>
            <li> white marks on my clothing that I have found thus far, which is a plus in my book!</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t need clinical strength deoderant products but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> and I think, (I hope) that some of the concerns I have will be fixed when I have a larger product to work</li>
            <li> and I think, (I hope) that some of the concerns I have will be fixed when I have a larger product to work</li>
            <li> I Love the Secret Brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Secret</li>
            <li> love Secret.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their product and I like Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant, it&#x27;s my new go to deodorant for several reasons.</li>
            <li> though is a huge disappointment in a brand that I&#x27;ve been loyal to.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever thought that I would need Clinical Strength but this particular summer in Pennsylvania, has been a very humid, hot, sticky time and after trying, Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid, I will be adding this product to my summer regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but i don&#x27;t really care for that feeling, which had me reaching for my other deodorant.</li>
            <li> It could have been due to the sample/trial size, which, by the way, are very generous samples.</li>
            <li> It could have been due to the sample/trial size, which, by the way, are very generous samples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has such a light inviting smell that you hardly notice, but once in awhile you catch the drift of scent and makes me happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now with this new formulation of a clear solid I am IN LOVE&amp;#62; Np more white marks on dark clothing and especially my dark blue bra.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid.  </li>
            <li> I have always been pleased with Secret products and this was no different.  </li>
            <li> (It is just a little higher priced then</li>
            <li> With only 2 swipes of the deodorant, it goes on dry, and stays dry all day long to allow me to feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It really does go on dry and stay dry but gives you the protection you need.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength deodorant was not only helpful for the excessive perspiration, but also had a pleasant smell that kept odor away.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin in general especially in my arm pit area, so my problem is usually a deodorant is either sensitive enough for my skin but not strong enough to last all day, or its strong enough to last all day but irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty active and it even keeps me relatively dry when I workout - as in, my face is dripping sweat</li>
            <li> I did normal activities, workouts, and even a half marathon wearing this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With that being said, I will admit that Secret Clinical Strength has worked better than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried to help remedy my situation.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid in the mail to try and was excited.  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t really had this problem with other clear gels i&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t long lasting or over powering.</li>
            <li> I am left feeling protected all day long without needing to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> one an only (minor) compliant</li>
            <li> I have tried similar products that claim to be clinical strength, but they either don&#x27;t work or burn and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I applied the deodorant, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t mark up my black shirt.</li>
            <li> I am brand loyal to Secret.</li>
            <li> The scent was long lasting and kept me dry all day.</li>
            <li> For an extra strength product, I have had more perspiration that using the much less expensive Suave.</li>
            <li> The deodorant leaves some white marks on black/dark shirts if you&#x27;re not careful, but a little water and rubbing does the trick</li>
            <li> Does not work as well or as long as it claims.</li>
            <li> I need something that protects and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> (And I have some really long days...</li>
            <li> Sometimes as long as 48 hours.</li>
            <li> 1 box lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning and it keeps my dry all day long no matter if I am working out or relaxing.</li>
            <li> It keeps my dry all day long, whether I&#x27;m cleaning the house, attending a BBQ, or at the gym.</li>
            <li> This keeps me dry all day long.</li>
            <li> This can be extremely tricky in a deodorant, especially when I wear darker colored clothes.</li>
            <li> is you have to be cautious using it, any minor cut from shaving can be irritated if the deodorant is applied before cut heals!  </li>
            <li> , was that the scent is very long lasing.</li>
            <li> I defiantly recommend this new Secret deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Secret Clinical Strength</li>
            <li> and then I have to try to push that back down</li>
            <li> I feel like I stay dry all day long, even when I&#x27;m really active outdoors in the summer sun.</li>
            <li> but my underarms are only slightly moist.</li>
            <li> but when you are in a hurry, it is a little crucial and you don&#x27;t want to get dressed after a shower until it is completely dry and not going to stick on your clothing.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength is a staple in our household, and the Adapts and Responds Customized Protection is proof positive that you can improve upon perfection.</li>
            <li> There is a little white residue left if I&#x27;m wearing something black though.</li>
            <li> I must mention, that a few times I did get dressed before it dried completely and it still didn&#x27;t stain or even mark my clothes!</li>
            <li> In spite of my crazy life as a mom and entrepreneur, I was able to stay dry all day, thanks to Secret Clinical Strength!  </li>
            <li> I found that when i applied it after a little while it left me with sticky underarms.</li>
            <li> It does dry invisible if it gets on one&#x27;s clothing; however, I do not recommend this product due to its ineffectiveness.</li>
            <li> What you do not see is a wide streak of this deodorant that I rubbed onto it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I use everyday now, especially in the Summer!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about wet underarms</li>
            <li> I have so much trouble finding a deodorant that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> I need something powerful to keep me from sweating (and stinking) while I keep up with my 2 toddlers in this heat, and Secret did the job!  </li>
            <li> I sometimes go to other brands, but after a few days of sweat, always come back.</li>
            <li> And I do mean major...</li>
            <li> It really does go on invisible and doesn&#x27;t leave a flaky mess behind.</li>
            <li> and I am amazed at the difference it brings vs other brands.</li>
            <li> I have not been compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> (My usual brand that is not clinical strength, only needs to be applied once or</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know again, if that is just due to the extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (the other one was not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear off and I don&#x27;t need to reapply like with other products.</li>
            <li> other clinical strength deodorants,</li>
            <li> I had previously dried a deodorant that goes on dry</li>
            <li> No strong smell to it and goes on dry.</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time finding a deodorant to do that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another small issue I did have with Secret Clinical Strength is that even when my sample wasn&#x27;t dialed up very high, it had a tendency to break off</li>
            <li> I have trouble with excessive perspiration, especially when I wear dark shirts</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue or stain my clothing, because this was a real problem with some deodorant in my past.</li>
            <li> clean&amp;#34; invisible clear gel Secret formula.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well with controlling perspiration as the Secret Clinical strength gel.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of invisible solids and although Secret is not my usual first choice when I shop for deodorant, I do use a few of their products on occasion</li>
            <li> (I am disabled and not an overly active person due to being disabled in my hips through my feet.)</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this specific product (invisible solid) as I broke out.  </li>
            <li> Less odor control, too.</li>
            <li> and it did not show on my black swim suit.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that I can apply this and immediately put clothing on, even a black shirt, and it stays with no transference.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant and found myself applying it liberally in the mornings, and then re-applying in the afternoons.</li>
            <li> That is super important because I hate difficult laundry!</li>
            <li> No sticky, cakey mess after applying.</li>
            <li> Not with Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant - I am so protected, and it lasts longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> but I did think it was a little odd that I had to reapply this throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about trying the clinical strength.  </li>
            <li> I have used Secret Clinical Strength previously, but the solid version.</li>
            <li> However I would recommend the Secret Clinical variety as it is one of the only deodorants that work for me.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical antiperspirant/deodorant has been my regular go to product!  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday since the product was released.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret Clinical Strength Protection Invisible Solid for about a year now</li>
            <li> I have tried countless brands and nothing has come close to comparing to Secret.</li>
            <li> I switched over to the clinical strength secret solid because (1) it&#x27;s invisible and (2)</li>
            <li> Well, I applied Clinical Strength Secret before I went to bed last night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a secret user since I was a teen</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Secret brand, however, I was still anxious to try this product.</li>
            <li> This is what I hate with solid deodorants, and will typically use clear gel</li>
            <li> I will admit I was a little skeptical with trying Secrets Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Even though it is a small container, I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and it is almost out.</li>
            <li> I usually just use it every morning</li>
            <li> I usually use a crystal</li>
            <li> /wiping my arm with a paper towel, and putting on as usual.</li>
            <li> This sort of overshadows the small, nit picky issues I have with this product.</li>
            <li> This sort of overshadows the small, nit picky issues I have with this product.</li>
            <li> This will last and last no matter how active you are, how brutal the heatwave is, it will still be there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other clinical strength products but none of them work as well as Secret Clinical Strength.</li>
            <li> I have broken out from similar products and have never had any irritation from Secret&#x27;s clinical strength</li>
            <li> Plus, it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave those awful white residue marks on my clothes!  </li>
            <li> Bring on the pool parties, bbq and late nights by the fire.</li>
            <li> I mean, I would put it on, go to sleep and then shower in the morning</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve resorted to prescription deodorants!</li>
            <li> When they say Clinical Strength, they truly mean it.</li>
            <li> It goes on dry, saving your clothes from those horrible white marks, and is in a stick form.</li>
            <li> he is a hard working man that needs his secret!</li>
            <li> Just opened it to use it and the dispenser is broken.  </li>
            <li> And I am still upset that Secret offered me a product gratis when they debuted the product &amp; then kept trying to charge for it,</li>
            <li> The Secret CS does just that.  </li>
            <li> Secret is a quality brand and always has been.</li>
            <li> I have been and will continue to use Secret Clinical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secret clinical strength is what I&#x27;ve always needed and never knew about.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(I&#x27;ve used Secret Clinical Strength for a couple of years now...</li>
            <li> Secret is not my go to brand of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Secret to start with.  </li>
            <li> I have used Secret Clinical for years.</li>
            <li> and I always buy Secret when there is a sale and a coupon.</li>
            <li> and I hate to say that this actually happened with both of my samples.</li>
            <li> and I hate to say that this actually happened with both of my samples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Secret</li>
            <li> With Secret Clinical Strength deodorant, I didn’t notice myself sweating through my shirts.</li>
            <li> I use Secret all the time, so when I tried this one, I already felt like I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> Very subtle yet feminine.</li>
            <li> Sadly , for me, this doesn&#x27;t even work well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> One thing that didn&#x27;t stop working was my Secret Clinical!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shower every day (guilty)</li>
            <li> It also did not leave white marks on my clothing which I hate!  </li>
            <li> I almost feel that its unfair for me to write a review since having my son I&#x27;ve had issues with JUST one armpit not responding to any deodorant that I use.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from PCOS and hormone fluctuations - I sweat,</li>
            <li> I hate when deodorant leaves behind residue.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Secret!!</li>
            <li> and I&amp;#34;m really disappointed in the effectiveness of this product.  </li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well with controlling perspiration as the Secret Clinical strength gel. It does dry invisible if it gets on one&#x27;s clothing; however, I do not recommend this product due to its ineffectiveness. It may as well be regular strength deoderant.</li>
            <li> A nice solid that lasts longer than the gel type products. Scent isn&#x27;t long lasting or over powering. Does the job well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I used to have a problem with sweating from nerves and anxiety, but this deodorant is amazing. I stay dry and feel better now. There are other clinical strength options out there,  but Secret smells and works the best!  This is all I use now.</li>
            <li> My skin got super irritated and I had a major breakout with just one use.</li>
            <li> Just opened it to use it and the dispenser is broken.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Best there is! This works amazing and smells wonderful. Dries clean and doesn&#x27;t leave marks. Does everything it says it will. I&#x27;m definitely making the switch!&lt;br /&gt;I received this to try from One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant from stresssweatchallenge.com but the opinions are all my own. I received my free sample and used it right away. I was pleasantly surprised. With the heat here reaching 106 or more it&#x27;s hard to find a deodorant that will last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid lasted all day and into the night. It even kept the sweat away. I&#x27;ll be buying a full size product ASAP</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant!  After trying multiple brands, Secret Clinical Strength Clinical is by far the best.  Not only does it smell lovely, but it combats sweat and body odor for a majority of the day.  Plus, it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave those awful white residue marks on my clothes!  A staple in my beauty regime, for sure! Note: I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> With both my job and my photography business i find myself in many sweaty situations. After trying this product i have found i don&#x27;t need to reapply my deodorant as often. I feel more dry and can go on about my business without worrying where my extra stick of deodorant is in my purse.  I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Secret brand, however, I was still anxious to try this product. The product proved to do just as it stated and kept my underarms dry in this hot humid Georgia weather. The smell was very pleasant and clean. I highly recommend.   I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength is a staple in our household, and the Adapts and Responds Customized Protection is proof positive that you can improve upon perfection. It has the dependable and powerful odor and wetness control I expect from Secret, with a fabulous fresh scent that makes me think I can skip the perfume today. And when they say invisible, it&#x27;s for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture of my arm below is an example. What you do not see is a wide streak of this deodorant that I rubbed onto it. It really is there, I speak the truth. No flakes, no powder all over the place, just major protection. And I do mean major...I&#x27;ve gone 24 hours and it still was working as well as when it was applied. Even when I got in the shower, I was still fully protected...the scent was still prevalent, until I washed it off. This is a wonderful deodorant, and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free from stresssweatchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network. My opinions and bathing habits are my own.</li>
            <li> With the onset of menopause I am literally sweating more and more.  Sometimes I feel totally drenched.  I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and I am totally impressed .  Not only do I smell nice but no more feeling like I am just sweating out buckets.  I am dry and fresh feeling in a good way.  No white streaks on my clothes I am totally in love .</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this specific product (invisible solid) as I broke out.  I typically need the Smooth Solid.  However I would recommend the Secret Clinical variety as it is one of the only deodorants that work for me. Extreme heat and circumstances are sometimes too much (like a hot day in the parks) but it holds up pretty well.  I am sure variety is fine, but something about it made me break out and irritated in the underarm area.  Had to stop using.  I can only recommend to try for yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for every woman to have! Provides all day protection and freshness. Great for the gym or working out. No strong smell to it and goes on dry. It keeps you dry and fresh all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their product and I like Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant, it&#x27;s my new go to deodorant for several reasons. There is not any yucky residue or stain left on any of my clothing, which I&#x27;m sure many of you would agree can be an issue with other deodorants. It has a pleasant scent, without being too much, and it lasts even during those HOT days. The best part - it lasts for up to 48 hours!

            <li> I could not believe it! I am a very strict, use the deodorant in the morning, type of person. When I saw that you are supposed to apply this at night, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work. I mean, I would put it on, go to sleep and then shower in the morning and it wouldn&#x27;t come off? I perspire a lot during the day with Zumba, racquetball, jogging, etc. So the first couple times I used it, I almost put on more deodorant in the morning. Thankfully though I had no need to worry. It stayed on and quite well! No need to re-apply and I loved the fresh scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a solid deodorant and the scent is not too strong but it is strong enough you will smell it. Amazing when you are working out and still smell fresh! Even though it is a small container, I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and it is almost out. But for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I love it! And who says you can&#x27;t love deodorant:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure* I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Final Thought: Clinical strength’s, completely clean invisible solid deodorant, provides wetness protection and helps you lead a sweat free life. So try it, stop worrying about the odor, let it add to your confidence level, relax and come out as a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I was provided a free sample from stresssweatchallenge.com to review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> One of the best deodorants I have ever used. Kept me fresh all day without breaking a sweat. Love the gel option and doesn&#x27;t get all smeared on clothing. I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Does not work well at all &amp; whoever heard of an anti-persirant  that you had to put on right before bed. Does not work as well or as long as it claims. For an extra strength product, I have had more perspiration that using the much less expensive Suave. Less odor control, too. And I am still upset that Secret offered me a product gratis when they debuted the product &amp; then kept trying to charge for it, no matter how many times I contacted them, they NEVER responded. So much for customer service. Sadly , for me, this doesn&#x27;t even work well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> strong enough for a man... i&#x27;m a guy and i use it.  works great, even if you skip a day (not recommended)</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical antiperspirant/deodorant has been my regular go to product!  The best part - it lasts for up to 48 hours!  I never wanted to actually test this, but I was out camping with my husband and there were no showers working, so we had to wait a day until our next stop.  One thing that didn&#x27;t stop working was my Secret Clinical!  I highly recommend this product in any form - solid, cream, etc.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday since the product was released. It seams to be the only one that protects from odors and sweat. I still have fresh smelling and smooth arm pits at the end of the day.  love the Stress Response one the best.</li>
            <li> I am brand loyal to Secret. I sometimes go to other brands, but after a few days of sweat, always come back. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I Love the Secret Brand. and i love the scent of The Clinical Strength in Clear Gel, however, this deodorant is not for me. I found that when i applied it after a little while it left me with sticky underarms. i don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but i don&#x27;t really care for that feeling, which had me reaching for my other deodorant. i haven&#x27;t really had this problem with other clear gels i&#x27;ve had in the past. this is definitely one of those products thats good for some but not all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i posted this review as a Member of One2One Network. All opinions are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid.  Living in the mountains, especially during the summer, it gets very humid.  I need something that protects and lasts a long time.  The Secret CS does just that.  Easy to apply, no need to reapply.  Lasts all day and really protects me...and those near me! :) I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I work in a kitchen this is by far the best deodorant out they. I stayed cool and dry my whole shift.</li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t be impressed by &#x27;60% more value&#x27;, because it&#x27;s also that much more in price!  But I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product.  Suggest buying a container in the store first and make sure you like it, because it&#x27;s not cheap.  But it works very well for me, even in very hot weather and during beach time.  Wish they were still using the kind that you pushed up from the bottom through holes in the top; now it&#x27;s a solid, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have as much control, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> This is not the gel formula I thought I had ordered.  This doesn&#x27;t work as well and it dries up in the container fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret Clinical Strength Protection Invisible Solid for about a year now and it&#x27;s  been great. I don&#x27;t have  to worry about spots on my clothes or flakes. Secret is a quality brand and always has been. I don&#x27;t have to worry about any unwanted odor when I am out, especially on hot Florida days.  I have been and will continue to use Secret Clinical.&lt;br /&gt;*for this review I did receive a free sample*</li>
            <li> I LOVE Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Completely Clean scent because it does a great job at keeping me not only feeling but smelling clean and dry all day. It really does go on invisible and doesn&#x27;t leave a flaky mess behind. I apply it in the morning and it keeps my dry all day long no matter if I am working out or relaxing. No sticky, cakey mess after applying. I LOVE the scent of it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with excessive perspiration, especially when I wear dark shirts it is very visible that I am sweating a lot. Secret Clinical Strength deodorant was not only helpful for the excessive perspiration, but also had a pleasant smell that kept odor away.

            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant from stresssweatchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network and I am glad I did! This stuff is fantastic. It smells great and keeps me dry all day. I have tried similar products that claim to be clinical strength, but they either don&#x27;t work or burn and dry out my skin. So happy I found Secret Clinical Strength!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and it was one of the best samples I received. This product does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do and keeps me fresh all day. I had such a hard time finding a deodorant to do that. It is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it because there are always coupons available for it and it lasts quite a long time. It&#x27;s what I use everyday now, especially in the Summer!</li>
            <li> I have used Secret Clinical Strength previously, but the solid version. I like the Clear Gel because it feels cool when you apply it and it does not leave white residue. It keeps me smelling clean all day, even in high humidity. I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I am a person that can sweat a lot and needs a lot of protection throughout the day. This clinical strength Secret deodorant worked great for me. It kept me fresh through the day and I was not smelly. I really like that it was invisible and it did not show on my black swim suit. It really does go on dry and stay dry but gives you the protection you need. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a working mom who&#x27;s always on the go...  I need a deodorant that can keep up because I don&#x27;t have time to stop and freshen up.  A couple clicks and two quick rubs under each arm and I&#x27;m good for the whole day. (And I have some really long days...)&lt;br /&gt;Two hours a day, I&#x27;m watching my son in his JiuJitsu classes in a gym without air conditioning in the heat of the summer.  Running from BJJ to drum lessons to piano lessons and trying to cram my own job in there is time consuming and stressful.  Secret clinical strength is what I&#x27;ve always needed and never knew about.  I don&#x27;t know what I did before, but I&#x27;m not going back.  It keeps me dry and smelling fresh so I can get on with life.  I&#x27;d totally recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The summer heat is here. From high humidity to scorching temps, the weather can cause stress (and stink). No one wants to wear a sassy dress or cute top and have sweat. With Secret Clinical Strength, I am confident that I will look, feel and smell my best all day long. Bring on the pool parties, bbq and late nights by the fire. I will be fresh all day lone.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Smells great, leaves my underarms feeling fresh and clean all day long. Apply only once and that&#x27;s it, you will smell great all day. No white marks at all. Great to have for the heat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> The only Solid I trust! I appreciate that I can apply this and immediately put clothing on, even a black shirt, and it stays with no transference. It goes on very smooth. It seems to melt , it feels creamy and quickly dries onto my skin. I live in a very hot humid city, and I tend to have problematic stress induced sweat. It works so well, I can even skip a day with no worries!  The clean scent is the best for not clashing with my perfume. If the store I am shopping in does not have it, I will go to another store because there is no other Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant that  can compare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Secret products and they always did their job for me. But... after having my daughters I suddenly found myself sweating a lot more. (Pregnancy has a lot of lasting side effects that no one talks about!!!). I would actually soak my shirt underarms on a daily basis... even when it wasn&#x27;t extremely hot. Thank goodness I found the Clinical Strength. I don&#x27;t worry about wet underarms anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve used Secret Clinical Strength for a couple of years now... but I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.)</li>
            <li> This is a great solid! I used 2 clicks and that was plenty for me. It left no white marks on my clothes or my underarms! Great scent!I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> After being a Secret &amp;#34;admirer&amp;#34; for years, I was pleased to try something new! This product is wonderful. In spite of my crazy life as a mom and entrepreneur, I was able to stay dry all day, thanks to Secret Clinical Strength!  received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network at stresssweatchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is AWESOME. If you don&#x27;t shower every day (guilty) you don&#x27;t even have to reapply until after your next shower! It has a nice fragrance when it goes on, which fades fairly quickly. However, when your #stresssweat kicks in, you&#x27;ll notice a burst of an almost cucumber-y fragrance. And it keeps my underarms from going beyond &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34;. Thank you, Secret!!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot for a woman so when I was offered a free sample from One2One Network to try this deodorant, I thought I had nothing to lose and that was the truth. This stuff keeps your fresh, clean and dry. It goes on smooth and lasts all day and it smells good, not like a clinical deodorant might smell.</li>
            <li> I love love love this. I get hot fast and I need something strong by soft. It goes one smooth keeps me fresh all day. I love the way it smells too. It is not over powering but it is a nice. I will for sure be buying this one again. I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>

            <li> This deodorant works great at keeping me dry everyday no matter what I&#x27;m doing. The directions say its actually best to apply at night, and then it works even into the next day. I usually just use it every morning and I&#x27;m good to go. The gel absorbs quickly, and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks staining my clothes anymore. Great Product! I did receive this as a sample to try for free, however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Secret is not my go to brand of deodorant. But ever since learning about it and all its promises; I had to try it out myself. And boy am I glad I did. It smells fantastic. It is smooth going on. NO residue, NO sticky feeling, NO stains! It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that. I promise you ladies will enjoy this fantastic invention! Oh btw, I didn&#x27;t have to put it on for 2 days after first applying it!!! I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much and I am glad I was able to try it for free thanks to stresssweatchallenge.com. I will tell others about this great product. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t been using this product all along. It keeps me dry all day long and smells good too.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Secret Clinical Strength and I am amazed at the difference it brings vs other brands. I didn&#x27;t used to have any issues with sweating, but after becoming a mother that all changed. I have tried countless brands and nothing has come close to comparing to Secret. I no longer have to worry about reapplying throughout the day, if I have sweat stains on my brand new white shirt or even odor. This will now be the only deodorant I use, I loved it that much.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Clinical Strength Invisible Solid as a member of One2One Network</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Secret to start with.  I&#x27;ve used their product for years, and I like Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant, it&#x27;s my new go to deodorant for several reasons.

            <li> I have so much trouble finding a deodorant that actually works for me. In the past I&#x27;ve resorted to prescription deodorants! But this one works! And it feels and smells so much better than the RX kind! I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network from stresssweatchallenge.com.  I&#x27;m one of those people always trying to find a deodorant that is dependable, smells nice and works great at keeping me dry all day long.  This is the product for you if you are searching for that too!  It went on smooth, kept me smelling great and dry all day long even in 100 degree temperatures here in Houston!  It also did not leave white marks on my clothing which I hate!  Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a dependable deodorant product</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this deodorant! I was able to replace the other brand that I used for this. I am left feeling protected all day long without needing to reapply throughout the day. It goes on smooth and clear and has a light scent that I love. I would recommend this to anyone looking to replace their current brand! I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> soft smell, lasts all day, no wet pits</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant- he is a hard working man that needs his secret!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite deodorant! I had previously dried a deodorant that goes on dry but it was in aerosol form and it worried me what I was inhaling when I sprayed it. This Secret Clinical Strength deodorant is the best of both worlds. It goes on dry, saving your clothes from those horrible white marks, and is in a stick form. The clinical strength keeps you dry all day and even through the most intense workouts and it smells good too. I defiantly recommend this new Secret deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network. I have not been compensated in any other way. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It seems great and isn&#x27;t overly perfumed/overwhelming. I like that this doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue or stain my clothing, because this was a real problem with some deodorant in my past. I feel like I stay dry all day long, even when I&#x27;m really active outdoors in the summer sun. I prefer this solid stick, because it doesn&#x27;t take forever to get the deodorant to come to the surface. I just turn the crank a couple times and I&#x27;m ready to use. This is my newest favorite, and I will be continuing to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclosure: I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue, which is great. I hate when deodorant leaves behind residue. This even has a great scent to it. I love that it&#x27;s not to overpowering. It&#x27;s also great that you won&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out a sweat. This deodorant has got you covered! I would highly recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Works great. I usually use a crystal but occasionally when it&#x27;s really hot I use this and it works perfectly. There is a little white residue left if I&#x27;m wearing something black though.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that works all day long!</li>
            <li> *I received a free sample of this product from One2OneNetwork and stresssweatchallenge.com* It has a nice pleasant scent and works well. I have been using it for a couple weeks now. I like that it is clinical strength and it is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use a smooth solid, but this one was ideal!  No residue, smells great and feels smooth on my skin. I felt confident all day long. I definitely recommend!  I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and I have to say that this one was by far the most impressive product, it kept up with me and my busy day and I did not have to worry about having white powder under my armpits. This product went on easy and worked for me all day. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking a deodorant that will keep up with them. I received a free sample courtesy of stresssweatchallenge.com and am a member of the one2one network.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t need clinical strength deoderant products but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It kept me feeling fresh and dry and sweet smelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free from stresssweatchallenge.com</li>
            <li> I almost feel that its unfair for me to write a review since having my son I&#x27;ve had issues with JUST one armpit not responding to any deodorant that I use. With that being said, I will admit that Secret Clinical Strength has worked better than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried to help remedy my situation. It&#x27;s stayed fresher and dryer longer; now , I did take it with me to re-apply because like I said, none last for my underneath the one arm. (yes, it&#x27;s so frustrating).&lt;br /&gt;BUT I re-applied by drying/wiping my arm with a paper towel, and putting on as usual. This helped tremendously and kept the stink away. I would definitely recommend if you have ANY issues with sweat or odor.</li>

            <li> Finally, something that works in the Florida July summer!</li>
            <li> i got this at a great price, it has a nice clean scent and truly covers sweat all day! i wish i had bought more.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from PCOS and hormone fluctuations - I sweat, A LOT!  I need protection and it is something that I am super self-conscious about.  Not with Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant - I am so protected, and it lasts longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I have used Secret Clinical for years. I am allergic to many brands of deoderants---but not this product. I wear it &amp; it last for more than 24 hrs. Sometimes as long as 48 hours. It is awesome. Now with this new formulation of a clear solid I am IN LOVE&amp;#62; Np more white marks on dark clothing and especially my dark blue bra. Nothing sexy about those white marks---gross!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant smells heavenly too----so nice and refreshing. I did received the product free from stresssweatchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of invisible solids and although Secret is not my usual first choice when I shop for deodorant, I do use a few of their products on occasion and I always buy Secret when there is a sale and a coupon. (It is just a little higher priced then my main brand.)&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any brand of Clinical Strength just yet but I have seen them in stores, offline and online. I haven&#x27;t ever thought that I would need Clinical Strength but this particular summer in Pennsylvania, has been a very humid, hot, sticky time and after trying, Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid, I will be adding this product to my summer regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is just a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; with Clinical Strength deodorants, but it did seem that I had to reapply a bit more then a regular deodorant. Again, we have had some wicked humidity this summer but I did think it was a little odd that I had to reapply this throughout the day. (My usual brand that is not clinical strength, only needs to be applied once or twice.)&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice that was very cool, was that the scent is very long lasing. This will last and last no matter how active you are, how brutal the heatwave is, it will still be there. Which is great! But, I wish I could say the same for the sweating, sticky feeling I have when I have to reapply and reapply. (I am disabled and not an overly active person due to being disabled in my hips through my feet.) So, I don&#x27;t know again, if that is just due to the extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that it seems to take an extra minute before drying. Not that an extra minute matters but when you are in a hurry, it is a little crucial and you don&#x27;t want to get dressed after a shower until it is completely dry and not going to stick on your clothing. I must mention, that a few times I did get dressed before it dried completely and it still didn&#x27;t stain or even mark my clothes! That is a big bonus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;Another small issue I did have with Secret Clinical Strength is that even when my sample wasn&#x27;t dialed up very high, it had a tendency to break off and I had to try to reattach to continue using to facilitate my review. They did send me 2 samples and I hate to say that this actually happened with both of my samples. It could have been due to the sample/trial size, which, by the way, are very generous samples. I have yet to purchase a full size Invisible Solid but, I plan to and I hope the same thing doesn&#x27;t happen to that one. It&#x27;s an easy fix although it seems you do lose a couple of applications each time it happens but, it isn&#x27;t the end of the world. (Unless of course you lose the top and can not find it or a child or pe gets a hold of it first!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those with mild to moderate active lifestyles. I don&#x27;t know if this would be the best choice for a hardcore athlete but, if the weather is right, who knows. It is worth giving it a shot. I really like how the scent stays and doesn&#x27;t disappear. This sort of overshadows the small, nit picky issues I have with this product. Except for the reapplication process. But, it will last the duration of your workout.&lt;br /&gt;I do plan on buying this again and I think, (I hope) that some of the concerns I have will be fixed when I have a larger product to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.**gth is that even when my sample wasn&#x27;t dialed up very high, it had a tendency to break off and I had to try to reattach to continue using to facilitate my review.

But, it will last the duration of your workout.&lt;br /&gt;I do plan on buying this again and I think, (I hope) that some of the concerns I have will be fixed when I have a larger product to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.**</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve always used Secret but I&#x27;ve found that I now need something stronger. Maybe it&#x27;s the stress of being a mom, but I like the strength of Clinical Strength. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothing. I don&#x27;t have to deal with deodorant stains. That is super important because I hate difficult laundry! Overall great product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> My pits can get pretty funky. Thanks to this amazing product from Secret, my pits smell good and I don&#x27;t have to worry about whether it&#x27;s still working or smelling good. When they say Clinical Strength, they truly mean it. I love the scent too. Very subtle yet feminine. *I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I have always loved using Secret as my deodorant of choice, and this product is one that I&#x27;ll always have on hand. It did not leave me with those hideous white marks, it lasted all day long, and I really enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> I have always been pleased with Secret products and this was no different.  Here in the south it&#x27;s HOT...like heat index 112 HOT.  I need something powerful to keep me from sweating (and stinking) while I keep up with my 2 toddlers in this heat, and Secret did the job!  I received a free product to review through One2OneNetwork.  My opinion is MY opinion!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a clinical strength deodorant and I am absolutely hooked! I live in Phoenix, which as you probably know, gets to be pretty toasty in the summers. I had previously been using a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant and found myself applying it liberally in the mornings, and then re-applying in the afternoons. I decided to try Secret  Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant and was instantly amazed by how much more effective it is compared to my old brand. I apply it once in the morning after showering, and I&#x27;m fresh all day long. No &amp;#34;sticky pit&amp;#34; feeling, no funk. It even holds up through my hour-long kickboxing class. I&#x27;m officially a convert! I received a free sample that I suspect will last me quite a while, but I will absolutely be buying more when it runs out!</li>
            <li> I was using a different clinical brand, but now that I&#x27;m in menopause, I find that I am sweating more and smelling stronger than ever before (ew!). I switched over to the clinical strength secret solid because (1) it&#x27;s invisible and (2) it&#x27;s a solid (the other one was not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how&#x27;d it work? Well, I applied Clinical Strength Secret before I went to bed last night and I just finished completing 13 miles of running, quickly changed shirts in the car, and showed up for lunch with my friends. Someone told me I smelled good! LOL! That should answer it all right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect Deodorant for me. As a busy mom, I am always running around after my kids and feel like I am sweaty and smelly! This keeps me dry all day long. 1 box lasts a long time too. I have broken out from similar products and have never had any irritation from Secret&#x27;s clinical strength deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Love.  I was using the liquid gel version which left white streaks on my clothing.  This solid seems to not only work better for perspiration, but it leaves less streaking.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I use.  I&#x27;ve tried other clinical strength products but none of them work as well as Secret Clinical Strength.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this type of antiperspirant / deodorant.  It works well and most importantly DOESN&#x27;T stain your clothes, excellent product!</li>
            <li> The product is okay - doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as the original. Most of my rating comes from the fact that when I roll it up from the bottom, the piece that anchors the bottom of the stick pushes out the bottom - then if I try to replace that, the protective piece that surrounds the deodorant itself pops up and then I have to try to push that back down - then the bottom pops out again - etc etc etc. Annoying.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid in the mail to try and was excited.  I try to switch up my deodorants occasionally as I feel my body gets used to them.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant did a great job with not leaving marks on my clothes, leaving me smelling fresh, and protecting odors.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product at night before bed as well as in the morning before any activities.  I woke up smelling fresh and smelled good, even after strenuous activities (well, as good as could be expected).  I did normal activities, workouts, and even a half marathon wearing this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone who might be looking for something new.</li>
            <li> This by far the best to use for any occasion, never lets me down and pleasant smelling. Has not stained my clothing either, try it out!</li>
            <li> This invisible solid is great!! The scent was long lasting and kept me dry all day. Perfect! *I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Secret.  So it&#x27;s no Secret that I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It has such a light inviting smell that you hardly notice, but once in awhile you catch the drift of scent and makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps me dry and smelling great no matter what I am doing.&lt;br /&gt;No white marks on my clothing that I have found thus far, which is a plus in my book!</li>
            <li> Great Deodorant! Would highly recommend this to those that cannot seem to find the right deodorant to keep themselves feeling and smelling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network and I am loving it! It works well in the Texas heat, I smell nice, and I&#x27;m not having wet marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product. I received it for free from stresssweatchallenge.com and am so glad I did. The main thing that would make me not repurchase is the price, but it works so well that I may be tempted to buy one for times when I need the extra strength. (Sports, hiking, all night dance parties, etc.)</li>
            <li> I love the Secret Clinical Strength Deodorant! I received the Stress Response Smooth Solid Deodorant, and Clinical Strength. Both are amazing at keeping me fresh, and dry all day. I love that it&#x27;s sweat proof so I don&#x27;t experience any wetness under my arms. Plus I don&#x27;t get marks on my clothes. They also have a lovely scent. Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength Stress Response deodorant from stresssweatchallenge.com and as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about trying the clinical strength.  But once I tried it, it worked amazing. I load semi&#x27;s and it was still working once I finished.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorant...or any deodorant for that matter. Nothing really seemed to work that well on me and I&#x27;ve found myself reapplying midday. I&#x27;d essentially given up on finding a deodorant that did what it claimed, but this...this is the holy grail! This deodorant has a pleasant, clean smell and keeps me dry all day even if I don&#x27;t use it as directed (supposed to apply at night). I&#x27;m pretty active and it even keeps me relatively dry when I workout - as in, my face is dripping sweat but my underarms are only slightly moist. But be aware, it&#x27;s not completely &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;. The deodorant leaves some white marks on black/dark shirts if you&#x27;re not careful, but a little water and rubbing does the trick and it&#x27;s nothing major! Good bye embarrassing pit stains!</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid deodorant, and I have been quite impressed with the outcome. I was a bit hesitant to try out the invisible solid deodorant (vs. clear gel deodorant), as it seems that most “invisible solid” deodorants don’t really do a good job at being “invisible”.&lt;br /&gt;With Secret Clinical Strength deodorant, I was able to apply the deodorant to my underarms, and I was pleased to see that it didn’t rub off onto my clothes. This is what I hate with solid deodorants, and will typically use clear gel deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one of the days I tried the deodorant, I was headed out for a summer party, and I was wearing a black tank top. This can be extremely tricky in a deodorant, especially when I wear darker colored clothes. I applied the deodorant, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t mark up my black shirt. The deodorant truly stays in place where it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was I happy to see that Secret Clinical Strength deodorant stayed in place, but it really gave me the protection I needed to get through a hot summer day. It gets extremely hot here in the summers, and I tend to sweat a lot. I need a deodorant that will protect against the “extra sweat” or stress of the Arizona summer heat. With Secret Clinical Strength deodorant, I didn’t notice myself sweating through my shirts. With only 2 swipes of the deodorant, it goes on dry, and stays dry all day long to allow me to feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant from stresssweatchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network.

            <li> This is an essential product for me.I am so impressed at how well this product works to keep me dry and smelling great.It doesn&#x27;t wear off and I don&#x27;t need to reapply like with other products.I love the fresh scent it is perfect and at the end of the day I still feel like I just applied it.I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deoderant as part of the stresssweatchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Does not offer sweat protection.  I&#x27;ve been a secret user since I was a teen and I&amp;#34;m really disappointed in the effectiveness of this product.  I&#x27;ve used other clinical strength products that worked great, Secret&#x27;s clinical though is a huge disappointment in a brand that I&#x27;ve been loyal to.  The scent is great, albeit a bit strong, but it&#x27;s ability to keep me dry with even minimal exertion was none.  I applied before bed as per the instructions, did my morning walk at 5am and came home and had to change my shirt :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant.  It&#x27;s so easy to put on, and it stays put all day long.  It has a very pleasant smell, but it&#x27;s not too overpowering.  This deodorant helps keep me smelling fresh and clean even after a long workout!  I&#x27;m so happy that I found this product :)  I received a free sample from stresssweatchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant is the best deodorant I have ever used. I have used this before a stressful workout and it held up great. No sweating and no odor. It also has a great scent . The scent and protection lasts all day. This is a product that I will continue to use.I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was a little skeptical with trying Secrets Clinical Strength Invisible Solid Deodorant. I have sensitive skin in general especially in my arm pit area, so my problem is usually a deodorant is either sensitive enough for my skin but not strong enough to last all day, or its strong enough to last all day but irritates my skin. After putting this to a full days test of hot weather and running after my 5 year old. I am proud to say that on top of the pleasant scent it held up to the challenge of both keeping me odor free all day long and by not irritating my skin. I am now proud to say that I have switched and I am never going back!! I Thankfully received a sample free from stresssweatchallenge.com</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use Secret all the time, so when I tried this one, I already felt like I knew what to expect. It works great, it smells great and it actually does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do. It has a nice clean scent, I don&#x27;t have marks on my clothes or sweat spots, it lasts all day and I don&#x27;t have to re-apply it during the day. I don&#x27;t feel sticky while it&#x27;s in use and when you wash up or are getting up for the next day, you most likely still won&#x27;t have any issues. You don&#x27;t have anything to worry about when you wear this antiperspirant/deodorant. I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product in order to facilitate this review. As a huge fan of Secret products I was excited to try is. I was very impressed. Not only did it keep me dry and fresh but it did so without smear my clothes. It truly is a strong and effective product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well and goes on super clear.  Last for 24-48 hours.  I have been using this kind for 3 years now and have never been more happy with a deodorant.  Love, Love, LOVE.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live w/o this deodorant during the summer, complete wetness and odor protection. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the feel of &amp;#34;Completely clean&amp;#34; invisible clear gel Secret formula. It is easy to apply, feels refreshing, and is not noticeable deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing, and last the whole day! I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network. I was in no way paid for my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;After trying my sample, I was highly impressed!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other clinical strength deodorants, hours after application, I still felt refreshed! In my opinion, the scent of the deodorant was not over bearing, but still present hours later. It does go on clear, and stay on clear! This deodorant did not clump, become chalky, or flake off. The price point, for the quality of this deodorant seems highly reasonable, as well.&lt;br /&gt;My one an only (minor) compliant is you have to be cautious using it, any minor cut from shaving can be irritated if the deodorant is applied before cut heals!  Overall, I am highly impressed.</li>
            <li> I only use clinical strength deodorant now. I still smell fresh at the end of the day! It smells good and lasts even during a workout with heavy sweating. Much much better than regular deodorant. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this in sample size and just paid for shipping. This is a great deodorant! I never use to sweat and could use just about any deodorant. After having my daughter, nothing works for me anymore. But now that I have found this, I am very very happy. Not only am I not sweating but I smell great! I definitely recommend you try this! If you want to sample it first, got to there website and try a sample, just pay shipping. They have a variety.</li>
            <li> This was not the same as what I bought at the store and skin broke out immediately after putting it on. Ingredient list is totally different! And why does it say to put it on at bedtime?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this deodorant! There are so many things that I love about it, first the deodorant smells AMAZING! I have gone out and purchased almost every scent that the gel deodorant is sold in and while all of them smell great the lavender is by far my favorite! My husband is always telling me that I smell good, and it is the smell of my deodorant! Secondly, the gel isn&#x27;t sticky, AT ALL! It also dries quickly and LASTS! Overall this deodorant works amazingly, and I was surprised that it helped with razor burn too! I highly recommend that you buy this product. I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network, however all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love how great the product worked and that it was invisible so no stains or product left on my clothes. Would definitely purchase again.  I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the smooth solid that I have been using for years - which I can&#x27;t find anywhere anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum Solid for over 10 years. Even though I&#x27;m a product junkie, I have never even thought of trying something new. Then I got this is in a monthly sample box about 6 months ago and didn&#x27;t want to just toss it....now I&#x27;m hooked! This stuff works very well! I live in Florida and really need something that can be relied on. It dries instantly, even in a humid bathroom. It&#x27;s never sticky and has a subtle powdery smell that dissipates quickly. No odor or dampness break throughs, ever!</li>
