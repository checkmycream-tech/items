    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a great product!  </li>
            <li>However those do an excellent job of removing the hair.  </li>
            <li>Then I began using pre-waxed strips and found what i thought was the best out there in Sally Hanson.  </li>
            <li>These are the best waxing strips.  </li>
            <li>Not the best product.</li>
            <li>The best home self waxing product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Works great, very very happy!</li>
            <li>These worked great and there was no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>These strips are great.</li>
            <li>Great seller, package was timely and there were no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Investing in a wax warmer and waxing supplies was a good idea.</li>
            <li>When I saw this package I thought it would be the best of both world&#x27;s easy and effective.</li>
            <li>Its excellent for quick results while traveling as well.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love these strips!</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to the difference between this and the Moom wax that you have to warm and apply and then lay the fabric strips ontop the area to be waxed yourself.</li>
            <li>Also, it is not as effective not even close.</li>
            <li>I use a hair dryer to warm them instead of just rubbing them between my hands</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are told to rub the wax sheets between your hands to warm up a bit.  </li>
            <li>Good wax quality and the strips make it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are the best strips I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>to re-wax more than once in each sitting).</li>
            <li>When this happens, it hurts way more than correct</li>
            <li>Veet brand much better</li>
            <li>I just love it and get it twice every month.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite beauty product.  </li>
            <li>It is okay</li>
            <li>but I also found that  when I wrap a couple of them up in my microwaved heating pad, it worked even better.  </li>
            <li>Much better than Sally Hansen wax strips.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Normally these work great</li>
            <li>The strips pulled apart more easily after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin and compare to spa waxing prices</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and saves a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>Definitely easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just about as effective, and certainly much cheaper, as going to the salon!</li>
            <li>These are far superior to those.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sticky but the oil included with the package quickly and easily removes any residue.</li>
            <li>May work best with a partner if trying to wax a hard to reach area like arm pits.</li>
            <li>but it keeps my skin soft and free from ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li>The only difference was that it was not as effective as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Super convenient, not messy, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These would take hold of the hair and then it came right off with one removal strip.</li>
            <li>This product makes it very easy for me to wax my hands and legs in the comfort and convenience of my house at my liesure, sans the headaches of making appointments and the stress of keeping them, not to mention at a third of the price.</li>
            <li>I think Moom is better than the others and pretty comparable to the traditional wax.</li>
            <li>it stings ALOT more than the regular Moom you apply to your skin.</li>
            <li>I use a blow dryer to heat each strip first.</li>
            <li>The product received was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I never shave my legs any more- after using these correctly, the hair that grows back is lighter and thinner</li>
            <li>I stopped using the wax warmer and traditional warm wax because it&#x27;s easy to overapply and end up with a goopy mess when you try to pull off the muslin strip.</li>
            <li>These pre-waxed strips are much easier to apply that the warm do-it-yourself home wax because you can&#x27;t overapply it and get a goopy mess.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin very sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li>These pre-waxed strips work very well.  </li>
            <li>I find it comparable to the traditional warm wax from an at home warmer except I got smoother with the traditional wax, did less re-waxing and had more hair come off whith each strip removal.</li>
            <li>Do make sure you wait long enough between so that your hair will be long enough for the strips to be effective.</li>
            <li>The results last longer, more hair comes off and you don&#x27;t have to re-wax certain patches of skin as much (you&#x27;re really not supposed</li>
            <li>One side clearly has more wax but the other side does almost as well as its waxier brother (that souds super gross, &amp;#34;waxier brother.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>Now they do not generally work as well as hot wax, but I have to say these strips come pretty close.  </li>
            <li>What I love about the pre-waxed is that they always have the right amount of wax on them, can be used a few times just like the regular wax.  </li>
            <li>I am sold on these and this will be my new method of hair removal from now on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very high maitenance apparently</li>
            <li>She tells me it cannot come close to a hot wax but definitely serves the purpose</li>
            <li>The Sally ones do not have this grip, which is almost like regular hot wax.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a natural product!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a huge mess and no heating required.</li>
            <li>I cut the strips into smaller pieces to do certain areas.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially their after waxing soothing lotion (included).  </li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive Irish and welsh skin, this product doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li>waxing(at least you get used to the waxing feeling), and then you have to clean and then re-wax the area.</li>
            <li>I have used the hot waxes, which I find messy and the cloth strips always run out before the wax.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for something simpler than hot wax and not as messy, these are for you.  </li>
            <li>I tend to bleed a little sometimes when I wax but not so much with Moom.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife started using this when she moved from India. She tells me it cannot come close to a hot wax but definitely serves the purpose and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> These worked great and there was no irritation at all. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It is easy to use and saves a lot of money.  You can also take it with you on vacation! I cut the strips into smaller pieces to do certain areas.  Works great, very very happy!</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the difference between this and the Moom wax that you have to warm and apply and then lay the fabric strips ontop the area to be waxed yourself. I have used pre-waxed strips (Sally Hansen, Sally Beauty Supply and Parissa), traditional wax from a warmer and muslin strips (Sally Beauty Supply and Sally Hansen), Nad&#x27;s wax with cloth strips, Sugaring/Wax, Wax warmed on the stovetop with a plastic roll that is cut into strips and now Moom. I think Moom is better than the others and pretty comparable to the traditional wax. Investing in a wax warmer and waxing supplies was a good idea. The results last longer, more hair comes off and you don&#x27;t have to re-wax certain patches of skin as much (you&#x27;re really not supposed to re-wax more than once in each sitting). I stopped using the wax warmer and traditional warm wax because it&#x27;s easy to overapply and end up with a goopy mess when you try to pull off the muslin strip. When this happens, it hurts way more than correct waxing(at least you get used to the waxing feeling), and then you have to clean and then re-wax the area. I tend to bleed a little sometimes when I wax but not so much with Moom. I find it comparable to the traditional warm wax from an at home warmer except I got smoother with the traditional wax, did less re-waxing and had more hair come off whith each strip removal. These pre-waxed strips are much easier to apply that the warm do-it-yourself home wax because you can&#x27;t overapply it and get a goopy mess.</li>
            <li> I used the Moom kit and were amazed by the results. Ihad to get use to using the application and strips but it worked so well! When I saw this package I thought it would be the best of both world&#x27;s easy and effective. It is neither...it stings ALOT more than the regular Moom you apply to your skin. Also, it is not as effective not even close. I can&#x27;t even call it easier because when you constantly have to do touch-ups it takes longer. Please take my advice and get the regular moom and take the time to apply it and use the cloth strips...you will thank me</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of waxing products over the years.  I have used the hot waxes, which I find messy and the cloth strips always run out before the wax.  However those do an excellent job of removing the hair.  Then I began using pre-waxed strips and found what i thought was the best out there in Sally Hanson.  Not So!!  These are far superior to those.  What I love about the pre-waxed is that they always have the right amount of wax on them, can be used a few times just like the regular wax.  And they don&#x27;t have lots of extra wasted wax and no cloth strips which I always run out of.  Now they do not generally work as well as hot wax, but I have to say these strips come pretty close.  The Sally ones do not have this grip, which is almost like regular hot wax.  Not exactly but close enough for me.  I am sold on these and this will be my new method of hair removal from now on.  So if you are looking for something simpler than hot wax and not as messy, these are for you.  I can cut them down to size, but you have to watch how you cut them as you need to leave at least one side with a space to grip.  Anyway, I love these strips!</li>
            <li> Not great. Veet brand much better</li>
            <li> These strips are great. I have ultra sensitive Irish and welsh skin, this product doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. I use a hair dryer to warm them instead of just rubbing them between my hands AND I use both sides of the plastic strip! One side clearly has more wax but the other side does almost as well as its waxier brother (that souds super gross, &amp;#34;waxier brother. Not sure why waxing strips are male. . . ) long story short, I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, in between waxings I use gold bond ultimate healing lotion mixed with some jojoba oil and tea tree oil. I&#x27;m very high maitenance apparently but it keeps my skin soft and free from ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> I had used salon service for most part of my life for waxing, which was expensive, time-consuming and stressful, especially since I started working. This product makes it very easy for me to wax my hands and legs in the comfort and convenience of my house at my liesure, sans the headaches of making appointments and the stress of keeping them, not to mention at a third of the price. Its excellent for quick results while traveling as well. I just love it and get it twice every month.</li>
            <li> These are the best waxing strips.  Super convenient, not messy, easy to use.  Definitely my favorite beauty product.  Never going to waste money on a fancy wax again.</li>
            <li> Not the best product. It leaves skin very sticky afterwards. It is okay, I prefer it for my legs and nothing else. Definitely easy to use.</li>
            <li> The best home self waxing product I&#x27;ve found. I prefer the pre-waxed strips for ease of use. It&#x27;s a bit sticky but the oil included with the package quickly and easily removes any residue. Just about as effective, and certainly much cheaper, as going to the salon! And it&#x27;s a natural product!</li>
            <li> I love using this because I hate having to put the wax on the cloth. I use a blow dryer to heat each strip first. It makes waxing my legs a quicker method. I do this, then I take a shower. I use the oil on cotton balls to remove the excess wax. Sometimes I wax then I shave too because I miss some spots.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use and effective.  Great seller, package was timely and there were no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are told to rub the wax sheets between your hands to warm up a bit.  That has worked for me but I also found that  when I wrap a couple of them up in my microwaved heating pad, it worked even better.  I have one of those bean bag type heating pads and only heated it half way (1 minute instead of 2) and then wrapped around the still packaged strips (out of the box, of course) for one minute.  The strips pulled apart more easily after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely easier for me then using the regular moom with the fabric strips.</li>
            <li> Good wax quality and the strips make it easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a huge mess and no heating required.</li>
            <li> These pre-waxed strips work very well.  Much better than Sally Hansen wax strips.  I would highly recommend these.  I used for light in texture facial hair which is sometimes difficult to get to adhere to the wax and remove.  These would take hold of the hair and then it came right off with one removal strip.</li>
            <li> The product received was exactly as described. The only difference was that it was not as effective as I thought it would be. I have thicker hair on all parts of my body, and after using the face strips and leg strips I was unsuccessful in removing all the hair. The amount of oil that comes with each package is only enough for a couple uses.</li>
            <li> I love these. I never shave my legs any more- after using these correctly, the hair that grows back is lighter and thinner so I don&#x27;t feel like a furry species between waxing. Do make sure you wait long enough between so that your hair will be long enough for the strips to be effective.</li>
            <li> Normally these work great but this time one box didn&#x27;t work so well. I&#x27;ll give it another try with the other box and see what happens</li>
            <li> We have been using these wax strips for years!  Great for sensitive skin and compare to spa waxing prices is a steal. Highly recommended, especially their after waxing soothing lotion (included).  I use the lotion even after spa waxing if I don&#x27;t have hydrocortisone.</li>
            <li> These leave a lot of hair behind, so I&#x27;m not really pleased with them. May work best with a partner if trying to wax a hard to reach area like arm pits.</li>
            <li> These are the best strips I have used so far. I will continue buying them.</li>
