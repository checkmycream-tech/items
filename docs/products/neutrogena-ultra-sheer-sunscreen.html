            <li>They learned what I already knew, we are very fair and most sunblock doesn&#x27;t work for us.  </li>
            <li>, A., you smell soooo good, says she.</li>
            <li>But, A., you smell soooo good, says she.</li>

            <li>Helioplex for keeping the product effective longer&lt;</li>
            <li>is that they supply the sunblock, kids aren&#x27;t allowed to bring their own.  </li>
            <li>Protects against the sun well and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I can get it all over her body very easily.</li>
            <li>Even works great for extra fair skin and redheads!</li>
            <li>Felt kind of greasy too, but I find most sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>old&#x27;s best friends.</li>
            <li>We used it on our vacation in the Caribbean with great success.</li>
            <li>Love the mist spray, it covers so nicely</li>
            <li>The spray is so nice and way more sanitary.</li>
            <li>A light all over misting of this does a good job.</li>
            <li>This has a fairly light scent and does a good job.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine  - no burns!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply as it&#x27;s a spray and it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It is effective and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I accidentally rub sun screen into my eyes, it does not burn like many others.</li>
            <li>this stuff is the best, except for the non-spray version of the same sunblock.</li>
            <li>the bottles are better for faces.</li>
            <li>I love this suncreen.</li>
            <li>Nice light sun tan lotion scent.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel or leave me looking like I&#x27;ve been dipped in a vat of oil, which most do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overly perfume-y smell, and most importantly, it WORKS!</li>
            <li>This product ruined a non-replaceable favorite shirt.</li>
            <li>I keep reading, enjoying the day, sipping my Scotch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I always to rub it in just a bit to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any spots.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on the top of my head and my neck to keep from burning.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s windy, you&#x27;re better off breaking out the SPF lotion.</li>
            <li>I really love this sunblock.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the face sunscreen and other sunscreens from Nutrogena as well (as they are wonderful)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sweat off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use when playing golf.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and does the job.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and is not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like how easy it is to miss a spot.</li>
            <li>and I burn easily.</li>
            <li>This is a really easy choice, because it&#x27;s so easy to spray on everywhere -- no wait time as you would have with a lotion.  </li>
            <li>So easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and feels nice and cool upon contact.  </li>
            <li>I live in extra-sunny Florida, and this is by far the BEST sunblock I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Has a light mist.  </li>
            <li>It does cost a bit more but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly easy to put on and have full coverage.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other sunscreens, this one had a good smell, and didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Even after several hours in and out of wave pools, water slides, and walking around out in the bright sun, we&#x27;ve never burnt using this.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s true because it happened to me,</li>
            <li>True story.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde with fair skin</li>
            <li>I spray this sunblock on my head before I go out and find that it is good for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Note that I do a lot of running in full sun, so</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>At an SPF 45, it provides adequate coverage for 2 to 3 hours when I am not in the water.  </li>
            <li>We like the shearness and the fact that it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very protective against burn and so easy to spray on your arms and legs.</li>
            <li>We used this in Belize - hot sun!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena sunblocks in the summer for several years now and, given that most of our summers are spent in the sun, by the pool or at the beach, I think I have some authority to state that I am happy with this</li>
            <li>Not sticky, just right.</li>
            <li>My personal experience is that you should not apply this anywhere near your eyes unless you have easy access to an abundant water supply to wash it off.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and light and when you reapply it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I am Irish with fair skin and this product protected me completely.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t recommend using it especially if you have very light skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil-free and described as being non-greasy, but it sure does feel greasy on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t wear well under makeup, so I&#x27;ll only use it for the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>and I used this in the hot sun on a cruise.</li>
            <li>I used this for a really hot day in the sun, where I sweated a lot and went into the pool maybe twice.  </li>
            <li>I forgot the tops of my feet and when they were burnt to a crisp</li>
            <li>the first thingI I do is apply it on my face and hands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that, this is definitely our favorite sunblock.</li>
            <li>The first time it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>First day out at the beach</li>
            <li>I will be buying more once I finish my current bottle.  </li>
            <li>The 45 spf is too strong to get a tan quickly, I barely had any color after a 7 day vacation in my swimming suit!</li>
            <li>a very fine dry mist&lt;br</li>
            <li>I frequently spend full days in the sun and because of uniform requirements, can not wear a hat.  </li>
            <li>The big draw for me is the easy application.</li>
            <li>You can really rub lotion in someone&#x27;s hair without it getting gross, but this light mist keeps my daughter&#x27;s part</li>
            <li>I reapplied after sweating and going in the water, but places that I missed on reapplication got really sunburned.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t want to look and smell like you are covered with sunblock</li>
            <li>When it says water resistant - it really is waterproof &amp; sweat</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>SPF 45 really is a lot of protection.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen for my family.</li>
            <li>so I really needed a spray sunblock in spite of the fact that it&#x27;s harmful to inhale the stuff.</li>
            <li>and this was actually the retail available sunblock the Dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li>low odor&lt;br /&gt;- seems to stay effective for several hours</li>
            <li>but I really wanted a quick spray for when I&#x27;m just going on a short walk.</li>
            <li>We buy a dozen or so spray cans of various SPF levels (we use SPF 70 in Florida) and a few sticks and out family of 5 is good for the season.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Such a fine mist barely leaves any residue, it don&#x27;t have to worry about it on my hands, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it still does the job.  </li>
            <li>First, I like that it&#x27;s a spray; I&#x27;ve recently realized that spray-on sunscreen is so much faster to apply.  </li>
            <li>The zinc- and titanium-based sunscreen that I normally use (</li>
            <li>Has a distinct aerosol smell (obviously), so if that bothers you take note</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on correctly so while it may work for normal outdoor use</li>
            <li>I find at the end of my day, my hair feels normal / is not sticky at all</li>
            <li>and it works fine for the other kids.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those that don&#x27;t like the feel, but definitely want the protection, of most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It was a fine product... but not worth writing War and Peace over.</li>
            <li>Banana Boat Kids SPF50) stays on much better through an entire day of swimming and other activities, plus it doesn&#x27;t have the suspect chemicals that this one does.  </li>
            <li>As a swim instructor I can&#x27;t exactly ask my students to put sunblock on my back</li>
            <li>This has a tendency to be a little oily if you use too much, so easy does it on the application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, normally I use expensive sunscreen</li>
            <li>My boyfriend fared a only a little better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is THE sunblock we use and we don&#x27;t use anything else, I am compelled to award this product the 5 stars it clearly deserves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to like this, I&#x27;m sticking with my physical barrier sunscreen.</li>
            <li>the smell, the feel, the residue so much that i just don&#x27;t go outside in the summer.</li>
            <li>old one of our 6 yr.</li>
            <li>Even after swimming I was surprised how well this worked.  </li>
            <li>This sunblock protected my skin completely.  </li>
            <li>My 4-year old daughter hates to hold still when I apply suntan lotion, but she doesn&#x27;t mind the spray</li>
            <li>Only four star because the bottle is small and it costs a bit more.  </li>
            <li>and I usually forget I&#x27;m wearing it because it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li>I was down in NJ for a week in the hot sun and never got burnt at all with this product.  </li>
            <li>but if you are a very pale person like me, I would just stick to something tried and true.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like their other sunblock as much.  </li>

            <li>Apparently our reviews are not valid unless we write enough words...</li>
            <li>Use some dry stick for the areas near your eyes or for your entire face if possible.&lt;br</li>

            <li> My personal experience is that you should not apply this anywhere near your eyes unless you have easy access to an abundant water supply to wash it off.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and light and when you reapply it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I am Irish with fair skin and this product protected me completely.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t recommend using it especially if you have very light skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil-free and described as being non-greasy, but it sure does feel greasy on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t wear well under makeup, so I&#x27;ll only use it for the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> and I used this in the hot sun on a cruise.</li>
            <li> I used this for a really hot day in the sun, where I sweated a lot and went into the pool maybe twice.  </li>
            <li> I forgot the tops of my feet and when they were burnt to a crisp</li>
            <li> the first thingI I do is apply it on my face and hands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, this is definitely our favorite sunblock.</li>
            <li> The first time it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> First day out at the beach</li>
            <li> I will be buying more once I finish my current bottle.  </li>
            <li> The 45 spf is too strong to get a tan quickly, I barely had any color after a 7 day vacation in my swimming suit!</li>
            <li> a very fine dry mist&lt;br</li>
            <li> I frequently spend full days in the sun and because of uniform requirements, can not wear a hat.  </li>
            <li> The big draw for me is the easy application.</li>
            <li> You can really rub lotion in someone&#x27;s hair without it getting gross, but this light mist keeps my daughter&#x27;s part</li>
            <li> I reapplied after sweating and going in the water, but places that I missed on reapplication got really sunburned.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t want to look and smell like you are covered with sunblock</li>
            <li> When it says water resistant - it really is waterproof &amp; sweat</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> SPF 45 really is a lot of protection.  </li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen for my family.</li>
            <li> so I really needed a spray sunblock in spite of the fact that it&#x27;s harmful to inhale the stuff.</li>
            <li> and this was actually the retail available sunblock the Dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> low odor&lt;br /&gt;- seems to stay effective for several hours</li>
            <li> but I really wanted a quick spray for when I&#x27;m just going on a short walk.</li>
            <li> We buy a dozen or so spray cans of various SPF levels (we use SPF 70 in Florida) and a few sticks and out family of 5 is good for the season.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Such a fine mist barely leaves any residue, it don&#x27;t have to worry about it on my hands, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it still does the job.  </li>
            <li> First, I like that it&#x27;s a spray; I&#x27;ve recently realized that spray-on sunscreen is so much faster to apply.  </li>
            <li> The zinc- and titanium-based sunscreen that I normally use (</li>
            <li> Has a distinct aerosol smell (obviously), so if that bothers you take note</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on correctly so while it may work for normal outdoor use</li>
            <li> I find at the end of my day, my hair feels normal / is not sticky at all</li>
            <li> and it works fine for the other kids.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those that don&#x27;t like the feel, but definitely want the protection, of most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It was a fine product... but not worth writing War and Peace over.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat Kids SPF50) stays on much better through an entire day of swimming and other activities, plus it doesn&#x27;t have the suspect chemicals that this one does.  </li>
            <li> As a swim instructor I can&#x27;t exactly ask my students to put sunblock on my back</li>
            <li> This has a tendency to be a little oily if you use too much, so easy does it on the application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, normally I use expensive sunscreen</li>
            <li> My boyfriend fared a only a little better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is THE sunblock we use and we don&#x27;t use anything else, I am compelled to award this product the 5 stars it clearly deserves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to like this, I&#x27;m sticking with my physical barrier sunscreen.</li>
            <li> the smell, the feel, the residue so much that i just don&#x27;t go outside in the summer.</li>
            <li> old one of our 6 yr.</li>
            <li> Even after swimming I was surprised how well this worked.  </li>
            <li> This sunblock protected my skin completely.  </li>
            <li> My 4-year old daughter hates to hold still when I apply suntan lotion, but she doesn&#x27;t mind the spray</li>
            <li> Only four star because the bottle is small and it costs a bit more.  </li>
            <li> and I usually forget I&#x27;m wearing it because it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li> I was down in NJ for a week in the hot sun and never got burnt at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> but if you are a very pale person like me, I would just stick to something tried and true.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like their other sunblock as much.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s girlfriend, a neighbor, and she&#x27;s married too, 3 little girls.</li>
            <li> Apparently our reviews are not valid unless we write enough words...</li>
            <li> Use some dry stick for the areas near your eyes or for your entire face if possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 3 hours I not only was still very sunburned but the sunburn was very uneven.</li>
            <li> I do not use it anywhere other than my scalp as I generally prefer rub-on to aerosol sunblocks, but there&#x27;s no way to rub sunblock into my hair.  </li>
            <li> My husband spent several hours in the ocean and it did not wear off after 5 to 6 hours!  </li>
            <li> I would re apply every couple of hours just because I was nervous but after returning home at the end of the day I was not red and not even pink.  </li>
            <li> If we swim we do reapply after we dry off.  </li>
            <li> and Neutrogena has always been my go-to sunscreen with its wide array of SPF&#x27;s and non greesy, non smelly, non clogging lotions.  </li>
            <li> , I put 2 coats on, went on a 1 hour walk and came home with pink forearms.</li>
            <li> I use the cream version on my face daily, year round as well.</li>
            <li> I gave this product several tries, mostly because I hate the way sunscreen lotion feels.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and you do not need to keep applying as you sweat or get wet.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely say this holds up in heavy sweat.  </li>
            <li> This time I used it all day long during an extremely sunny day with little shelter.</li>
            <li> lazy Saturday afternoon, having completed my 100 or so laps, I am in the back of the house, reading a book and sipping some drink, Scotch and soda.</li>
            <li> but this did not work like other SPF 45s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is 4 stars due to cost but it is a 5 star for effectiveness and feeling on the skin for this level of UV protection.</li>
            <li> Holy cow.</li>
            <li> I am now experiencing the itchiest rashiest reddest most painful burn of my life, and I have had a few.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel, have a strange odor, or any of those other unappealing aspects of other sunblocks.</li>
            <li> I did not burn and even got a little color.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and ingredient  in sunscreen may have a chemical reaction if there&#x27;s iron in your well water.  </li>
            <li> Now my little girl is a teenager in water polo (3 hr practices/5 days a week outdoor pool) still using this sunblock.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing the way some other brand&#x27;s have done in the past.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to for everyday use, and for water parks.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this, but it is not worth arguing over.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face, but I don&#x27;t like it.  It&#x27;s oil-free and described as being non-greasy, but it sure does feel greasy on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t wear well under makeup, so I&#x27;ll only use it for the rest of my body.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.  Has a light mist.  It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I am very fair skinned and I used this in the hot sun on a cruise. I did not burn and even got a little color. It is easy to apply as it&#x27;s a spray and it has a nice scent. It doesn&#x27;t sweat off easily. It does cost a bit more but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use the Neutrogena spray on the golf course, working in the yard, and on the beach. It&#x27;s very protective against burn and so easy to spray on your arms and legs. I keep a supply handy.</li>
            <li> First, I like that it&#x27;s a spray; I&#x27;ve recently realized that spray-on sunscreen is so much faster to apply.  I used this for a really hot day in the sun, where I sweated a lot and went into the pool maybe twice.  I reapplied after sweating and going in the water, but places that I missed on reapplication got really sunburned.  The zinc- and titanium-based sunscreen that I normally use (Banana Boat Kids SPF50) stays on much better through an entire day of swimming and other activities, plus it doesn&#x27;t have the suspect chemicals that this one does.  As much as I wanted to like this, I&#x27;m sticking with my physical barrier sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Easy to use when playing golf. You do not get your hands greasy to hold the golf club.&lt;br /&gt;If I accidentally rub sun screen into my eyes, it does not burn like many others.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best, except for the non-spray version of the same sunblock. The spray version is great to get coverage all over. the bottles are better for faces. This doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel, have a strange odor, or any of those other unappealing aspects of other sunblocks. it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t want to look and smell like you are covered with sunblock</li>
            <li> Holy cow. Just tried the Sunscreen Body mist from Neutrogena. And i just have to recommend this product.  I HATE sunscreen. the smell, the feel, the residue so much that i just don&#x27;t go outside in the summer. I&#x27;ve used the face sunscreen and other sunscreens from Nutrogena as well (as they are wonderful) but i have to say that the mist takes the Cake.  Such a fine mist barely leaves any residue, it don&#x27;t have to worry about it on my hands, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it still does the job.  I am very pale skinned and i burn within 30 minutes and Neutrogena has always been my go-to sunscreen with its wide array of SPF&#x27;s and non greesy, non smelly, non clogging lotions.  I&#x27;ve never burned with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this suncreen. It goes on as a thin mist and I usually forget I&#x27;m wearing it because it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li> Very glad we had bought this for our vacation to the beach!  I forgot the tops of my feet and when they were burnt to a crisp I realized how well this worked!  My husband spent several hours in the ocean and it did not wear off after 5 to 6 hours!  When it says water resistant - it really is waterproof &amp; sweat resistant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are looking for a tan, don&#x27;t get this.  The 45 spf is too strong to get a tan quickly, I barely had any color after a 7 day vacation in my swimming suit!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, normally I use expensive sunscreen but I really wanted a quick spray for when I&#x27;m just going on a short walk. So I tried this, I put 2 coats on, went on a 1 hour walk and came home with pink forearms. Fail. and it does smell like sunscreen, no hiding that! Felt kind of greasy too, but I find most sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> I had a procedure done to get rid of freckles on my face.  That was back in May last year.  I&#x27;ve been using this sunblock RELIGIOUSLY and not only have my sun spots come back but now I&#x27;m getting also in my hand.  I keep a can in my glove compartment so the minute I get un the car the first thingI I do is apply it on my face and hands.  I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Smells great. Works very well. Nice and compact</li>
            <li> Protects against the sun well and very easy to apply. Has a distinct aerosol smell (obviously), so if that bothers you take note</li>
            <li> Have been going out tot the river and using different brands.  This one is the best.  One application and even after several dips, no burns.  Only four star because the bottle is small and it costs a bit more.  Nice light sun tan lotion scent.</li>
            <li> I live in extra-sunny Florida, and this is by far the BEST sunblock I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel or leave me looking like I&#x27;ve been dipped in a vat of oil, which most do. It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out. It doesn&#x27;t have an overly perfume-y smell, and most importantly, it WORKS! I&#x27;ve used this stuff and stupidly forgotten to reapply for hours, and still, no sunburn (I&#x27;m extremely prone to burning). This is my go-to for everyday use, and for water parks. Even after several hours in and out of wave pools, water slides, and walking around out in the bright sun, we&#x27;ve never burnt using this. Even works great for extra fair skin and redheads!</li>
            <li> I know others have praised this product but I don&#x27;t recommend using it especially if you have very light skin like I do. I bought this in the spf 100 version. I used it twice while swimming. After 3 hours I not only was still very sunburned but the sunburn was very uneven. I&#x27;ve used spray sunscreens before that have never done that. I sprayed it on correctly so while it may work for normal outdoor use I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if your planning on being in water even though it claims its water resistant.</li>
            <li> It arrived past the usage date, and was useless.  I didn&#x27;t realize this until we arrived on vacation and I had to spend $20 on a replacement. I am not pleased with this, but it is not worth arguing over.  I won&#x27;t buy from these folks again.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  It has performed great for us.  We&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It stays on and does its job.  If we swim we do reapply after we dry off.  I use the cream version on my face daily, year round as well.</li>
            <li> Beware.  If any of this product is sprayed on your clothing you may get rust stains after washing in well water.  I did a little research and ingredient  in sunscreen may have a chemical reaction if there&#x27;s iron in your well water.  I am so sad.  This product ruined a non-replaceable favorite shirt.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena sunblocks in the summer for several years now and, given that most of our summers are spent in the sun, by the pool or at the beach, I think I have some authority to state that I am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF 45 spray features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- UVA/UVB protection&lt;br /&gt;- Helioplex for keeping the product effective longer&lt;br /&gt;- a very fine dry mist&lt;br /&gt;- low odor&lt;br /&gt;- seems to stay effective for several hours&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t need to re-apply it after swimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with the maker&#x27;s claim that it &#x27;resists running into eyes&#x27;. My personal experience is that you should not apply this anywhere near your eyes unless you have easy access to an abundant water supply to wash it off. Use some dry stick for the areas near your eyes or for your entire face if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, this is definitely our favorite sunblock. We buy a dozen or so spray cans of various SPF levels (we use SPF 70 in Florida) and a few sticks and out family of 5 is good for the season. We haven&#x27;t experienced any sunburns lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is THE sunblock we use and we don&#x27;t use anything else, I am compelled to award this product the 5 stars it clearly deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True story. I know it&#x27;s true because it happened to me, a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One lazy Saturday afternoon, having completed my 100 or so laps, I am in the back of the house, reading a book and sipping some drink, Scotch and soda. A bunch of kids are splashing in the pool, dogs running around, over-excited - they are not allowed in the pool area. And I notice T., circling around, making herself look busy, a hesitant, uncomfortable look on her face. She&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s girlfriend, a neighbor, and she&#x27;s married too, 3 little girls. Her 6 yr. old one of our 6 yr. old&#x27;s best friends. I keep reading, enjoying the day, sipping my Scotch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it short, she seems to find the needed energy to address me directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A., she says, what are you wearing?&lt;br /&gt;Svimvear I says (a joke, she&#x27;s from Russia).&lt;br /&gt;No, no, no, she says, what perfume are you wearing? Or is it your aftershave?&lt;br /&gt;T., what are you talking about? No perfume, says I. I just came out of the pool.&lt;br /&gt;But, A., you smell soooo good, says she. My husband never smells like this. Why can&#x27;t my husband smell like you do?&lt;br /&gt;Ahhhh... I finally realize, it&#x27;s GOT to be the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Mist Sunblock Spf 70 5 Oz. I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True story.&#x27;s from Russia).   No, no, no, she says, what perfume are you wearing? Or is it your aftershave?   T., what are you talking about? No perfume, says I. I just came out of the pool.   But, A., you smell soooo good, says she. My husband never smells like this. Why can&#x27;t my husband smell like you do?   Ahhhh... I finally realize, it&#x27;s GOT to be the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Mist Sunblock Spf 70 5 Oz. I&#x27;m wearing.    True story.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and does the job.</li>
            <li> I gave this product several tries, mostly because I hate the way sunscreen lotion feels. The first time it didn&#x27;t work I assumed that the breezy day was the culprit.     This time I used it all day long during an extremely sunny day with little shelter. It was liberally reapplied every hour. We didn&#x27;t just spray it on, we got it all over our hands and rubbed it in- we SLATHERED ourselves in the stuff.    I am now experiencing the itchiest rashiest reddest most painful burn of my life, and I have had a few. My boyfriend fared a only a little better. It&#x27;s been a week and the burn is still a painful healing mess. My forehead looks like I took a bad spill off of someone&#x27;s dirt bike and my shoulders give the impression that I am evolving into some sort of scaly higher life form.    I don&#x27;t know if I used this stuff wrong or what, but if you are a very pale person like me, I would just stick to something tried and true.    I am going to have a freckle explosion when this thing goes away :(</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and you do not need to keep applying as you sweat or get wet.  We used it on our vacation in the Caribbean with great success.</li>
            <li> My daughter started summer camp and the policy at camp is that they supply the sunblock, kids aren&#x27;t allowed to bring their own.  First day out at the beach and I get a call from camp... your daughter is badly sunburned.  They couldn&#x27;t understand it, they re-applied it every 2 hours and it works fine for the other kids.  They learned what I already knew, we are very fair and most sunblock doesn&#x27;t work for us.  I sent my daughter back to camp with this sunblock and we haven&#x27;t had a sun burn at summer camp in the three summers since.  Yes, this product works.  I only use spray on and only use this specific product - I don&#x27;t like their other sunblock as much.  Now my little girl is a teenager in water polo (3 hr practices/5 days a week outdoor pool) still using this sunblock.</li>
            <li> Very  nice.  Not sticky, just right.</li>
            <li> We used this in Belize - hot sun! We didn&#x27;t get a sunburn at all. Love the mist spray, it covers so nicely</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and is not at all greasy.  Provides very good coverage but I always to rub it in just a bit to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any spots.  Great for kids.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my golf bag and use it when I start to feel the burn.  I spray it on the top of my head and my neck to keep from burning.  And it works great!!  SPF 45 really is a lot of protection.  I played 18 holes yesterday and used this once and I&#x27;m fine  - no burns!  Expensive, but it does spray well.  And it feels good too - not oily or anything.  Good sunblock, Neutrogena!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen for my family. It is great to use on kids who are antsy to run around and play because they don&#x27;t have to sit still to have it applied. Just spray! It seems to protect them well, since they have never gotten a sunburn. It&#x27;s also great for using on their scalps. You can really rub lotion in someone&#x27;s hair without it getting gross, but this light mist keeps my daughter&#x27;s part protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sucks on a windy day, though. If it&#x27;s windy, you&#x27;re better off breaking out the SPF lotion. It can be a little frustrating, otherwise. I also don&#x27;t like how easy it is to miss a spot.</li>
            <li> It is good, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to put on and have full coverage. A relative told me it rubs off in the sand, but I&#x27;ve never gotten burnt when wearing it.</li>
            <li> The spray is so nice and way more sanitary. It feels nice and light and when you reapply it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. Application is re convenient with a spray as well.</li>
            <li> I really love this sunblock.  I was down in NJ for a week in the hot sun and never got burnt at all with this product.  Sprayed it on my face and all over my body.  Goes on smoothly, smells great and works perfectly.  I am Irish with fair skin and this product protected me completely.  Even after swimming I was surprised how well this worked.  I would re apply every couple of hours just because I was nervous but after returning home at the end of the day I was not red and not even pink.  This sunblock protected my skin completely.  I am a big Neutrogena fan and even a bigger one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li> This is a good sunblock. At an SPF 45, it provides adequate coverage for 2 to 3 hours when I am not in the water.  After I come out of the water, I reapply. The big draw for me is the easy application. A light all over misting of this does a good job. This has a tendency to be a little oily if you use too much, so easy does it on the application.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer using this to a lotion because lotions often leave me looking streaky. This has a fairly light scent and does a good job. I&#x27;m a blonde with fair skin and I burn easily. This is a reliable product that when used properly works..</li>
            <li> As a swim instructor I can&#x27;t exactly ask my students to put sunblock on my back so I really needed a spray sunblock in spite of the fact that it&#x27;s harmful to inhale the stuff. I was relieved to finally get a spray sunblock but this did not work like other SPF 45s. I doused myself in it and still got a lot of color on my body and red on the tops of my shoulders (I used Neutrogena Baby SPF 60 on my face and that works great!). I constantly inhaled it and it would make me cough even if applied outside. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Apparently our reviews are not valid unless we write enough words... so I will keep writing until the site is happy. It was a fine product... but not worth writing War and Peace over.</li>
            <li> My 4-year old daughter hates to hold still when I apply suntan lotion, but she doesn&#x27;t mind the spray and I can get it all over her body very easily. Works great!</li>
            <li> I was recently told by my dermatologist that I need to wear sunscreen all the time, even under clothes.  This is a really easy choice, because it&#x27;s so easy to spray on everywhere -- no wait time as you would have with a lotion.  I love it and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> We like the shearness and the fact that it dries quickly. It is effective and easy to apply. The issue is the cost... it&#x27;s expensive and with the spray, which we like as an application method for even coverage, it does waste quite a bit of product. Even with that, this is still cheaper than the one you get from the Dermatologist and this was actually the retail available sunblock the Dermatologist recommended. She even gave samples of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 4 stars due to cost but it is a 5 star for effectiveness and feeling on the skin for this level of UV protection. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing the way some other brand&#x27;s have done in the past.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply.  Absorbs quickly and feels nice and cool upon contact.  We use this almost every day.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews of others, I purchased Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunblock to keep my scalp from getting sunburned.  I frequently spend full days in the sun and because of uniform requirements, can not wear a hat.  I spray this sunblock on my head before I go out and find that it is good for the entire day.  Note that I do a lot of running in full sun, so I can definitely say this holds up in heavy sweat.  I do not use it anywhere other than my scalp as I generally prefer rub-on to aerosol sunblocks, but there&#x27;s no way to rub sunblock into my hair.  I find at the end of my day, my hair feels normal / is not sticky at all and my scalp has been protected.  I will be buying more once I finish my current bottle.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other sunscreens, this one had a good smell, and didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  Highly recommended for those that don&#x27;t like the feel, but definitely want the protection, of most other sunscreens.</li>
