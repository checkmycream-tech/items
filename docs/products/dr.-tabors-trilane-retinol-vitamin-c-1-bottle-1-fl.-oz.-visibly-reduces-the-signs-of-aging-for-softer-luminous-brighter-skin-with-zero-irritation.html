            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Works better than anything I have tried and I have tried many things.</li>
            <li>got the sample of Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C and started using it about a week ago and absolutely love it…</li>
            <li>My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.and more nutritional formula.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Two of my favorite skincare ingredients are Retinol and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to put any lotion/serum on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel and look better.</li>
            <li>I use it at night mostly and once I started using it, I immediately noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I will be continuing using this reasonably priced great product</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product  </li>
            <li>Then I did get what I felt a better edge on keeping any fine lines at bay</li>
            <li>Then I did get what I felt a better edge on keeping any fine lines at bay</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I did receive some of these products complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>So finding one that works so well for my skin at such a great price was really a huge relief for me!</li>
            <li>I have never tried vitamin based moisturizers before, so this was a great opportunity for me to learn more about this product, and how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am used to taking vitamins daily to ensure that my body receives all the necessary nutrition, but it is great to be able to apply some vitamins to my skin as well.</li>
            <li>I do wish it absorbed in because I would love to be able to wear it during the day.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have disappeared also.  </li>
            <li>After just 1 week I noticed a difference in my skin texture, tone and my fine lines</li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines are getting fainter and the puffiness under my eyes from all these blooms is hugely reduced.</li>
            <li>However, if I&#x27;m staying home and going without makeup for the day, I have found that the Trilane gives a smooth and glowing look to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but my review is genuine.</li>
            <li>I tried seeing if Squalane as an individual source differed greatly when it came to nutritional properties,</li>
            <li>Olive Squalane provides a lightly formulated oil like substance that is rich in lipids.</li>
            <li>The best feature is that the retinal in the formula does not dry or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After continuous use, the skin tone and spots on my skin have significantly evened out.</li>
            <li>20% off your first purchase of Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C sold by Healthy Directions on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was free but the statements are true to what our opinions are.</li>
            <li>The rest of the ingredients are familiar from Pomegranate, Cucumber, Licorice and so forth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also a Vegan friendly alternative as Shark Squalane is derived from their liver.</li>
            <li>so “skin friendly”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so “skin friendly”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the original product overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It will look and feel more soft and smooth, your skin tone will be more even, fines lines and wrinkles will be reduced, hyperpigmentation will fade and your skin will look luminous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my skin looks better, and it is something I would definitely purchase on my own..</li>
            <li>I found that it doesn’t irritate my skin at all, and I feel a lot more certain that my skin is protected when I apply</li>
            <li>While I was very happy with the moisturizer and how well it applied, distributed and absorbed, I did find I was not satisfied with the Retinol level.</li>
            <li>While I was very happy with the moisturizer and how well it applied, distributed and absorbed, I did find I was not satisfied with the Retinol level.</li>
            <li>the color looked better and it went in fast …</li>
            <li>It is like a mini facelift really. :)</li>
            <li>I really like this product and am enjoying using.</li>
            <li>If I am outside for a lot of the day and go for my runs in the evening, I do reapply after I shower, but I only use about one drop and it perfectly moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this that it really does go a long way.</li>
            <li>The morning after my first application, I immediately saw a difference in the texture of my skin!</li>
            <li>and it goes on really smooth and doesn’t require a lot to cover your whole face and neck ..</li>
            <li>I love it, it never wears off and my face feels soft, just the way I like it without an oily look</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t give many 5-star ratings, but I think this product qualifies for it as far as my experience is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received a complimentary product to facilitate a review.</li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Trilane (Healthy Directions).  </li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Trilane (Healthy Directions).  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel, so soft.  </li>
            <li>I like to apply the Trilane Retinol+Vitamin C right after I cleanse my skin,</li>
            <li>My daughter started using right along with me</li>
            <li>I love this product it works amazing i highly suggest other to test this out!</li>
            <li>Fantastic for mature skin!</li>
            <li>This product really moisturizes!</li>
            <li>It really needs it!</li>
            <li>I applied it liberally to my face in the evening, for the first time.</li>
            <li>Tried product it is very similar to many others I have used.</li>
            <li>Trilane is part of Healthy Directions LLC., which has an extensive line of serums, moisturizers to battle all your anti-aging needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>researching what makes this ingredient different and more powerful, I discovered that it is really just an emollient.</li>
            <li>I really like this!  </li>
            <li>and it automatically feels moisturize and super soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;[ll keep positive thoughts</li>
            <li>am not wild about Healthy Directions, the producers of this product.  </li>
            <li>That was not the case, after it dried it made my skin feel nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>didn’t know what to expect the consistence is kind of like a watered down oil</li>
            <li>I tried one container and find it a lighter substance, easy for daily use use.</li>
            <li>While it did in fact leave my skin feeling super soft</li>
            <li>very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Depending on how much you apply it may or may not work under the foundation.</li>
            <li>Using this under really matte foundations worked for me</li>
            <li>The solution is very hydrating and silky on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product was designed with the person in mind who wants the skin-improving benefits of Retinol, but without the drying side-effects.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer really plumped my cheeks, and I noticed an even glow.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works …</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product!</li>
            <li>, however, I also still have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I think the Squalane was a bit too intense for my face.  </li>
            <li>I think the intensity of the hydration was a bit too much for my already oily skin</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me, but I like the way it feels on my face</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>You have a wax that has been boiled down to produce a purer and more intensified solution.</li>
            <li>Jojoba is rich in fatty acids, so you not only get improvement in how a product applies but a richer and more nutritional formula.</li>
            <li>Now, the sun is out, and we will be spending more time outside, so the sun is going to definitely impact the skin, and we will need and take all the nutrition we can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The moisturizer was not harsh at all, and it left my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The Trilane line reflects several acting agents and the ones that stood the most, was Olive Squalane and Jojoba Esters.</li>
            <li>I have been using OTC products with 2.5% and none was declared on the package from Healthy Directions, but I did feel I needed to amp it up and decided to incorporate back my serum (containing Retinol) back by the 2.5 week point.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very liquid, clear product that dispenses from a pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Trilane Retinol+Vitamin C moisturizer also contains Squalane which is a oilless oil and is supposed to be lightweight, clear, odorless and non-comedogenic and provides intense hydration and makes skin feel soft and</li>
            <li>so I have to be very conscious of what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was going to leave my face feeling dry because the consistency is like a mix between water and oil, it is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>My fave is as soft as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>After pages and pages, I could only find that it penetrates (absorbs) into the skin quickly at a rate of 2MM per second when the agent is used singularly (by itself).</li>
            <li>They promote products with apparent Dr. approval and I find that highly unprofessional.</li>
            <li>I have breakout prone skin and this nourishes my skin and keeps it clear.</li>
            <li>I am amazed with all of the natural extracts that this lotion contains: squalane, sunflower oil, jojoba esters, olive oil, aloe extract, pomegranate extract, cucumber extract, licorice</li>
            <li>It just says to apply generously in the morning and evening, but doesn’t really explain how this product would tie in with the rest of your regular beauty</li>
            <li>my skin was so soft and visible looked better….</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was sent a bottle of their 100% Natural Retinol and Vitamin C moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Much like olive oil when it comes to the beneficial properties, but you have some differences that can be felt in how the final product feels and applies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old, 63.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and diagnosed rosecea</li>
            <li>I have used other Trilane products for a long time as the ingredient Squalane is natural and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>It was fine at night, so long as I didn&#x27;t wear any other moisturizer or facial oils, and I could wait awhile before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a shine on the skin, so ensure that you apply it under some other products on the skin, as well as maybe wait before leaving outside to ensure that the lotion is fully absorbed in the skin to avoid a shine on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I have found that 3 drops will cover my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>Not really sure of any true results yet, jury still out.</li>
            <li>but i have to say that it is  a little bit grease when you first applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>Since using this oil, no other type of moisturizer is necessary.</li>
            <li>I live in the Southwest and the weather here is beyond dry, it is DAAAARRRRRRYYYYYYAAAAHHH!</li>
            <li>It does not dry my face out and I am seeing the same results as retin a.</li>

            <li> Well pleased with product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have tried and I have tried many things.</li>
            <li> got the sample of Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C and started using it about a week ago and absolutely love it…</li>
            <li> My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.and more nutritional formula.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> Two of my favorite skincare ingredients are Retinol and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to put any lotion/serum on top of it.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel and look better.</li>
            <li> I use it at night mostly and once I started using it, I immediately noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I will be continuing using this reasonably priced great product</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product  </li>
            <li> Then I did get what I felt a better edge on keeping any fine lines at bay</li>
            <li> Then I did get what I felt a better edge on keeping any fine lines at bay</li>
            <li> /&gt;***I did receive some of these products complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li> So finding one that works so well for my skin at such a great price was really a huge relief for me!</li>
            <li> I have never tried vitamin based moisturizers before, so this was a great opportunity for me to learn more about this product, and how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am used to taking vitamins daily to ensure that my body receives all the necessary nutrition, but it is great to be able to apply some vitamins to my skin as well.</li>
            <li> I do wish it absorbed in because I would love to be able to wear it during the day.</li>
            <li> My fine lines have disappeared also.  </li>
            <li> After just 1 week I noticed a difference in my skin texture, tone and my fine lines</li>

            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines are getting fainter and the puffiness under my eyes from all these blooms is hugely reduced.</li>
            <li> However, if I&#x27;m staying home and going without makeup for the day, I have found that the Trilane gives a smooth and glowing look to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but my review is genuine.</li>
            <li> I tried seeing if Squalane as an individual source differed greatly when it came to nutritional properties,</li>
            <li> Olive Squalane provides a lightly formulated oil like substance that is rich in lipids.</li>
            <li> The best feature is that the retinal in the formula does not dry or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After continuous use, the skin tone and spots on my skin have significantly evened out.</li>
            <li> 20% off your first purchase of Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C sold by Healthy Directions on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was free but the statements are true to what our opinions are.</li>
            <li> The rest of the ingredients are familiar from Pomegranate, Cucumber, Licorice and so forth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also a Vegan friendly alternative as Shark Squalane is derived from their liver.</li>
            <li> so “skin friendly”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so “skin friendly”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the original product overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It will look and feel more soft and smooth, your skin tone will be more even, fines lines and wrinkles will be reduced, hyperpigmentation will fade and your skin will look luminous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my skin looks better, and it is something I would definitely purchase on my own..</li>
            <li> I found that it doesn’t irritate my skin at all, and I feel a lot more certain that my skin is protected when I apply</li>
            <li> While I was very happy with the moisturizer and how well it applied, distributed and absorbed, I did find I was not satisfied with the Retinol level.</li>
            <li> While I was very happy with the moisturizer and how well it applied, distributed and absorbed, I did find I was not satisfied with the Retinol level.</li>
            <li> the color looked better and it went in fast …</li>
            <li> It is like a mini facelift really. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product and am enjoying using.</li>
            <li> If I am outside for a lot of the day and go for my runs in the evening, I do reapply after I shower, but I only use about one drop and it perfectly moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this that it really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> The morning after my first application, I immediately saw a difference in the texture of my skin!</li>
            <li> and it goes on really smooth and doesn’t require a lot to cover your whole face and neck ..</li>
            <li> I love it, it never wears off and my face feels soft, just the way I like it without an oily look</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give many 5-star ratings, but I think this product qualifies for it as far as my experience is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I received the above product(s) free of charge from Trilane (Healthy Directions).  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel, so soft.  </li>
            <li> I like to apply the Trilane Retinol+Vitamin C right after I cleanse my skin,</li>
            <li> My daughter started using right along with me</li>
            <li> I love this product it works amazing i highly suggest other to test this out!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for mature skin!</li>
            <li> This product really moisturizes!</li>
            <li> It really needs it!</li>
            <li> I applied it liberally to my face in the evening, for the first time.</li>
            <li> Tried product it is very similar to many others I have used.</li>
            <li> Trilane is part of Healthy Directions LLC., which has an extensive line of serums, moisturizers to battle all your anti-aging needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> researching what makes this ingredient different and more powerful, I discovered that it is really just an emollient.</li>
            <li> I really like this!  </li>
            <li> and it automatically feels moisturize and super soft!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;[ll keep positive thoughts</li>
            <li> am not wild about Healthy Directions, the producers of this product.  </li>
            <li> That was not the case, after it dried it made my skin feel nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> didn’t know what to expect the consistence is kind of like a watered down oil</li>
            <li> I tried one container and find it a lighter substance, easy for daily use use.</li>
            <li> While it did in fact leave my skin feeling super soft</li>
            <li> very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depending on how much you apply it may or may not work under the foundation.</li>
            <li> Using this under really matte foundations worked for me</li>
            <li> The solution is very hydrating and silky on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product was designed with the person in mind who wants the skin-improving benefits of Retinol, but without the drying side-effects.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer really plumped my cheeks, and I noticed an even glow.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works …</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product!</li>
            <li> , however, I also still have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I think the Squalane was a bit too intense for my face.  </li>
            <li> I think the intensity of the hydration was a bit too much for my already oily skin</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me, but I like the way it feels on my face</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> You have a wax that has been boiled down to produce a purer and more intensified solution.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is rich in fatty acids, so you not only get improvement in how a product applies but a richer and more nutritional formula.</li>
            <li> Now, the sun is out, and we will be spending more time outside, so the sun is going to definitely impact the skin, and we will need and take all the nutrition we can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The moisturizer was not harsh at all, and it left my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The Trilane line reflects several acting agents and the ones that stood the most, was Olive Squalane and Jojoba Esters.</li>
            <li> I have been using OTC products with 2.5% and none was declared on the package from Healthy Directions, but I did feel I needed to amp it up and decided to incorporate back my serum (containing Retinol) back by the 2.5 week point.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very liquid, clear product that dispenses from a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Trilane Retinol+Vitamin C moisturizer also contains Squalane which is a oilless oil and is supposed to be lightweight, clear, odorless and non-comedogenic and provides intense hydration and makes skin feel soft and</li>
            <li> so I have to be very conscious of what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was going to leave my face feeling dry because the consistency is like a mix between water and oil, it is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> My fave is as soft as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> After pages and pages, I could only find that it penetrates (absorbs) into the skin quickly at a rate of 2MM per second when the agent is used singularly (by itself).</li>
            <li> They promote products with apparent Dr. approval and I find that highly unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I have breakout prone skin and this nourishes my skin and keeps it clear.</li>
            <li> I am amazed with all of the natural extracts that this lotion contains: squalane, sunflower oil, jojoba esters, olive oil, aloe extract, pomegranate extract, cucumber extract, licorice</li>
            <li> It just says to apply generously in the morning and evening, but doesn’t really explain how this product would tie in with the rest of your regular beauty</li>
            <li> my skin was so soft and visible looked better….</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was sent a bottle of their 100% Natural Retinol and Vitamin C moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Much like olive oil when it comes to the beneficial properties, but you have some differences that can be felt in how the final product feels and applies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old, 63.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and diagnosed rosecea</li>
            <li> I have used other Trilane products for a long time as the ingredient Squalane is natural and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> It was fine at night, so long as I didn&#x27;t wear any other moisturizer or facial oils, and I could wait awhile before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a shine on the skin, so ensure that you apply it under some other products on the skin, as well as maybe wait before leaving outside to ensure that the lotion is fully absorbed in the skin to avoid a shine on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have found that 3 drops will cover my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> Not really sure of any true results yet, jury still out.</li>
            <li> but i have to say that it is  a little bit grease when you first applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> Since using this oil, no other type of moisturizer is necessary.</li>
            <li> I live in the Southwest and the weather here is beyond dry, it is DAAAARRRRRRYYYYYYAAAAHHH!</li>
            <li> It does not dry my face out and I am seeing the same results as retin a.</li>
            <li> The first 5 ingredients are all emollients and/or oils, so it&#x27;s a very rich base for the Retinol and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> This may work for some women, but it made my face feel dry and rough, not dewy and soft.</li>
            <li> One drop covers my face, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical because every product makes the claim that it will help wrinkles, smooth out and even skin texture, help your pores  </li>
            <li> I have found that I can usually put it on in the morning and my skin is still moist and soft enough</li>
            <li> so it took a really long time for the product to absorb.  </li>
            <li> This oil also makes a good makeup base.</li>
            <li> Due to Jojoba being close to the properties found in human sebum, you can see why it’s</li>
            <li> Due to Jojoba being close to the properties found in human sebum, you can see why it’s</li>
            <li> It’s thinner and provides a rich barrier, something you want to seek out because you want a moisturizer that applies thin and absorbs quickly, but leaves no oily slick behind.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C anti-aging moisturizer, is simple when it comes to the properties that make-it up, so I was looking forward in trying a product that can cause less interactions, but still provide results.</li>

            <li> I’m not a vegetarian, but the latter is not exactly something I want to purchase and much less apply to my skin…..</li>
            <li> Too bad since I purchased two bottles, and it isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days so it is too soon to tell if it works.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 and starting to get a few lines, around mouth and forehead.</li>
            <li> Rub it in until it&#x27;s not really sitting on the skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin didn&#x27;t even turn pink with this oil.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry at all ( a little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> : a little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t be scared by the price tag.</li>
            <li> Each use needed only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that since I started using this oil under my eyes, the puffiness caused by other eye moisturizers is gone.</li>
            <li> I used the product for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found that workable for me in the past.</li>
            <li> Down side is that the product is very expensive.</li>
            <li> ??? Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Sorry I tried it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would leave my face greasy, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> However, I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any bad order.  </li>
            <li> The base of the moisturizer is botanical oil, and it helps to unclog pores and reduce wrinkles.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love it! My fave is as soft as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love it, it never wears off and my face feels soft, just the way I like it without an oily look</li>
            <li> ??? Not impressed at all. Kind of greasy and ???&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give many 5-star ratings, but I think this product qualifies for it as far as my experience is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of folks use specific oils or combinations of oils to cleanse and moisturize their face skin. I&#x27;ve not found that workable for me in the past. However, I&#x27;ve now been introduced to Trilane® Retinol + Vitamin C moisturizer and found it to be an encouragingly effective and workable product for me to use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very liquid, clear product that dispenses from a pump bottle. It contains a variety of oils along with retinol and vitamin C. It only takes a tiny amount and goes on very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning my face, I apply the Trilane rubbing it into the skin with upward rotating strokes. After it absorbs (mostly), I apply my makeup for the day. Foundation goes on beautifully atop the Trilane. However, if I&#x27;m staying home and going without makeup for the day, I have found that the Trilane gives a smooth and glowing look to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this to be a very pleasant and appealing product. I would encourage my readers to investigate and consider this as one product in their skin care arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate a review. Opinions are mine and I was not compensated.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the serum is fluid, silky and almost feels like a face oil without the greasiness. It absorbs rapidly and leaves a beautiful glow on your skin. This product really moisturizes! Depending on how much you apply it may or may not work under the foundation. Using this under really matte foundations worked for me otherwise I use this for nighttime use. My skin feels softer and looks healthier when I wake up in the morning. And since it&#x27;s so silky you only need a couple of drops for your face and neck area. The best feature is that the retinal in the formula does not dry or irritate my sensitive skin. I refuse to give up retinol products so I&#x27;m grateful that Trilane is a wonderful alternative. I recommend you try this product for yourself. I received this to test out but my review is genuine.</li>
            <li> This amazing moisturizer visibly reduces the signs of aging and leaves your skin luminous and glowing.  It smoothes and evens out skin texture and speeds the turnover of skin cells!  It also diminishes brown spots and minimizes pores! FYI: a little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t be scared by the price tag.</li>
            <li> I live in the Southwest and the weather here is beyond dry, it is DAAAARRRRRRYYYYYYAAAAHHH! So I was so happy to find Trilane. Just a couple drops in the morning keeps my skin feeling great. I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines are getting fainter and the puffiness under my eyes from all these blooms is hugely reduced. The suggested use calls for morning and evening application after cleansing. I have found that I can usually put it on in the morning and my skin is still moist and soft enough that I don&#x27;t always need it in the evening. If I am outside for a lot of the day and go for my runs in the evening, I do reapply after I shower, but I only use about one drop and it perfectly moisturizes my skin. In the morning I notice that I have reduced redness and the sking around my neck is looking smoother and not quite as blotchy. It really is a great product and I was so happy I gave it a try. There are so many products out there and so expensive too. So finding one that works so well for my skin at such a great price was really a huge relief for me!</li>
            <li> I have recently received Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C moisturizer for a review. I have never tried vitamin based moisturizers before, so this was a great opportunity for me to learn more about this product, and how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am used to taking vitamins daily to ensure that my body receives all the necessary nutrition, but it is great to be able to apply some vitamins to my skin as well. It really needs it! Now, the sun is out, and we will be spending more time outside, so the sun is going to definitely impact the skin, and we will need and take all the nutrition we can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer from Healthy Directions with Retinol and Vitamin C helps to protect the skin from the elements, smoothes the skin, and makes the skin shine. It definitely adds that wonderful glow. The base of the moisturizer is botanical oil, and it helps to unclog pores and reduce wrinkles. I found that it doesn’t irritate my skin at all, and I feel a lot more certain that my skin is protected when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using it from now on as a moisturizer at home. I spend most of my day at home, so it is quite perfect! The solution is very hydrating and silky on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t find that this vitamin cream has any scent to it at all. I am amazed with all of the natural extracts that this lotion contains: squalane, sunflower oil, jojoba esters, olive oil, aloe extract, pomegranate extract, cucumber extract, licorice extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that a con for me in this vitamin is the somewhat greasy texture of it. It leaves a shine on the skin, so ensure that you apply it under some other products on the skin, as well as maybe wait before leaving outside to ensure that the lotion is fully absorbed in the skin to avoid a shine on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the lotion did not come with a lot of instructions in the package on how to use it. I am not a big pro in makeup department, so I need all the tips I can get on how it shouldbe used, and how to apply it. I wish the company would provide more direction. It just says to apply generously in the morning and evening, but doesn’t really explain how this product would tie in with the rest of your regular beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out of this trial sample, I will definitely buy this product again! It is a great way to hydrate your skin, and give it a lot of vitamins that it wouldn’t be able to get otherwise. Your skin will stay moist for most of the day, and it is great to apply at night at well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a sample of this product for a review. This is a sponsored post. I am expressing my honest opinion about the product.</li>
            <li> Check out my blog post for an in depth review on this product    [...]</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased. Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> My skin looks radiant and healthy.  Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Actually this irritated my skin, created bumps and redness so I had to quit using it after 2 weeks.  Sorry I tried it.</li>
            <li> (I received this product for review purposes. My opinions are my own. For more information and pictures, please see my blog, Lit From Within.) This product was designed with the person in mind who wants the skin-improving benefits of Retinol, but without the drying side-effects. The first 5 ingredients are all emollients and/or oils, so it&#x27;s a very rich base for the Retinol and Vitamin C.  It also has soothing ingredients like Aloe and Cucumber extract.  My skin is aging (I&#x27;m over 40) but it&#x27;s also really oily, and I found that this moisturizer was a bit too heavy for my tastes.  If I put it on in the morning, I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup over it.  It was fine at night, so long as I didn&#x27;t wear any other moisturizer or facial oils, and I could wait awhile before going to bed.  I did like that it was fragrance-free, and with lots of natural ingredients; it just wasn&#x27;t the best fit for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. At first I thought it was going to leave my face feeling dry because the consistency is like a mix between water and oil, it is very lightweight. But it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry at all ( a little goes a long way) and it gives my face a nice glowy + dewy look. Overall I would recommend it! My face feels somehow plumper which I think helps give it a glowing appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Trilane Retinol for 3 weeks, and I&#x27;m in love with this serum. One drop covers my face, so it will last a long time. I was afraid it would leave my face greasy, and it didn&#x27;t. After my face absorbed it, I am good to go. Shipping was fast. Customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days so it is too soon to tell if it works.  However, I have nothing bad to say about it. No breakouts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Elaine</li>
            <li> My complexion was glowing after 1 week of use.  My fine lines have disappeared also.  I love this product.  I use it with the Hyaluronic acid serum &amp; the Trilane moisturizer with squalene.</li>
            <li> Well pleased with product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Works better than anything I have tried and I have tried many things.</li>
            <li> I loved using Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C on my skin! The moisturizer itself is a liquid-oil consistency, and comes in a 1 fluid ounce bottle. I applied it liberally to my face in the evening, for the first time. A little bit of this definitely goes a long way. Each use needed only a small amount. The morning after my first application, I immediately saw a difference in the texture of my skin! The moisturizer really plumped my cheeks, and I noticed an even glow. After continuous use, the skin tone and spots on my skin have significantly evened out. The moisturizer was not harsh at all, and it left my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;I got the sample of Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C and started using it about a week ago and absolutely love it…&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical because every product makes the claim that it will help wrinkles, smooth out and even skin texture, help your pores  blah blah blah ……..&lt;br /&gt; This stuff really works …&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know what to expect the consistence is kind of like a watered down oil and it goes on really smooth and doesn’t require a lot to cover your whole face and neck ..&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I noticed my skin was plumping up and getting hydrated without a greasy feel the color looked better and it went in fast … no sitting on the skin waiting for it to soak in ..&lt;br /&gt;I went to bed and in the morning my skin was so soft and visible looked better…. I used the product for a few days and I honestly have to say I love the stuff I didn’t break out, my skin looks better, and it is something I would definitely purchase on my own..&lt;br /&gt;Below is the product page and discount code if you want to try it&lt;br /&gt;Amazon product page http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K3FY3GE&lt;br /&gt;Save 20% off your first purchase of Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C sold by Healthy Directions on Amazon.com.

            <li> Like it. It&#x27; my second bottle</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product! Fantastic for mature skin! Check out my review of this product at rebeccasbeautyblog.com</li>
            <li> Tried product it is very similar to many others I have used. Down side is that the product is very expensive. I did receive this product as a courtesy to review on my blog simplysamples on blogspot #simplysamples</li>
            <li> this product works great as a moisturizer and it does a wonderful job at minimizing the pores. but i have to say that it is  a little bit grease when you first applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it every night before bed. I have breakout prone skin and this nourishes my skin and keeps it clear. I don&#x27;t use it during the day though because it is oily even though they say it isn&#x27;t.  I do wish it absorbed in because I would love to be able to wear it during the day.</li>
            <li> nothing yet, but I&#x27;ll continue using it.  I&#x27;[ll keep positive thoughts</li>
            <li> Trilane is part of Healthy Directions LLC., which has an extensive line of serums, moisturizers to battle all your anti-aging needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a bottle of their 100% Natural Retinol and Vitamin C moisturizer. The Trilane line reflects several acting agents and the ones that stood the most, was Olive Squalane and Jojoba Esters. The rest of the ingredients are familiar from Pomegranate, Cucumber, Licorice and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive Squalane-&lt;br /&gt;Upon researching what makes this ingredient different and more powerful, I discovered that it is really just an emollient. It is also a Vegan friendly alternative as Shark Squalane is derived from their liver. I’m not a vegetarian, but the latter is not exactly something I want to purchase and much less apply to my skin…..no matter the claims. Olive Squalane provides a lightly formulated oil like substance that is rich in lipids. Much like olive oil when it comes to the beneficial properties, but you have some differences that can be felt in how the final product feels and applies. It’s thinner and provides a rich barrier, something you want to seek out because you want a moisturizer that applies thin and absorbs quickly, but leaves no oily slick behind. I tried seeing if Squalane as an individual source differed greatly when it came to nutritional properties, like is it more potent (percentage wise) but could not allocate any clinical information stating so. After pages and pages, I could only find that it penetrates (absorbs) into the skin quickly at a rate of 2MM per second when the agent is used singularly (by itself). So, it gives you an idea on why it was added to this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Esters-&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba is always identified as an oil and it’s really technically a wax, but still an emollient. You have a wax that has been boiled down to produce a purer and more intensified solution. Jojoba is rich in fatty acids, so you not only get improvement in how a product applies but a richer and more nutritional formula. Due to Jojoba being close to the properties found in human sebum, you can see why it’s so “skin friendly”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;The Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C anti-aging moisturizer, is simple when it comes to the properties that make-it up, so I was looking forward in trying a product that can cause less interactions, but still provide results. I tried the product for a period of 2 weeks and stopped using any alternate Vitamin C and Retinol product. I figure this was a 2-in-1 product, so let us see how it does on it’s own. While I was very happy with the moisturizer and how well it applied, distributed and absorbed, I did find I was not satisfied with the Retinol level. I have been using OTC products with 2.5% and none was declared on the package from Healthy Directions, but I did feel I needed to amp it up and decided to incorporate back my serum (containing Retinol) back by the 2.5 week point. Then I did get what I felt a better edge on keeping any fine lines at bay and I can say the Trilane line does deliver a lot of moisture and I say this again, because it put up with the weather swings we have been experiencing in Southern California. It’s been cloudy and in the 60’s to then the 80’s three days later! Trilane kept my skin’s temperaments at bay because it likes to misbehave when the weather swings like this. I received the above product(s) free of charge from Trilane (Healthy Directions).  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.and more nutritional formula.

            <li> Love it.. It is like a mini facelift really. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product it works amazing i highly suggest other to test this out!</li>
            <li> I have used other Trilane products for a long time as the ingredient Squalane is natural and easy to wear. Earlier in my life I wore no products aside from soap and water.  As I age I need something to keep the skin moisturized and decided on this product. Now there is a second similar product that contains Retinol and Vitamin C.  I tried one container and find it a lighter substance, easy for daily use use. I use the original product overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I am not wild about Healthy Directions, the producers of this product.  They promote products with apparent Dr. approval and I find that highly unprofessional.</li>
            <li> Two of my favorite skincare ingredients are Retinol and Vitamin C.  This moisturizer by Trilane provides the best of both worlds!  You get skin-renewing antioxidants and age-fighting ingredients that help your skin look and feels years younger!&lt;br /&gt;The Trilane Retinol+Vitamin C moisturizer also contains Squalane which is a oilless oil and is supposed to be lightweight, clear, odorless and non-comedogenic and provides intense hydration and makes skin feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 and I have obvious age concerns, however, I also still have very oily skin so I have to be very conscious of what I put on my face.  I think the Squalane was a bit too intense for my face.  While it did in fact leave my skin feeling super soft I think the intensity of the hydration was a bit too much for my already oily skin so it took a really long time for the product to absorb.  However, I continued to use it as under my eyes, on my neck and decollete and loved the results!  Since it contains Retinol, which can make skin sun-sensitive I decided to only use it as part of my nightly skincare routine.  I like to apply the Trilane Retinol+Vitamin C right after I cleanse my skin, while it&#x27;s still damp and massage it in, it only takes a drop or two and it automatically feels moisturize and super soft!  After just 1 week I noticed a difference in my skin texture, tone and my fine lines were even diminished.&lt;br /&gt;With Trilane Retinol+Vitamin C you will notice a vast improvement in your skin.  It will look and feel more soft and smooth, your skin tone will be more even, fines lines and wrinkles will be reduced, hyperpigmentation will fade and your skin will look luminous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive some of these products complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> I received this as a product for review.  It is so great.  I love how it makes my skin feel, so soft.  It doesn&#x27;t have any bad order.  I don&#x27;t need to put any lotion/serum on top of it.  I didn&#x27;t break out using it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS SO WONDERFULLY SOOTHING.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel and look better.</li>
            <li> I really like this!  It does not dry my face out and I am seeing the same results as retin a.</li>
            <li> Needs to be thicker, doesn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing as the regular formula.</li>
            <li> I started using Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C moisturizer a couple of weeks ago. I use it at night mostly and once I started using it, I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. I am 61 and starting to get a few lines, around mouth and forehead. I found that I only needed about two drops of the moisturizer for my entire face and neck. Since it is an oil I was concerned that it was going to feel greasy. That was not the case, after it dried it made my skin feel nice and soft and smooth. My daughter started using right along with me and she said how nice her skin felt. I will be continuing using this reasonably priced great product and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Trilane Retinol + Vitamin C moisturizer for review through http://www.brandbacker.com. </li>
            <li> I really like this product and am enjoying using.</li>
            <li> The Trilane moisturizer is a good product you should invest in because it works both as a serum and a moisturizer. It noticeably made a difference on my skin. My skin seems healthier and brighter than ever; another great thing is that it didn’t clog my pores. The great thing about this that it really does go a long way. If I put a drop onto my hands, I can use it all over my face and still have some left over so I know I can use this for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old, 63. It didn&#x27;t do much for me, but I like the way it feels on my face</li>
            <li> Not really sure of any true results yet, jury still out. However product feels good going on.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Moisturizing and I have noticed wrinkle reduction.  I am 55.  I use it with Jan Marini products</li>
            <li> This may work for some women, but it made my face feel dry and rough, not dewy and soft. After a week of use I have quit using it. Too bad since I purchased two bottles, and it isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a couple of weeks. So far I have found that 3 drops will cover my entire face and neck. Rub it in until it&#x27;s not really sitting on the skin. Since using this oil, no other type of moisturizer is necessary. I&#x27;ve noticed that since I started using this oil under my eyes, the puffiness caused by other eye moisturizers is gone. This oil also makes a good makeup base. My pores are smaller and makeup doesn&#x27;t cake in wrinkles or slide off.  I also use this oil at night, again, with only 3 drops. I have sensitive skin and diagnosed rosecea and my skin didn&#x27;t even turn pink with this oil. Oh yes, by the way I&#x27;m 69.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After only one use I could see a difference in my skin. I have very oily skin so I use it in the daytime only around my lips, then all over at night. Very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY FAVARITE MOISTURIZEER.  MY WRINCKLES ARE DIMENISHING</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time! Love this product  it works so well for me . Will be a regular customer!</li>
