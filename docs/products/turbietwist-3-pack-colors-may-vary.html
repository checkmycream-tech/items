            <li>Very handy.  </li>
            <li>It also was sent very quick and was perfect.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li>But I loved the convenience of hair wraps, so I bought a 3 pack of these Turbie Twisties as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>They work great and are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>They loved them and wore them most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love Turbie Twists!!</li>
            <li>They do a great job absorbing, and will wrap up a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li>If you want more panache, the zebra Turbie Twists are cute!</li>
            <li>I said Amazon is great with their shipping &amp; I was right</li>
            <li>Very light weight but very absorbent and easy to use!!!</li>
            <li>I love these...</li>
            <li>I just love Turbie Twist towels and needed to add more to my collection because they get used all the time.</li>
            <li>These are so great, I used them at my sisters when I was visiting and loved them,came home and ordered them, plus ordered extra to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a GREAT Product</li>
            <li>Better than listed.</li>
            <li>So they were even better than listed.</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>The snowflakes one is ok, but I bought it around March-</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if they work or not, but she&#x27;s had them for over 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a great buy: soft, effective, cute, and convenient.</li>
            <li>I do so wish Turbie Twist would make note of the comments and make a better quality towel, but in the meantime, there is a solution.</li>
            <li>The material is more of a terry cloth than microfiber (I uploaded a photo showing the difference in material).</li>
            <li>It was about time to buy some more.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I love the Turbie Towels, but some are knock-offs and are synthetic material.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really finds this product to be a great item to have.</li>
            <li>these are great, I used to wear a whole towel around my head.  </li>
            <li>and he likes it better than using a bath towel.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred the terry cloth to be more of a terry cloth than a velour feel.</li>
            <li>I love that we can wrap her hair up in this</li>
            <li>and of course she looked ridiculously cute in it.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>They love them and so do I.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and I am still able to use this with ease on her hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using my turbie twist for 6 years almost to the day and it has seen better days...</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer Terry Cloth, more like a towel.</li>
            <li>I would love love to have some more</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more.</li>
            <li>I have used the Turbie Twists for years and have given many as gifts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better values elsewhere for this type of item,but its okay.</li>
            <li>better material.  </li>
            <li>something to add to my Christmas bags, love these</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad they still make them.</li>
            <li>these things are one of my favorite...</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;Older&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>the terry cloth is much more absorbant than the micro-fiber....</li>
            <li>I bought a pack of these years ago(maybe 7 years ago), and love them.</li>
            <li>But for me, I love them.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more so if they ever wear out(which</li>
            <li>I figured after 7 or so years they probably don&#x27;t make them any more.</li>
            <li>She likes them much better than wrapping a towel around her head.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love these, great for getting ready in the morning or a restful night at home.</li>
            <li>A hit for a tocking stuffer for sure.</li>
            <li>Love the fit!</li>
            <li>After trying the turbie twist, i realize the bath towel does a much better job</li>
            <li>i wonder if there is a better quality turbie twist out there?</li>
            <li>They are the best for putting my extremely long hair up in before I get out of the shower and drip all over the floor...</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see 100% cotton as I do NOT like microfiber!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, absorbent, and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>So light and comfortable!</li>
            <li>She loved it so much she gave one to some of her girl friends.</li>
            <li>They should of kept the original twist and if they wanted to make one w/ more of a terry fiber added to their product line and added a Turbie Twist 2.</li>
            <li>The package comes with 3, so it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on.</li>
            <li>They came in the mail very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to put on and stays up until I need to take it off.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and easy to wash.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than using a full sized towel.  </li>
            <li>They work fine and wash up fine.</li>
            <li>I have med length hair, fine.</li>
            <li>I really need 2 more!</li>
            <li>such a great product.  </li>
            <li>My friends make fun of my Turbie Twist but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, it stays in place and it is absorbent.</li>
            <li>She will enjoy it for years to come</li>
            <li>Easy to clean in wash machine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit in the Turbie Twist without having to \\&quot;fold in\\&quot; the longest layers.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my two year-old one night and it seemed to fit her just as well.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great idea.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t all fit inside,</li>
            <li>plus, I love the fun colors I received.  </li>
            <li>The item itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They stay in place and don&#x27;t fall easily like a full size towel does.</li>
            <li>I love the turbie twist it works great on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair less bulky then a towel.</li>
            <li>I love these so much!</li>
            <li>Do stick with the original</li>
            <li>They work great on my long hair.</li>
            <li>Stick with the original.</li>
            <li>Making them bulkier and heavier than the original.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the original Turbie Twist based on the product description and the reviews; however, these are made of microfiber not cotton like the original ones.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs a great amount of water, but I think since my hair is so long, it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It was no longer looking clean</li>
            <li>it is bright white, free of holes and luxurious as can be.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for keeping wet hair out of your face while getting ready.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true what a lot of reviews -- on this site and others --say about how thin the towels are, but there is a wonderful way of making it better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to launder and although I&#x27;ve purchased more, I&#x27;ve had one for several years that I can still use making it a good value as well as highly functional.</li>
            <li>I love them, however, I added one large button to each.  </li>
            <li>Either way really happy about the purchase and definitely will buy these again once they run out (which I don&#x27;t expect to be very soon!)</li>
            <li>but this works great at keeping your wet hair up</li>
            <li>It is true microfiber and being true microfiber over time grabbed bits and pieces of stuff over time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep them because regardless they are still lighter than a full sized towel.</li>
            <li>They are not as floppy as a full sized towel.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, I now have four of them.</li>
            <li>I love the turbie twist,it is so much easier when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>They are also good to help keep my hair from the sun when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li>These are not bad.</li>
            <li>Since the packages were separate I was able to give a NEW 1 in the Original Package to a friend.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of quick drying hair &amp; holding hair in place so you can do other things.  </li>
            <li>Light on the head, easy to use, and better looking than a big bulky towel.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see the high quality as I had remembered.  </li>
            <li>If you have short hair, I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Good towels- not super cheap quality.</li>
            <li>These are great to use to dry your hair and way more efficient than a regular towel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for keeping your hair out of the way while you dry off and they work wonderfully to help dry your hair while you are busy tending to other things.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that the Turbie fit comfortably on such a little head,</li>
            <li>this is really a terry towel cut to a turban fit.  </li>
            <li>I love these soft, absorbant towel wraps.  </li>
            <li>But for the hassle and discomfort it saves both of us, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I rarely review products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple and effective way to deal with your hair after a bath or shower, or even after sampooing.</li>
            <li>However if you have owned the ORIGINAL Turbie Twist and you are looking for an exact replacement, please be aware that they HAVE changed it.</li>
            <li>the quality is very good and they last a long time...</li>
            <li>Good sized, and fits securely on your head but only downside to it is that its made of microfiber and doesn&#x27;t absorb the water like the regular cloth they used to be made of.</li>
            <li>I have used these for years and was so glad to find them again, there are other brands but none work as good as the actual turbie twist brand.</li>
            <li>I bought a different kind years ago made of microfiber which is much thicker.</li>
            <li>These will be Christmas presents, thanks for shipping these to me so quickly.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li>The wraps arrived as promised and my daughters has used it daily and is pleased with how it drys her hair</li>
            <li>story short, I love these things.</li>
            <li>They are heavier, more bulky and slightly larger.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>But I still have to use a regular towel first to get most of the moisture out of my hair.</li>
            <li>My daughters first used this at Grandmas house.</li>
            <li>If your only goal is to be able to tie your hair up after a shower, the Turbie Twist might do.</li>
            <li>the shipped product is better than the same brand I found in Walgreens.....</li>
            <li>but I am glad I ordered theses as I think they will last longer.</li>
            <li>So I look inside at the label and sure enough it read microfiber and spandex.</li>
            <li>It gets hot hot hot where I live and this keeps my cool after my shower.</li>
            <li>This is good for keeping your hair up and out of your face, but keep in mind, it does not DRY hair as well as a regular towel does...  </li>
            <li>I love it, because it is so much lighter on your head than a standard size towel.  </li>
            <li>Have used turbies for some time; got my daughter with long hair hooked on them.&lt;br /&gt;Lessens time for  her to use hair dryer - saving time and better for condition of hair.</li>
            <li>My daughters love these with their long hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected, I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li>They are on the thinner side and are not thick towels (and the both of us have really thick hair) but the thickness doesn&#x27;t seem to matter, they still work great.</li>
            <li>They hold my hair easily and came in three different colors.</li>
            <li>I love these towels when I get out of the shower with my long wet her, it keeps my hair from getting all the water in my blouse, I just LOVE THESE TOWELS, practical and convenient</li>
            <li>They work really well on shorter hair though I agree it would be nice if they were made of a material that was slightly thicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about, but these are great!</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase a cotton Turbie so that it works better getting the wet hair dry.</li>
            <li>and with these light weight turbies I can wrap my hair up and read a book, put on make-up, even sleep without a big bulky towel on my head.   </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it would be good for long hair because of the light weight and small size.  </li>
            <li>, the knock-off brands won&#x27;t stay on and are much thinner.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t know how she went without it and recommends it highly!</li>
            <li>It really helps keep the oil out of my face and neckline.  </li>
            <li>Her head/neck can&#x27;t comfortably support the weight of a regular towel on her head and she doesn&#x27;t like to blowdry it (nor do I).  </li>
            <li>My wife likes them very well.</li>
            <li>These really absorb water after a shower.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>This works for putting your hair up and out of your face when you are getting ready just after a shower.</li>
            <li>Mine were quite threadbare after much use.  </li>
            <li>It could be maybe they have very thick,long,heavy hair.</li>
            <li>The Turbie Twists are a tradition in our family; my two daughters and I really like them and they aren&#x27;t as bulky as a towel and easier to use.</li>
            <li>I travel very often</li>
            <li>Wish they were available in white tho</li>
            <li>I really would like to have color&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>After a few months, the button fell off, and then even the elastic loop began to separate, rendering it a nice terry cloth rag.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a nice heavy weight and made well.  </li>
            <li>Received the turby twist yesterday and my daughter said it is good to have it&#x27;s absobability since her hair takes so long to dry.  </li>
            <li>weight of the original Turbie Twist is only 3.2 OZ.</li>
            <li>Wish they hard more colors, love it overall!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
            <li>the elastic loop to hold it in place is very stretched out, the once white towel is more of a light brown and there is a hole in it from where I hang it on the towel rack daily...</li>
            <li>Less snug fitting allows &#x27;flopping&#x27; which fatigues my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Turbie Twists.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the original for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I originally bought a single Turbie Twist at Bed, Bath and Beyond when they 1st</li>
            <li>It is made of a soft velour-like material that is very absorbent.  </li>
            <li>they are so soft and hold my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I have to use a regular towel first to get as much of the moisture out, THEN, I put on the Turbie Twist.</li>
            <li>I would, and probably will, buy a few more.</li>
            <li>My hair is not quite shoulder length and the turbie barely captures all of the hair, not enough material to wrap securely.  </li>
            <li>These are nice and thick and the elastic works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Turbie Twist before and what I received was not the same fabric; it was visually different plus it felt much lighter than the original Turbie Twist.  </li>
            <li>Got one of these for Christmas a few years back, and was looking for more for years!</li>
            <li>The new Turbie Twists weigh 4.9, 5.3 and 5.5 OZ.</li>
            <li>I needed new hair towels, so I decided to try these.  </li>
            <li>I used it for over 6 years before I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pefer all white, but pink is ok.</li>
            <li>I searched to replace my old Turbie Twist with the main thing in mind &amp;#34;it must be 100% cotton.</li>
            <li>and it looks like it&#x27;s in the same exact condition as the new ones I got her.</li>
            <li>Came back for more here on Amazon as after MANY years of use and washings they were looking sad.</li>
            <li>I ordered a 3 pack of Turbie Twists back when they first debuted on infomercials over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Keeps me cool instead of having my wet hair all over my neck and in my face.</li>
            <li>only conclusion is that maybe a couple other reviewers received a defected item, but so far I&#x27;ve had zero problems and am completely satisfied with the quality of these towels.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;head scoop\\&quot; is 1.5 inches deeper making them fit my head less snug.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, buy with complete confidence!</li>
            <li>cheap version of the real thing - if you thick hair, forget it.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that they dont soak up a lot of water, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>they were yellowed old terry cloth.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was even old and yellowed.  </li>
            <li>As a 13 year old girl, I care a lot about my hair.</li>
            <li>I picked this up on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Supper soft....</li>
            <li>Much nicer than wrapping a giant body towel around your head after the shower.</li>
            <li>they haven&#x27;t yet so far</li>
            <li>I use this for me and my 6 year old.  </li>
            <li>Really would like to have my towel&#x27;s to be different color&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a regular towel, but then a regular towel isn&#x27;t an option for her in the first place.  </li>
            <li>mainly anything but white because it gets so dingy.  </li>
            <li>There is NO other product I will ever use!</li>
            <li>They also fit oddly leaving a loose area on the back of your head making the towel not stay put very well.</li>
            <li>My new hand towels were too short to wrap around my head</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair up and out of the way until you are ready to dry it.  </li>
            <li>they wash well and dry fast.</li>
            <li>One single wrap cost as much as this 3 pack.</li>
            <li>I live in the south where it is hot and find the heavy microfiber is hot and weighs my head down.</li>
            <li>The loops making up the terrycloth were full of long pulls and irregularities in one area and pulling a loose thread unraveled all the loops from a long strip of the fabric</li>
            <li>I had used a similar product manufactured by a major cosmetics brand name before.</li>
            <li>The elastic bands are wide, and, while I haven&#x27;t had these very long, the stitching seems pretty</li>
            <li>For me, my hair is pretty dry and may even have to wet it a bit before drying(leaving wrapped about 10 min).</li>
            <li>We girls also know that the old towel on the head trick is really a pain because it can come loose while performing other tasks after the shower.</li>
            <li>Regular towels can be too heavy and big, so this is just right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Turbo Twist towels before and this particular product is very thin and  light weight.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that we have to kind of fold her hair into the pocket and stuff it in a little, otherwise her hair is too long for it.  </li>
            <li>I received a hot pink one, a deep purple one, and a baby pink one.</li>

            <li> Very handy.  </li>
            <li> It also was sent very quick and was perfect.</li>

            <li> But I loved the convenience of hair wraps, so I bought a 3 pack of these Turbie Twisties as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love my turbi twists!</li>
            <li> They work great and are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> They loved them and wore them most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Love Love Love Turbie Twists!!</li>
            <li> They do a great job absorbing, and will wrap up a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li> If you want more panache, the zebra Turbie Twists are cute!</li>
            <li> I said Amazon is great with their shipping &amp; I was right</li>
            <li> Very light weight but very absorbent and easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> I love these...</li>
            <li> I just love Turbie Twist towels and needed to add more to my collection because they get used all the time.</li>
            <li> These are so great, I used them at my sisters when I was visiting and loved them,came home and ordered them, plus ordered extra to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a GREAT Product</li>
            <li> Better than listed.</li>
            <li> So they were even better than listed.</li>
            <li> LOVE  </li>
            <li> The snowflakes one is ok, but I bought it around March-</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if they work or not, but she&#x27;s had them for over 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a great buy: soft, effective, cute, and convenient.</li>
            <li> I do so wish Turbie Twist would make note of the comments and make a better quality towel, but in the meantime, there is a solution.</li>
            <li> The material is more of a terry cloth than microfiber (I uploaded a photo showing the difference in material).</li>
            <li> It was about time to buy some more.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love the Turbie Towels, but some are knock-offs and are synthetic material.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really finds this product to be a great item to have.</li>
            <li> these are great, I used to wear a whole towel around my head.  </li>
            <li> and he likes it better than using a bath towel.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred the terry cloth to be more of a terry cloth than a velour feel.</li>
            <li> I love that we can wrap her hair up in this</li>
            <li> and of course she looked ridiculously cute in it.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> They love them and so do I.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> and I am still able to use this with ease on her hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using my turbie twist for 6 years almost to the day and it has seen better days...</li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer Terry Cloth, more like a towel.</li>
            <li> I would love love to have some more</li>
            <li> I will probably buy more.</li>
            <li> I have used the Turbie Twists for years and have given many as gifts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better values elsewhere for this type of item,but its okay.</li>
            <li> better material.  </li>
            <li> something to add to my Christmas bags, love these</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad they still make them.</li>
            <li> these things are one of my favorite...</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;Older&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the terry cloth is much more absorbant than the micro-fiber....</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these years ago(maybe 7 years ago), and love them.</li>
            <li> But for me, I love them.</li>
            <li> I am ordering more so if they ever wear out(which</li>
            <li> I figured after 7 or so years they probably don&#x27;t make them any more.</li>
            <li> She likes them much better than wrapping a towel around her head.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Love these, great for getting ready in the morning or a restful night at home.</li>
            <li> A hit for a tocking stuffer for sure.</li>
            <li> Love the fit!</li>
            <li> After trying the turbie twist, i realize the bath towel does a much better job</li>
            <li> i wonder if there is a better quality turbie twist out there?</li>
            <li> They are the best for putting my extremely long hair up in before I get out of the shower and drip all over the floor...</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see 100% cotton as I do NOT like microfiber!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, absorbent, and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> So light and comfortable!</li>
            <li> She loved it so much she gave one to some of her girl friends.</li>
            <li> They should of kept the original twist and if they wanted to make one w/ more of a terry fiber added to their product line and added a Turbie Twist 2.</li>
            <li> The package comes with 3, so it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> They are easy to put on.</li>
            <li> They came in the mail very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to put on and stays up until I need to take it off.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than using a full sized towel.  </li>
            <li> They work fine and wash up fine.</li>
            <li> I have med length hair, fine.</li>
            <li> I really need 2 more!</li>
            <li> such a great product.  </li>
            <li> My friends make fun of my Turbie Twist but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, it stays in place and it is absorbent.</li>
            <li> She will enjoy it for years to come</li>
            <li> Easy to clean in wash machine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit in the Turbie Twist without having to \\&quot;fold in\\&quot; the longest layers.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my two year-old one night and it seemed to fit her just as well.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great idea.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t all fit inside,</li>
            <li> plus, I love the fun colors I received.  </li>
            <li> The item itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> They stay in place and don&#x27;t fall easily like a full size towel does.</li>
            <li> I love the turbie twist it works great on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair less bulky then a towel.</li>
            <li> I love these so much!</li>
            <li> Do stick with the original</li>
            <li> They work great on my long hair.</li>
            <li> Stick with the original.</li>
            <li> Making them bulkier and heavier than the original.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the original Turbie Twist based on the product description and the reviews; however, these are made of microfiber not cotton like the original ones.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs a great amount of water, but I think since my hair is so long, it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It was no longer looking clean</li>
            <li> it is bright white, free of holes and luxurious as can be.  </li>
            <li> These are perfect for keeping wet hair out of your face while getting ready.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is true what a lot of reviews -- on this site and others --say about how thin the towels are, but there is a wonderful way of making it better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to launder and although I&#x27;ve purchased more, I&#x27;ve had one for several years that I can still use making it a good value as well as highly functional.</li>
            <li> I love them, however, I added one large button to each.  </li>
            <li> Either way really happy about the purchase and definitely will buy these again once they run out (which I don&#x27;t expect to be very soon!)</li>
            <li> but this works great at keeping your wet hair up</li>
            <li> It is true microfiber and being true microfiber over time grabbed bits and pieces of stuff over time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep them because regardless they are still lighter than a full sized towel.</li>
            <li> They are not as floppy as a full sized towel.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I now have four of them.</li>
            <li> I love the turbie twist,it is so much easier when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> They are also good to help keep my hair from the sun when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li> These are not bad.</li>
            <li> Since the packages were separate I was able to give a NEW 1 in the Original Package to a friend.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of quick drying hair &amp; holding hair in place so you can do other things.  </li>
            <li> Light on the head, easy to use, and better looking than a big bulky towel.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see the high quality as I had remembered.  </li>
            <li> If you have short hair, I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Good towels- not super cheap quality.</li>
            <li> These are great to use to dry your hair and way more efficient than a regular towel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for keeping your hair out of the way while you dry off and they work wonderfully to help dry your hair while you are busy tending to other things.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that the Turbie fit comfortably on such a little head,</li>
            <li> this is really a terry towel cut to a turban fit.  </li>
            <li> I love these soft, absorbant towel wraps.  </li>
            <li> But for the hassle and discomfort it saves both of us, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I rarely review products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple and effective way to deal with your hair after a bath or shower, or even after sampooing.</li>
            <li> However if you have owned the ORIGINAL Turbie Twist and you are looking for an exact replacement, please be aware that they HAVE changed it.</li>
            <li> the quality is very good and they last a long time...</li>
            <li> Good sized, and fits securely on your head but only downside to it is that its made of microfiber and doesn&#x27;t absorb the water like the regular cloth they used to be made of.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and was so glad to find them again, there are other brands but none work as good as the actual turbie twist brand.</li>
            <li> I bought a different kind years ago made of microfiber which is much thicker.</li>
            <li> These will be Christmas presents, thanks for shipping these to me so quickly.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li> The wraps arrived as promised and my daughters has used it daily and is pleased with how it drys her hair</li>
            <li> story short, I love these things.</li>
            <li> They are heavier, more bulky and slightly larger.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> But I still have to use a regular towel first to get most of the moisture out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters first used this at Grandmas house.</li>
            <li> If your only goal is to be able to tie your hair up after a shower, the Turbie Twist might do.</li>
            <li> the shipped product is better than the same brand I found in Walgreens.....</li>
            <li> but I am glad I ordered theses as I think they will last longer.</li>
            <li> So I look inside at the label and sure enough it read microfiber and spandex.</li>
            <li> It gets hot hot hot where I live and this keeps my cool after my shower.</li>
            <li> This is good for keeping your hair up and out of your face, but keep in mind, it does not DRY hair as well as a regular towel does...  </li>
            <li> I love it, because it is so much lighter on your head than a standard size towel.  </li>
            <li> Have used turbies for some time; got my daughter with long hair hooked on them.&lt;br /&gt;Lessens time for  her to use hair dryer - saving time and better for condition of hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters love these with their long hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected, I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> They are on the thinner side and are not thick towels (and the both of us have really thick hair) but the thickness doesn&#x27;t seem to matter, they still work great.</li>
            <li> They hold my hair easily and came in three different colors.</li>
            <li> I love these towels when I get out of the shower with my long wet her, it keeps my hair from getting all the water in my blouse, I just LOVE THESE TOWELS, practical and convenient</li>
            <li> They work really well on shorter hair though I agree it would be nice if they were made of a material that was slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about, but these are great!</li>
            <li> Be sure to purchase a cotton Turbie so that it works better getting the wet hair dry.</li>
            <li> and with these light weight turbies I can wrap my hair up and read a book, put on make-up, even sleep without a big bulky towel on my head.   </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it would be good for long hair because of the light weight and small size.  </li>
            <li> , the knock-off brands won&#x27;t stay on and are much thinner.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t know how she went without it and recommends it highly!</li>
            <li> It really helps keep the oil out of my face and neckline.  </li>
            <li> Her head/neck can&#x27;t comfortably support the weight of a regular towel on her head and she doesn&#x27;t like to blowdry it (nor do I).  </li>
            <li> My wife likes them very well.</li>
            <li> These really absorb water after a shower.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> This works for putting your hair up and out of your face when you are getting ready just after a shower.</li>
            <li> Mine were quite threadbare after much use.  </li>
            <li> It could be maybe they have very thick,long,heavy hair.</li>
            <li> The Turbie Twists are a tradition in our family; my two daughters and I really like them and they aren&#x27;t as bulky as a towel and easier to use.</li>
            <li> I travel very often</li>
            <li> Wish they were available in white tho</li>
            <li> I really would like to have color&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, the button fell off, and then even the elastic loop began to separate, rendering it a nice terry cloth rag.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a nice heavy weight and made well.  </li>
            <li> Received the turby twist yesterday and my daughter said it is good to have it&#x27;s absobability since her hair takes so long to dry.  </li>
            <li> weight of the original Turbie Twist is only 3.2 OZ.</li>
            <li> Wish they hard more colors, love it overall!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
            <li> the elastic loop to hold it in place is very stretched out, the once white towel is more of a light brown and there is a hole in it from where I hang it on the towel rack daily...</li>
            <li> Less snug fitting allows &#x27;flopping&#x27; which fatigues my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Turbie Twists.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the original for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a single Turbie Twist at Bed, Bath and Beyond when they 1st</li>
            <li> It is made of a soft velour-like material that is very absorbent.  </li>
            <li> they are so soft and hold my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I have to use a regular towel first to get as much of the moisture out, THEN, I put on the Turbie Twist.</li>
            <li> I would, and probably will, buy a few more.</li>
            <li> My hair is not quite shoulder length and the turbie barely captures all of the hair, not enough material to wrap securely.  </li>
            <li> These are nice and thick and the elastic works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Turbie Twist before and what I received was not the same fabric; it was visually different plus it felt much lighter than the original Turbie Twist.  </li>
            <li> Got one of these for Christmas a few years back, and was looking for more for years!</li>
            <li> The new Turbie Twists weigh 4.9, 5.3 and 5.5 OZ.</li>
            <li> I needed new hair towels, so I decided to try these.  </li>
            <li> I used it for over 6 years before I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pefer all white, but pink is ok.</li>
            <li> I searched to replace my old Turbie Twist with the main thing in mind &amp;#34;it must be 100% cotton.</li>
            <li> and it looks like it&#x27;s in the same exact condition as the new ones I got her.</li>
            <li> Came back for more here on Amazon as after MANY years of use and washings they were looking sad.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 3 pack of Turbie Twists back when they first debuted on infomercials over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Keeps me cool instead of having my wet hair all over my neck and in my face.</li>
            <li> only conclusion is that maybe a couple other reviewers received a defected item, but so far I&#x27;ve had zero problems and am completely satisfied with the quality of these towels.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;head scoop\\&quot; is 1.5 inches deeper making them fit my head less snug.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, buy with complete confidence!</li>
            <li> cheap version of the real thing - if you thick hair, forget it.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that they dont soak up a lot of water, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> they were yellowed old terry cloth.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was even old and yellowed.  </li>
            <li> As a 13 year old girl, I care a lot about my hair.</li>
            <li> I picked this up on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Supper soft....</li>
            <li> Much nicer than wrapping a giant body towel around your head after the shower.</li>
            <li> they haven&#x27;t yet so far</li>
            <li> I use this for me and my 6 year old.  </li>
            <li> Really would like to have my towel&#x27;s to be different color&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a regular towel, but then a regular towel isn&#x27;t an option for her in the first place.  </li>
            <li> mainly anything but white because it gets so dingy.  </li>
            <li> There is NO other product I will ever use!</li>
            <li> They also fit oddly leaving a loose area on the back of your head making the towel not stay put very well.</li>
            <li> My new hand towels were too short to wrap around my head</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair up and out of the way until you are ready to dry it.  </li>
            <li> they wash well and dry fast.</li>
            <li> One single wrap cost as much as this 3 pack.</li>
            <li> I live in the south where it is hot and find the heavy microfiber is hot and weighs my head down.</li>
            <li> The loops making up the terrycloth were full of long pulls and irregularities in one area and pulling a loose thread unraveled all the loops from a long strip of the fabric</li>
            <li> I had used a similar product manufactured by a major cosmetics brand name before.</li>
            <li> The elastic bands are wide, and, while I haven&#x27;t had these very long, the stitching seems pretty</li>
            <li> For me, my hair is pretty dry and may even have to wet it a bit before drying(leaving wrapped about 10 min).</li>
            <li> We girls also know that the old towel on the head trick is really a pain because it can come loose while performing other tasks after the shower.</li>
            <li> Regular towels can be too heavy and big, so this is just right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Turbo Twist towels before and this particular product is very thin and  light weight.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that we have to kind of fold her hair into the pocket and stuff it in a little, otherwise her hair is too long for it.  </li>
            <li> I received a hot pink one, a deep purple one, and a baby pink one.</li>
            <li> The frustration of having to tie your hair up with a conventional towel is completely gone with this simple product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, almost to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> Oh well, at least they&#x27;re made of real towel material!</li>
            <li> They hold all my hair, and because they&#x27;re so thick, after only a few minutes, they&#x27;ve soaked up all the excess water-- much more than the other brand ever did.</li>
            <li> I have long hair ( lower back )</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it will hold up for long in the washing machine given the extremely low quality of the fabric.</li>
            <li> In fact I like that they are light weight and still work the way a heavy thick towel would.</li>
            <li> SHE HAS LONG HAIR , AND A TWIST AROUND THE HAIR , AND SHE PUTS HER MAKEUP ON.</li>
            <li> for anyone who has long hair.</li>
            <li> These were generic and not what was expected.</li>
            <li> All I did was put, for example, the white inside the pink, and stitched them together -- nothing fancy -- and now it does the job it was supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> I recieved purple, white and pink</li>
            <li> Depending on how long I leave it on, I&#x27;ve noticed it decreases the time I need to use a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> - I got pink, blue and lavender.  </li>
            <li> i purchased these thinking i wouldn&#x27;t have to use my long bath towel anymore...</li>
            <li> so I have to pull the towel up on the back of my head and expose about half of my hair in the back.  </li>
            <li> It also had a very thin elastic loop and a button to secure the tail.</li>
            <li> Some other similar products use string-like loops and a button.</li>
            <li> Turbie Twist to ANYone with long hair after a shampooing!</li>
            <li> In other words, I was cheated - there were only 2 turbans in the package.</li>
            <li> I like to let my hair dry in a towel for 15 - 30 minutes before I blow dry it</li>
            <li> I have never used it to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am used to relying on towels alone to dry my hair</li>
            <li> Between my daughters and me, we have a lot of hair to dry.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t help dry your hair</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;almost dry your hair&amp;#34; like it states.</li>
            <li> so I can blow dry, even if I wait an hour.  </li>
            <li> Mine came in 3 colors- white, turquoise, and green with white snowflakes on it.</li>
            <li> These would have gotten a five star but one of the turbie twists was only a single thin layer of cloth that doesn&#x27;t absorb much.</li>
            <li> and she uses them every single day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying one for myself now and we can all use a bath towel and the Turbie and cut down on the space taken up by towels in our tiny bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair; this other brand wrap did not contain it all.</li>
            <li> They are less bulky than wrapping wet hair in a big towel.</li>
            <li> Personally I like that it isn&#x27;t heavy, wraps tightly against my head, and hardly notice it till I&#x27;m ready to dry it.</li>
            <li> Finally a towel that can stay on their little heads.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; of the towel is a little short and almost doesn&#x27;t reach the elastic hoop.  </li>
            <li> Keeps wet hair snug while applying makeup.</li>
            <li> and I see and feel absolutely no difference between these ones and the one that has held up for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I would have rather had another solid colored one than green with snowflakes.</li>
            <li> The terry on this towel is heavyweight as I expected.</li>
            <li> and she can go about the rest of her evening without having wet hair dripping on her, soaking her jammies, the couch, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have always wrapped my hair with a towel when getting out of the shower, and it is always heavy and ends up falling off multiple times.</li>
            <li> My hair is still wet, not damp, wet...</li>
            <li> The Turbie Twist is wonderfully thick and absorbent but it is too short to tuck into the back...</li>
            <li> Her hair isn&#x27;t as thick, but is longer and we tend to have the same drying issues with her hair that we do with her big sister.  </li>
            <li> The fabric is soft and thick.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with the false advertising.</li>
            <li> The other two are double layered and thick enough to absorb a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> It does not stay on either, with head movements while doing facial care, they seem to slide off slowly when used to wrap dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My oldest daughter is 8 with hair past her lower back</li>
            <li> My wife and other family members swear by these.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair soaking wet and dripping down my body.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut to about chin length and found that I had a hard time wrapping my hair in a towel.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that instead of each of them being a different color 2 came in white - I like variety.</li>
            <li> I hand wash it or put it in the delicate wash cycle and it bounces back!  </li>
            <li> It barely absorbs water from my thin wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and the towels do absorb without having to use a big, bulky towel.</li>
            <li> My hair is long (longest layer reaches my back), slightly wavy and very thick.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair that gets really wet after washing.</li>
            <li> so I broke down and bought this 3 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels a little thin but seems to dry her hair well enough.  </li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair</li>
            <li> did like that it was thin enough to wrap</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And one benefit of not being too heavy is it dries out quicker.  </li>
            <li> and I use them everyday</li>
            <li> So I just throw them in with my regular towels, and they don&#x27;t seem too worse for wear as a result.</li>
            <li> They are so much less bulky than a towel and yet absorb wetness from your hair like a towel!</li>
            <li> NOT for long or thick hair!</li>
            <li> Thin material  not happy  would not buy again  nothing like old ones</li>
            <li> I hate having to use a whole towel for wrapping my wet hair up.</li>
            <li> So simple: the secret is putting TWO together!</li>
            <li> No more bulky towel.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is just past my shoulders in length</li>
            <li> I usually buy these in CVS drugstore, but on here you get three.  </li>
            <li> These Turbie&#x27;s are thin and not very useful.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous upon reading other reviews saying that they changed the turbie twist and now it is so thin-</li>
            <li> The material is thin -- it won&#x27;t help absorb water from thick wet hair.</li>
            <li> sorry it took so long to invent;</li>
            <li> I also have moderately thick hair and these are so thin they leave the majoarity of it still dripping wet!</li>
            <li> so it got to where a towel twisted turban style would become painful due to the weight of my long wet hair and the added weight of the towel plus the instability of flopping to the sides</li>
            <li> This terry cloth version is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wash it at least 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ignored the instructions to wash in cold water because the ones I received were white.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I was tired of wrapping my hair in heavy towels.</li>
            <li> My six year-old has the longest hair and hers is also incredibly thick.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find one as thick and absorbant as it is.  </li>
            <li> I kept one for myself and gave the other three as a silly gift for friends.</li>
            <li> It is no good.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I did not receive what I had ordered, and initially thought I had purchased something looking like Turbie Twist by mistake.  </li>
            <li> I use mine everyday!!!</li>
            <li> The towel is paper thin.</li>
            <li> The quality must have decreased since.</li>
            <li> see through thin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it costs almost a quarter of the price in postage to return them</li>
            <li> i was wrong.  </li>
            <li> This item was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have bad neck issues</li>
            <li> but when you have bad neck problems it DOES make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I figured, I&#x27;ll take the chance and return if it was bad.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of towels unraveling when I had them on my head after the shower and this takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed to see they have changed them.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the quality of these towel turbans.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate using bulky towels and the Turbie Twist fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> (I hate to use blowdriers), but the Turbie Twist just doesn&#x27;t cut it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> And if it is ever in the dirty clothes and I need to wash my hair, I hate it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I got three useless Turbies!!</li>
            <li> I always hated when I would wrap a towel around my head and it would fall off.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> They were awful, they don&#x27;t even come close to comparing to the ones I have seen in the stores.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> awesome product and I plan to buy more!!! they came in a assorted colors of purple, teal and blue!!! very pretty and well made!!!</li>
            <li> I have a Turbie Twist from years ago.  It is made of a soft velour-like material that is very absorbent.  This terry cloth version is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> it says its a 3 pack but mine only had one in it.&lt;br /&gt;I did like that it was thin enough to wrap</li>
            <li> After seeing these over the years I finally thought why not try them. So, I bought a set of four of these one year off the shopping channel. I kept one for myself and gave the other three as a silly gift for friends. We all loved them! Light on the head, easy to use, and better looking than a big bulky towel. Came back for more here on Amazon as after MANY years of use and washings they were looking sad.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I was tired of wrapping my hair in heavy towels. I love these so much! I like to let my hair dry in a towel for 15 - 30 minutes before I blow dry it and with these light weight turbies I can wrap my hair up and read a book, put on make-up, even sleep without a big bulky towel on my head.   The only downfall is that they dont soak up a lot of water, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> I love these...I don&#x27;t have to worry about the big towel coming unfolded.  It&#x27;s so compact I can even put my shirt on while I have it on!  Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The Turbie Twist is a wonderful product!  I love it, because it is so much lighter on your head than a standard size towel.  They are durable and last forever!</li>
            <li> Very handy.  Keeps wet hair snug while applying makeup.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.... a lightweight, not-too-heavy towel to use after getting out of the shower on my short hair.  Regular towels can be too heavy and big, so this is just right.  I really don&#x27;t know if it would be good for long hair because of the light weight and small size.  If you have short hair, I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I just love Turbie Twist towels and needed to add more to my collection because they get used all the time. It&#x27;s perfect for keeping your hair out of the way while you dry off and they work wonderfully to help dry your hair while you are busy tending to other things. I highly recommend the Turbie Twists.</li>
            <li> These are great - I love them.  Do stick with the original, the knock-off brands won&#x27;t stay on and are much thinner.</li>
            <li> These are so great, I used them at my sisters when I was visiting and loved them,came home and ordered them, plus ordered extra to give as gifts. Thanks for a GREAT Product</li>
            <li> Better than listed. Item was listed as a THREE PACK. When I received them they were in  3 separate packs. So they were even better than listed. Since the packages were separate I was able to give a NEW 1 in the Original Package to a friend. They work great on my long hair. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> cheap version of the real thing - if you thick hair, forget it.</li>
            <li> LOVE  THIS . BOUGHT THE TWISTIE FOR MY TEEN GRANDDUAGTER FOR XMAS. SHE LOVES THEM !!! SHE HAS LONG HAIR , AND A TWIST AROUND THE HAIR , AND SHE PUTS HER MAKEUP ON. BOUGHT THEM IN THREE DIFFERANT COLORS. GO GET THEM LADIES , THERE GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> such a great product.  for anyone who has long hair. my daughter loves them and it saves a second towel being used for hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about, but these are great! I bought these for my girlfriend and she uses them every single day. The frustration of having to tie your hair up with a conventional towel is completely gone with this simple product. She has one turbie twist she bought from the mall almost two years ago and it looks like it&#x27;s in the same exact condition as the new ones I got her. I closely inspected the ones bought off of Amazon and I see and feel absolutely no difference between these ones and the one that has held up for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only conclusion is that maybe a couple other reviewers received a defected item, but so far I&#x27;ve had zero problems and am completely satisfied with the quality of these towels. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, buy with complete confidence!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I love these towels when I get out of the shower with my long wet her, it keeps my hair from getting all the water in my blouse, I just LOVE THESE TOWELS, practical and convenient</li>
            <li> I love these soft, absorbant towel wraps.  They are less bulky than wrapping wet hair in a big towel.</li>
            <li> Good towels- not super cheap quality. Mine came in 3 colors- white, turquoise, and green with white snowflakes on it. The snowflakes one is ok, but I bought it around March- so I would have rather had another solid colored one than green with snowflakes. Either way really happy about the purchase and definitely will buy these again once they run out (which I don&#x27;t expect to be very soon!)</li>
            <li> These were generic and not what was expected.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife as a gift.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if they work or not, but she&#x27;s had them for over 2 yrs. now and she loves them.</li>
            <li> These would have gotten a five star but one of the turbie twists was only a single thin layer of cloth that doesn&#x27;t absorb much. The other two are double layered and thick enough to absorb a lot of moisture. They work great!</li>
            <li> The towel is paper thin. I bought it because someone offered me to use one, but it was bought some years ago. The quality must have decreased since.</li>
            <li> My friends make fun of my Turbie Twist but that&#x27;s okay; it&#x27;s a great product. I got sick of towels unraveling when I had them on my head after the shower and this takes care of the problem. It&#x27;s comfortable, it stays in place and it is absorbent. I did try to buy a knock-off brand and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good. Stick with the original.</li>
            <li> The wraps arrived as promised and my daughters has used it daily and is pleased with how it drys her hair</li>
            <li> I had used a similar product manufactured by a major cosmetics brand name before. One single wrap cost as much as this 3 pack. I have long hair; this other brand wrap did not contain it all. It also had a very thin elastic loop and a button to secure the tail. After a few months, the button fell off, and then even the elastic loop began to separate, rendering it a nice terry cloth rag. But I loved the convenience of hair wraps, so I bought a 3 pack of these Turbie Twisties as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Turbie Twisties are great. They hold all my hair, and because they&#x27;re so thick, after only a few minutes, they&#x27;ve soaked up all the excess water-- much more than the other brand ever did. There&#x27;s no buttons to worry about coming off in the wash or over time from use; you just tuck the tail itself into the band. The elastic bands are wide, and, while I haven&#x27;t had these very long, the stitching seems pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I love these things. I always take one with me when I travel. They&#x27;re a great buy: soft, effective, cute, and convenient.</li>
            <li> Still use years later. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Received the turby twist yesterday and my daughter said it is good to have it&#x27;s absobability since her hair takes so long to dry.  She will enjoy it for years to come I&#x27;m sure!  She doesn&#x27;t know how she went without it and recommends it highly!</li>
            <li> Love the turbie twist! I&#x27;ve had them before and loved them so when I saw a 3 pack for the price of 1 in the store I jumped on it.  My only disappointment was that instead of each of them being a different color 2 came in white - I like variety.</li>
            <li> love these- great for suitcase.</li>
            <li> There is a way to make the Turbie Twist 5 stars (without this solution, it would get only 1.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true what a lot of reviews -- on this site and others --say about how thin the towels are, but there is a wonderful way of making it better. So simple: the secret is putting TWO together! The package comes with 3, so it&#x27;s easy. All I did was put, for example, the white inside the pink, and stitched them together -- nothing fancy -- and now it does the job it was supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution, it is only slightly more difficult to put the end, which now is double thickness, into the rubber hook, but if you twist the end of the towel well, it goes in fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me add here: I do so wish Turbie Twist would make note of the comments and make a better quality towel, but in the meantime, there is a solution.</li>
            <li> This item was a disappointment.  The colors I received were hideous.  The towels themselves were not absorbent at all.  These will be used as garage rags.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a single Turbie Twist at Bed, Bath and Beyond when they 1st came out. I have bad neck issues so it got to where a towel twisted turban style would become painful due to the weight of my long wet hair and the added weight of the towel plus the instability of flopping to the sides etc. would fatigue my neck. The original Turbie Twist was AWESOME for my issue. I&#x27;ve had the original for a very long time. It is true microfiber and being true microfiber over time grabbed bits and pieces of stuff over time. It was no longer looking clean so I broke down and bought this 3 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to see they have changed them. The material is more of a terry cloth than microfiber (I uploaded a photo showing the difference in material). Making them bulkier and heavier than the original. The \\&quot;head scoop\\&quot; is 1.5 inches deeper making them fit my head less snug. Less snug fitting allows &#x27;flopping&#x27; which fatigues my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the original Turbie Twist is only 3.2 OZ. The new Turbie Twists weigh 4.9, 5.3 and 5.5 OZ. That does not sound like much of a difference but when you have bad neck problems it DOES make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep them because regardless they are still lighter than a full sized towel. They are not as floppy as a full sized towel. However if you have owned the ORIGINAL Turbie Twist and you are looking for an exact replacement, please be aware that they HAVE changed it. They are heavier, more bulky and slightly larger. I wish companies would learn that,\\&quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;. They should of kept the original twist and if they wanted to make one w/ more of a terry fiber added to their product line and added a Turbie Twist 2.</li>
            <li> The Turbie Twist is wonderfully thick and absorbent but it is too short to tuck into the back...When I wrap my hair up in the towel and flip the tail to the back of my head to tuck it in the tail is too short to tuck so I have to pull the towel up on the back of my head and expose about half of my hair in the back.  I would not purchase this set again just because of the length problem.</li>
            <li> The Turbie Twist 3 pack I received was not micro fiber...they were yellowed old terry cloth.  we decided to use them as rags.  The packaging was even old and yellowed.  They were awful, they don&#x27;t even come close to comparing to the ones I have seen in the stores.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the original Turbie Twist based on the product description and the reviews; however, these are made of microfiber not cotton like the original ones.  Since I don&#x27;t care for these I have returned them.  Unfortunately it costs almost a quarter of the price in postage to return them</li>
            <li> You! These ones work. They are easy to put on. They will remove excess of water from your hair. Easy to clean in wash machine. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed. I have tried many others, and this is it!</li>
            <li> Have used these for years!  Still the best! It was about time to buy some more. I am very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I needed new hair towels, so I decided to try these.  They came in the mail very quickly.  They stay on my head with no problem.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I hate using bulky towels and the Turbie Twist fits the bill.  It&#x27;s light, absorbent, and very comfortable.  I love this product so much, I now have four of them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get along without them!  I would prefer a pack of all white ones though (you get one white, one blue &amp; one purple).</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love the Turbie Towels, but some are knock-offs and are synthetic material. Be sure to purchase a cotton Turbie so that it works better getting the wet hair dry.</li>
            <li> Love it. No dripping hair after washing anymore. My twist fit my lifestyle perfectly. No more bulky towel. Thank u.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I do my hair and while its up in the turbie twist, I put on my makeup then finish my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these!! They are so much less bulky than a towel and yet absorb wetness from your hair like a towel!</li>
            <li> I love the turbie twist it works great on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair less bulky then a towel. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use it when I give myself coconut oil treatments.  It really helps keep the oil out of my face and neckline.  I put it over my plastic conditioning cap.  It works.  I have never used it to dry my hair.  I have no complaints with it.  I hand wash it or put it in the delicate wash cycle and it bounces back!  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I love the turbie twist,it is so much easier when I wash my hair. sorry it took so long to invent;</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Got one of these for Christmas a few years back, and was looking for more for years!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really finds this product to be a great item to have. It was exactly what I expected, I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Have used turbies for some time; got my daughter with long hair hooked on them.&lt;br /&gt;Lessens time for  her to use hair dryer - saving time and better for condition of hair.</li>
            <li> This is good for keeping your hair up and out of your face, but keep in mind, it does not DRY hair as well as a regular towel does...  I am used to relying on towels alone to dry my hair (I hate to use blowdriers), but the Turbie Twist just doesn&#x27;t cut it for that purpose. I have to use a regular towel first to get as much of the moisture out, THEN, I put on the Turbie Twist. So basically, I might as well just twist up the towel and eliminate the Turbie Twist...    My hair is long (longest layer reaches my back), slightly wavy and very thick. It doesn&#x27;t fit in the Turbie Twist without having to \\&quot;fold in\\&quot; the longest layers. Last week I cut my hair (to shoulder-length) and now all of my hair fits properly. But I still have to use a regular towel first to get most of the moisture out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My sister got me one 5 years ago? I have been using it ever since. I wash it at least 2 times a week. And if it is ever in the dirty clothes and I need to wash my hair, I hate it! Have been meaning to buy another one for years and just haven&#x27;t done it. It is just great. It keeps your hair up and out of the way until you are ready to dry it.  I really need 2 more!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these things</li>
            <li> Love these!!!! I have long hair ( lower back ) so this is great to help soak up water while getting dressed/doing makeup or whatever.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter who was leaving for vacation on Saturday.  When I got the confirmation I told her not to worry even though it wasn&#x27;t sceduled to arrive till the following week.  I said Amazon is great with their shipping &amp; I was right-it arrived on Friday!  We were both very happy.  We already knew the quality of the product since I had bought them for her when she was a teen &amp; they lasted for years!</li>
            <li> these are great, I used to wear a whole towel around my head.  Now I&#x27;m hooked on this</li>
            <li> I love them, however, I added one large button to each.  Using the button, they stay on your head.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than using a full sized towel.  It&#x27;s light weight and the perfect size.  I bring one to the gym for when I shower, and when I travel.  I&#x27;d pefer all white, but pink is ok.</li>
            <li> After using this for a year, and packing it for travel everywhere, I now have them in every bathroom for guests and in my suitcase so I don&#x27;t forget them when traveling.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 3 pack of Turbie Twists back when they first debuted on infomercials over 10 years ago. I still use them every day when I shower, and they are still in great shape. If/when they ever need to be replaced I will not hesitate to buy them again!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wanted a turban sort of towel for after he washes his prodigious hair. After reading reviews I chose these, and he&#x27;s quite happy with them. If I&#x27;d had the choice I wouldn&#x27;t have picked brown, but it does the job and he likes it better than using a bath towel.</li>
            <li> The terry on this towel is heavyweight as I expected. However. I would have preferred the terry cloth to be more of a terry cloth than a velour feel.</li>
            <li> As a 13 year old girl, I care a lot about my hair. I always hated when I would wrap a towel around my head and it would fall off. The minute I tried on Turbie Twist, I loved it! It kept my hair in place and it was so absorbent!! Defiantly get this! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love these things!  Between my daughters and me, we have a lot of hair to dry.  My six year-old has the longest hair and hers is also incredibly thick.  Her head/neck can&#x27;t comfortably support the weight of a regular towel on her head and she doesn&#x27;t like to blowdry it (nor do I).  I picked this up on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  It feels a little thin but seems to dry her hair well enough.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a regular towel, but then a regular towel isn&#x27;t an option for her in the first place.  I love that we can wrap her hair up in this and she can go about the rest of her evening without having wet hair dripping on her, soaking her jammies, the couch, etc.  The Turbie has been perfect for her.  My only complaint is that we have to kind of fold her hair into the pocket and stuff it in a little, otherwise her hair is too long for it.  But for the hassle and discomfort it saves both of us, it&#x27;s worth it.  I tried it on my two year-old one night and it seemed to fit her just as well.  Her hair isn&#x27;t as thick, but is longer and we tend to have the same drying issues with her hair that we do with her big sister.  I was impressed that the Turbie fit comfortably on such a little head, and of course she looked ridiculously cute in it. :)  I&#x27;m buying one for myself now and we can all use a bath towel and the Turbie and cut down on the space taken up by towels in our tiny bathrooms.  Even the boys in the family are happy about that.</li>
            <li> My wife likes them very well. I don&#x27;t like microfiber, myself. Otherwise the products works as described.</li>
            <li> These really absorb water after a shower. Washes well.</li>
            <li> My daughters first used this at Grandmas house. They love them and so do I. I have always wrapped my hair with a towel when getting out of the shower, and it is always heavy and ends up falling off multiple times. I LOVE this product. It is easy to put on and stays up until I need to take it off. I have long hair, almost to the middle of my back and it keeps it up with ease. My oldest daughter is 8 with hair past her lower back and I am still able to use this with ease on her hair. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Beware that this order comes with 3 Turbie Twists but they are NOT white. I received a hot pink one, a deep purple one, and a baby pink one. I would have preferred them to be all white. Also, this style of towel turban has an elastic loop through which you are to pull the end of the turban. Some other similar products use string-like loops and a button. I thought that maybe the elastic wouldn&#x27;t hold as well, but it does. No problems.</li>
            <li> Good sized, and fits securely on your head but only downside to it is that its made of microfiber and doesn&#x27;t absorb the water like the regular cloth they used to be made of.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on kids hair. Finally a towel that can stay on their little heads. Warning this says 3 pack you only receive 2!</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  I have very long thick hair, these hold my hair up and soak up excess water.  Loved the color, quantity,  and quality.</li>
            <li> I love these things! They are the best for putting my extremely long hair up in before I get out of the shower and drip all over the floor...We girls also know that the old towel on the head trick is really a pain because it can come loose while performing other tasks after the shower. These stay on till YOU remove them! Try one! You will fall in love with them like I did!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; of the towel is a little short and almost doesn&#x27;t reach the elastic hoop.  The fabric is soft and thick.</li>
            <li> I have been using my turbie twist for 6 years almost to the day and it has seen better days...the elastic loop to hold it in place is very stretched out, the once white towel is more of a light brown and there is a hole in it from where I hang it on the towel rack daily...but I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  I was a bit nervous upon reading other reviews saying that they changed the turbie twist and now it is so thin- see through thin.  But I figured, I&#x27;ll take the chance and return if it was bad.  Well let me tell you, it looks just like the one I bought 6 years ago from the &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; store...but it is bright white, free of holes and luxurious as can be.  It does a great job of quick drying hair &amp; holding hair in place so you can do other things.  I just love it.  I wish the 3 pack I ordered had various colors...mainly anything but white because it gets so dingy.  But it works, so I won&#x27;t complain.  RIP Turbie twist #1-- hello Turbie twist #2...3 &amp; 4!!</li>
            <li> They work, i just personally don&#x27;t like the microfiber material.  I would prefer Terry Cloth, more like a towel.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this because it was a 3-pack. It only contains 1 item. Sounds like a great deal but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> NOT for long or thick hair! I have hair that is just past my shoulders in length and these are too short to cover the ends! I also have moderately thick hair and these are so thin they leave the majoarity of it still dripping wet! They also fit oddly leaving a loose area on the back of your head making the towel not stay put very well. I really don&#x27;t understand the rave reviews. I rarely review products but I want to save someone else the hassle.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set of these for myself loved them and ordered them for every gal in our family.  They are so nice after the shower and great while putting makeup on.</li>
            <li> Gave them to my granddaughters for one of their Easter presents.  They loved them and wore them most of the day.  I have one and my great granddaughter uses it all the time.  This is such a great idea.</li>
            <li> I received one Turbie Twist years ago as  a gift.  I can&#x27;t find one as thick and absorbant as it is.  I would love love to have some more but they&#x27;re just not the same as they used to be.</li>
            <li> These are great to use to dry your hair and way more efficient than a regular towel. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the quality of these towel turbans. The material is thin -- it won&#x27;t help absorb water from thick wet hair. It barely absorbs water from my thin wet hair. The loops making up the terrycloth were full of long pulls and irregularities in one area and pulling a loose thread unraveled all the loops from a long strip of the fabric (see photo). If your only goal is to be able to tie your hair up after a shower, the Turbie Twist might do. It won&#x27;t help dry your hair and I don&#x27;t think it will hold up for long in the washing machine given the extremely low quality of the fabric.</li>
            <li> Only came in one color, even though it says colors may vary.</li>
            <li> Got the for my daughter for after swim lessons and they work great. She loves them and now I use them too. They are on the thinner side and are not thick towels (and the both of us have really thick hair) but the thickness doesn&#x27;t seem to matter, they still work great. In fact I like that they are light weight and still work the way a heavy thick towel would. I will probably buy more.</li>
            <li> My new hand towels were too short to wrap around my head so I ordered these.  They work great and are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and it doesn&#x27;t all fit inside, but I make it work. This works for putting your hair up and out of your face when you are getting ready just after a shower. Keeps me cool instead of having my wet hair all over my neck and in my face. It gets hot hot hot where I live and this keeps my cool after my shower. It absorbs a great amount of water, but I think since my hair is so long, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;almost dry your hair&amp;#34; like it states.</li>
            <li> I have used the Turbie Twists for years and have given many as gifts.  Mine were quite threadbare after much use.  I was pleased to see the high quality as I had remembered.  They are a great weight and well made.</li>
            <li> I have big hair that always falls out of the towel but this works great at keeping your wet hair up</li>
            <li> i bought these on on 10/6/2014  all of them broke within a week.  The elastic that hooks on button broke.  Do not buy this.  It is no good.</li>
            <li> My wife and other family members swear by these. I&#x27;ve seen better values elsewhere for this type of item,but its okay.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known the colors that were in the bag, description didn&#x27;t tell that.  They work fine and wash up fine.</li>
            <li> I go to the indoor pool twice a week ...its  winter.....need I say more.&lt;br /&gt;works out perfect and the shipped product is better than the same brand I found in Walgreens.....better material.  I don&#x27;t understand that but I am glad I ordered theses as I think they will last longer.</li>
            <li> something to add to my Christmas bags, love these</li>
            <li> Supper soft.... I use mine everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these! These have been around forever and I&#x27;m so glad they still make them. Much nicer than wrapping a giant body towel around your head after the shower.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for keeping wet hair out of your face while getting ready. No bulky towel, they are just perfect!</li>
            <li> these things are one of my favorite...I have been using them for years....the quality is very good and they last a long time...</li>
            <li> I searched to replace my old Turbie Twist with the main thing in mind &amp;#34;it must be 100% cotton. The above product on the outside packaging read 100% cotton and so did the individual packaging also read 100% cotton. I was so excited to see 100% cotton as I do NOT like microfiber! I take the Turbie Twist out and instantly it started to feel sticky as the material snags on your fingers and does not absorb well. So I look inside at the label and sure enough it read microfiber and spandex. WTH?? Very dissatisfied with the false advertising.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;Older&amp;#34; Turbie Twist....the terry cloth is much more absorbant than the micro-fiber....plus, I love the fun colors I received.  I would recommend the terry cloth Turbie Twist to ANYone with long hair after a shampooing!</li>
            <li> I love these things! So light and comfortable! They stay in place and don&#x27;t fall easily like a full size towel does.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and was so glad to find them again, there are other brands but none work as good as the actual turbie twist brand.</li>
            <li> The item itself is fantastic. But when a package says *3 Pack* I expect to get 3 each and not 2 . In other words, I was cheated - there were only 2 turbans in the package.</li>
            <li> Buy the brand name - the colors were muted but perfectly acceptable. If you want more panache, the zebra Turbie Twists are cute!</li>
            <li> I bought these Turbie Twist to help me when I need help with my hair. They are also good to help keep my hair from the sun when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li> My mom ordered one of these for me years ago when they were sold on television. I used it for over 6 years before I needed a new one. I have very long, thick hair that gets really wet after washing. There is NO other product I will ever use! Beware of cheaper versions, they do not work. These are nice and thick and the elastic works like a charm. I recieved purple, white and pink</li>
            <li> These head wraps do not soak up moisture at all.  They leave my hair soaking wet and dripping down my body.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these, and we could only find the microfiber ones locally.  These are regular terry cloth towel material.  They do a great job absorbing, and will wrap up a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these years ago(maybe 7 years ago), and love them. I have med length hair, fine. I bought a different kind years ago made of microfiber which is much thicker. I live in the south where it is hot and find the heavy microfiber is hot and weighs my head down. I could walk around all day with the Turbie Twist. Personally I like that it isn&#x27;t heavy, wraps tightly against my head, and hardly notice it till I&#x27;m ready to dry it. And one benefit of not being too heavy is it dries out quicker.  For me, my hair is pretty dry and may even have to wet it a bit before drying(leaving wrapped about 10 min). I know some people said it&#x27;s too thin, cheap and doesn&#x27;t absorb well. It could be maybe they have very thick,long,heavy hair. But for me, I love them. I gave one to my sister and she loves it. I am ordering more so if they ever wear out(which they haven&#x27;t yet so far and I use them everyday, even the rubber band part still is good) I&#x27;ll always have backups for the future. I was very glad to see they still make these. I figured after 7 or so years they probably don&#x27;t make them any more. Give them a try, and if you don&#x27;t like them, share them with a friend, they just might. But for me, I never want to be w/o one, ever.</li>
            <li> So happy to find the absorbent cotton item and not the microfiber type sold in stores.  It also was sent very quick and was perfect.</li>
            <li> The Turbie Twists are a tradition in our family; my two daughters and I really like them and they aren&#x27;t as bulky as a towel and easier to use.</li>
            <li> What I received was not the Turbie Twist brand but some off-brand, in generic-type packaging.  I have purchased Turbie Twist before and what I received was not the same fabric; it was visually different plus it felt much lighter than the original Turbie Twist.  I was disappointed that I did not receive what I had ordered, and initially thought I had purchased something looking like Turbie Twist by mistake.  They were intended as stocking stuffer gifts and I will not be using them myself so I don&#x27;t know if they will perform the same or not.</li>
            <li> My daughters love these with their long hair.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Turbie Twists!! I use mine every day and will never use a towel on my hair again!! Very light weight but very absorbent and easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut to about chin length and found that I had a hard time wrapping my hair in a towel. It was just a bit too short to stay put. So, I saw these and gave them a try. They work really well on shorter hair though I agree it would be nice if they were made of a material that was slightly thicker. But then again, it might not twist and hold as well. I&#x27;ve ignored the instructions to wash in cold water because the ones I received were white. So I just throw them in with my regular towels, and they don&#x27;t seem too worse for wear as a result. I would, and probably will, buy a few more.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that makes you think, &amp;#34;Why didn&#x27;t I think of that?!!&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a simple and effective way to deal with your hair after a bath or shower, or even after sampooing. I like to leave it on while I&#x27;m moisturizing and getting dressed. Depending on how long I leave it on, I&#x27;ve noticed it decreases the time I need to use a blow dryer. It&#x27;s easy to launder and although I&#x27;ve purchased more, I&#x27;ve had one for several years that I can still use making it a good value as well as highly functional.</li>
            <li> I usually buy these in CVS drugstore, but on here you get three.  I travel very often so take these with me. If I lose one or forget one in a hotel- no big deal. Have extras.</li>
            <li> I bought these for our daughter. She likes them much better than wrapping a towel around her head. They are absorbent and seem to stand up well in the washer.</li>
            <li> I love my turbi twists! I have thick hair and the towels do absorb without having to use a big, bulky towel. I have used these products for ten years now.</li>
            <li> Love them. they are so soft and hold my hair very well.</li>
            <li> These Turbie&#x27;s are thin and not very useful.  My hair is not quite shoulder length and the turbie barely captures all of the hair, not enough material to wrap securely.  It does not stay on either, with head movements while doing facial care, they seem to slide off slowly when used to wrap dry hair.  I would not recommend these.  Very disappointed as I got three useless Turbies!!</li>
            <li> These are the terrycloth ones I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I abhor the microfiber ones.  They&#x27;re a nice heavy weight and made well.  I just wish I&#x27;d have had my choice of colors - I got pink, blue and lavender.  Oh well, at least they&#x27;re made of real towel material!</li>
            <li> this is really a terry towel cut to a turban fit.  Not that &amp;#34;Micro&amp;#34; stuff that still leaves your hair dripping after you take it off.  Wish they were available in white tho</li>
            <li> These are not bad. They were not wrapped in plastic when I received them so I washed them before I use them. They hold my hair easily and came in three different colors.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this product.  I&#x27;ve purchased Turbo Twist towels before and this particular product is very thin and  light weight. I have short hair and the towel does not absorb water.  My hair is still wet, not damp, wet...prior to using hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Very Very Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 14 years, and I&#x27;m not used to showering without it. People might think it&#x27;s dorky-looking, but I think it&#x27;s so convenient and well-designed! Wish they hard more colors, love it overall!</li>
            <li> Thin material  not happy  would not buy again  nothing like old ones</li>
            <li> Love these, great for getting ready in the morning or a restful night at home. These will be Christmas presents, thanks for shipping these to me so quickly. Merry Christmas</li>
            <li> I use this for me and my 6 year old.  Keeps my hair damp so I can blow dry, even if I wait an hour.  Easy to put on and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this Twistie. She loved it so much she gave one to some of her girl friends. A hit for a tocking stuffer for sure.</li>
            <li> I hate having to use a whole towel for wrapping my wet hair up. these are perfect. they absorb the wetness well. they wash well and dry fast.</li>
            <li> I really would like to have color&#x27;s.  Really would like to have my towel&#x27;s to be different color&#x27;s. Love the fit!</li>
            <li> i purchased these thinking i wouldn&#x27;t have to use my long bath towel anymore... i was wrong.  After trying the turbie twist, i realize the bath towel does a much better job so i&#x27;m back to that!  I like the concept though... i wonder if there is a better quality turbie twist out there?</li>
