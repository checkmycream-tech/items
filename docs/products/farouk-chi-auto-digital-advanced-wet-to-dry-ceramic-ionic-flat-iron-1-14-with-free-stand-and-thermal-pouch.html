            <li>But when I use it myself, I find that the results aren&#x27;t so great.  </li>
            <li>The price is great.</li>
            <li>does a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li>Chi makes great stuff for this.      </li>
            <li>Although it works great, there is another solution.</li>
            <li>Have always had good luck with chi products.</li>
            <li>It heats up really good but doesn&#x27;t keep the temperature that well.  </li>
            <li>Love the Chi product line!</li>
            <li>Who would have thought it would be better than Chi!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost a year now, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the shelf life of a CHI, but 30 bucks for 8 years sounds like a fabulous investment!!</li>
            <li>I would do definitely do more business with this shipper!</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing, as well as the results.  </li>
            <li>handy</li>
            <li>i liked the straightener a lot while it lasted.</li>
            <li>i liked the heat settings and that you could control the temperature.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot, it&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it were still working, but we&#x27;ll buy another because we liked how well it worked.</li>
            <li>- very cool!    </li>
            <li>and it worked great at first.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is very curly and it straightens it beautifully.</li>
            <li>He receives so many compliments about how healthy his hair looks.  </li>
            <li>It seems that this has happened to many others as well.  </li>
            <li>and it works much better.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the chi for many years</li>
            <li>What more could there be to say?</li>
            <li>I purchased this iron and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>Love the holder, keeps he heat off the granite counter tops.</li>
            <li>and I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Like many women out there, I could not bring myself to \\&quot;invest\\&quot; in a hair appliance.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a much better buy</li>
            <li>This is the top of the line product.  </li>
            <li>I also love the stand and pouch</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is safe.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can set the temperature.</li>
            <li>Love the stand.</li>
            <li>I have owned many hair straighteners for many years.</li>
            <li>I have yet to contact the company, but I am not too confident in their response after reading some of the posts this afternoon.</li>
            <li>I will update when I know more.     </li>
            <li>Other than that - great product, great buy.</li>
            <li>Well, I got the chi in the mail, was very excited to use it</li>
            <li>It works great - except it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide quite as smoothly through your hair at first because there are vent holes in the iron.  </li>
            <li>Damp almost dry hair works the best for many reasons.  </li>
            <li>At first, I loved it-</li>
            <li>Note however that the more water you steam with,  the more humidity resistance you will enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Great Flat Iorn - Worth the money - my hair is strait as can be !!!</li>
            <li>Remington \\&quot;Wet to Straight\\&quot; hair straightener that is the best!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried both and the original works BETTER.  </li>
            <li>My hair ends up with more frizz than when I straighten it with the original one (which my friend has).  </li>
            <li>Anyway, other than that, it is awesome!</li>
            <li>I use it every day and have found how easy it is to work with.   </li>
            <li>Its easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it was the best for my hair (thick, wavy and abundant)</li>
            <li>This straightener is awesome and it is half the price on amazon as it is in stores.  </li>
            <li>This one catches in my hair, it doeen&#x27;t pull through smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It gives the hair a nice straight silky shine.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is on amazon.</li>
            <li>Having the place to put the iron while working keeps it secure.</li>
            <li>Well, to make the story short when I saw this I was so happy</li>
            <li>The bonus stuff is fantastic too.</li>
            <li>Used someone else&#x27;s and found it worked much better than my Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>Again as long as you leave each section damp to the touch the iron will work great.   </li>
            <li>I try the original CHI but didn&#x27;t like it because you could not adjust the temperature and my hair and scalp would burn.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty pleased with it.    </li>
            <li>Best product ever, I have purchased several other CHI irons and non can compare to this wet/dry iron love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great job on my hair dry</li>
            <li>Super fast and arrived just in time for Christmas!!!  </li>
            <li>I treated it gently and always made sure it was clean before I turned it on.</li>
            <li>i bought this product for my daughter, who apparently knows more fashion than i.&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>For my hair, I need to dry it completely before using this for the very best result.</li>
            <li>The first time I experienced a flat iron was at the beauty shop.  </li>
            <li>I guess in a way I was lucky this happened to me quickly</li>
            <li>The automated timer and quick heating time are a plus.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how smooth and shiny my hair is (especially since your hair starts pretty damp!).  </li>
            <li>This is great because you do not have to blow dry your hair first.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m kind of glad my other chi broke</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be worth saving the money from buying here vs. at a beauty salon...    </li>
            <li>This iron was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>However, this morning August 2010, I turned it on, let it warm up and then, noticed that the digital display had stopped working and there were not numbers.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It does just as good a job as the regular Chi Flat Iron with the added feature of being able to have  your hair damp.  </li>
            <li>I brought this iron because my original chi didn&#x27;t work anymore and finally broke after being dropped so many times.</li>
            <li>This Chi flat iron comes with a nice travel case and holster.  </li>
            <li>Chi irons are superior to all other irons because of their temperature level and evenness.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who can find it at the right price.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works even better than the original Chi.</li>
            <li>The chi wet dry is awesome.  </li>
            <li>A definite upgrade that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with the original 1 inch chi especially if you can get it for the good price that I did</li>
            <li>My previous chi broke (which I loved)</li>
            <li>worked well but died quick - bought a much cheaper off the shelf store model and still have it .</li>
            <li>but it gets your hair very straight.  </li>
            <li>I was using a $40 drugstore model, which completely fried my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li>I decided to take it back and purchased the FHI which seems to work much, much better...</li>
            <li>This is not my first iron, and I also had Chi products before that I truly love such as my ceramic blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It stays hot and you can read the temp and know that halfway through it is still just as hot as the beginning of doing your hair.</li>
            <li>You can control how hot it gets.  </li>
            <li>I love the digital temperature setting, as well as the ability to set a timer to turn off the iron.  </li>
            <li>My only addition I would love for this product</li>
            <li>I have had that experience first hand.  </li>
            <li>Use a comb to catch the hot section.  </li>
            <li>While the weather still has the same effect most of the times on my hair after using this iron, the good thing is that if I am in a rush I can just part my hair in half and quickly iron two big sections and get my hair pretty straight quickly, which i find comes in</li>
            <li>I really love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is okay</li>
            <li>and then I used the flat iron with much better results, but the fact is thet</li>
            <li>I had gotten this flat iron two years ago and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This got my hair straight, shiny, &amp; silky &amp; my hair is very very wavy.</li>
            <li>She loves hers, but i&#x27;m not sure she has ever had a good flatiron.  </li>
            <li>My hair glides much easier through these plates and you can control the temperature.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s a much thinner and sleeker version and not as bulky as the chi.</li>
            <li>and I can finish straightening my hair much quicker.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure wet</li>
            <li>If I had not noticed I could have really damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up immediately, hair turns out straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use it with Chi Iron guard and Chi straight guard.  </li>
            <li>If you want to use it while your hair is still damp then it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because it really styled well.  </li>
            <li>Allows me to finish the end with a curve, and not just broomstick straight.</li>
            <li>I really like this flatiron.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The trick is that you really need to know how to use the Wet-Dry iron.  </li>
            <li>I have used on wet hair, but it takes forever, takes more skill</li>
            <li>Product: I am told by a top professional that silicone based thermal products are the only ones to use with a wet-dry iron.  </li>
            <li>but I was surprised to find that my favorite is the ConAir Nano Silver Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>I guessed that it was because there were so many other people using there own flat irons and blow driers that there wasn&#x27;t enough electricity for mine.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how fast and smooth this flat iron works!  </li>
            <li>I could get the same results using a significantly cheaper straightener.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy it at first but after going through many reviews of different flat irons I decided to go ahead and purchase this one.     </li>
            <li>Although it worked great on my hair, I will not purchase another one considering I spent over $100 for less than 6 months of use.</li>
            <li>I chose this one online because it was marked down significantly from the original price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the more basic CHI, or a different brand all together.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s fine, and it actually straightens better than my old plain one inch CHI, IMO.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>If top sections get dryer as you work, a little drop of water does the trick.       </li>
            <li>I purchased the product for my 16 year old son and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>what outlet I use or how many times I press the reset button it is completely dead.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair, and it works really fast and leaves me with a good shine, and a lasting style.</li>
            <li>I would have to separate my hair into many sections with the other iron and still it wouldn&#x27;t come out as straight or would puff up after stepping outside in the Miami heat and humidity almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I have confirmed this with a laser heat gauge comparing Chi&#x27;s to other brands.   </li>
            <li>I live in Fla and I have zero curl, fizz or puffiness when humidity is at max.  </li>
            <li>and it broke, so we had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>This is 2nd time I bought this for my wife, because my wife burned first when when she took it to England and pluged into 220 volt.</li>
            <li>I had my first one for 8 years, and finally had to replace it.</li>
            <li>I have had two of this exact same iron.</li>
            <li>Some professionals tell you NOT to use this product on true wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I have to turn it up to at least 300 degrees for it to even work, and i have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to do a lot less damage on my hair than the original</li>
            <li>If you must buy this product, please buy it at a professional beauty salon.</li>
            <li>Has a travel case as well as a stand which are very convienent for travel and daily use.</li>
            <li>It worked well for several years, but after 4 years of use I decided I needed something new!</li>
            <li>My hair was kind of stiff and dry, so the next time that I used I blowed dry my hair first</li>
            <li>This iron is slightly bigger than my original chi, and that&#x27;s just one of the other major improvements.</li>
            <li>As long as your hair is damp to the touch this method will produce pin straight hair once you iron.   </li>
            <li>But, I thought as long as it keeps heating up, I don&#x27;t really care.    </li>
            <li>She can use it when her hair is wet, so it saves a step blow drying first.</li>
            <li>Well, about 3 mins later, I realized that it was starting to cool down and the piece of junk had actaully stopped working completely!</li>
            <li>We read other reviews and wanted to purchase a quality straightener, and were willing to spend the money.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend blowdrying or toweldrying your hair for maybe 5-10 minutes before you use this just because it takes awhile to dry when your hair is super wet</li>
            <li>The temp is nearly identical to the digital display on the front.  </li>
            <li>The regular old thermal protectors leave my hair feeling crunchy.  </li>
            <li>seems kind of silly, eh?     </li>
            <li>By $75 you can buy wet to dry ceramic that worth $200.</li>
            <li>Not sure how the other reviewer was able to get a replacement...</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed, it has a super long cord, a timer and the plates are not too thin nor thick just the right size.</li>
            <li>This one we bought is the first time we got to use the Wet to Dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a Remington Wet to Straight flat iron that works just as well</li>
            <li>Before I bought this product, I read all the reviews, good and bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> What more could there be to say?</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> Love the holder, keeps he heat off the granite counter tops.</li>
            <li> and I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Like many women out there, I could not bring myself to \\&quot;invest\\&quot; in a hair appliance.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a much better buy</li>
            <li> This is the top of the line product.  </li>
            <li> I also love the stand and pouch</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is safe.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can set the temperature.</li>
            <li> Love the stand.</li>
            <li> I have owned many hair straighteners for many years.</li>
            <li> I have yet to contact the company, but I am not too confident in their response after reading some of the posts this afternoon.</li>
            <li> I will update when I know more.     </li>
            <li> Other than that - great product, great buy.</li>
            <li> Well, I got the chi in the mail, was very excited to use it</li>
            <li> It works great - except it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide quite as smoothly through your hair at first because there are vent holes in the iron.  </li>
            <li> Damp almost dry hair works the best for many reasons.  </li>
            <li> At first, I loved it-</li>
            <li> Note however that the more water you steam with,  the more humidity resistance you will enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Great Flat Iorn - Worth the money - my hair is strait as can be !!!</li>
            <li> Remington \\&quot;Wet to Straight\\&quot; hair straightener that is the best!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried both and the original works BETTER.  </li>
            <li> My hair ends up with more frizz than when I straighten it with the original one (which my friend has).  </li>
            <li> Anyway, other than that, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have found how easy it is to work with.   </li>
            <li> Its easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it was the best for my hair (thick, wavy and abundant)</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome and it is half the price on amazon as it is in stores.  </li>
            <li> This one catches in my hair, it doeen&#x27;t pull through smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It gives the hair a nice straight silky shine.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is on amazon.</li>
            <li> Having the place to put the iron while working keeps it secure.</li>
            <li> Well, to make the story short when I saw this I was so happy</li>
            <li> The bonus stuff is fantastic too.</li>
            <li> Used someone else&#x27;s and found it worked much better than my Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> Again as long as you leave each section damp to the touch the iron will work great.   </li>
            <li> I try the original CHI but didn&#x27;t like it because you could not adjust the temperature and my hair and scalp would burn.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty pleased with it.    </li>
            <li> Best product ever, I have purchased several other CHI irons and non can compare to this wet/dry iron love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job on my hair dry</li>
            <li> Super fast and arrived just in time for Christmas!!!  </li>
            <li> I treated it gently and always made sure it was clean before I turned it on.</li>
            <li> i bought this product for my daughter, who apparently knows more fashion than i.&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> For my hair, I need to dry it completely before using this for the very best result.</li>
            <li> The first time I experienced a flat iron was at the beauty shop.  </li>
            <li> I guess in a way I was lucky this happened to me quickly</li>
            <li> The automated timer and quick heating time are a plus.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how smooth and shiny my hair is (especially since your hair starts pretty damp!).  </li>
            <li> This is great because you do not have to blow dry your hair first.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m kind of glad my other chi broke</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be worth saving the money from buying here vs. at a beauty salon...    </li>
            <li> This iron was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> However, this morning August 2010, I turned it on, let it warm up and then, noticed that the digital display had stopped working and there were not numbers.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It does just as good a job as the regular Chi Flat Iron with the added feature of being able to have  your hair damp.  </li>
            <li> I brought this iron because my original chi didn&#x27;t work anymore and finally broke after being dropped so many times.</li>
            <li> This Chi flat iron comes with a nice travel case and holster.  </li>
            <li> Chi irons are superior to all other irons because of their temperature level and evenness.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who can find it at the right price.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works even better than the original Chi.</li>
            <li> The chi wet dry is awesome.  </li>
            <li> A definite upgrade that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with the original 1 inch chi especially if you can get it for the good price that I did</li>
            <li> My previous chi broke (which I loved)</li>
            <li> worked well but died quick - bought a much cheaper off the shelf store model and still have it .</li>
            <li> but it gets your hair very straight.  </li>
            <li> I was using a $40 drugstore model, which completely fried my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> I decided to take it back and purchased the FHI which seems to work much, much better...</li>
            <li> This is not my first iron, and I also had Chi products before that I truly love such as my ceramic blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It stays hot and you can read the temp and know that halfway through it is still just as hot as the beginning of doing your hair.</li>
            <li> You can control how hot it gets.  </li>
            <li> I love the digital temperature setting, as well as the ability to set a timer to turn off the iron.  </li>
            <li> My only addition I would love for this product</li>
            <li> I have had that experience first hand.  </li>
            <li> Use a comb to catch the hot section.  </li>
            <li> While the weather still has the same effect most of the times on my hair after using this iron, the good thing is that if I am in a rush I can just part my hair in half and quickly iron two big sections and get my hair pretty straight quickly, which i find comes in</li>
            <li> I really love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is okay</li>
            <li> and then I used the flat iron with much better results, but the fact is thet</li>
            <li> I had gotten this flat iron two years ago and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This got my hair straight, shiny, &amp; silky &amp; my hair is very very wavy.</li>
            <li> She loves hers, but i&#x27;m not sure she has ever had a good flatiron.  </li>
            <li> My hair glides much easier through these plates and you can control the temperature.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a much thinner and sleeker version and not as bulky as the chi.</li>
            <li> and I can finish straightening my hair much quicker.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure wet</li>
            <li> If I had not noticed I could have really damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up immediately, hair turns out straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it with Chi Iron guard and Chi straight guard.  </li>
            <li> If you want to use it while your hair is still damp then it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because it really styled well.  </li>
            <li> Allows me to finish the end with a curve, and not just broomstick straight.</li>
            <li> I really like this flatiron.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The trick is that you really need to know how to use the Wet-Dry iron.  </li>
            <li> I have used on wet hair, but it takes forever, takes more skill</li>
            <li> Product: I am told by a top professional that silicone based thermal products are the only ones to use with a wet-dry iron.  </li>
            <li> but I was surprised to find that my favorite is the ConAir Nano Silver Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> I guessed that it was because there were so many other people using there own flat irons and blow driers that there wasn&#x27;t enough electricity for mine.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how fast and smooth this flat iron works!  </li>
            <li> I could get the same results using a significantly cheaper straightener.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy it at first but after going through many reviews of different flat irons I decided to go ahead and purchase this one.     </li>
            <li> Although it worked great on my hair, I will not purchase another one considering I spent over $100 for less than 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> I chose this one online because it was marked down significantly from the original price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the more basic CHI, or a different brand all together.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s fine, and it actually straightens better than my old plain one inch CHI, IMO.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> If top sections get dryer as you work, a little drop of water does the trick.       </li>
            <li> I purchased the product for my 16 year old son and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> what outlet I use or how many times I press the reset button it is completely dead.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and it works really fast and leaves me with a good shine, and a lasting style.</li>
            <li> I would have to separate my hair into many sections with the other iron and still it wouldn&#x27;t come out as straight or would puff up after stepping outside in the Miami heat and humidity almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have confirmed this with a laser heat gauge comparing Chi&#x27;s to other brands.   </li>
            <li> I live in Fla and I have zero curl, fizz or puffiness when humidity is at max.  </li>
            <li> and it broke, so we had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This is 2nd time I bought this for my wife, because my wife burned first when when she took it to England and pluged into 220 volt.</li>
            <li> I had my first one for 8 years, and finally had to replace it.</li>
            <li> I have had two of this exact same iron.</li>
            <li> Some professionals tell you NOT to use this product on true wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to turn it up to at least 300 degrees for it to even work, and i have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to do a lot less damage on my hair than the original</li>
            <li> If you must buy this product, please buy it at a professional beauty salon.</li>
            <li> Has a travel case as well as a stand which are very convienent for travel and daily use.</li>
            <li> It worked well for several years, but after 4 years of use I decided I needed something new!</li>
            <li> My hair was kind of stiff and dry, so the next time that I used I blowed dry my hair first</li>
            <li> This iron is slightly bigger than my original chi, and that&#x27;s just one of the other major improvements.</li>
            <li> As long as your hair is damp to the touch this method will produce pin straight hair once you iron.   </li>
            <li> But, I thought as long as it keeps heating up, I don&#x27;t really care.    </li>
            <li> She can use it when her hair is wet, so it saves a step blow drying first.</li>
            <li> Well, about 3 mins later, I realized that it was starting to cool down and the piece of junk had actaully stopped working completely!</li>
            <li> We read other reviews and wanted to purchase a quality straightener, and were willing to spend the money.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend blowdrying or toweldrying your hair for maybe 5-10 minutes before you use this just because it takes awhile to dry when your hair is super wet</li>
            <li> The temp is nearly identical to the digital display on the front.  </li>
            <li> The regular old thermal protectors leave my hair feeling crunchy.  </li>
            <li> seems kind of silly, eh?     </li>
            <li> By $75 you can buy wet to dry ceramic that worth $200.</li>
            <li> Not sure how the other reviewer was able to get a replacement...</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed, it has a super long cord, a timer and the plates are not too thin nor thick just the right size.</li>
            <li> This one we bought is the first time we got to use the Wet to Dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a Remington Wet to Straight flat iron that works just as well</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I read all the reviews, good and bad.  </li>
            <li> It heats uneven, and will cool down for no reason.</li>
            <li> it heated up quickly and it thoroughly straightened my very long, thick hair in minutes.</li>
            <li> My flat iron only lasted 6 months from this store.</li>
            <li> My next flat iron will not be a CHI.</li>
            <li> I had used this flat iron about three days a week for two years</li>
            <li> I used this flat iron</li>
            <li> The key is NEVER to leave the heat on too long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron through Amazon.com about three months ago.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference this flat iron made in my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter.</li>
            <li> So I suggest that if you want a long lasting flat iron,you should invest in something else.</li>
            <li> The temp on your hair shaft is the same as a dry iron.  </li>
            <li> (this is the same with a dry iron BTW)</li>
            <li> When used on dry hair, it only takes 2-3 passes to straighten.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and you can turn down the heat if your hair is not really that wet.  </li>
            <li> Our flat iron broke after minimal use in only 4 months.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long, wavy and frizzy, and this flat iron can straighten my hair in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this item expecting it to work similar to my regular chi iron, but was a little disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I have only owned one other \\&quot;professional\\&quot; flat iron before.</li>
            <li> My wife have long hair and I purchased it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> as she used it on wet hair, then she had to let it heat back up.</li>
            <li> Normally that would be a small problem, but the seller \\&quot;Payless Beauty\\&quot; did not disclose that the manufacturer does NOT warranty items sold over the internet.  </li>
            <li> After 2 months of minimal use, it started turning off in the middle of my styling for no reason.  </li>
            <li> It is faster, and the outcome is virtually the same as on wet hair.   </li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and she loves that she can dry it a little bit and then use the iron to straighten it completely.</li>
            <li> This my second wet to dry iron</li>
            <li> Wet to Dry Key Points:    </li>
            <li> I have had it for less than 6 months, and apparently the warranty is not valid if the product is purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I used on my damp hair, and the result weren&#x27;t as I expected from this flat iron.</li>
            <li> As she is familiar with how well the first one worked, she was very disappointed to find out that this one does not get hot enough to straighten her long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hair when it was about 90 percent dry.</li>
            <li> She says its just easier to blow dry.</li>
            <li> Whenever I would use it often my hair would get dry after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> YES-use product before you blow dry and again before you iron.   </li>
            <li> I like a cream before I dry and the oil before I iron.   </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t blow nearly dry.  </li>
            <li> because even when I blow dry my hair, it stays damp so</li>
            <li> Try a different iron or at least buy it directly from Farouk</li>
            <li> TO DRY CHI flat iron, what I got was a non-wet to dry in a wet to dry box!</li>
            <li> The only little complaint I have is that the auto-shut off isn&#x27;t really \\&quot;auto\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s broken underneath the tape and clearly not made very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Chi Wet to Dry iron from Discount Jungle online.  </li>
            <li> I would never go back to a plain Chi dry iron.     </li>
            <li> and it seems to dry and straighten it extremely well.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch was jammed and the iron no longer turned on.</li>
            <li> Although supposedly you can use it on wet hair, I never have nor would I want to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the extra $$ on this \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; CHI.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even attempt to straighten it wet or even damp.  </li>
            <li> I do not use it on my hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I was told I was buying a WET</li>
            <li> Total scam and waste of money as this is not what I needed.</li>
            <li> A few of them noted that the warranty on this product is void when bought off the internet, but I didnt listen because my last chi lasted over a year</li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted to use it on wet hair, so if that is what you want I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my mother at the same time as I bought mine, and it, too, stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> I do not use it on wet hair as I could see that doing some damage to the hair.  </li>
            <li> And I spent triple the money on this one and it lasted for a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li> I used to end up knocking the flat irons down when I just put them down on the counter.</li>
            <li> barely 8 mos!!It&#x27;s too expensive to only last 8 mos.</li>
            <li> Iron in small sections about a 3rd the width of your iron&#x27;s length.  </li>
            <li> you can straighten your hair with a round brush and blow dry in sections.  </li>
            <li> and I tried it both ways, dry hair and damp/towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> Divide your head in half down center and then pin all up except what you are working with.  </li>
            <li> some other places too!</li>
            <li> However I have used it on slightly damp hair that I had washed in the morning and ironed in the evening for example</li>
            <li> It is half the price</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t have it, but a month and half, when one of the plates stopped working all together.  </li>
            <li> This heats up in less than a minute, and saves lots of time.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t too angry about having to purchase a new iron since I figured it was time for a change.</li>
            <li> I really like my CHI but was extremely disappointed when all of a sudden it just stopped working one day.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had an expensive electrical item fail like this, and I can only conclude that there&#x27;s a serious flaw in the construction of these flat irons.</li>
            <li> A lot of wasted money.</li>
            <li> I just got off the phone with Amazon customer service who informed me that they can do nothing for the fact that I have had this item a few months and it has stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money  </li>
            <li> Read the pamphlet it came with, tried to trouble shoot that darn thing, and bottom line.......</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just about a week ago I was at a youth weekend trip and after I got out of the shower and dried my hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this flatiron.  </li>
            <li> My hair sytlist had trouble with hers as well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this time a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Just a small drop worked into your hair.  </li>
            <li> Small batches:</li>
            <li> I used it about two times per week for the past three months without any problems.</li>
            <li> The difference is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> They both broken after about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> The nicer silkier products are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Company has a return for exchange/credit, but not because its not effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter, who has thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This product pulls at my hair no matter how slow i go.  </li>
            <li> and I was very unhappy with this particular model.</li>
            <li> It is for serious thick hair-straightening.    </li>
            <li> This is completelty ridiculous and unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Now, I have two expensive flat irons that are broken!</li>
            <li> Just be warned, it is not a good product.</li>
            <li> so I could still return the product, but I can imagine the same thing happening after 2-3 months and that would be SO disappointing!    </li>
            <li> it would be worse.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bad product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with both Amazon and CHI/Farouk.</li>
            <li> I checked Farouk&#x27;s website for the warranty information and was very shocked to read that the warranty is void if you purchase the product over the internet.</li>
            <li> She is very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Despite that horrible experience, when using the product I noticed that the finger grips/button positioning/steam holes were designed for a stylist who works on someone elses hair.  </li>

            <li> I brought this iron because my original chi didn&#x27;t work anymore and finally broke after being dropped so many times. The on/off switch was jammed and the iron no longer turned on. I had it for about 2 years so I wasn&#x27;t too angry about having to purchase a new iron since I figured it was time for a change. I chose this one online because it was marked down significantly from the original price. This iron is slightly bigger than my original chi, and that&#x27;s just one of the other major improvements. Overall it&#x27;s a big upgrade and I consider it a great purchase and I&#x27;m kind of glad my other chi broke so I had the chance to get this one. My hair glides much easier through these plates and you can control the temperature. Also it&#x27;s a much thinner and sleeker version and not as bulky as the chi. It also seems to do a lot less damage on my hair than the original and I can finish straightening my hair much quicker. I would have to separate my hair into many sections with the other iron and still it wouldn&#x27;t come out as straight or would puff up after stepping outside in the Miami heat and humidity almost immediately. While the weather still has the same effect most of the times on my hair after using this iron, the good thing is that if I am in a rush I can just part my hair in half and quickly iron two big sections and get my hair pretty straight quickly, which i find comes in handy if I&#x27;m in a rush. Although supposedly you can use it on wet hair, I never have nor would I want to. However I have used it on slightly damp hair that I had washed in the morning and ironed in the evening for example and it seems to dry and straighten it extremely well. A definite upgrade that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with the original 1 inch chi especially if you can get it for the good price that I did then it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the extra $$ on this \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; CHI.  I have tried both and the original works BETTER.  This one catches in my hair, it doeen&#x27;t pull through smoothly.  My hair ends up with more frizz than when I straighten it with the original one (which my friend has).  I didn&#x27;t even attempt to straighten it wet or even damp.  It doesn&#x27;t do a great job on my hair dry so I&#x27;m sure wet it would be worse.</li>
            <li> By $75 you can buy wet to dry ceramic that worth $200. only from AMAZON.</li>
            <li> The first time I experienced a flat iron was at the beauty shop.  It was the Chi.  This one we bought is the first time we got to use the Wet to Dry.  It does just as good a job as the regular Chi Flat Iron with the added feature of being able to have  your hair damp.  This is great because you do not have to blow dry your hair first.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent price.  This flat iron works even better than the original Chi.</li>
            <li> Great Flat Iorn - Worth the money - my hair is strait as can be !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this and 30 days later it stopped working.  Chi will not warrenty it.  A lot of wasted money.</li>
            <li> I really love this flat iron.  It&#x27;s amazing how smooth and shiny my hair is (especially since your hair starts pretty damp!).  It heats up really fast and you can turn down the heat if your hair is not really that wet.  Buy one!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product! Love the Chi product line! Have always had good luck with chi products. I also have the blow dryer which works awesome as well!</li>
            <li> I purchased the product for my 16 year old son and it works very well.  It gives the hair a nice straight silky shine.  He receives so many compliments about how healthy his hair looks.  I was hesitant to make the purchase but the product has proved itself.  It was an awesome bonus to receive all three items for $72.84</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I found it for a great price on Amazon.  My cousin is a hair stylist and when he straightens my hair with this straightener I get great results.  But when I use it myself, I find that the results aren&#x27;t so great.  I could get the same results using a significantly cheaper straightener.  I would recommend this product to anyone who can find it at the right price.</li>
            <li> I have only owned one other \\&quot;professional\\&quot; flat iron before. That was the Solia. It worked well for several years, but after 4 years of use I decided I needed something new! I had heard a lot about the chi, and my stylist uses it on my hair. I was hesitant to buy it at first but after going through many reviews of different flat irons I decided to go ahead and purchase this one.     I do not use it on my hair when it is wet. I have used it on my hair when it was about 90 percent dry. My hair is very long, wavy and frizzy, and this flat iron can straighten my hair in about 10 minutes. It can also be used for curls, however this took some practice for me. I have had it for 6 months now and have had no problems with it.     Overall, I think this is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> Really,I got a problem with farouk CHI.I had try to comunicate with the sellers and I got no answers</li>
            <li> I really like my CHI but was extremely disappointed when all of a sudden it just stopped working one day.  I have had it for less than 6 months, and apparently the warranty is not valid if the product is purchased from Amazon.  It seems that this has happened to many others as well.  Although it worked great on my hair, I will not purchase another one considering I spent over $100 for less than 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> I just got off the phone with Amazon customer service who informed me that they can do nothing for the fact that I have had this item a few months and it has stopped working.  I have used the iron maybe a total of 20 times and no matter what outlet I use or how many times I press the reset button it is completely dead.  Amazon has a 30 day return policy and will not budge.  Not sure how the other reviewer was able to get a replacement...I even mentioned that on the call and he still said \\&quot;oh, sorry\\&quot;.  Amazon is also an unauthorized seller of this product so you have no recourse with Chi if it does break or malfunction.  If you are going to buy it, get it from a salon.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is okay but I was surprised to find that my favorite is the ConAir Nano Silver Flat Iron.  It is half the price and it works much better.  I got it from Walmart!  Who would have thought it would be better than Chi!  I use it with the chi silk infusion or BioSilk Silk Therapy.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money  I bought this straightener for my daughter, who has thick hair.  We read other reviews and wanted to purchase a quality straightener, and were willing to spend the money.  We didn&#x27;t have it, but a month and half, when one of the plates stopped working all together.  It heats uneven, and will cool down for no reason. Hair catches on the plates and pulls your hair out EVERY time!    Read the pamphlet it came with, tried to trouble shoot that darn thing, and bottom line.......it&#x27;s a piece of junk.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is 2nd time I bought this for my wife, because my wife burned first when when she took it to England and pluged into 220 volt. Go figure. This is the best iron she has ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using the chi for many years and I was very unhappy with this particular model. My previous chi broke (which I loved) so I decided to get this newer model. Not only did it take several times to straighten my hair, it snagged the ends of my hair and the cord would continuously coil. It would take me double the time to do my hair between going over my hair several times and unraveling the cord. I decided to take it back and purchased the FHI which seems to work much, much better...</li>
            <li> Has survived hair straightening duties for three African American women for over a year and still performs well.  What more could there be to say?</li>
            <li> I was told I was buying a WET TO DRY CHI flat iron, what I got was a non-wet to dry in a wet to dry box! If I had not noticed I could have really damaged my hair. Total scam and waste of money as this is not what I needed. Big time scam artist.</li>
            <li> i liked the straightener a lot while it lasted. i liked the heat settings and that you could control the temperature. it straightened my hair well. however, i dropped it and the two pieces split apart and the spring got loosened. i actually duct taped the bottom of it so that the spring was tightened and the straightener was held together. it still works but it&#x27;s broken underneath the tape and clearly not made very well. i ended up getting a different chi straightener</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I read all the reviews, good and bad.  A few of them noted that the warranty on this product is void when bought off the internet, but I didnt listen because my last chi lasted over a year so I wouldn&#x27;t need the warranty anyways! I thought it&#x27;d be worth saving the money from buying here vs. at a beauty salon...    Well, I got the chi in the mail, was very excited to use it and it worked great at first.  Then, the second time using it, one of the plates wouldn&#x27;t heat up!  I unplugged it, waited a couple days, but it didn&#x27;t ever work again.  I guess in a way I was lucky this happened to me quickly so I could still return the product, but I can imagine the same thing happening after 2-3 months and that would be SO disappointing!    Despite that horrible experience, when using the product I noticed that the finger grips/button positioning/steam holes were designed for a stylist who works on someone elses hair.  It was awkward to hold the correct way while working on my own hair (accidently press buttons or trap steam under my hair)  I&#x27;d recommend the more basic CHI, or a different brand all together.</li>
            <li> My wife have long hair and I purchased it for Christmas. 1st time she used it we put it back in the box and its been there since. Problem: It \\&quot;cools\\&quot; as she used it on wet hair, then she had to let it heat back up. She says its just easier to blow dry. Im out $129 because I bought it at a Kiosk in the mall and went back, they were gone of course. Company has a return for exchange/credit, but not because its not effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron and I love it. The price is great. At the beauty supply they had a basic Chi for 109.00. I purchased this one as I just needed it for myself, I am no longer working in a salon. I love this iron. Heats up immediately, hair turns out straight and shiny. Love the holder, keeps he heat off the granite counter tops. I would reccomend this to friend. Actually I did and she loves hers too!</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome and it is half the price on amazon as it is in stores.  I had the regular chi straightener but my blowdryer kept causing all my lights to go out so I thought I would try this and I am really glad I did.  I would recommend blowdrying or toweldrying your hair for maybe 5-10 minutes before you use this just because it takes awhile to dry when your hair is super wet but it gets your hair very straight.  I use it with Chi Iron guard and Chi straight guard.  I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is on amazon.</li>
            <li> does a great job on my hair. like all the accessories that came with product.</li>
            <li> This iron was well worth the money. My daughter has curly hair and she loves that she can dry it a little bit and then use the iron to straighten it completely. Her hair looks beautiful all the time.</li>
            <li> I used on my damp hair, and the result weren&#x27;t as I expected from this flat iron. This is not my first iron, and I also had Chi products before that I truly love such as my ceramic blow dryer. My hair was kind of stiff and dry, so the next time that I used I blowed dry my hair first and then I used the flat iron with much better results, but the fact is thet I bought it because I wanted to use it on wet hair, so if that is what you want I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this flat iron two years ago and I fell in love with it.  It heats up really good but doesn&#x27;t keep the temperature that well.  If you want to use it while your hair is still damp then it works very well.  Whenever I would use it often my hair would get dry after a couple of days.  I had used this flat iron about three days a week for two years and I had never had a problem with it.  Just about a week ago I was at a youth weekend trip and after I got out of the shower and dried my hair I went to turn it on,but it wouldn&#x27;t.  It would heat up to about 200% then it would shut off.  I guessed that it was because there were so many other people using there own flat irons and blow driers that there wasn&#x27;t enough electricity for mine.  I tried again back at the cabin that I was at and it would only come on for about two seconds then shut off.  So I suggest that if you want a long lasting flat iron,you should invest in something else.</li>
            <li> My flat iron only lasted 6 months from this store. I emailed them about it and got a very generic response. They could have just acted like they cared. Not ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because a friend of mine has one.  She loves hers, but i&#x27;m not sure she has ever had a good flatiron.  This product pulls at my hair no matter how slow i go.  I have to turn it up to at least 300 degrees for it to even work, and i have very fine hair.  I have ordered a cricketx2 just like i had before, and it is about 25.00 cheaper than this CHI. The cricketx2 works at about 180 degrees on my hair and doesn&#x27;t pull. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this flatiron.  I&#x27;m going to try to sale mine to my friend or just throw it in the back of the closet, it&#x27;s frying my hair!</li>
            <li> Like many women out there, I could not bring myself to \\&quot;invest\\&quot; in a hair appliance.  All that has changed now!  I cannot believe how fast and smooth this flat iron works!  The quality is amazing, as well as the results.  To all you ladies out there, take the leap and just buy one.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Our flat iron broke after minimal use in only 4 months.  Normally that would be a small problem, but the seller \\&quot;Payless Beauty\\&quot; did not disclose that the manufacturer does NOT warranty items sold over the internet.  We would recommend buying only from a brick and mortar establishment.</li>
            <li> I used this flat iron about 15 times before it started smoking and then stopped turning on. I liked it a lot, it&#x27;s a shame. I treated it gently and always made sure it was clean before I turned it on. I bought one for my mother at the same time as I bought mine, and it, too, stopped working after a few months. And of course the only warranty is Amazon&#x27;s 30 day one, and it&#x27;s been four months, so I have no recourse. This is the first time I&#x27;ve had an expensive electrical item fail like this, and I can only conclude that there&#x27;s a serious flaw in the construction of these flat irons. My next flat iron will not be a CHI.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Chi Wet to Dry iron from Discount Jungle online.  The iron works great - when it works!  After 2 months of minimal use, it started turning off in the middle of my styling for no reason.  Discount Jungle gave me a replacement and the same thing happened after 3 months.  This time the temperture display would zero out and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  Discount Jungle wouldn&#x27;t replace it and neither would Farouk since I bought it online.  It&#x27;s a shame because it really styled well.  I only used it about 2-3 times per week and it was never subjected to any physical abuse.  It&#x27;s just a bad product.  My hair sytlist had trouble with hers as well.  Try a different iron or at least buy it directly from Farouk so you can use the warranty.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Used someone else&#x27;s and found it worked much better than my Hot Tools. This heats up in less than a minute, and saves lots of time. It stays hot and you can read the temp and know that halfway through it is still just as hot as the beginning of doing your hair. Allows me to finish the end with a curve, and not just broomstick straight. This was the best price I could find, and I checked everywhere. Having the place to put the iron while working keeps it secure. I used to end up knocking the flat irons down when I just put them down on the counter. This is spring locked into the holster, so it doesn&#x27;t come out if you lean against the cord.  I really like this flatiron.  I have thick hair, and it works really fast and leaves me with a good shine, and a lasting style.</li>
            <li> I bought this item expecting it to work similar to my regular chi iron, but was a little disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t as good. I&#x27;ve got a Remington Wet to Straight flat iron that works just as well and it only cost me $35 at walmart...it&#x27;s a much better buy</li>
            <li> This is the top of the line product.  You can control how hot it gets.  For my hair, I need to dry it completely before using this for the very best result.</li>
            <li> I love the digital temperature setting, as well as the ability to set a timer to turn off the iron.  GREAT!  I also love the stand and pouch - very cool!    It works great - except it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide quite as smoothly through your hair at first because there are vent holes in the iron.  Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s fine, and it actually straightens better than my old plain one inch CHI, IMO.    My only addition I would love for this product is for the timer to have an option for a default maximum that is always set, so that it would always turn itself off after say one hour, if you accidentally leave it on.    Other than that - great product, great buy.</li>
            <li> i bought this product for my daughter, who apparently knows more fashion than i.&#x3D;) she loves the hair straightener, this item was recommended by a beautician. absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> This Chi flat iron comes with a nice travel case and holster.  The automated timer and quick heating time are a plus.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.   I use it every day and have found how easy it is to work with.   FANTASTIC!!!!</li>
            <li> This got my hair straight, shiny, &amp; silky &amp; my hair is very very wavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Chi irons for years now.   This my second wet to dry iron and I love it.  I would never go back to a plain Chi dry iron.     Chi irons are superior to all other irons because of their temperature level and evenness.  I have confirmed this with a laser heat gauge comparing Chi&#x27;s to other brands.   The temp is nearly identical to the digital display on the front.  This is WHY you buy a Chi.  It is for serious thick hair-straightening.    The trick is that you really need to know how to use the Wet-Dry iron.  It is not intuitive, nor can you simply use on wet or damp hair with the same old products.   There are some key points you need to know.     Wet to Dry Key Points:    Key Benefit:  The number one benefit of the wet-dry iron is resistance to humidity.  When I started using this iron, I stopped getting chemical and thermal straighten at the salon.   I live in Fla and I have zero curl, fizz or puffiness when humidity is at max.  I only get this benefit with the wet-dry.    Steam:  Yes you are steaming your hair.  Yes it is safe.  No, you shouldn&#x27;t worry that you are hurting your hair.   You are steaming out the moisture and product not your hair.  The temp on your hair shaft is the same as a dry iron.  The key is NEVER to leave the heat on too long. See below.     Water Content: Damp almost dry hair works the best for many reasons.  It is faster, and the outcome is virtually the same as on wet hair.   Some professionals tell you NOT to use this product on true wet hair.  I have used on wet hair, but it takes forever, takes more skill and as I mentioned there is no benefit in the straightness category. Note however that the more water you steam with,  the more humidity resistance you will enjoy.  You&#x27;ll figure out the correct wetness for your needs. Start out with dryer hair and gradually work damper with each attempt.    Product: I am told by a top professional that silicone based thermal products are the only ones to use with a wet-dry iron.  I have had that experience first hand.  The regular old thermal protectors leave my hair feeling crunchy.  The nicer silkier products are hardly noticeable. YES-use product before you blow dry and again before you iron.   No need to use on each section. Just a small drop worked into your hair.  I like a cream before I dry and the oil before I iron.   Chi makes great stuff for this.      Dryer: There are a couple of approaches depending on your time commitment.  1) you can simply get all the water out with basic simple blow drying.  As long as your hair is damp to the touch this method will produce pin straight hair once you iron.   or  2) you can straighten your hair with a round brush and blow dry in sections.  Again as long as you leave each section damp to the touch the iron will work great.   I prefer method 2 for silkier hair.  Remember leave in enough wetness.  Don&#x27;t blow nearly dry.  If top sections get dryer as you work, a little drop of water does the trick.       Small batches: Just a reminder for those of you that may not know this.  The trick is to start at the nape of your neck and work forwards. Divide your head in half down center and then pin all up except what you are working with.  Iron in small sections about a 3rd the width of your iron&#x27;s length.  This produces the straightest outcome. Use a comb to catch the hot section.  You will burn your hands.     Steam:  You should produce steam, that is how you know there is still water on the shaft.  Do NOT leave the iron in one place EVER.  Again NEVER EVER hold the iron in one spot.  Catch your hair close to the head and iron till ONE INCH before the ends.  You may have to go over a section again but that is the idea.  Once you have completed that section you can then gather the entire section in the iron, and iron to the ends of the shaft.  This protects your ends, THE most vulnerable part.  (this is the same with a dry iron BTW)</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron through Amazon.com about three months ago. At first, I loved it- it heated up quickly and it thoroughly straightened my very long, thick hair in minutes. I used it about two times per week for the past three months without any problems. Last week, it just stopped working- I would turn it on, it would start heating up, and then it would just switch off for no reason. I checked Farouk&#x27;s website for the warranty information and was very shocked to read that the warranty is void if you purchase the product over the internet. If you must buy this product, please buy it at a professional beauty salon. Spend the extra money, because the iron WILL break, and you will need to use the warranty. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with both Amazon and CHI/Farouk. I will never purchase another CHI.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. The only little complaint I have is that the auto-shut off isn&#x27;t really \\&quot;auto\\&quot;. You have to turn it on! ha. seems kind of silly, eh?     Anyway, other than that, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased this time a few years ago.  It still works great!  Highly recommend this product.  I love that you can set the temperature.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a year now, and I love it!  I do not use it on wet hair as I could see that doing some damage to the hair.  When used on dry hair, it only takes 2-3 passes to straighten.</li>
            <li> I try the original CHI but didn&#x27;t like it because you could not adjust the temperature and my hair and scalp would burn. I have had the wet2straight from REMINGTON for 4 yrs and it was the best for my hair (thick, wavy and abundant) because even when I blow dry my hair, it stays damp so when I straighten it the steam does not burn my scalp. Well, to make the story short when I saw this I was so happy, I bought it immediately and I am not disappointed, it has a super long cord, a timer and the plates are not too thin nor thick just the right size. The bonus stuff is fantastic too. Love the stand. I put it on the mirror.</li>
            <li> For all of you out there who would like to save your money for another womanly must have - don&#x27;t buy the CHI! Although it works great, there is another solution. Remington \\&quot;Wet to Straight\\&quot; hair straightener that is the best!!! It&#x27;s only $[...] - cheaper some other places too! It works great, and is durable! I had my first one for 8 years, and finally had to replace it. I almost panicked until I found it again for the same price $[...]. I don&#x27;t know the shelf life of a CHI, but 30 bucks for 8 years sounds like a fabulous investment!! Keep it in mind before you make a purchase like this - especially in an economy like this!</li>
            <li> I bought this wet/dry Chi in January 2010. I had read all the reviews, talked to friends that had purchased and used this brand for years. I got it and I tried it both ways, dry hair and damp/towel dried hair. It worked well and I was pretty pleased with it.    However, this morning August 2010, I turned it on, let it warm up and then, noticed that the digital display had stopped working and there were not numbers. But, I thought as long as it keeps heating up, I don&#x27;t really care.    Well, about 3 mins later, I realized that it was starting to cool down and the piece of junk had actaully stopped working completely! I have owned many hair straighteners for many years. I have owned Hottools irons that have lasted YEARS! And I spent triple the money on this one and it lasted for a fraction of the time. This is completelty ridiculous and unacceptable. I have yet to contact the company, but I am not too confident in their response after reading some of the posts this afternoon. I will update when I know more.     I would not recommend this product and will not be buying another CHI to replace the one that lasted barely 8 mos!!It&#x27;s too expensive to only last 8 mos. Just be warned, it is not a good product. It should not burn out in such a short amount of time!!</li>
            <li> The one that I bought for my wife lasted for almost 4 years.  I can&#x27;t complain about that.  Would be nice if it were still working, but we&#x27;ll buy another because we liked how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I have had two of this exact same iron. They both broken after about a year and a half. If you buy online the warranty is invalid. Now, I have two expensive flat irons that are broken! I am not buying Chi again...</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  It does wonders on my hair.  I get lots of compliments on my hair.  I like the fact that I can control the temperature digitally.  Still working in 4-2014.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference this flat iron made in my hair. I was using a $40 drugstore model, which completely fried my fine hair. I bought this and used it set on only 160 degrees, as advised by my stylist. The difference is unbelievable. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> worked well but died quick - bought a much cheaper off the shelf store model and still have it .</li>
            <li> My daughter had one of these for about 4 years. She used it constantly. When it broke, we got the same one on Amazon. She loves it. She can use it when her hair is wet, so it saves a step blow drying first. Her hair is very curly and it straightens it beautifully.</li>
            <li> Best product ever, I have purchased several other CHI irons and non can compare to this wet/dry iron love it!</li>
            <li> Super fast and arrived just in time for Christmas!!!  absolutely awesome!!!  A++++. I would do definitely do more business with this shipper! I do recommend them!</li>
            <li> The chi wet dry is awesome.  Its easy to use. Has a travel case as well as a stand which are very convienent for travel and daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter. She had the same model but dropped it and it broke, so we had to buy a new one. As she is familiar with how well the first one worked, she was very disappointed to find out that this one does not get hot enough to straighten her long, thick hair. She is very disappointed. We are returning it.</li>
