            <li>This lotion right here is one of my favorite non tingle tanning lotions it smells so Good</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong, not a bad smell just very strong.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves a nice golden tan!</li>
            <li>and it goes on super smooth!!</li>
            <li>Ed Hardy did an amazing job with his whole tanning lotion line!!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it goes on really smooth and doesn&#x27;t change in smell after you tan.</li>
            <li>so most tanning lotions can make you look a funny color!!</li>
            <li>This has a strong berry scent that is over powering to me.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and I didn&#x27;t sink after coming out of the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lotion to use!</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lotion and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent so when you are done tanning you don&#x27;t smell like the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same, great smell, non streaking, non greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a sweat ball of burnt skin.</li>
            <li>Must make sure you rub this in well as its very streaky, like your rubbing fruit in your skin...</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a downside, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>this could be my new favorite lotion smells fantastic and supper moisturizing will order this one again</li>
            <li>:) IF your looking for a great dark bronzing lotion, I HIGHLY recommend this one!</li>
            <li>Has these little burgundy bronze beads so make sure you rub it in good.</li>
            <li>very pleased with product, low cost and prime shipping!</li>
            <li>Just a nice dark brown :)</li>
            <li>Fast results!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend, it&#x27;s a nice big bottle for the price</li>
            <li>It also helps with a good beginning tan, but i went up to a tingle after this one to get the dark tan that I was aiming for.</li>
            <li>seems to be a nice natural tan so far.</li>
            <li>Upon first use you will see some color</li>
            <li>It has an instant color effect and a delay color effect which I love.</li>
            <li>Shower much needed!  </li>
            <li>Several more times to wait after color shows up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been testing out this tanning lotion for the past few weeks, the bronzing effect fades very quickly and isn&#x27;t that impressive to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Got it fast in the mail with my prime acct in time for me to use at the tanning bed</li>
            <li>Every time I try something new, I regret the waste of money and go back to this lotion lol</li>
            <li>Decent size bottle too.</li>
            <li>I would put this on the same level as DS Spellbound, only the Spellbound has more silicone</li>
            <li>This product smells great but does not compare to the Ed hardy black elixir I previously purchased.</li>
            <li>So far it seems compatable to what my salon sells except this one was much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>and I feel silky soft while using it.</li>
            <li>Smells like an adult version or tropical punch</li>
            <li>My skin is already naturally olive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same lotion you buy at tanning salons for about $75 less!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same lotion you buy at tanning salons for about $75 less!</li>
            <li> seems to last a long time</li>
            <li> It takes at least 2-3 hours before noticing the bronzing effect and probably won&#x27;t really show up until the next day after use.  </li>
            <li> and then you will see you are even a little darker later on that same day or next morning.</li>
            <li> but it fades almost completely within less than 2 days, you would have to tan everyday to maintain the same initial color.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for a very long time ...</li>
            <li> As soon as I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I&#x27;m going back to Ed hardy black elixir.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so you use less.</li>
            <li> Half the price of what it retails for in tanning salons.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Swedish Beauty Dark Escape and can not rate the results highly enough, just the after smell that is awful..</li>
            <li> This product after reading the reviews was highly anticipated, absolutly awful...</li>
            <li> Not impressed!!!  </li>
            <li> it really stinks</li>
            <li> Like others I&#x27;ve tried they have stained my hands and had a terrible after smell.</li>

            <li> Smells great, works good!I</li>
            <li> Works great.  Fast service.</li>
            <li> this was bought on amazon.com for cheaper than i could buy through a discounted tanning member&#x27;s catalog. very pleased with product, low cost and prime shipping!</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for a very long time ... 13 yrs and I am not the go every day type of person... but I go regularly. That being said I have tried many products... and the ones I love are with bronzers and anything that will help my skin look and feel supple. This lotion does that..and if you have tatts it helps because this eliminates fading in the color of the tatt. Upon first use you will see some color and then you will see you are even a little darker later on that same day or next morning. It has an instant color effect and a delay color effect which I love. This smells good and I feel silky soft while using it. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaking or an orange color. Very good color and looks natural. I will purchase this again. Not to mention purchasing this on line along with many others is  a lot cheaper than in the salon.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I have been tanning for 10 years now and nothing beats the color this lotion gives you! its a must for any tanner &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, rather cheap.</li>
            <li> this could be my new favorite lotion smells fantastic and supper moisturizing will order this one again seems to last a long time</li>
            <li> This lotion is TRUELY amazing! The bronzing beads give you GORGEOUS color!!! Also the smell is fabulous! Smells like an adult version or tropical punch :) IF your looking for a great dark bronzing lotion, I HIGHLY recommend this one! Ed Hardy did an amazing job with his whole tanning lotion line!!</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Swedish Beauty Dark Escape and can not rate the results highly enough, just the after smell that is awful.. Shower much needed!  This product after reading the reviews was highly anticipated, absolutly awful... Feel like i have used a regular hemp cream from the salon.. Must make sure you rub this in well as its very streaky, like your rubbing fruit in your skin... (Maybe this is what happend they made this lotion with fruit and forgot the bronzing ingrediants..)  Today i look like i need a tan. Not impressed!!!  If you want a fansy bottle of cream however that looks like it does the job then this is your man!</li>
            <li> I was not \\&quot;blown away\\&quot; by this product.  It&#x27;s okay &amp; I will use what I have, but won&#x27;t buy it again.  The smell is very strong, not a bad smell just very strong.  It does not have the instant bronzing in it so you don&#x27;t see immediate results.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Smells great n i get really great color from it. Got it fast in the mail with my prime acct in time for me to use at the tanning bed</li>
            <li> This lotion right here is one of my favorite non tingle tanning lotions it smells so Good and it goes on super smooth!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing out this tanning lotion for the past few weeks, the bronzing effect fades very quickly and isn&#x27;t that impressive to begin with.  The smell out of the bottle isn&#x27;t great, but post-tanning it really stinks and I can&#x27;t wait to shower.  I plan on using the rest of the bottle up but wouldn&#x27;t repurchase or recommend to others.</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion! Smells so good and very refreshing to use! Will be visiting again once I run out!</li>
            <li> Smells good &amp; leaves great color.</li>
            <li> Would have told how it works, takes some time. Several more times to wait after color shows up. Will catch up then.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! By far my favorite lotion and smells amazing. A little goes a long way. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lotion. It smells amazing before and after. It gives you a nice brown color that lasts! No orange or off shade.. Just a nice dark brown :) Every time I try something new, I regret the waste of money and go back to this lotion lol</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion ever.</li>
            <li> A great price for a name brand tanning lotion! Half the price of what it retails for in tanning salons. This is my absolute favorite lotion to use!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest tanning lotion ever. Fast results!! My skin is already naturally olive so most tanning lotions can make you look a funny color!! Love it</li>
            <li> Ed Hardy is so overrated, but this product had good reviews so I tried it. I still use this every time I tan. It smells amazing, covers up any tanning odors, and has bronzing beads that dissipate into the skin and make you tan, not orange. Tan lasts and I smell great, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better tanning product. I&#x27;ve also tried the Ed Hardy koi fish lotion, which also smells good but doesn&#x27;t tan as well as this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same lotion you buy at tanning salons for about $75 less! Exactly the same, great smell, non streaking, non greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a sweat ball of burnt skin. The seller had the product to me with no hassle well before the estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it goes on really smooth and doesn&#x27;t change in smell after you tan. It has bronzing beads, which I also like. Sometimes the beads leave a streak across your skin if you don&#x27;t rub them in all the way, but the streaks rub out no problem so it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. This lotions smells good and it also leaves a noticeably good tan right away and I haven&#x27;t seen any hint of orange, seems to be a nice natural tan so far. I would recommend, it&#x27;s a nice big bottle for the price and it leaves a nice golden tan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Ed Hardy lotion before and a friend wanted a bottle. I work at a tanning salon and found it to be cheaper ordering it from here. It had the scent, color, and bronzing beads that my lotion from a salon had. I was 100% satisfied with the lotion.</li>
            <li> This has a strong berry scent that is over powering to me. That&#x27;s the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this lotion. Goes on great an tans great.</li>
            <li> I recommend this tanning lotion. It smells good and works great. I especially like the bronzing affect.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It has a light scent so when you are done tanning you don&#x27;t smell like the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Still love this product  .......</li>
            <li> Just received this product yesterday.  Went to the tanning salon today and tried it out.  So far it seems compatable to what my salon sells except this one was much cheaper.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and I didn&#x27;t sink after coming out of the tanning bed.  Like others I&#x27;ve tried they have stained my hands and had a terrible after smell. It takes at least 2-3 hours before noticing the bronzing effect and probably won&#x27;t really show up until the next day after use.  This is a downside, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This product smells great but does not compare to the Ed hardy black elixir I previously purchased. This product gives you some color but it fades almost completely within less than 2 days, you would have to tan everyday to maintain the same initial color. As soon as I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I&#x27;m going back to Ed hardy black elixir.</li>
    </ol>
