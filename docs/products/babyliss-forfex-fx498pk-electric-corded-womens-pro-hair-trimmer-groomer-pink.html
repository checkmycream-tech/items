    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li>It is also designed for a woman, to look feminine and dainty.  </li>
            <li>The cord is a great length.</li>
            <li>And it works great.</li>
            <li>The attachments are plastic and flimsy, but still work great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>great product and no complaints from me.</li>
            <li>My husband seems moderately happy with his andis</li>
            <li>No complaints! :P</li>
            <li>the color is so cute plus they are the perfect size.</li>
            <li>but I am loving the quality and the price!</li>
            <li>It has a surprisingly hefty cord.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good buy.</li>
            <li>The blades are a good quality.</li>
            <li>these trimmers are very cute.</li>
            <li>They also feel great when you use them, no pulling and tugging, just a smooth glide as they remove the hair.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, we&#x27;re buying these to trim up our nether</li>
            <li>I get worried about catching it on myself.</li>
            <li>Just needed a trimmer, if you&#x27;re looking for results like the kind you get with a razor I would stick to the razor or waxing.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of trying to return this and wait for another product to arrive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, it does the job.</li>
            <li>And the price was almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute color too.</li>
            <li>More like stabby...</li>
            <li>Whoever would think a hair trimmer could be cute.</li>
            <li>When I trimed my hair this gave me such a wonderful cut!</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Color is cute</li>
            <li>am happy to report that my first use was successful, safe, and fast.</li>
            <li>The Babyliss handles nicely, it is a nice size that is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this and would have preferred to find a cordless trimmer, but I have to say this little thing is very good.</li>
            <li>Although this is quite handy for the nether regions, the attachments are very pointy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>In a few months I should know what I like best.</li>
            <li>I am a fan!&lt;br /&gt;I repeat that I am NOT using this trimmer to remove hair down to the skin (like I would with a disposable razor or with wax); it is perfect to get an even shape/trim quickly.</li>
            <li>very powerful, my fiance used them once</li>
            <li>Keeps those sensitive areas tidy</li>
            <li>Have only used once but seems like good qaulity for the price.  </li>
            <li>It got fairly good reviews on several websites.  </li>
            <li>I did not find this true of the babyliss.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I agree with the one reviewer who said these clippers are just the right size and weight for a woman&#x27;s hand.  </li>
            <li>Nice long cord...</li>
            <li>I wanted a trimmer to get tidy results in that most delicate of areas.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works as expected, cuts close and keeps things nice and trimmed.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close without nicking or scraping your skin.</li>
            <li>This my first body trimmer</li>
            <li>It is a lot more easy to hold and maneuver than a full sized clipper, and the head is about 2/3 the width of standard clippers, maybe less.</li>
            <li>little thing is nice.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not too noisy, and has a nice little cleaning brush (why don&#x27;t they all come with a cleaning brush??</li>
            <li>cuts very close and smooth with several gaurd options to choose from.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>and now he wants a pair.</li>
            <li>was really nervous (Would I get hurt?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about running out of juice, especially in the middle of a trim!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy duty, easy to use and gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also love that it&#x27;s pink!!</li>
            <li>Product had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also available in black for about 50% more money if you want to feel less like a pretty princess when you shave your parts.</li>
            <li>Motor seems to be somewhat weak and even though it does a fairly good job, it struggles sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple of electric shavers, but most died after a few months.</li>
            <li>I wish it was cordless, but then again, the cord is super long</li>
            <li>I am new to Babyliss</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet though.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happy cutting.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it wasn&#x27;t cordless, but it is very efficient.  </li>
            <li>a pretty long cable which is always good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I had one complaint it would be the fact that it needs more sizes of guards.</li>
            <li>By \\&quot;tidy results\\&quot; I mean uniform, short groomed body hair but not \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; close.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first babyliss product I have ever ordered, this single item has earned my trust in this company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and I feel weighs as much as the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li>They are more like the blades on hair clippers than the usual cheap thin blades they try to put on trimmers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and has a generous cord - longer than the ones on any full sized clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>

            <li> Do you know how many trimmers I have purchased that have been, may I say, absolute crap?</li>
            <li> The cord is still a pain to work around without getting a bit tangled up, but it is quite long which makes it easier to move around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely solid and well-made with sharp blades that cut well</li>
            <li> Will add further reviews if it starts to break down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink.</li>
            <li> just keep them away from your man, he will want to commandier your trimmers, and wont mind the color pink.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;ve given this product 3 stars is because I have to be VERY careful when using the attachments in my bikini area as the combs have cut my skin &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;  They are a little bit too sharp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something with more oomph than those dreadful beard trimmers with the double A batteries that last about a minute before they cough up a hairball and die.</li>
            <li> Usually due to the battery not holding a charge</li>
            <li> (and I even cut myself underestimating how sharp).</li>
            <li> I have used cordless electric shavers, but this has a cord (won&#x27;t run down because of discharge), so it takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product itself is pretty heavy and a little difficult to maneuver if you&#x27;re looking for a closer trim.  </li>
            <li> I still use it...just very carefully!</li>
            <li> i am a hairstylist that uses these all day, everyday</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that the extra parts (Brush, oil, etc) did NOT come included in the packaging despite the product information both on Amazon as well as clearly labeled on the box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two waterproof rechargeable razors over the past few years and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how heavy this is</li>
            <li> They buzz for a few minutes, drone sadly for a few more, and then slowly fail on you, always leaving your bits all sad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and lightweight and maneuvers well.  </li>
            <li> Especially down there...</li>
            <li> Be disappointed with the results?</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my bikini line so this works well for cleaning up the bikini line without getting razor burn.</li>

            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it wasn&#x27;t cordless, but it is very efficient.  It is also designed for a woman, to look feminine and dainty.  It is also solid and sturdy feeling, not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have to borrow one from my husband.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, we&#x27;re buying these to trim up our nether regions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something with more oomph than those dreadful beard trimmers with the double A batteries that last about a minute before they cough up a hairball and die. The &#x27;rechargeable&#x27; trimmers suck too. They buzz for a few minutes, drone sadly for a few more, and then slowly fail on you, always leaving your bits all sad looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little thing is nice. It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and has a generous cord - longer than the ones on any full sized clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. You can use it with or without the included guards, which are flimsy.  It is a lot more easy to hold and maneuver than a full sized clipper, and the head is about 2/3 the width of standard clippers, maybe less. It&#x27;s also available in black for about 50% more money if you want to feel less like a pretty princess when you shave your parts.</li>

            <li> I really like this razor.  I&#x27;ve tried two waterproof rechargeable razors over the past few years and they&#x27;ve each only last about 2 years.  The only reason I&#x27;ve given this product 3 stars is because I have to be VERY careful when using the attachments in my bikini area as the combs have cut my skin &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;  They are a little bit too sharp.  I still use it...just very carefully!</li>
            <li> Do you know how many trimmers I have purchased that have been, may I say, absolute crap? Not this one! It does the job with ease, it&#x27;s not too noisy, and has a nice little cleaning brush (why don&#x27;t they all come with a cleaning brush?? HELLO!). I wish it was cordless, but then again, the cord is super long and it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about running out of juice, especially in the middle of a trim! Highly recommend. Also love that it&#x27;s pink!!</li>
            <li> It works. It&#x27;s small. It&#x27;s pink. It&#x27;s quiet. It has a surprisingly hefty cord. The cord is a great length. No complaints! :P</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty, easy to use and gets the job done quickly.  This is the first babyliss product I have ever ordered, this single item has earned my trust in this company.</li>

            <li> Nice long cord... Easy to use and clean. And it works great. The attachments are plastic and flimsy, but still work great. I&#x27;m happy</li>

            <li> I use these for wk and home. I love them</li>
            <li> these trimmers are very cute. the color is so cute plus they are the perfect size. very powerful, my fiance used them once and now he wants a pair. And the price was almost too good to be true. cuts very close and smooth with several gaurd options to choose from. just keep them away from your man, he will want to commandier your trimmers, and wont mind the color pink. Happy cutting.</li>
            <li> i am a hairstylist that uses these all day, everyday and I love them. I am new to Babyliss but I am loving the quality and the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used battery shavers in the past so this is my first electric. It&#x27;s nice, it does the job. I hate shaving my bikini line so this works well for cleaning up the bikini line without getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels well made.&lt;br /&gt;Has a pretty long cable which is always good.&lt;br /&gt;Variety of heads to pick from.&lt;br /&gt;Color is cute so it is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> It got fairly good reviews on several websites.  This my first body trimmer and I have only used it once, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with.  I have used cordless electric shavers, but this has a cord (won&#x27;t run down because of discharge), so it takes getting used to.  Motor seems to be somewhat weak and even though it does a fairly good job, it struggles sometimes.  It&#x27;s small and lightweight and maneuvers well.  I got a Hitachi CL-365-B Clippers (because I like my Hitachi RM-160-S electric shaver) and I am comparing it with the Bablyliss Clippers.  In a few months I should know what I like best.</li>
            <li> I wanted a trimmer to get tidy results in that most delicate of areas. By \\&quot;tidy results\\&quot; I mean uniform, short groomed body hair but not \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; close.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used disposable razors/wax prior and had no experience with an electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I was really nervous (Would I get hurt? Be disappointed with the results? How do I use this thing?!).&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that my first use was successful, safe, and fast. I am a fan!&lt;br /&gt;I repeat that I am NOT using this trimmer to remove hair down to the skin (like I would with a disposable razor or with wax); it is perfect to get an even shape/trim quickly.</li>
            <li> I agree with the one reviewer who said these clippers are just the right size and weight for a woman&#x27;s hand.  They also feel great when you use them, no pulling and tugging, just a smooth glide as they remove the hair.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried a lot of rechargeable battery powered trimmers. They have all ended up junk within a month. Usually due to the battery not holding a charge and you cannot use them while plugged in. This led me to my search for a corded trimmer. I bought the Babyliss for me and an andis for my husband. My husband seems moderately happy with his andis he says it seems under powered. I did not find this true of the babyliss. I think it has plenty of power. The blades are a good quality. They are more like the blades on hair clippers than the usual cheap thin blades they try to put on trimmers. The Babyliss handles nicely, it is a nice size that is comfortable to hold. If I had one complaint it would be the fact that it needs more sizes of guards.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this and would have preferred to find a cordless trimmer, but I have to say this little thing is very good. It&#x27;s definitely solid and well-made with sharp blades that cut well (and I even cut myself underestimating how sharp). The cord is still a pain to work around without getting a bit tangled up, but it is quite long which makes it easier to move around. Overall I would recommend.</li>
