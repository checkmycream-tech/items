            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great buy</li>

            <li>it even smells gorgeous xoxo</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, rich color, but i wish it was darker.</li>
            <li>This solution has no orange tones therefore gives a nice brown tint when applied.  </li>
            <li>very nice golden brown on fair skin.</li>
            <li>Loved it, works great on fair and dark skin</li>
            <li>Venetian Plus is my top requested product.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE -</li>
            <li>but i feel like this is a better color &amp; looks more exotic tan.</li>
            <li>Better than using make up every day.</li>
            <li>And the ingredients contain mostly vegetables which my skin appreciates.</li>
            <li>I love Novell&#x27;s Venetian and recommend it to all.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to read measurements.</li>
            <li>Im more concerned with that</li>
            <li>no sticky feeling can&#x27;t wait to use on my self first client loved</li>
            <li>Love this product but why oh WHY the huge jump in price?  </li>
            <li>When applying you use less product to achieve perfect tan look.</li>
            <li>lightning fast shipping amazing color</li>
            <li>It is amazing how many different skin tones I can use it on</li>
            <li>Tip: if you ARE on Accutane, you will have the chest/neck area and down side of forearms fade quick, just touch it up with this solution after about a week and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>hi, that was the most fast delivery ever.</li>
            <li>My products have always been fresh and well sealed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Pretty color and stayed on longer</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I love this color.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Will look for something more convenient in the future</li>
            <li>Cap was not sealed making me think it is not the real product I paid for.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I hate when people say if you are fair skinned it won&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>Highly recommeded</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m forced to shop around for a more reasonable product.</li>
            <li>I do not use alot, just a light misting every week or so no heavy saturation but could see how a heavy application could create a much deeper brown color.</li>
            <li>Def as dark as the Double Dark &amp; smells sooooo good.</li>
            <li>Works especially well for those of us who have a darker/olive skin tone naturally.  </li>

            <li> Works especially well for those of us who have a darker/olive skin tone naturally.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly sticky for the first few hours and does have the smell</li>
            <li> I really was hoping to receive what was pictured, because a dispense nozzle makes the process less messy.</li>
            <li> Tan lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Norvell products before- usually from Norvell directly.  </li>
            <li> i used to always use Norvell Double Dark</li>
            <li> This solution has green undertones which compliment my red undertones without turning me orange.</li>
            <li> Well I am Irish and pale, I burn not tan-</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> (Norvell caps are usually brown for this product)</li>
            <li> MY clients who like to go dark without looking fake like this brand compared to others</li>
            <li> Except I was disappointed when I thought I was being sent this box</li>
            <li> but I thought I would keep it anyway and was so disappointed.</li>

            <li> Venetian Plus is my top requested product. It is amazing how many different skin tones I can use it on</li>
            <li> very nice golden brown on fair skin. Doesn&#x27;t come in box, expect a 33 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Best color by Norvell!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Norvell products before- usually from Norvell directly.  My products have always been fresh and well sealed. This bottle I received today expired in April of 2015. It&#x27;s now June... and the cap is WHITE (Norvell caps are usually brown for this product) Cap was not sealed making me think it is not the real product I paid for.</li>
            <li> Great color with a bluish base, so no orange tone.  Works especially well for those of us who have a darker/olive skin tone naturally.  It is slightly sticky for the first few hours and does have the smell but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Color is INCREIBLE! Except I was disappointed when I thought I was being sent this box but I was sent a bottle</li>
            <li> Pretty color and stayed on longer</li>
            <li> Perfect color!  Not orange at all!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I love this color. I am fair skinned, but still do two coats of this and I look like I just got back from the Bahamas. I hate when people say if you are fair skinned it won&#x27;t look good. Well I am Irish and pale, I burn not tan- and this solution looks PERFECT on me. I even used this while on Accutane (Absorica/Isotretinoin), and it is the only solution that lasts on my skin! Tip: if you ARE on Accutane, you will have the chest/neck area and down side of forearms fade quick, just touch it up with this solution after about a week and you&#x27;re good to go! Tan lasts very long. Great buy</li>
            <li> lightning fast shipping amazing color no sticky feeling can&#x27;t wait to use on my self first client loved it even smells gorgeous xoxo</li>
            <li> I ordered this and got Venetian one instead of Venetian plus. Not only that but I thought I would keep it anyway and was so disappointed. Does not work at all. After you shower, it reveals no color at all stayed!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE - i used to always use Norvell Double Dark but i feel like this is a better color &amp; looks more exotic tan. Def as dark as the Double Dark &amp; smells sooooo good. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Loved it, works great on fair and dark skin</li>
            <li> The item pictured is not what you get.  You get a plastic bottle...don&#x27;t be fooled.  Other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I received it two days before the estimated delivery date. I will continue to be a customer</li>
            <li> MY clients who like to go dark without looking fake like this brand compared to others</li>
            <li> Love this product but why oh WHY the huge jump in price?  Almost $60.00 for a liter?  I&#x27;m forced to shop around for a more reasonable product.</li>
            <li> Lasts me a lifetime. This solution has green undertones which compliment my red undertones without turning me orange. I do not use alot, just a light misting every week or so no heavy saturation but could see how a heavy application could create a much deeper brown color. Skin tone has everything to do with the solution one chooses. Better than using make up every day. And the ingredients contain mostly vegetables which my skin appreciates.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, rich color, but i wish it was darker.</li>
            <li> This solution has no orange tones therefore gives a nice brown tint when applied.  I love Novell&#x27;s Venetian and recommend it to all.  When applying you use less product to achieve perfect tan look.</li>
            <li> The picture shown here is not what is actually sent to you.  Make sure to read measurements.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I really was hoping to receive what was pictured, because a dispense nozzle makes the process less messy. But I got a bottle Instead. Im more concerned with that then what the color actually looks like as I do spray tans several times a day and that was the selling point for me on this item. Will look for something more convenient in the future</li>
            <li> hi, that was the most fast delivery ever. Highly recommeded</li>
