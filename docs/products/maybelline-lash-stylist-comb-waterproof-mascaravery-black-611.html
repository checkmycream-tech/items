            <li>I loved this mascara</li>
            <li>what I love best about it is the comb applicator - more mascara companies should incorporate a comb version into their line.</li>
            <li>I had a great experience being able to find it and purchase it on line.</li>
            <li>, I was so glad to see that Amazon carried it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>This is an amazing mascara.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I read the reviews, but this mascara did NOT work for me.  </li>
            <li>Nice.    </li>
            <li>This was by far the best mascara that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I prefer tubing mascaras, but when this was locally available in drugstores I loved buying &amp; using it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy &amp; convenient!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT..  </li>
            <li>I love the lash stylist comb.</li>
            <li>interesting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite because the comb separates and coats lashes fully.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I would love the results everyone else is getting.  </li>
            <li>I get more compliments from using this mascasra</li>
            <li>It is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love the comb and must have waterproof.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all in the comb, though, so if you run out, wash the brush and dip it in another mascara :)</li>
            <li>I love playing up my eyes</li>
            <li>and I hope I can continue getting my favorite brand from you.</li>
            <li>I do love my product, I did love you ...</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just hope the seller comes to their senses so I can spread more of my hard-earned ever-vanishing cash their way again.</li>
            <li>Wow, for a drugstore mascara this works great, and I must say I&#x27;m surprised and very impressed!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 15 years and now have not been able to adjust to using a macara with a brush applicator.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>i love this mascara but it has been discontinued</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Try it - you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>this was my favorite now</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>but glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>and I did LOVE it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how many compliments I receive for having beautiful, long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>but glad it&#x27;s still available here.</li>
            <li>I just bought this mascara because of the good ratings, and I really wondered, how this one would measure up to all the hype.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even mind paying much more than the original price</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave panda-eye residue.</li>
            <li>Comes off easy with eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, no clumping.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to get close to your lashline and in the corners.  </li>
            <li>Then I started noticing that I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so easily.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, the best mascara out there.</li>
            <li>Hassle free transaction, quickly shipped!</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon &amp; was super excited!</li>
            <li>I absolutely swear by this mascara and was thrilled to find it still available through Amazon.     </li>
            <li>Try that with the huge brushes everybody has now</li>
            <li>The comb was fabulous, and it truly did make for impactful lashes.</li>
            <li>It is ABSOLUTELY fantastic.</li>
            <li>Definitely holds up through sports, tears, weather and is great for people who wear contacts.</li>
            <li>The comb wand is fantastic at separating lashes.  </li>
            <li>I know the product is sealed but what is the guarantee that the formula is still good inside, considering its 5 years old in the tube.</li>
            <li>Thanks Maybelline!!!</li>
            <li>It is upsetting to see such an exceptional, favorite mascara get discontinued.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite mascara , and it&#x27;s cheap, man it makes me happy that it&#x27;s not some fancy shmancy brand.</li>
            <li>I have really britle lashes and this mascara makes the long and makes them seperate perfect.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to contact them and they were very helpful</li>
            <li>but man, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not avalaible in stores anymore, but I&#x27;m glad that I find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending more on something like an eye shadow that really shows the pigment and quality, but I&#x27;m not a fan of overpriced mascaras, and this one rocks!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s unique about it is the comb tip instead of a brush which combs and separates your lashes while lifting and lengthening them.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so unique a product...</li>
            <li>The unique comb evenly coats, separates and lengthens and the formula is true to it&#x27;s waterproof claim.</li>
            <li>i use it on all my special occasions.</li>
            <li>Cool.  </li>
            <li>The item I ordered was delivered right on time &amp; was hassle free.</li>
            <li>Maybelline Last Stylish Comb waterproof mascara, Very Black is the best mascara out there</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>It was reasonable to pay $7.99 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It was worth $9+ shipping, but $18+ shipping?</li>
            <li>the comb wand alone makes it entirely worth it.</li>
            <li>but in that case it was worth the costly shipping fees.</li>
            <li>I am going to order 10 of these right now, because I read it is a discontinued product.</li>
            <li>When I first tryed this mascara i couldn&#x27;t believe it, Im</li>
            <li>I love the way it last forever</li>
            <li>I will check Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>Items in your cart will always reflect the most recent price displayed on their product detail pages.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>I read about all the reviews of this item before purchasing and because I love trying different mascaras I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore this I got a compliment from a coworker.</li>
            <li>Instead I&#x27;d love for all you to go to the Maybelline site and send a note asking for it back....</li>
            <li>Sure wish Maybelline would either reconsider or or quickly give some other manufacturer a shot at distributing this product.</li>
            <li>You definitely need a good makeup remover to properly get this all off</li>
            <li>I purchased these items but would really like to be able to buy them at my local drug store.</li>
            <li>I love the comb as it really gives the lashes length and, above al,l it does not leave any clumps on the tops of the lashes.</li>
            <li>I myself bought a whole bunch of these when I first heard its being discontinued.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want to say that it changed my life, but that&#x27;s a little extreme, but my lashes look the best that they have in my whole life.</li>
            <li>This formula goes on easily, coats and covers every last lash.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, hard-to-curl lashes, and this neat little comb and mascara make my lashes full and pretty.  </li>
            <li>No big deal to them, but a huge ordeal for me.</li>
            <li>THANKS TO AMAZON.COM</li>
            <li>They always ask me if my eyelashes are real when i wear this mascara.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks  Dgirl1919</li>
            <li>But, since shipping was no longer free, I figured it all came out to about the same price.)</li>
            <li>I have spent nearly twice as much for mascara and didn&#x27;t receive these kind of results.</li>
            <li>Separates your lashes very well.  </li>
            <li>It also really is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my eyes sting like many other mascaras do &amp;</li>
            <li>I have used many different EXPENSIVE brands over the last 40 years, and by far this is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li>The comb really does a better job than those brushes in other mascaras!</li>
            <li>The order came within two days and I finally felt like my face was complete --- long lashes --- blackest of black lashes --- perfectly styled --- waterproof, smudge-proof.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is very wet and black - it makes my lashes look great with one coat - two coats and they&#x27;re very glam.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t until I happened to type in the product on Amazon that I was surprised to find the exact Maybelline mascara I had been searching for.  </li>
            <li>Great waterproof mascara is hard to find, and this was a terrific one.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and it requires only one application - which is quick and saves alot of time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have tried tons of mascaras this is by far the best out there although it is a little difficult to get off its worth it!  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned and wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a \\&quot;comb\\&quot; instead of a brush like normal mascara&#x27;s....</li>
            <li>It makes your eyelash look long and full.</li>
            <li>For fun I&#x27;m going to combine this with another mascara to experiment with different looks.</li>
            <li>But then I started thinking that six would not be an adequate lifetime supply, especially as I hesitated in opening that first pack which would knock me right down to five.    </li>
            <li>The product showed up when it was promised &amp; was in brand new shape/packaging as promised.</li>
            <li>a new message from Amazon.com ...    </li>
            <li>(One more mental note made public:  </li>
            <li>I love this product and am so sad that it is not longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not as dark and feels totally different, I made the mistake a few times getting different colors but only the waterproof one works the best.</li>
            <li>Maybelline should really think again as far as bringing the product back.....  </li>
            <li>This mascara really holds up the curl in a lash and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It comes off quite easy with baby oil or makeup remover, and never feels dry or stiff.    </li>
            <li>My eyes never looked so bright and one person at work asked me if my lashes were fake because of how long they were.  </li>
            <li>Nothing ever held a curl; my lashes would look short and straight before long.</li>
            <li>Lash Stylist is by far simple to use.  </li>
            <li>I will not waste my time in the future..  </li>
            <li>I absolutely refuse to buy any other mascara.</li>
            <li>When I first pulled out the little comb</li>
            <li>geeze a little much for maybeline....</li>

            <li> Hassle free transaction, quickly shipped!</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon &amp; was super excited!</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this mascara and was thrilled to find it still available through Amazon.     </li>
            <li> Try that with the huge brushes everybody has now</li>
            <li> The comb was fabulous, and it truly did make for impactful lashes.</li>
            <li> It is ABSOLUTELY fantastic.</li>
            <li> Definitely holds up through sports, tears, weather and is great for people who wear contacts.</li>
            <li> The comb wand is fantastic at separating lashes.  </li>
            <li> I know the product is sealed but what is the guarantee that the formula is still good inside, considering its 5 years old in the tube.</li>
            <li> Thanks Maybelline!!!</li>
            <li> It is upsetting to see such an exceptional, favorite mascara get discontinued.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite mascara , and it&#x27;s cheap, man it makes me happy that it&#x27;s not some fancy shmancy brand.</li>
            <li> I have really britle lashes and this mascara makes the long and makes them seperate perfect.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to contact them and they were very helpful</li>
            <li> but man, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not avalaible in stores anymore, but I&#x27;m glad that I find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending more on something like an eye shadow that really shows the pigment and quality, but I&#x27;m not a fan of overpriced mascaras, and this one rocks!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s unique about it is the comb tip instead of a brush which combs and separates your lashes while lifting and lengthening them.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so unique a product...</li>
            <li> The unique comb evenly coats, separates and lengthens and the formula is true to it&#x27;s waterproof claim.</li>
            <li> i use it on all my special occasions.</li>
            <li> Cool.  </li>
            <li> The item I ordered was delivered right on time &amp; was hassle free.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Last Stylish Comb waterproof mascara, Very Black is the best mascara out there</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> It was reasonable to pay $7.99 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It was worth $9+ shipping, but $18+ shipping?</li>
            <li> the comb wand alone makes it entirely worth it.</li>
            <li> but in that case it was worth the costly shipping fees.</li>
            <li> I am going to order 10 of these right now, because I read it is a discontinued product.</li>
            <li> When I first tryed this mascara i couldn&#x27;t believe it, Im</li>
            <li> I love the way it last forever</li>
            <li> I will check Amazon first.  </li>
            <li> Items in your cart will always reflect the most recent price displayed on their product detail pages.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> I read about all the reviews of this item before purchasing and because I love trying different mascaras I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore this I got a compliment from a coworker.</li>
            <li> Instead I&#x27;d love for all you to go to the Maybelline site and send a note asking for it back....</li>
            <li> Sure wish Maybelline would either reconsider or or quickly give some other manufacturer a shot at distributing this product.</li>
            <li> You definitely need a good makeup remover to properly get this all off</li>
            <li> I purchased these items but would really like to be able to buy them at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> I love the comb as it really gives the lashes length and, above al,l it does not leave any clumps on the tops of the lashes.</li>
            <li> I myself bought a whole bunch of these when I first heard its being discontinued.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to say that it changed my life, but that&#x27;s a little extreme, but my lashes look the best that they have in my whole life.</li>
            <li> This formula goes on easily, coats and covers every last lash.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, hard-to-curl lashes, and this neat little comb and mascara make my lashes full and pretty.  </li>
            <li> No big deal to them, but a huge ordeal for me.</li>
            <li> THANKS TO AMAZON.COM</li>
            <li> They always ask me if my eyelashes are real when i wear this mascara.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks  Dgirl1919</li>
            <li> But, since shipping was no longer free, I figured it all came out to about the same price.)</li>
            <li> I have spent nearly twice as much for mascara and didn&#x27;t receive these kind of results.</li>
            <li> Separates your lashes very well.  </li>
            <li> It also really is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my eyes sting like many other mascaras do &amp;</li>
            <li> I have used many different EXPENSIVE brands over the last 40 years, and by far this is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> The comb really does a better job than those brushes in other mascaras!</li>
            <li> The order came within two days and I finally felt like my face was complete --- long lashes --- blackest of black lashes --- perfectly styled --- waterproof, smudge-proof.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is very wet and black - it makes my lashes look great with one coat - two coats and they&#x27;re very glam.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t until I happened to type in the product on Amazon that I was surprised to find the exact Maybelline mascara I had been searching for.  </li>
            <li> Great waterproof mascara is hard to find, and this was a terrific one.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and it requires only one application - which is quick and saves alot of time in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have tried tons of mascaras this is by far the best out there although it is a little difficult to get off its worth it!  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned and wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a \\&quot;comb\\&quot; instead of a brush like normal mascara&#x27;s....</li>
            <li> It makes your eyelash look long and full.</li>
            <li> For fun I&#x27;m going to combine this with another mascara to experiment with different looks.</li>
            <li> But then I started thinking that six would not be an adequate lifetime supply, especially as I hesitated in opening that first pack which would knock me right down to five.    </li>
            <li> The product showed up when it was promised &amp; was in brand new shape/packaging as promised.</li>
            <li> a new message from Amazon.com ...    </li>
            <li> (One more mental note made public:  </li>
            <li> I love this product and am so sad that it is not longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not as dark and feels totally different, I made the mistake a few times getting different colors but only the waterproof one works the best.</li>
            <li> Maybelline should really think again as far as bringing the product back.....  </li>
            <li> This mascara really holds up the curl in a lash and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It comes off quite easy with baby oil or makeup remover, and never feels dry or stiff.    </li>
            <li> My eyes never looked so bright and one person at work asked me if my lashes were fake because of how long they were.  </li>
            <li> Nothing ever held a curl; my lashes would look short and straight before long.</li>
            <li> Lash Stylist is by far simple to use.  </li>
            <li> I will not waste my time in the future..  </li>
            <li> I absolutely refuse to buy any other mascara.</li>
            <li> When I first pulled out the little comb</li>
            <li> geeze a little much for maybeline....</li>
            <li> I like to wiggle it back and forth and deposit more at the base and let it thin out at the top, no lumps at the tips, no one wants that.</li>
            <li> &quot; - you know - some are really wet and make your lashes hang straight down in front of your eyes almost.  </li>
            <li> Being the selfish soul that I am, I ordered six tubes at $7.99 each ... with FREE Amazon Prime shipping.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long, but need to be tamed and this mascara does the job 100%.</li>
            <li> Wiggle it on your lashes and you will get compliments on your lashes all day long.</li>
            <li> I already have long curly lashes and with this on</li>
            <li> Only mascara that gives me length that stays and actually makes my eye lashes black.</li>
            <li> I tried it three different times, being ever so careful all three times, wiggling the brush gently to distribute the mascara carefully, and all three times came up with thick, globby, clumpy crack whore eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying it here as long as I can!  </li>
            <li> After several attempts contacting the company; they suggested other brands, but none worked as well.</li>
            <li> The trick to applying this is to not let it dry between coats by the way.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, as I have easily tried 20+ mascaras in the last year ranging in price from $4-$30+ each.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than very expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I tried several other types; spending alot of money, time and lots of frustration!</li>
            <li> Not too wet and not too dry.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara, which has unfortunately become hard to find.</li>
            <li> what else to use and have tried quite a few different products and brands and nothing comes close!</li>
            <li> which I never really understood until I got this, but it makes all your lashes group together.</li>
            <li> The only Lash Stylist mascara that I recommend is the Waterproof formula in Very Black.</li>
            <li> I spent at least 6 months looking for this product in every drug store, major retailer and online.  </li>
            <li> it looks like I have very long almost false, yet Naturally defined eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and like it, but due to the flaking issue, I have started searching for something else.  </li>
            <li> then any other mascara</li>
            <li> It is extremely unreasonable to watch the price rise</li>
            <li> Why did they take it off the market and what other brand is comparable?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find one I love :(</li>
            <li> The comb will look scary to anyone who has never used once before, but it paints the ink onto the lashes with so much power and precision that they look extremely dark and coated from root to tip.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate those clunky rubber/plastic brushes many companies use these days.</li>
            <li> and now I am lost because I can&#x27;t find any other mascara like this one!   </li>
            <li> It makes your lashes long and thick.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve paid this much for high end mascara that I hated.  </li>
            <li> The regular formula sucks, or at least I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dried up inside the tube.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s not available anymore</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Please note that the price of MAYBELLINE Lash Stylist Comb Waterproof Mascara, Very Black #611 has increased from $1.35 to $3.69 since you placed it in your Shopping Cart.</li>
            <li> but is anyone SERIOUSLY buying this stuff at the gauging prices these and other folks are selling it for?  </li>
            <li> I´m not big on expensive make up products</li>
            <li> , I have a hard time looking for over the counter mascara.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find, so</li>
            <li> I did, however, find it hard to believe that six tubes of mascara cost over 30 dollars to ship, but</li>
            <li> its hard to find now a days since they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> My lashes are thick, curled, and look longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lash Stylist for the past two years, and unfortunately I can no longer find the waterproof mascara at any stores.</li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO FIND....</li>
            <li> It was reasonable to pay $1.35 plus $6.39 shipping (although shipping charges per tube are insane).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> SORRY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that Maybelline has discontinued this item.  </li>
            <li> So I admit, I threw away the packaging and threw the tube in my purse as soon as I received the mascara in the mail, so if there were directions outside of the norm on there, maybe that would explain my awful experience with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> What am I doing wrong?  </li>
            <li> which was so frustrating considering its a beauty fav of mine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry</li>
            <li> Why is the water proof one so expensive $35</li>
            <li> It creates crazy \\&quot;spider eyes,\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> This mascara has been discontinued for 5 few years now &amp; still being sold with outrageous prices.</li>
            <li> So sad to learn it&#x27;s been discontinued!  </li>
            <li> They make my lashes like false ones,that&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t even buy fake lashes because I have this mascara!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s not sold in stores:</li>
            <li> IT  :(  </li>
            <li> :(    </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that this item has been pulled from the market.  </li>
            <li> Go here to voice your opinion: [...]</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this mascara!!! I was so upset when they discontinued it, I was so glad to see that Amazon carried it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT......MAKES YOUR LASHES LOOK GREAT!  SORRY MAYBELLINE DISCONTINUED IT  :(  VERY HARD TO FIND.... THANKS TO AMAZON.COM I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT..  IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, which has unfortunately become hard to find. I had a great experience being able to find it and purchase it on line. Prompt delivery and customer service.  I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I absolutely refuse to buy any other mascara. I&#x27;ve been using Lash Stylist for the past two years, and unfortunately I can no longer find the waterproof mascara at any stores. If your eyelashes are unruly and need to be tamed then this is the mascara. My eyelashes are long, but need to be tamed and this mascara does the job 100%. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife because she swears by it, and she knows her stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I love the lash stylist comb. So easy to put on and lashes look great.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, as I have easily tried 20+ mascaras in the last year ranging in price from $4-$30+ each. Nothing ever held a curl; my lashes would look short and straight before long. Then I found this fabulous mascara!! I want to say that it changed my life, but that&#x27;s a little extreme, but my lashes look the best that they have in my whole life. My lashes are thick, curled, and look longer. I see the price has doubled since I bought a month ago... interesting. I wish it was offered in stores so I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping. It was worth $9+ shipping, but $18+ shipping? Let&#x27;s be honest. This is MAYBELLINE, not a designer brand.</li>
            <li> Only mascara that gives me length that stays and actually makes my eye lashes black. Easy to put on. It&#x27;s my favorite and I wear it all the time. Also, it&#x27;s to the max waterproof, however, will come off with make-up remover. Love it.</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this mascara in stores and was tickled to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s my favorite because the comb separates and coats lashes fully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that Maybelline has discontinued this item.  This was by far the best mascara that I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s even better than very expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! I have really britle lashes and this mascara makes the long and makes them seperate perfect. When I first tryed this mascara i couldn&#x27;t believe it, Im so happy that i found this mascara i use it on all my special occasions. They make my lashes like false ones,that&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t even buy fake lashes because I have this mascara!!! Thanks Maybelline!!!</li>
            <li> There couldn&#x27;t possibly be a better mascara!  I hate that this product has been discontinued.  Lash Stylist is by far simple to use.  It&#x27;s a \\&quot;comb\\&quot; instead of a brush like normal mascara&#x27;s....After you dip the comb the mascara is on the comb.  So, basically, you take the comb and comb your lashes and they&#x27;re styled!  Great concept!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb separates and adds volume at the same time.  Maybelline should really think again as far as bringing the product back.....  I have no idea what else to use and have tried quite a few different products and brands and nothing comes close!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  Using a comb makes application and separation a breeze.  I simply cannot get the same results with a brush.  This formula goes on easily, coats and covers every last lash.  So sad to learn it&#x27;s been discontinued!  I&#x27;ll keep buying it here as long as I can!  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> So I admit, I threw away the packaging and threw the tube in my purse as soon as I received the mascara in the mail, so if there were directions outside of the norm on there, maybe that would explain my awful experience with this mascara.  I was thrilled when I read the reviews, but this mascara did NOT work for me.  I tried it three different times, being ever so careful all three times, wiggling the brush gently to distribute the mascara carefully, and all three times came up with thick, globby, clumpy crack whore eyelashes.  What am I doing wrong?  I would love the results everyone else is getting.  :(    I have been using CoverGirl Lash Blast for a year or so and like it, but due to the flaking issue, I have started searching for something else.  I&#x27;m back to Lash Blast for now, though.</li>
            <li> Why did they discontinue this product? Great waterproof mascara is hard to find, and this was a terrific one. The comb was fabulous, and it truly did make for impactful lashes. This is the only place I could find it....Hassle free transaction, quickly shipped!</li>
            <li> I prefer tubing mascaras, but when this was locally available in drugstores I loved buying &amp; using it. It didn&#x27;t make my eyes sting like many other mascaras do &amp; what I love best about it is the comb applicator - more mascara companies should incorporate a comb version into their line. I absolutely hate those clunky rubber/plastic brushes many companies use these days. It&#x27;s too bad Maybelline discontinued this mascara - the comb wand alone makes it entirely worth it. Washes off easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave panda-eye residue.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Last Stylish Comb waterproof mascara, Very Black is the best mascara out there and I am so upset that Maybelline has discontinued it! I had been using this mascara for years and now I am lost because I can&#x27;t find any other mascara like this one!   MAYBELLINE...bring this product back!!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome ! Too bad it&#x27;s not sold in stores:(. I love the way it last forever, I have a hard time looking for over the counter mascara. Haven&#x27;t found one that works like this one! It makes your eyelash look long and full. They always ask me if my eyelashes are real when i wear this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best there is.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find, so I hope Maybelline isn&#x27;t planning on doing away with it.  I have fine, hard-to-curl lashes, and this neat little comb and mascara make my lashes full and pretty.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I just bought this mascara because of the good ratings, and I really wondered, how this one would measure up to all the hype. It is ABSOLUTELY fantastic. The best mascara I ever had. Nothing globby. Each and every lash improved and visible, which gives a way fuller effect of lashes. I am going to order 10 of these right now, because I read it is a discontinued product. What a shame, because it is the best mascara I ever had. The comb really does a better job than those brushes in other mascaras! Both thumbs up for this one!</li>
            <li> This item was discontinued in local stores sometime ago which was so frustrating considering its a beauty fav of mine! I found it on Amazon &amp; was super excited! The item I ordered was delivered right on time &amp; was hassle free. Its so easy &amp; convenient! The product showed up when it was promised &amp; was in brand new shape/packaging as promised. I would definite order from this person/company again.  Thanks  Dgirl1919</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara Maybelline has ever made. I get more compliments from using this mascasra then any other mascara i have ever used.  It makes your lashes long and thick.  I wish Maybelline would please bring this mascara back, it&#x27;s the best they ever sold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how many compliments I receive for having beautiful, long eyelashes. Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stylist Comb Waterproof Mascara is the reason why. The unique comb evenly coats, separates and lengthens and the formula is true to it&#x27;s waterproof claim. Definitely holds up through sports, tears, weather and is great for people who wear contacts. Comes off easy with eye make-up remover. This mascara resembles a product that Max Faxtor sold years ago. It is upsetting to see such an exceptional, favorite mascara get discontinued. Sure wish Maybelline would either reconsider or or quickly give some other manufacturer a shot at distributing this product.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that this item has been pulled from the market.  It is my favorite mascara.  I love the comb and must have waterproof.</li>
            <li> I spent at least 6 months looking for this product in every drug store, major retailer and online.  it wasn&#x27;t until I happened to type in the product on Amazon that I was surprised to find the exact Maybelline mascara I had been searching for.  I will not waste my time in the future..  I will check Amazon first.  This is an amazing mascara.  I have used many different EXPENSIVE brands over the last 40 years, and by far this is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best mascara out there. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you Dior Show is the best cos it comes NOWHERE CLOSE to this. Wiggle it on your lashes and you will get compliments on your lashes all day long. It&#x27;s like wearing false lashes. You definitely need a good makeup remover to properly get this all off but man, it&#x27;s so worth it! It&#x27;s all in the comb, though, so if you run out, wash the brush and dip it in another mascara :) That&#x27;s what I do now!</li>
            <li> on time and as described</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for quite some time. Then it was discontinued. I tried several other types; spending alot of money, time and lots of frustration! Then I found it here. This mascara really holds up the curl in a lash and lasts a long time. It goes on easy, no clumping. The comb wand is fantastic at separating lashes.  After several attempts contacting the company; they suggested other brands, but none worked as well. No big deal to them, but a huge ordeal for me. I love playing up my eyes and I hope I can continue getting my favorite brand from you. Thank you.  Wink! Wink!</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of mascaras this is by far the best out there although it is a little difficult to get off its worth it!  Also, I have to mention the great help from the company...my local post office lost the package and reshipped it back to sender. It was very easy to contact them and they were very helpful they sent my package back to me at a different adress at no shipping cost to me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this mascara and was thrilled to find it still available through Amazon.     S O ...    Being the selfish soul that I am, I ordered six tubes at $7.99 each ... with FREE Amazon Prime shipping.  Wonderful.  The order came within two days and I finally felt like my face was complete --- long lashes --- blackest of black lashes --- perfectly styled --- waterproof, smudge-proof.  Simply perfect.    But then I started thinking that six would not be an adequate lifetime supply, especially as I hesitated in opening that first pack which would knock me right down to five.    S O ...     Back to Amazon.com I headed.      Cool.  Same merchant offered the mascara at the low price of only $1.35 each.  (Somehow I felt a bit ripped off, since I ordered the same mascara from the same merchant only six days prior.  But, since shipping was no longer free, I figured it all came out to about the same price.) (One more mental note made public:  I did, however, find it hard to believe that six tubes of mascara cost over 30 dollars to ship, but ... what can we do.)    S O ...    I saved it in my shopping cart and contemplated off and on all day over the issue.  I came back tonight to place the order ...    A N D ...     low and behold ... a new message from Amazon.com ...    \\&quot;Please note that the price of MAYBELLINE Lash Stylist Comb Waterproof Mascara, Very Black #611 has increased from $1.35 to $3.69 since you placed it in your Shopping Cart. Items in your cart will always reflect the most recent price displayed on their product detail pages.\\&quot;     Nice.    Note to seller:  Sometimes greed doesn&#x27;t pay.  I do love my product, I did love you ... but ... you bit the hand that fed you.      I&#x27;ll just hang around and wait till you come back to your senses.      *It was reasonable to pay $7.99 with free shipping.  *It was reasonable to pay $1.35 plus $6.39 shipping (although shipping charges per tube are insane).  *It is extremely unreasonable to watch the price rise by$2.34 from morning till night ... with the still-insane shipping charge of $6.39 per tube.    I&#x27;m still giving the product five stars ... because I&#x27;m rating the product.    Let&#x27;s just hope the seller comes to their senses so I can spread more of my hard-earned ever-vanishing cash their way again.</li>
            <li> I read about all the reviews of this item before purchasing and because I love trying different mascaras I decided to purchase this product. When I first pulled out the little comb I was a little concerned and wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to work. Wow, for a drugstore mascara this works great, and I must say I&#x27;m surprised and very impressed! The first day I wore this I got a compliment from a coworker. I have spent nearly twice as much for mascara and didn&#x27;t receive these kind of results. I already have long curly lashes and with this on it looks like I have very long almost false, yet Naturally defined eyelashes. For fun I&#x27;m going to combine this with another mascara to experiment with different looks.</li>
            <li> My wife couldn&#x27;t find this in the store anymore so she wanted 12 of them.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan.  It creates crazy \\&quot;spider eyes,\\&quot;  which I never really understood until I got this, but it makes all your lashes group together.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so sad that it is not longer available in stores.  I have used this product for over 15 years and now have not been able to adjust to using a macara with a brush applicator.  Glad I purchased these items but would really like to be able to buy them at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Mascara for years. Unfortunately it is not avalaible in stores anymore, but I&#x27;m glad that I find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I was searching the www  for this mascara with a comb instead of a brush as it is not possible to find it in the shops. I love the comb as it really gives the lashes length and, above al,l it does not leave any clumps on the tops of the lashes. You can - literately - comb them out. I´m not big on expensive make up products but in that case it was worth the costly shipping fees.</li>
            <li> This is the best Mascara Maybelline could ever ever had and I definitely recommend this product to all the ladies looking for it.</li>
            <li> i love this mascara but it has been discontinued so i ordered it here.  the stick is so good and it does not glop</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite mascara , and it&#x27;s cheap, man it makes me happy that it&#x27;s not some fancy shmancy brand. I don&#x27;t mind spending more on something like an eye shadow that really shows the pigment and quality, but I&#x27;m not a fan of overpriced mascaras, and this one rocks! The comb will look scary to anyone who has never used once before, but it paints the ink onto the lashes with so much power and precision that they look extremely dark and coated from root to tip. I like to wiggle it back and forth and deposit more at the base and let it thin out at the top, no lumps at the tips, no one wants that. I also pinch the tops of the lashes with my fingers if theres any clumps.     The only Lash Stylist mascara that I recommend is the Waterproof formula in Very Black. The regular formula sucks, or at least I don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not as dark and feels totally different, I made the mistake a few times getting different colors but only the waterproof one works the best. It comes off quite easy with baby oil or makeup remover, and never feels dry or stiff.    - Kasia S.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.  Thank goodness I found it on Amazon to keep me fully stocked!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Mascara for years and then they took it off the market; why?  The is the best long-wearing mascara that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on evenly and it requires only one application - which is quick and saves alot of time in the morning.  Why did they take it off the market and what other brand is comparable?</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  What&#x27;s unique about it is the comb tip instead of a brush which combs and separates your lashes while lifting and lengthening them.  My eyes never looked so bright and one person at work asked me if my lashes were fake because of how long they were.  I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  The comb applicator is great. Separates your lashes very well.  It&#x27;s not too \\&quot;wet\\&quot; - you know - some are really wet and make your lashes hang straight down in front of your eyes almost.  This is the perfect formula.  Not too wet and not too dry.  I used a mascara years ago that had a comb applicator, it may have been this one, and I loved it.  Makes it easy to get close to your lashline and in the corners.  Try that with the huge brushes everybody has now and you may poke your own eye out!  Wish they&#x27;d start making it again. Try it - you&#x27;ll love it.  (:</li>
            <li> This mascara has been discontinued for 5 few years now &amp; still being sold with outrageous prices. I saw one thats priced for $70+.  I know the product is sealed but what is the guarantee that the formula is still good inside, considering its 5 years old in the tube. It&#x27;s dried up inside the tube. I myself bought a whole bunch of these when I first heard its being discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish all the ladies like me who loves this mascara would all go to Maybelline website &amp; request them to bring this mascara back in the market. There is strength in numbers girls, lets all do it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry Maybelline stopped making this but glad it&#x27;s still available here. I don&#x27;t even mind paying much more than the original price - I&#x27;ve paid this much for high end mascara that I hated.  This mascara is very wet and black - it makes my lashes look great with one coat - two coats and they&#x27;re very glam.  This is also the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever used that keep my lashes curled all day.  It also really is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge whatsoever.  The trick to applying this is to not let it dry between coats by the way.</li>
            <li> Love the product and I miss it.,however I bought it for about 5.00  not thisINSANE  price! Don&#x27;t pay this price</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I used for for years.  Then I started noticing that I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so easily.  I went from store to store.  Finally I found it at Walgreens and I bought them all!  lol.  Now they are no where to be found in the Upstate of SC.  Boo Hoo.</li>
            <li> Maybelline please bring these back to stores this was my favorite now I can&#x27;t find one I love :(</li>
            <li> Why is the water proof one so expensive $35 geeze a little much for maybeline.... I loved this mascara but it got discontinued for some reason, but can&#x27;t see paying that price for it when I use to buy it for $5 or $6..</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. its hard to find now a days since they discontinued it. but glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s not available anymore and I did LOVE it...but is anyone SERIOUSLY buying this stuff at the gauging prices these and other folks are selling it for?  Sorry...not me!    Instead I&#x27;d love for all you to go to the Maybelline site and send a note asking for it back....it&#x27;s so unique a product...I can&#x27;t believe they got rid of it!    Go here to voice your opinion: [...]</li>
            <li> I wish this mascara hadn&#x27;t been discontinued.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
