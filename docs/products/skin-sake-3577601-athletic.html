    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The product itself is great!!!</li>
            <li>I am a cyclist and out of all the chafing products I have used, Skin Sake is the best.  </li>
            <li>Best bang for the buck as well.  </li>
            <li>Best chamois cream I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>As a marathon runner in South Florida, this is my best friend!!</li>
            <li>this is the best anti-chafing product out there.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this at the AZ Lake Havasu 1/2 and it worked great</li>
            <li>Works great though.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>However, when it warmed up on the skin, spread out nicely.  </li>
            <li>Rubs on very easily.</li>
            <li>We have been pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is better than glide.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite running products.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes a HUGE difference for me when I walk--no more blisters between my toes.  :-)  </li>
            <li>Worth far more than I paid!!!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really that good.</li>
            <li>It comes in a deodorant style tube and applies quite easily.  </li>
            <li>works great started with free samples and started having rashes went back to skin sake and rashes</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and did the job.</li>
            <li>I have used it during 24 hour races in hot weather and never had to reapply at all!  </li>
            <li>Bonus is I was experimenting with nipple guard options and struggling to find the right solution</li>
            <li>I also used it in a pinch to lube my feet during that race, not as good as my regular foot lube (however, my socks were soaking wet and full of sand, I was asking a lot), but it worked fine.</li>
            <li>This does not work any better than your standard diaper cream.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I have been using Glide for Her, but I found that when I was on a long run my sweaty tank top would still rub me and I was in search of a product that could go the distance...literally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sort of a think white paste but applies easily, and cleans up with no problem.  </li>
            <li>It is great although it is very thick until you rub it in.</li>
            <li>I got this product because it was so much cheaper than the one I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This bottle lasts for many rides as not much has to be applied.  </li>
            <li>For day to day use, I much prefer Glide.  </li>
            <li>I just slather it on my whole torso before getting dressed</li>
            <li>One tube is very long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try a different kind of chamois cream.</li>
            <li>and I live in a hot and humid state.  </li>
            <li>For intense walking, this outperforms and so is worth the initial application effort.</li>
            <li>Many other sites have it for $1 less and free shipping and no tax.</li>
            <li>It is thick and there is some transfer to your bike shorts, but it is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>I heard this brand mentioned regularly on Zen and the Art of Triathlon podcast and thought the price was right</li>
            <li>Many worked fine, but for longer runs and races, reapplication was difficult under sweaty conditions.  </li>
            <li>The Glide stick was super easy to apply, but pointless if it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in my last two marathons and one of those it was pouring rain the whole time.</li>
            <li>Its more of a thick paste that you rub on.</li>
            <li>We purchased this to use on the area newly healed following a brown recluse spider bite on my husband&#x27;s leg at the advice of the doctor.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a bit of an effort to squeeze it out of the tube, it&#x27;s thick like diaper rash cream, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I recently used it in a multi-day event and went as long as 28 hours without reapplication and it still worked.  </li>
            <li> It really helped but hard to get out of tube</li>
            <li> As a cycling enthusiast I needed a product that would prevent chafing on long rides and this product delivers.  </li>
            <li> This item was recommended by a running buddy of mine to help with the long run chaffing issues that were making me miserable...and I am amazed at how this Skin Sake has made those issues disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried using bandages and other creams, but Skin Sake is the only thing that works 100% of the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested Skin Sake under extreme conditions and it&#x27;s the only one I use now.</li>
            <li> No weird smells; thick and long-lasting; doesn&#x27;t stain, but is a thick white cream that takes a while to rub in and can get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Once I finally got some squeezed out, it was extremely thick, almost solid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other chamois cream before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of products in the search for bra (and other) chafe and rash prevention.  </li>
            <li> - a little Skin Sake has made this problem go away</li>
            <li> Only tough thing is that it&#x27;s really thick and hard to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> The stuff is so thick it reminds me of trying to pour molasses in winter.  </li>
            <li> No more friction rub!</li>
            <li> If you have weak hands, don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li> you struggle with any chaffing, you cant go wrong with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I had horrible chafing from my sports bra.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works great started with free samples and started having rashes went back to skin sake and rashes went away would recommend.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at the AZ Lake Havasu 1/2 and it worked great so I ordered a bottle.  I&#x27;m a runner and it prevents chafing.  5 star product!</li>
            <li> I got this product because it was so much cheaper than the one I was looking for. It is great although it is very thick until you rub it in. Works great though.</li>
            <li> This does not work any better than your standard diaper cream.  I find that Desitin is basically the same product.  Even then, I prefer A+D Ointment.</li>
            <li> As a cycling enthusiast I needed a product that would prevent chafing on long rides and this product delivers.  I have used this product for 2 years and am on my second tube.  I see no reason to try anything else.</li>
            <li> I was always getting blisters in the same places, but I started using this before my runs and now I never get them. This stuff is really that good. I also use it under the band of my sports bra to prevent chafing. I&#x27;ve used it in my last two marathons and one of those it was pouring rain the whole time. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> We purchased this to use on the area newly healed following a brown recluse spider bite on my husband&#x27;s leg at the advice of the doctor.  Worked well.We have been pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all after about 5 minutes and caused quite a rash. Its more of a thick paste that you rub on. I used gold Bond powder the rest of the week and had no issues at all.</li>
            <li> Since Amazon started charging tax in Florida, I won&#x27;t use them for products like this. Many other sites have it for $1 less and free shipping and no tax. The product itself is great!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Glide for Her, but I found that when I was on a long run my sweaty tank top would still rub me and I was in search of a product that could go the distance...literally. I heard this brand mentioned regularly on Zen and the Art of Triathlon podcast and thought the price was right so I would give it a try. Worth far more than I paid!!!  I read reviews before I purchased about difficulty rubbing it in or getting it out of the tube...I haven&#x27;t had any of those issues. Rubs on very easily. The Glide stick was super easy to apply, but pointless if it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I am a triathlete and I&#x27;ve been trying several products but not anymore! Skin Sake sticks in your skin from the swimming thru the end of the running.</li>
            <li> I am a cyclist and out of all the chafing products I have used, Skin Sake is the best.  This bottle lasts for many rides as not much has to be applied.  Best bang for the buck as well.  What are you waiting for</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than glide.  It is the only product that will stop me from getting rubbed on my back from my sports bra.  One of my favorite running products.</li>
            <li> Best chamois cream I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I had horrible chafing from my sports bra.  I tried using bandages and other creams, but Skin Sake is the only thing that works 100% of the time.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and did the job. No weird smells; thick and long-lasting; doesn&#x27;t stain, but is a thick white cream that takes a while to rub in and can get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes a HUGE difference for me when I walk--no more blisters between my toes.  :-)  Only tough thing is that it&#x27;s really thick and hard to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Simply getting the stuff out of the bottle was a CHORE.  The stuff is so thick it reminds me of trying to pour molasses in winter.  If you have weak hands, don&#x27;t bother.  Once I finally got some squeezed out, it was extremely thick, almost solid.  Spreading it on tender skin was a royal pain.  However, when it warmed up on the skin, spread out nicely.  Worked for about 5 hours to keep the skin from chafing. For day to day use, I much prefer Glide.  It comes in a deodorant style tube and applies quite easily.  For intense walking, this outperforms and so is worth the initial application effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other chamois cream before but once I tried Skin Sake I won&#x27;t go back.  Even after a 4 hour ride you don&#x27;t feel like you need to reapply.  You also don&#x27;t have to use as much initially so the tube lasts longer.  I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try a different kind of chamois cream.</li>
            <li> As a runner, after using skin sake, I will not use anything else! No more friction rub! Do not hesitate to try this stuff out, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> As a marathon runner in South Florida, this is my best friend!! Traded in my body glide 3 years ago for skin sake. Will never go back- this is the best anti-chafing product out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Heals and protects.</li>
            <li> It really helped but hard to get out of tube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ultra distance runner and I live in a hot and humid state.  I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of products in the search for bra (and other) chafe and rash prevention.  Many worked fine, but for longer runs and races, reapplication was difficult under sweaty conditions.  I&#x27;ve tested Skin Sake under extreme conditions and it&#x27;s the only one I use now. I have used it during 24 hour races in hot weather and never had to reapply at all!  I had zero chafing.  I recently used it in a multi-day event and went as long as 28 hours without reapplication and it still worked.  It kept my hydration vest from rubbing as well.  I also used it in a pinch to lube my feet during that race, not as good as my regular foot lube (however, my socks were soaking wet and full of sand, I was asking a lot), but it worked fine. I will say, for me it&#x27;s a bit of an effort to squeeze it out of the tube, it&#x27;s thick like diaper rash cream, but it is well worth it.  I just slather it on my whole torso before getting dressed and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it again.</li>
            <li> If you need to treat or prevent saddle sores, this is the product for you.  It is thick and there is some transfer to your bike shorts, but it is extremely effective.  One tube is very long-lasting.  I would imagine it would work well for any friction or moisture issues.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by a running buddy of mine to help with the long run chaffing issues that were making me miserable...and I am amazed at how this Skin Sake has made those issues disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sort of a think white paste but applies easily, and cleans up with no problem.  Bonus is I was experimenting with nipple guard options and struggling to find the right solution - a little Skin Sake has made this problem go away also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you struggle with any chaffing, you cant go wrong with this stuff.  Fantastic.</li>
