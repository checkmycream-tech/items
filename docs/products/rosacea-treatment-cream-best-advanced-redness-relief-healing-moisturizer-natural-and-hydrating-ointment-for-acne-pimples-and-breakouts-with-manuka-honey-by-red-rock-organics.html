            <li>What is also nice is you donâ€™t need a lot of this product.</li>
            <li>I got this as part of a promotional price in exchange for my opinion and honest review.</li>
            <li>It would also be nice to see this come in a tube so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating the jar before &amp; after dipping/ each application.</li>
            <li>It is really the BEST.</li>
            <li>Cream is smooth and feels good applying.  </li>
            <li>More acne and redness than ever.</li>
            <li>Rosacea is getting some better.  </li>
            <li>more tip:</li>
            <li>I used this cream and love it.</li>
            <li>I was  diagnosed with rosacea many years ago and still looking for a otc product to assist in relieving the signs and symptoms.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>healthy skin cells &#x3D; healthy skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s drastically helped my rosacea get better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the redness &amp; dryness</li>
            <li>and I will say that I am oh so pleased with how things are working out.</li>
            <li>Highly pleased and would purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this great cream.</li>
            <li>When I first got the cream I could not believe how great mine smelled, I was excited to use it, whether it helped or not.</li>
            <li>But now I have something that really works!!!  :-)  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural healthy pH balance of 5.5!!</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the first product that worked for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice smell that is not too strong which makes it very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for the two main ingredients posted: Organic Manuka Honey and Aloe Vera, as I am aware that they have great healing properties and can help with hyperpigmentation and melasma as well.</li>
            <li>But no, this product really is that amazing.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as light, it&#x27;s a heavier feeling cream, but I need that protection</li>
            <li>When I came across Red Rocks Organics Rosacea Cream at an extremely great price I thought that maybe it would help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my face and chest and am happy to say I am finally seeing results and feeling like myself.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I finally found something that works for them.</li>
            <li>I have only used for a week, but it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>2) scent-free, which is probably good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Looking at my face when I wake up, after using it with the red rock cleanser and a toner each night, has become my favorite part of the day instead of my most dreaded!  </li>
            <li>I read all the glowing reviews, so I was excited to receive the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>My husband was so happy with the results that he has started using it on his dry, cracked heels and has noticed an improvement there as well</li>
            <li>Until Now... All three of them are very excited that I received this product in exchange for my honest review because they finally have relief.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find good honest lotions.</li>
            <li>The texture is lovely, ideal for under make-up and the size of the pot is bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>The formula is thick and rich and really hydrates the skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>Red Rock Organics Rosacea Cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind (as I have to keep reminding myself) that natural, organic products take more time to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which brings me to the next point:  4) spectacular customer service.  </li>
            <li>This cream has provided amazing moisture on my super dry areas (feet, hands, elbows).</li>
            <li>This Rosacea cream soothes, nourishes and protects your skin by rebuilding at a cellular level deep below the outer layer of facial redness and this Rosacea cream is non-allergenic, gluten free, fragrance free, paraben free and alcohol free</li>
            <li>I work in the medical field and we do use honey based wound care products and I am so glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have bought this cream</li>
            <li>and I expect it will only get better with each additional use.</li>
            <li>Wash your face with an antibacterial soap first</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I have used it on more than the red patches, since my elbows take a bit of a beating in the winter months.</li>
            <li>This formula is full of all the trace minerals; vitamins and nutrients that are needed to repair your ravaged red skin back to its natural healthy look &amp; feel!!</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Red Rock cream is not sticky, it&#x27;s smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this product works and feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This has worked really well.</li>
            <li>This rehydrates my skin so much.</li>
            <li>Compared, Red Rock organics is a cream that:  1) goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and does not cause the skin to shine, which often is a problem with creams based on coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this</li>
            <li>As someone that is always on the search for products that will help with my skin issues I was excited to receive this Red Rock Organics Rosacea Cream in the mail!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try something that was natural in ingredients and this fitted the bill exactly.</li>
            <li>In no time I received an answer explaining, that this kind of TD  is not \\&quot;nano\\&quot; but \\&quot;simply the color white and is a natural sun protector \\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive Irish, rosacea prone skin, and suffer from a very rare vascular disease.</li>
            <li>; promise products haven&#x27;t worked, then I highly suggest that you give this a chance.</li>
            <li>This Rosacea treatment cream is a 100% natural 85% organic Rosacea cream that gently returns your skin to</li>
            <li>However, after a few weeks of using this, I have to say I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This works great as a mask or as an overnight moisturizing mask, using a very thin layer.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are 100% natural and 85% organic and they are high quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great value, unfortunately shipping costs are very high for me as I live in Italy, but the pot is so big</li>
            <li>I am now just about finished with the first tub I bought and just ordered my second.</li>
            <li>Overall it works much better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I still get small breakouts but things are going much better since using this cream.</li>
            <li>I can finally leave the house without makeup and not look like I have a face full of red inflamed blotches everywhere!!  </li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;It also works well on all types of skin issues and it not harsh on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream did not soothe my skin - I have sensitive / rosacea type skin.  </li>
            <li>This penetrates the skin and makes it so soft</li>
            <li>WOW is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Good product I suppose, but smells weird.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this is I donâ€™t have to use a lot, there are a lot of creams out there that you have to slather on but this cream a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have used this cream consistently once to twice a day over a month&#x27;s time, and noticed a minimal change in my rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I only gave this product 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel that I have used it long enough to see the full effects.</li>
            <li>also works really well for dry skin too, which is always a problem during the winter months.</li>
            <li>ok, my only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t sealed, and that worried me.  </li>
            <li>The redness had calmed down a tremendous amount and the ever constant bumps along my chin line were gone.</li>
            <li>B00V5H8CI4 Red Rosacea Treatment Cream 100% Natural / Organic Ingredients - Manuka Honey - Aloe Vera - Redness Face Cream for Skin - Works</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and toned, and my pores also look smaller.</li>
            <li>my skin just has been totally neglected and so far this cream is working wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I have only been using the product for a week so far and can tell a big difference already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still skeptical about it not being sealed, and I do use other products on my face that could be responsible for my face&#x27;s improvement, however, I certainly have had no bad reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li>Due to the medication that I have to take on a monthly basis, and my regular chemotherapy, my skin has become very sensitive and reacts to everything.</li>
            <li>This product is free of all those harsh chemicals you sometimes find in other products!!</li>

            <li> What I like most about this is I donâ€™t have to use a lot, there are a lot of creams out there that you have to slather on but this cream a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream consistently once to twice a day over a month&#x27;s time, and noticed a minimal change in my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I only gave this product 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel that I have used it long enough to see the full effects.</li>
            <li> also works really well for dry skin too, which is always a problem during the winter months.</li>
            <li> ok, my only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t sealed, and that worried me.  </li>
            <li> The redness had calmed down a tremendous amount and the ever constant bumps along my chin line were gone.</li>
            <li> B00V5H8CI4 Red Rosacea Treatment Cream 100% Natural / Organic Ingredients - Manuka Honey - Aloe Vera - Redness Face Cream for Skin - Works</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and toned, and my pores also look smaller.</li>
            <li> my skin just has been totally neglected and so far this cream is working wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a week so far and can tell a big difference already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still skeptical about it not being sealed, and I do use other products on my face that could be responsible for my face&#x27;s improvement, however, I certainly have had no bad reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li> Due to the medication that I have to take on a monthly basis, and my regular chemotherapy, my skin has become very sensitive and reacts to everything.</li>
            <li> This product is free of all those harsh chemicals you sometimes find in other products!!</li>
            <li> So when I got pregnant a few years ago I got an odd rash on my leg and the doctors just told me it was a skin blemish.</li>
            <li> A little product really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> For other customers out there; I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t have rosacea.</li>

            <li> I get very dry skin with red patches.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product as I have tried many different over the counter and prescription treatments for rosacea with little improvement.</li>
            <li> My neighbour gave me this cream,  as I was badly sunburned, it was amazing how it took away the heat and the pain..</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I feel this product and people behind it deserve it.  </li>
            <li> The product also claims to reduce skin damage, and while some of my spots have lightened, I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference from any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When you use this product you are bond to not be disappointed this product does an amazing job at relieving inflamed, red, dry, cracking, itchy, irritated skin whether it be rosacea, psoriasis, eczema etc.!!</li>
            <li> My face is not scaling dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> so my face doesn&#x27;t start peeling from being so dry.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt feel like dry skin or a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> but I still wake up in the morning with really dry skin in the areas where the rashes used to be.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin along with some patches of redness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, immediately after I started using this product, I could see at least a 50% reduction in redness by the next day, and now it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid of the redness or small bumps completely, but it did help.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few days</li>
            <li> All of these obstacles have made me very self-conscious and uncomfortable to even look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have not been able to find anything that will help relieve the itching and annoying rash like dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and both of my children suffer from extreme eczema</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As someone that is always on the search for products that will help with my skin issues I was excited to receive this Red Rock Organics Rosacea Cream in the mail!! After trying out this cream for myself I really liked the cream and loved the way it made my skin look and feel after using it!! This Rosacea treatment cream is a 100% natural 85% organic Rosacea cream that gently returns your skin to it&#x27;s natural healthy pH balance of 5.5!! This formula is full of all the trace minerals; vitamins and nutrients that are needed to repair your ravaged red skin back to its natural healthy look &amp; feel!! This Rosacea cream soothes, nourishes and protects your skin by rebuilding at a cellular level deep below the outer layer of facial redness and this Rosacea cream is non-allergenic, gluten free, fragrance free, paraben free and alcohol free which is great to have it a product as all natural products are the best products available!! This product is free of all those harsh chemicals you sometimes find in other products!! This product is also not tested on animals!! When you use this product you are bond to not be disappointed this product does an amazing job at relieving inflamed, red, dry, cracking, itchy, irritated skin whether it be rosacea, psoriasis, eczema etc.!! I definitely recommend this Red Rock Organics Rosacea cream to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream consistently once to twice a day over a month&#x27;s time, and noticed a minimal change in my rosacea.  My skin is still red, but the pimples disappeared.  I&#x27;m having a horrible time with dry flaky skin in addition to the redness of rosacea, and this helped in a small way.</li>
            <li> My face has only recently gotten worse. More acne and redness than ever. Tried literally everything so I was skeptical about this, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It looked like all the people who gave it raving reviews were paid for them! :P But no, this product really is that amazing. The best way to describe the texture is a gel/cream combination, and it feels great going on and you will notice a difference. If you&#x27;re worried about the cost, don&#x27;t be. A little product really does go a long way. I also use this as a primer under my make up and it works very well. Never greasy feeling and my make up stays in place.</li>
            <li> My neighbour gave me this cream,  as I was badly sunburned, it was amazing how it took away the heat and the pain..</li>
            <li> have used almost 1/2 of jar.  Rosacea is getting some better.  I was told it would take awhile and it does to get rid of it.  hoping by end of the jar it will be gone.  Cream is smooth and feels good applying.  cons.. communication..  I called the company to ask ?&#x27;s about their products  I got voice mail... left another message so after 2 weeks trying to get in contact they finally returned my call.  Then my ?&#x27;s were answered. For this reason I give it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I think it has good quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product as I have tried many different over the counter and prescription treatments for rosacea with little improvement. Within a couple of days of use, my skin was noticeably better! The redness had calmed down a tremendous amount and the ever constant bumps along my chin line were gone. I am now just about finished with the first tub I bought and just ordered my second. I am a customer for life! I work in the medical field and we do use honey based wound care products and I am so glad I tried this product. I now have an even complexion with no redness and no further bumps.</li>
            <li> ok, my only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t sealed, and that worried me.  However, after a few weeks of using this, I have to say I LOVE IT. My face is not scaling dry anymore.  It didn&#x27;t get rid of the redness or small bumps completely, but it did help.  I put it on after I come home from work and wash my face.  Then in the morning I wash my face and put on my day cream.  Today I tried a different cream, (Ultimate Aloe) and my cheeks started burning and turned red.  I washed it off thoroughly and couldn&#x27;t wait to put red rock on.  Red Rock cream is not sticky, it&#x27;s smooth.  I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as light, it&#x27;s a heavier feeling cream, but I need that protection so my face doesn&#x27;t start peeling from being so dry.  I&#x27;m still skeptical about it not being sealed, and I do use other products on my face that could be responsible for my face&#x27;s improvement, however, I certainly have had no bad reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li> Exelent product, it works great for my skin</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I have only been using the product for a week so far and can tell a big difference already.</li>
            <li> I have heard that this is supposed to be great for rosacea. Its a definite plus that it is organic too.&lt;br /&gt;It also works well on all types of skin issues and it not harsh on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell that is not too strong which makes it very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this on myself and the kids and it really is a great cream to have in my household.&lt;br /&gt;It also works really well for dry skin too, which is always a problem during the winter months. What is also nice is you donâ€™t need a lot of this product. Just a small amount seems to go a long way. With summer coming soon I think I am going to keep this product around since it is also supposed to be good for sunburns. I really like the way this product works and feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have bought this cream and I was very impressed with the quick service. I have only been using the product for a few days and I&#x27;m hopeful that it will make a difference to my Rosacea. I really wanted to try something that was natural in ingredients and this fitted the bill exactly. The texture is lovely, ideal for under make-up and the size of the pot is bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Please never stop selling this...I&#x27;ve only been using a week and I will definitely be a lifetime customer as long as I can find it.  This is the only cream I have tried that has actually helped with the dryness and redness of my Rosacea.  I can finally leave the house without makeup and not look like I have a face full of red inflamed blotches everywhere!!  Already changed my life and I expect it will only get better with each additional use. Looking at my face when I wake up, after using it with the red rock cleanser and a toner each night, has become my favorite part of the day instead of my most dreaded!  Thank you for selling this!!!!</li>
            <li> Red Rock Organics has done it again! I am wowed by this rosacea cream. The ingredients are 100% natural and 85% organic and they are high quality. The manuka honey and aloe are working wonders on the eczema i have on my hands. This cream has provided amazing moisture on my super dry areas (feet, hands, elbows). The formula is thick and rich and really hydrates the skin perfectly. It wasnt at all greasy and felt great when rubbed in. The cream is exceptional. This is the second cream I have tried and I will definitely continue to buy from this brand. I am happy to recieve this wonderful cream to review. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for the two main ingredients posted: Organic Manuka Honey and Aloe Vera, as I am aware that they have great healing properties and can help with hyperpigmentation and melasma as well. I have very sensitive Irish, rosacea prone skin, and suffer from a very rare vascular disease. Due to the medication that I have to take on a monthly basis, and my regular chemotherapy, my skin has become very sensitive and reacts to everything. For example, although I wear sunblock, a hat and/or an umbrella outside, I still get dark spots. My skin also becomes very dry, flaky and red during extreme weather changes, which is frustrating. All of these obstacles have made me very self-conscious and uncomfortable to even look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, immediately after I started using this product, I could see at least a 50% reduction in redness by the next day, and now it&#x27;s nearly gone. After at least a week, I no longer have dry and flaky skin and wake up up with a glow to my skin. I only gave this product 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel that I have used it long enough to see the full effects. The product also claims to reduce skin damage, and while some of my spots have lightened, I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference from any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I know that it can take awhile, though, and so I will report back when it&#x27;s been 12 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have issues with Rosacea and haven&#x27;t found that prescribed products or other, expensive &amp;#34;rosacea cure&amp;#34; promise products haven&#x27;t worked, then I highly suggest that you give this a chance. Just keep in mind (as I have to keep reminding myself) that natural, organic products take more time to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tip: This works great as a mask or as an overnight moisturizing mask, using a very thin layer. Give it a try! Even if it&#x27;s not &#x27;perfect,&#x27; I promise you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> My mother suffers from rosacea and I bought this for her. When i was in FL the humidity caused my skin to react. I used this cream and love it.</li>
            <li> This cream did not soothe my skin - I have sensitive / rosacea type skin.  Unfortunately this cream made my skin feel dry and burning with increased redness.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well. Applies very nice and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. I recommend</li>
            <li> So when I got pregnant a few years ago I got an odd rash on my leg and the doctors just told me it was a skin blemish. Well here it is almost 3 years later and its still there. It itches and burns, I hate it. When I came across Red Rocks Organics Rosacea Cream at an extremely great price I thought that maybe it would help. When I first got the cream I could not believe how great mine smelled, I was excited to use it, whether it helped or not. Well I am glad to inform you that this cream is amazing! No it didnâ€™t get rid of my mystery spot but the redness and itchiness is gone and the spot has started to diminish. I am so glad I found this cream!! I can wear shorts again!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I read all the glowing reviews, so I was excited to receive the product.  I was  diagnosed with rosacea many years ago and still looking for a otc product to assist in relieving the signs and symptoms.  The cream burned immediately after I applied it.....and made my complexion worse.  By the next day I had a rash.</li>
            <li> LOVIN IT! I got this as part of a promotional price in exchange for my opinion and honest review. This rehydrates my skin so much. I get very dry skin with red patches. This penetrates the skin and makes it so soft and you know touchable. Doesnt feel like dry skin or a brillo pad. I just love it. The smell of it is really pleasant and my skin feels awesome. I will be using this for a long time. It is hard to find good honest lotions.</li>
            <li> Good product I suppose, but smells weird. If smells bother you, look elsewhere. Otherwise it does seem to help red areas.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has bad skin on his back.  But after using this cream for about a week, you can definitely see a difference.  I wish I took before and after pictures. I got this product at a great price and I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This cream is formulated to a 5.5 pH which is skin pH.  Rosacea can start due to something out in a person&#x27;s diet and also made worse because of facial creams and soaps that are too alkaline for the skin. I&#x27;ve used this on my face and chest and am happy to say I am finally seeing results and feeling like myself. This Rosacea cream restores the skin to its proper pH 5.5 and nourishes the skin deep below the surface with food grade nutrients that the skin is screaming for.  When the skin cells get what they need, they heal themselves.  healthy skin cells &#x3D; healthy skin.</li>
            <li> U only apply it to my nose and chin for two weeks now. I have break out on my chin. I stop using it on my chin.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great! It&#x27;s drastically helped my rosacea get better but I still wake up in the morning with really dry skin in the areas where the rashes used to be. It&#x27;s better than the redness &amp; dryness I used to have throughout the day though! It would also be nice to see this come in a tube so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating the jar before &amp; after dipping/ each application. Overall it works much better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I just bought another jar of the Red Rock Red Rosacea Treatment Cream. It is really the BEST. Not only did it immediately sooth my under arm and crotch it[[ASIN:B00V5H8CI4 Red Rosacea Treatment Cream 100% Natural / Organic Ingredients - Manuka Honey - Aloe Vera - Redness Face Cream for Skin - Works Under Make-up - Helps Eczema Too - Satisfaction Guaranteed]]ch but over a week or so of applying haphazardly my skin tags in my underarms reduced and eventually went away. WOW is all I can say. I HIGHLY recommend this great cream.</li>
            <li> OMG this product is AMAZING! My rosacea went into 95% remission in less than 3 days! And it&#x27;s almost gone! Wash your face with an antibacterial soap first (I used Cetaphil) then use this product. Do it twice a day. And watch the rosacea disappear! I have wasted so much money on other products before finding this cream :-(  But now I have something that really works!!!  :-)  I love this product so much! You definitely have a customer for life! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Red Rock Organics Rosacea Cream is amazing. My husband and both of my children suffer from extreme eczema and I have not been able to find anything that will help relieve the itching and annoying rash like dry skin. Until Now... All three of them are very excited that I received this product in exchange for my honest review because they finally have relief. They have all been using it for a week now and all 3 have seem a dramatic change in the appearance and itchiness of their skin. I am so happy that I finally found something that works for them. My husband was so happy with the results that he has started using it on his dry, cracked heels and has noticed an improvement there as well and it has only been 2 days. I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> After three days this product has drastically helped my skin. I have Rosacea redness on my nose and cheeks and bumps, and also some dark discoloration from pimples. The bumps are almost gone, the redness is toned down, and the discoloration is much less. My skin feels soft and toned, and my pores also look smaller. The smell is not the best, but the product is worth it!</li>
            <li> I have only used for a week, but it feels great on my skin. I look forward to help reducing redness in my skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I feel this product and people behind it deserve it.  For other customers out there; I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t have rosacea. I do have some broken capillaries/blotchiness. I am one of the growing number of people that would rather not put on the skin anything that they cannot pronounce, and I like going sans make up. I used coconut oil based creams (Tropical Traditions) as well as vitamin K based formulations (VitaK).  Compared, Red Rock organics is a cream that:  1) goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and does not cause the skin to shine, which often is a problem with creams based on coconut oil.  2) scent-free, which is probably good for sensitive skin.  3) quality ingredients. I had doubts about Titanium Dioxide. In no time I received an answer explaining, that this kind of TD  is not \\&quot;nano\\&quot; but \\&quot;simply the color white and is a natural sun protector \\&quot;. Which brings me to the next point:  4) spectacular customer service.  Why 4 stars then? The main reason behind my purchase was to get help with my capillaries and uneven skin color. Vita K did the job in the past, but, not having a background in chemistry, I could not figure out what I was actually putting on my skin. So I switched.  Regretfully, after a month of faithful, twice a day application of Red Rock Rosacea Cream, my skin did not respond.  The makers of the cream may consider adding vitamin K to the formulation, which I think would benefit the product. In this case, I would be back to give it another try.</li>
            <li> I have had this cream a couple of days now and I will say that I am oh so pleased with how things are working out. I have dry skin along with some patches of redness. Not sure if it is totally 100% rosacea but my dermatologist is out of town and I wasnâ€™t trying to wait until he returned. I got this at a promotional price and figured what is the worst that can happen, it doesnâ€™t work? I am happy to say that is not the case. Whether it is or isnâ€™t rosacea I found that the patches are a lot smaller than they were and my skin is softer. I have used it on more than the red patches, since my elbows take a bit of a beating in the winter months. What I like most about this is I donâ€™t have to use a lot, there are a lot of creams out there that you have to slather on but this cream a little bit goes a long way. This winter with my schedule my skin just has been totally neglected and so far this cream is working wonders for me. I really do like this and when I get low I will be ordering this again. If you are looking for something that is going to soften your skin this is something that you should look into. Highly pleased and would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the first product that worked for me. Ever. I&#x27;ve developed rosacea six months ago and was desperate to get my skin back. I still get small breakouts but things are going much better since using this cream. I could never recommend it enough. It&#x27;s also great value, unfortunately shipping costs are very high for me as I live in Italy, but the pot is so big and you need so little that it lasts for months.</li>
