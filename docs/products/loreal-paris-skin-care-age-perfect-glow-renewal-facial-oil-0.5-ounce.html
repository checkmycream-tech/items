            <li>The scent is a bit strong but I like it</li>
            <li>I think it would be fine under makeup.</li>

            <li>to me feel is meh...not super oiley</li>
            <li>positive points: amazing scent and highly absorbent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for dry skin</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh, light smell and mixes well with a moisturizer or any other products that you put on your face.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt absorb right away &amp; feel luxurious either...</li>
            <li>Melts into skin very readily with no residual greasiness.</li>
            <li>First off -</li>
            <li>First off.....</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Makes it smooth, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>and it makes my face so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>it isnt a big deal to just order more.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all essential oils and natural ingredients things that are amazing for your skin color tone &amp; Moisture 2 thumbs up. .</li>
            <li>This facial oil is awesome, especially for dry skin and in the winter time (Or any time).</li>
            <li>I use this before bed time and in the morning after I wash my face and my skin is much more hydrated, less dry and has a nice youthful glow.</li>
            <li>I think that it is really helping me to stay moisturized through the dry/cold winter</li>
            <li>It is very goodl.</li>
            <li>The smell is therapeutic to me, just really seems to life my spirits.  </li>
            <li>Really makes a difference for me in keeping my skin from drying out this winter.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a short while, but I do love the way it makes my skin feel and my dry spots have cleared and my T-Zone does not become oily.</li>
            <li>the girl behind the counter said it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I don&#x27;t recommend doing that if you have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops with my foundation to make for a smooth and dewy finish.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m old and grey.</li>

            <li> How long have you used it &amp; how long did it take to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have not been using very long..</li>
            <li> A few months back I tried this product as a sample from a local store and</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, so I actually mix a few drops of this oil in with my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It also sinks into you skin within 10 minutes, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you with an oily feeling.</li>

            <li> And a little goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> also, seemingly not as hydrating as the other oils i have tried (which all tend to be the organic, no-chemical oils)</li>
            <li> Especially in this dry cold winter.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small</li>
            <li> seriously who&#x27;s writing these reviews?</li>
            <li> I receive it damage:(</li>
            <li> I hate the way this product smell.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A good product...  I have not been using very long.. so do not see any results.</li>
            <li> I believe a dab of olive oil would hv produced th same result</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Makes my skin so healthy!  Especially in this dry cold winter.</li>
            <li> This facial oil is awesome, especially for dry skin and in the winter time (Or any time). It has a nice fresh, light smell and mixes well with a moisturizer or any other products that you put on your face. I&#x27;ve even tried it in my foundation and it looked and felt great. Obviously, I don&#x27;t recommend doing that if you have very oily skin. I use this before bed time and in the morning after I wash my face and my skin is much more hydrated, less dry and has a nice youthful glow. Great product.</li>
            <li> First off - I love L&#x27;Oreal products. I was a little surprised at how small the bottle was but upon seeing the price again, guess I&#x27;m okay with the size. I hate the way this product smell. Too manly of a fragrance for me and the odor is too strong. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. I have been looking for a cheaper replacement for Elizabeth Arden ceramide capsules but if I can&#x27;t find a suitable replacement I think I&#x27;d just rather spend my money on that product since I really do love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for dry skin and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a short while, but I do love the way it makes my skin feel and my dry spots have cleared and my T-Zone does not become oily.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! It gives a beautiful, youthful glow! I always get compliments when I use it!</li>
            <li> Product is ok but I did not find any lasting results.</li>
            <li> This oil its just amazing and the scent addictive ,you will fall inlove with it and for the price I spend I couldnt ask for more 5 out of 5!</li>
            <li> A few months back I tried this product as a sample from a local store and boy it was amazing. It within a week there was a visible difference and it&#x27;s all essential oils and natural ingredients things that are amazing for your skin color tone &amp; Moisture 2 thumbs up. . Excellent product</li>
            <li> I got a sample at walgreens of this when I bought the moisterizer...the girl behind the counter said it was amazing. First off.....the scent is pretty icky. There is nothing light about it. It has somewhat of a herbal smell but its not pleasenlet and doesnt smell like flowers as some are saying....I can get past it if this actually works. People are mentioning alot about the feel....ok thats great....to me feel is meh...not super oiley but it doesnt absorb right away &amp; feel luxurious either...seriously who&#x27;s writing these reviews? Makes me wonder if there paid but I regress. Lets get to the important question: does this make your face look better? How? How long have you used it &amp; how long did it take to see a difference. Amen.</li>
            <li> Feels beautiful on the skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong but I like it so it does not bother me. I think that it is really helping me to stay moisturized through the dry/cold winter so I am glad to have tried it. I believe I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Very, very nice. Melts into skin very readily with no residual greasiness. I use one dropper full for face and neck. My skin absorbs it well enough I think it would be fine under makeup.</li>
            <li> Its okay. I use a few drops with my foundation to make for a smooth and dewy finish. It&#x27;s a good beauty trick. But overall, it&#x27;s just okay; smells pleasant. Have not used long enough to notice any benefits to my skin. I prefer using an Argan oil instead to get the antioxidant benefits, so I don&#x27;t know how good this oil blend may be for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I am a customer from China. This item is a Christmas gift for my wife. It is very goodl. Thanks!</li>
            <li> At 14 I would have NEVER imagined how critical this would be now...when I&#x27;m old and grey.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and feels on my skin. I&#x27;m hoping to see great long term improvement.</li>
            <li> Was excited to use this product.  It actually works and makes your face glow.  I would have given it 5 stars but read the beautypedia review that says the product is harmful to your skin because the amount of perfume in it.</li>
            <li> This is for the driest of skin, maybe. However, for hair it&#x27;s really good. Makes it smooth, shiny, and soft. So, I will be will using it for that.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells and the way it feels on my skin.  My skin is very dry, so I actually mix a few drops of this oil in with my moisturizer.  The smell is therapeutic to me, just really seems to life my spirits.  I will continue to use and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This really brightens up my skin and give mes gorgeous glow. It also sinks into you skin within 10 minutes, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you with an oily feeling. I use it before bed and wake up looking dewy. And a little goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I put it on every night after letting my vitamin c serum soak into my skin for a while and it makes my face so soft and smooth.  I won&#x27;t do without this product in the future.  The bottle is small but I think it will last a while.  If it doesnt, the price on amazon is so chaep it isnt a big deal to just order more.</li>
            <li> I receive it damage:(</li>
            <li> positive points: amazing scent and highly absorbent.  no &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel after about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negative points: the ingredients list has a lot of chemicals.  also, seemingly not as hydrating as the other oils i have tried (which all tend to be the organic, no-chemical oils)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite stuff.  I love this right after my shower, on a clean face.  Really makes a difference for me in keeping my skin from drying out this winter.</li>
