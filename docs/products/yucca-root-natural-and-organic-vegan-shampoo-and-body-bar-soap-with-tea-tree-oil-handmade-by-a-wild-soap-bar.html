            <li>I loved it!!</li>
            <li>Smells and feels amazing!!</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>All in all, a great product</li>
            <li>Works great, hair not greasy, used coconut oil on hair ends after shower.  </li>
            <li>Great both as a body bar and a no-poo shampoo bar.  </li>
            <li>This was really great as a soap</li>
            <li>but it was a great decision &amp;</li>
            <li>I head from my sis that it was good</li>
            <li>I love this soap!  </li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fairly inexpensive and clean better than any soap i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>As much as I love the Yucca Root soap as a...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to use more organic body care products.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone:)</li>
            <li>but it was just ok wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>get more.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this soap.</li>
            <li>Eh, this was just okay for me.  </li>
            <li>it helps exfoliate the skin but be sure to keep it away from your eyes (something to keep in mind with all soaps with granules that you use on your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the convenience of it, smell, it lathered good in my hair, and it was natural.  </li>
            <li>It is great as a shampoo, No harsh chemicals in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I also did the apple cider vinegar rinse with honey afterwards and my hair has felt incredible all day long.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing special, so</li>
            <li>Plus it fell apart pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I must say that this is very different than what I am used to however I surprisingly really liked it.  </li>
            <li>It would be useful to use if you needed that waxy texture in your hair for an updo or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this, will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy it again for face washing and shampooing.</li>
            <li>(On a side note I also love their Honey Oat body balm--it&#x27;s really helped my prone-to-cracking lips, especially when worn overnight).  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say much about it</li>
            <li>I have natural graying dark hair, and I love how this makes my hair feel!  </li>
            <li>Anyway the point is this soap isn&#x27;t that great, and it is contributing to deforestation which is a serious problem globally.</li>
            <li>Small bar for the $10 price tag, guess I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>It was near the showerhead on a caddy and fell apart...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months and it has not dried out my skin or caused it to break out.</li>
            <li>It works fine as a body soap, but I washed my hair with it for 4 nights in a row and by the 5th I had to switch back to my other shampoo in order to wash out all the buildup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this soap to anyone willing to spend a little more than usual on bar soap.</li>
            <li>To be fair, they do say to give it at least a week to adjust to a natural shampoo, so maybe I was just too impatient.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that they use minimal packaging--scraps of spare cardboard, apparently--and that the soap is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I actually like it so much I&#x27;ve stopped using conditioner and use only vinegar water).  </li>
            <li>regular natural bar soap</li>
            <li>I feel it is not worth to pay for this much to have the shampoo and body bar.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the african black soap sold here on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair and decided to try a natural hair soap.  </li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other &#x27;a wild soapbar&#x27; products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> (I find it almost spicy, a little like cinnamon), and the botanical oils in it leave my skin soft, even now that it&#x27;s winter.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to give it a week, as suggested, but I couldn&#x27;t make it that long.</li>
            <li> so I cannot say how well it works as a shampoo for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the package did not take long to arrive at my house.</li>
            <li> Other soaps designed for face use usually left my skin feeling not-so-clean, too dry, or caused me to break out (I am prone to breakouts).</li>
            <li> I have a few of A Wild Soap Bar&#x27;s other kinds of soap coming in the mail</li>
            <li> They were about the same size, half the price, &amp; lasted longer.</li>
            <li> well..as a soap, I washed my hair with it a few times since it&#x27;s also a shampoo bar, and it left my already oily hair feeling very heavy and waxy.  </li>
            <li> Something I should mention is this soap has little granule type things in it</li>
            <li> I would post the link but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow, but if you research thus you will find that it is true :(</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a small bar of soap.</li>
            <li> (sorry I am not really sure what they are)</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>

I also really like that they use minimal packaging--scraps of spare cardboard, apparently--and that the soap is all natural.

As much as I love the Yucca Root soap as a...well..as a soap, I washed my hair with it a few times since it&#x27;s also a shampoo bar, and it left my already oily hair feeling very heavy and waxy.  (The vinegar rinse that they recommend did help, though, and I actually like it so much I&#x27;ve stopped using conditioner and use only vinegar water).  To be fair, they do say to give it at least a week to adjust to a natural shampoo, so maybe I was just too impatient.  All in all, a great product and I&#x27;m glad I found it.  I have a few of A Wild Soap Bar&#x27;s other kinds of soap coming in the mail and I can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a small bar of soap. Plus it fell apart pretty easily. I&#x27;d rather stick to my organic lavender bar soaps from the farmers market. They were about the same size, half the price, &amp; lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I like the organic shampoo and body bar.&lt;br /&gt;I used for 3-4 times the soap gone. I feel it is not worth to pay for this much to have the shampoo and body bar. If you like to use it, you can just use it for your body bar.</li>
            <li> Works great, hair not greasy, used coconut oil on hair ends after shower.  Yay!  Great both as a body bar and a no-poo shampoo bar.  Thank you!  I am inspired to give soap making a try.</li>
            <li> It is great as a shampoo, No harsh chemicals in your hair.  I am trying to use more organic body care products.</li>
            <li> This was really great as a soap but i wouldn&#x27;t use it as shampoo bar again. I will say this though-it smells great!! and leaves a tingly feeling on your skin. Would recommend to anyone:)</li>
            <li> I must say that this is very different than what I am used to however I surprisingly really liked it.  I liked the convenience of it, smell, it lathered good in my hair, and it was natural.  I also did the apple cider vinegar rinse with honey afterwards and my hair has felt incredible all day long.

            <li> I head from my sis that it was good but it was just ok wouldn&#x27;t buy it again can&#x27;t really say much about it</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> I loved it!! Smells and feels amazing!! Can&#x27;t wait to try the other &#x27;a wild soapbar&#x27; products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will get more.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I have natural graying dark hair, and I love how this makes my hair feel!  I have very dry hair and decided to try a natural hair soap.  So glad I tried this, will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Will have to stop buying soap from this company. It contains palm oil which is causing destruction of the rainforest. I would post the link but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow, but if you research thus you will find that it is true :( I switched to Tropical Traditions soap which is organic and doesn&#x27;t contain palm oil. It&#x27;s also fairly inexpensive and clean better than any soap i&#x27;ve ever used. Anyway the point is this soap isn&#x27;t that great, and it is contributing to deforestation which is a serious problem globally.</li>
            <li> this product realy works i use it every day i will be buying it again and telling my friends thank you</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this soap. It works fine as a body soap, but I washed my hair with it for 4 nights in a row and by the 5th I had to switch back to my other shampoo in order to wash out all the buildup. I was trying to give it a week, as suggested, but I couldn&#x27;t make it that long. It would be useful to use if you needed that waxy texture in your hair for an updo or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already use \\&quot;natural\\&quot; haircare products (think Kiss My Face, Alba, etc) so my hair is used to no sulfates, parabens, etc. However, I think the pH in this formula must be off; I tried the apple cider vinegar rinse but it didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As regular natural bar soap it&#x27;s nothing special, so I won&#x27;t purchase again once I use it up.</li>
            <li> Eh, this was just okay for me.  I bought this based on the reviews and I don&#x27;t understand all of the rage.  I much prefer the african black soap sold here on amazon.</li>
            <li> This bar deteriorated after only 3 washes. It was near the showerhead on a caddy and fell apart...it literally melted away. I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to wash my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months and it has not dried out my skin or caused it to break out. Other soaps designed for face use usually left my skin feeling not-so-clean, too dry, or caused me to break out (I am prone to breakouts). I&#x27;ll continue to use it until the situation changes. Something I should mention is this soap has little granule type things in it (sorry I am not really sure what they are) it helps exfoliate the skin but be sure to keep it away from your eyes (something to keep in mind with all soaps with granules that you use on your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pixie cut so I cannot say how well it works as a shampoo for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this soap to anyone willing to spend a little more than usual on bar soap. I will most likely buy it again for face washing and shampooing.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was reluctant to buy it at 1st but it was a great decision &amp; the package did not take long to arrive at my house. Will be making this purchase again!</li>
