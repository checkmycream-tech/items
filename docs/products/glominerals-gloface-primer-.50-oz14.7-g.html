            <li>AGAIN WHICH I LOVE.  </li>
            <li>I really love the feel of this product on my face.</li>
            <li>Makes the foundation go on smoother, but doesn&#x27;t seem to give me more of a matt finish.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Have tried so many</li>
            <li>It makes the concealer easier to apply and spread more evenly.</li>
            <li>Smoothes skin so foundation goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product helps your foundation lay smooth each application.</li>
            <li>I put this on and my skin feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>To thick,I ordered a medium beige, and was to light.</li>
            <li>Feel light and silky and makes the make-up glide on.</li>
            <li>GloMinerals primer goes on light and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use bb cream as well and would have to say my updated routine keeps my face very fresh all day</li>
            <li>Definitely a great addition to my other glominerals products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and it makes your face feel so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Plus no crazy chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>makes my face feel soft and make up application is much better after using this</li>
            <li>It does improve the appearance of the powder foundation and seems to keep it looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li>this stuff better be amazing :/</li>
            <li>Love this primer more than any other!  </li>
            <li>You only have to use a tiny drop on each area of the face to get great results.</li>
            <li>but I had to try this one especially since I love this brand.  </li>
            <li>Apply makeup first and then use this to fill in.</li>
            <li>I am a primer girl from now on thanks to this stuff!</li>
            <li>It only takes a tiny drop of this primer to keep powdered mineral make-up looking smooth and good for the entire day!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin ready for its makeup.</li>
            <li>so I really did not know what to expect.  </li>
            <li>As a 52 yr old I&#x27;m always looking for something that makes my skin look better, and this definitely helps my Glo Pressed Powder Foundation go on smoother and stay that way longer.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and so far no bad reaction.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels on my skin and does make makeup go on smoother without the lines or clumping seen in other products.......</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite surprised at the size of this!</li>
            <li>It is an excellent base for me to apply my glo minerals powder foundation.</li>
            <li>BARE MINERALS DOESN&#x27;T IRRITATE MY FACE</li>
            <li>NOW I HAVE STARTED BACK USING BARE MINERALS</li>
            <li>Hmmm doesn&#x27;t do much and doesn&#x27;t have the same satiny silky feel of other primers (eg arbonne) also very tiny amount for the price!</li>

            <li> This is the best face primer! I put this on and my skin feels so smooth. It also does the job of keeping my make-up a lot longer.  Plus no crazy chemicals in it. I have a very sensitive skin and so far no bad reaction. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love glominerals foundation, but I was not really impressed with the primer.  I switched back to my go to primer - hourglass mineral veil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to HAVE to wear a primer everyday but I had to try this one especially since I love this brand.  It&#x27;s a very nice primer.

            <li> There is definitely a difference when applying this primer.  I have never used a primer before so I really did not know what to expect.  Guess it does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Great product.  You only have to use a tiny drop on each area of the face to get great results.</li>
            <li> Perfect - just what I ordered!</li>
            <li> never tried primer before... this makes skin feel like silk!  I use much less makeup too.  Definitely a great addition to my other glominerals products.</li>
            <li> This feels very smooth and luxurious on my face.  It does not cause any breakouts either.  It is an excellent base for me to apply my glo minerals powder foundation.</li>
            <li> To thick,I ordered a medium beige, and was to light.I do not recommend this makeup.</li>

            <li> makes my face feel soft and make up application is much better after using this</li>
            <li> NOT ALL THAT.  I ENDED UP GOING TO A DERMATOLOGIST AND SOLVED MY ROSACEA PROBLEM.  NOW I HAVE STARTED BACK USING BARE MINERALS AGAIN WHICH I LOVE.  BARE MINERALS DOESN&#x27;T IRRITATE MY FACE ANYMORE SINCE I SOLVED THE ROSACEA PROBLEM.</li>
            <li> I really love the feel of this product on my face. Of course the way it prepares my face for make up is wonderful as well.</li>

There is less creeping into pores and lines with this product.  The tube is small, I&#x27;ve been using less than a pea size drop on my problem areas, so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  I will be buying this product again though,I know that!</li>
            <li> I use a mineral powder foundation and had never tried a primer before. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. It doesn&#x27;t take much and it makes your face feel so smooth and silky.  It does improve the appearance of the powder foundation and seems to keep it looking fresh all day.</li>
