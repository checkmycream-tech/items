            <li>The light works great.</li>
            <li>I had seen someone else with one it was amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror because I was going on a cruise and thought a magnifying mirror would be nice to have.  </li>
            <li>Nice size for travel or to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good traveling mirror for sure.  </li>
            <li>My daughter saw it and liked it so well that I found her one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the lights were a bit brighter, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, but it is too bulky to carry around in my purse.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of glitzy for my taste.</li>
            <li>It would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>If there had just been some kind of on and off switch, that might have made a difference.  </li>
            <li>This item is great quality and very very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the light to be all that bright.</li>
            <li>The light is bright enough and the magnifying glass is perfect.  </li>
            <li>its VERY cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice size, good illumination and really pretty.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will never again be without one.  </li>
            <li>I love this lighted mirror compact and take it everywhere with me.</li>
            <li>but I think that is ok as it helps you to see even more.</li>
            <li>so I know they can make a much better product.  </li>
            <li>And so many batteries are needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the light is nice and it does what it says in terms of magnifying.</li>
            <li>However, I pressed the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button once to turn on the light, and then when I tried to turn it off it wouldn&#x27;t shut off!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this compact mirror.  </li>
            <li>I get so many complements...hard to find a lighted compact.  </li>
            <li>Over all I love it.  </li>
            <li>I used this mirror on my latest trip and it was all i had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Can see things clearly and the light is great, too!</li>
            <li>This is very pretty and practical as it has good magnification which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>I still love the mirror but wish it was just a bit more user friendly.</li>
            <li>Perfect pink color.</li>
            <li>I love the large size (4&amp;#34;) and the light is nice and bright.  </li>
            <li>Nice and big, good quality.</li>
            <li>They are just beautiful and the Swarovski crystals add such a&lt;br /&gt;classy touch.  </li>
            <li>loved the product but could practically buy a new one for what the replacement batteries cost.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror as a gift for my mother because she needed a light to see with while on a plane.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the light that makes this work.  </li>
            <li>The light on/off button continually gets bumped in my purse wasting battery life.</li>
            <li>this is just a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>For those who are visually challenged, this is a great compact.  </li>
            <li>I am going to go buy a cheap mirror that weighs a couple of ounces to have in my purse.  </li>
            <li>had the light worked.  </li>
            <li>For the price of this product, I found the casing to be cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>size to fit in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I would have given this mirror five stars if the light had worked.</li>
            <li>so it is easier to use hands free in a hotel.</li>
            <li>The magnified mirror is pretty good as I have seen some that are pretty distorted....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful (pink with Swarovski crystals)and functional.</li>
            <li>the light is bright enough to see every detail.  </li>
            <li>but it is bright enough to illuminate the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; side as well.  </li>
            <li>It looks cheap, but who cares, for the price and use, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Quite a bit larger than I was expecting, but good performance.</li>
            <li>This would have been worth it to me if the light had worked</li>
            <li>The only good part is the outer shell where the crystals are.</li>
            <li>The light comes in so handy for those last minute checks before getting out of the car .</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>It is great to arch your eyebrows with or pull out unwanted facial hair that we older women get.</li>
            <li>Awesome little mirror!!!</li>
            <li>Have bought several for gifts and they all love them!  </li>
            <li>The lighted mirror is great and the pink lid with the crystal is very girlie.  </li>
            <li>but for a trip I think this will be useful.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it magnifies enough to actually be useful to me</li>
            <li>but this didn&#x27;t make it worth the money.</li>
            <li>Bigger than expected but perfect</li>
            <li>but it feels right when holding to use mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The button to turn the lights on is on the outside of the compact, and it&#x27;s very easily toggled when being tossed into a purse.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mirror especially the LED lights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty and functional.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty picky</li>
            <li>Compact is pretty.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2P1W2CN6TFWSR]]The floxite lighted compact is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Interesting to read the mixed reactions.</li>
            <li>I find the compact pretty.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The crystal was pretty</li>
            <li>It is big, which I love.  </li>
            <li>This compact is so pretty and so feminine looking.  </li>
            <li>Only one thing could make it better - portable stand</li>
            <li>WELL LIT.maybe a little large for some, but good sized all-around.</li>
            <li>However, they may want to rethink the name &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; as it is rather large.  </li>
            <li>Needed that large magnifier for on the go in not a overly large package.  </li>
            <li>The light is too bright for such a small mirror.&lt;br /&gt;HAd to return.</li>
            <li>Pretty and very clear!  </li>
            <li>This is really nice, it comes with a little zipper pouch</li>
            <li>The price is way too much for the quality.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>It has a very refined weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li>In a moderately lit room, you won&#x27;t notice the light on your face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>25.00 dollars is way too much for a shell of a mirror that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>10x is too much magnification.</li>
            <li>Yes, the light is only around the magnifying side</li>
            <li>I actually decorated the first one with deco-den parts and more crystals, but I&#x27;ll keep my new one its original pink.</li>
            <li>I love this pretty little mirror</li>
            <li>The jeweled part on top is pretty enough, but the battery pack for the lights definitely adds some weight and depth to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Love the pink color and crystals, too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s larger than most compact mirrors, making it possible to see your whole face on the 1x side and</li>
            <li>Therefore, you need to hold it with one hand, so it is not practical if you are looking for a mirror to set down and be able to use two hands.</li>
            <li>The size was a bit bigger than I expected, which I liked.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m getting older, I can&#x27;t see to put my make-up on.</li>
            <li>I have the big version for home, and love it, but too big for travel.</li>
            <li>Extra star because of the very pretty case.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone in the market for a lighted compact.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come on when you open it, which is great because I won&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries dieing if it accidently came open in my purse, but comes on by pressing a little button on the side.  </li>
            <li>However, instead of keeping it in my purse, I keep it with my makeup train case as I find it quite useful to have both a magnified and regular mirror in hand.  </li>
            <li>The little light that surrounds the mirror was just enough light in case you are someplace where the lighting sucks - like most hotels, someone else&#x27;s bathroom, or bedroom.  </li>
            <li>the lights aren&#x27;t that useful to me, but maybe if the room was pretty dark.  </li>
            <li>Still, replacing the batteries is not the end of the world (and I&#x27;ll be more careful next time).</li>
            <li>Love this little compact mirror!</li>
            <li>Very clear mirrors and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a set of LEDs that are very, very dim, and replacing the battery didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>So the light was on for days until the batteries wore down.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a small mirror that would be easy to pack yet powerful enough to see what I wanted to see.  </li>
            <li>,Mama wanted a new compact, lighted like her old one.</li>
            <li>Small enough for packing and handy to use.  </li>
            <li>Bigger than I expected and cheap</li>
            <li>The lighting is far too dim, even when used in a well lit room.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not heavy and will work well for travel and allows me to see everything clearly.  </li>
            <li>The item is complete garbage.</li>
            <li>The light is useless &amp; it&#x27;s pretty large.</li>
            <li>This will come in so handy when traveling as it&#x27;s difficult to apply makeup well using poor hotel lighting, especially when hubby doesn&#x27;t like the curtains opened as he likes to wall around &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m sure those in the parking lot are glad I keep the curtains closed too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, as other reviewers have said, the light is not very powerful.</li>
            <li>Great idea, bad execution.</li>
            <li>It is small yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something small and powerful, look no farther.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, not able to use in my purse as intended, but found it useful elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The diameter of this little 10x mirror narrows the view so much that it comes out looking like my 8x.  </li>
            <li>And the maginified side has distortion and is hard to see in, you have to have it very close to your eye to see a clear image.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I used this mirror on my latest trip and it was all i had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> Can see things clearly and the light is great, too!</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and practical as it has good magnification which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> I still love the mirror but wish it was just a bit more user friendly.</li>
            <li> Perfect pink color.</li>
            <li> I love the large size (4&amp;#34;) and the light is nice and bright.  </li>
            <li> Nice and big, good quality.</li>
            <li> They are just beautiful and the Swarovski crystals add such a&lt;br /&gt;classy touch.  </li>
            <li> loved the product but could practically buy a new one for what the replacement batteries cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror as a gift for my mother because she needed a light to see with while on a plane.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the light that makes this work.  </li>
            <li> The light on/off button continually gets bumped in my purse wasting battery life.</li>
            <li> this is just a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> For those who are visually challenged, this is a great compact.  </li>
            <li> I am going to go buy a cheap mirror that weighs a couple of ounces to have in my purse.  </li>
            <li> had the light worked.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this product, I found the casing to be cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> size to fit in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this mirror five stars if the light had worked.</li>
            <li> so it is easier to use hands free in a hotel.</li>
            <li> The magnified mirror is pretty good as I have seen some that are pretty distorted....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful (pink with Swarovski crystals)and functional.</li>
            <li> the light is bright enough to see every detail.  </li>
            <li> but it is bright enough to illuminate the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; side as well.  </li>
            <li> It looks cheap, but who cares, for the price and use, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Quite a bit larger than I was expecting, but good performance.</li>
            <li> This would have been worth it to me if the light had worked</li>
            <li> The only good part is the outer shell where the crystals are.</li>
            <li> The light comes in so handy for those last minute checks before getting out of the car .</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> It is great to arch your eyebrows with or pull out unwanted facial hair that we older women get.</li>
            <li> Awesome little mirror!!!</li>
            <li> Have bought several for gifts and they all love them!  </li>
            <li> The lighted mirror is great and the pink lid with the crystal is very girlie.  </li>
            <li> but for a trip I think this will be useful.</li>
            <li> More importantly, it magnifies enough to actually be useful to me</li>
            <li> but this didn&#x27;t make it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected but perfect</li>
            <li> but it feels right when holding to use mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The button to turn the lights on is on the outside of the compact, and it&#x27;s very easily toggled when being tossed into a purse.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror especially the LED lights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and functional.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty picky</li>
            <li> Compact is pretty.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2P1W2CN6TFWSR]]The floxite lighted compact is so pretty.</li>
            <li> Interesting to read the mixed reactions.</li>
            <li> I find the compact pretty.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The crystal was pretty</li>
            <li> It is big, which I love.  </li>
            <li> This compact is so pretty and so feminine looking.  </li>
            <li> Only one thing could make it better - portable stand</li>
            <li> WELL LIT.maybe a little large for some, but good sized all-around.</li>
            <li> However, they may want to rethink the name &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; as it is rather large.  </li>
            <li> Needed that large magnifier for on the go in not a overly large package.  </li>
            <li> The light is too bright for such a small mirror.&lt;br /&gt;HAd to return.</li>
            <li> Pretty and very clear!  </li>
            <li> This is really nice, it comes with a little zipper pouch</li>
            <li> The price is way too much for the quality.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> It has a very refined weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li> In a moderately lit room, you won&#x27;t notice the light on your face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 25.00 dollars is way too much for a shell of a mirror that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> 10x is too much magnification.</li>
            <li> Yes, the light is only around the magnifying side</li>
            <li> I actually decorated the first one with deco-den parts and more crystals, but I&#x27;ll keep my new one its original pink.</li>
            <li> I love this pretty little mirror</li>
            <li> The jeweled part on top is pretty enough, but the battery pack for the lights definitely adds some weight and depth to the bottom.</li>
            <li> Love the pink color and crystals, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger than most compact mirrors, making it possible to see your whole face on the 1x side and</li>
            <li> Therefore, you need to hold it with one hand, so it is not practical if you are looking for a mirror to set down and be able to use two hands.</li>
            <li> The size was a bit bigger than I expected, which I liked.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m getting older, I can&#x27;t see to put my make-up on.</li>
            <li> I have the big version for home, and love it, but too big for travel.</li>
            <li> Extra star because of the very pretty case.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone in the market for a lighted compact.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come on when you open it, which is great because I won&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries dieing if it accidently came open in my purse, but comes on by pressing a little button on the side.  </li>
            <li> However, instead of keeping it in my purse, I keep it with my makeup train case as I find it quite useful to have both a magnified and regular mirror in hand.  </li>
            <li> The little light that surrounds the mirror was just enough light in case you are someplace where the lighting sucks - like most hotels, someone else&#x27;s bathroom, or bedroom.  </li>
            <li> the lights aren&#x27;t that useful to me, but maybe if the room was pretty dark.  </li>
            <li> Still, replacing the batteries is not the end of the world (and I&#x27;ll be more careful next time).</li>
            <li> Love this little compact mirror!</li>
            <li> Very clear mirrors and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a set of LEDs that are very, very dim, and replacing the battery didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> So the light was on for days until the batteries wore down.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a small mirror that would be easy to pack yet powerful enough to see what I wanted to see.  </li>
            <li> ,Mama wanted a new compact, lighted like her old one.</li>
            <li> Small enough for packing and handy to use.  </li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected and cheap</li>
            <li> The lighting is far too dim, even when used in a well lit room.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not heavy and will work well for travel and allows me to see everything clearly.  </li>
            <li> The item is complete garbage.</li>
            <li> The light is useless &amp; it&#x27;s pretty large.</li>
            <li> This will come in so handy when traveling as it&#x27;s difficult to apply makeup well using poor hotel lighting, especially when hubby doesn&#x27;t like the curtains opened as he likes to wall around &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m sure those in the parking lot are glad I keep the curtains closed too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, as other reviewers have said, the light is not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Great idea, bad execution.</li>
            <li> It is small yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something small and powerful, look no farther.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, not able to use in my purse as intended, but found it useful elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The diameter of this little 10x mirror narrows the view so much that it comes out looking like my 8x.  </li>
            <li> And the maginified side has distortion and is hard to see in, you have to have it very close to your eye to see a clear image.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would magnify better than my 8x mirror in order to pluck the eyelashes that are too stupid to grow in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> The other downside, however, is that it is somewhat large and heavy.  </li>
            <li> The magnified side is lit, unlike other lighted mirrors, however it is heavier than the regular side so you can only set it on a desk as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am curious to know how ling the batteries last.  </li>
            <li> In an extremely dark room, it barely lit my face, and certainly not well enough to see to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> One side of the mirror is for close up and the other side is for further away, which gives you options</li>
            <li> This is not a regular compact sized mirror,it is a little bigger</li>
            <li> It is a bit bigger than I expected as other reviewers mentioned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the weak light source, it&#x27;s a bit bulky if you plan on just using it as a small mirror for your purse.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, only half of the LED lights lit up and they gave off very dismal illumination.  </li>
            <li> It is just a little bit bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> mostly disappointed that Amazon offers it through prime which to me says its not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s too be expected with such a small mirror.</li>
            <li> it came on and other times it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It took forever to ship, the battery chamber is rusted and stinks like mildew, I put new batteries in and the lights stay on for maybe a second or two, then start to flutter.</li>
            <li> The glass is clear an distortion free, but the lights are horrible.  </li>
            <li> However, the lights are not bright enough.  </li>
            <li> Even with new batteries the lights are very weak.  </li>
            <li> A bit heavy</li>
            <li> This mirror is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way with my portable Sonicare toothbrush that you need to take out the batteries if you&#x27;re not going to use them for a while - and I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s the way with this little mirror.  </li>
            <li> I noticed there was one negative review and decided to go with the thoughts of  5 star reviewers instead.</li>
            <li> If your eyesight is poor, you&#x27;ll appreciate the aid of the lights.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with floxite.  </li>
            <li> but I was not impressed with the plastic on it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The LED lights help a lot as I have bad lighting in my house.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this item.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the perfect size mirror to keep in my make up bag.  The lighted magnified side is perfect for eyes.  I love it and will never again be without one.  I&#x27;ve ordered 2 to have as spares!!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this item. The magnified lighted side must be laying on the desk not in the upright position. The magnified side is lit, unlike other lighted mirrors, however it is heavier than the regular side so you can only set it on a desk as shown in the picture. Therefore, you need to hold it with one hand, so it is not practical if you are looking for a mirror to set down and be able to use two hands. And the maginified side has distortion and is hard to see in, you have to have it very close to your eye to see a clear image. I never used it and will never. A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror especially the LED lights. This makes a great gift too but got it for myself because it was just too cute. I can see every hair that I need to pluck on my eye brows. The LED lights help a lot as I have bad lighting in my house. I love this lighted mirror compact and take it everywhere with me.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for gifts.  They are just beautiful and the Swarovski crystals add such a&lt;br /&gt;classy touch.  The light is bright enough and the magnifying glass is perfect.  Very pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror with a magnifying side for a while. This one fills all my requirements perfectly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror as a gift for my mother because she needed a light to see with while on a plane. This did the trick. It looks cheap, but who cares, for the price and use, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and functional.  No distortion in the magnification.  the lights aren&#x27;t that useful to me, but maybe if the room was pretty dark.  I think it will work out perfectly for my purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the light that makes this work.  If your eyesight is poor, you&#x27;ll appreciate the aid of the lights.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and practical as it has good magnification which is important to me.  It is a bit bigger than I thought but I think that is ok as it helps you to see even more. I&#x27;m &amp;#34;older so I&#x27;m pretty picky but I would have no problem in even saying this would be a nice gift!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror because I was going on a cruise and thought a magnifying mirror would be nice to have.  I wanted a small mirror that would be easy to pack yet powerful enough to see what I wanted to see.  This mirror is wonderful!  It is small yet powerful.  If you&#x27;re looking for something small and powerful, look no farther.  This is the mirror.</li>
            <li> The glass is clear an distortion free, but the lights are horrible.  Even with new batteries the lights are very weak.  I have had this brand before, and they discontinued the one I had, so I know they can make a much better product.  Very disappointed in this item, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews, I bought this mirror for my daughter for Christmas. It&#x27;s beautiful (pink with Swarovski crystals)and functional. The light works great. One side of the mirror is for close up and the other side is for further away, which gives you options -especially when putting on make-up or fixing hair. My daughter loves the mirror and carries it in her purse.</li>
            <li> Great idea, bad execution. The light on/off button continually gets bumped in my purse wasting battery life. And so many batteries are needed. The hinge has a crack in it already. A design rethink is in order.</li>
            <li> The lighting is far too dim, even when used in a well lit room. I guess that&#x27;s too be expected with such a small mirror. Otherwise, this is a good quality compact mirror.</li>
            <li> Nice size for travel or to carry in your purse. It&#x27;s larger than most compact mirrors, making it possible to see your whole face on the 1x side and the 10x side is lit and magnifies well enough that I don&#x27;t need my glasses. I love this pretty little mirror</li>
            <li> Nice size, good illumination and really pretty.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with floxite.  They make the best mirrors in my opinion</li>
            <li> its VERY cheap. The price is way too much for the quality. It was a gift for my friend who loved it but I was not impressed with the plastic on it. I had seen someone else with one it was amazing so thought to buy one for a friends bday. this is just a cheap knock off. mostly disappointed that Amazon offers it through prime which to me says its not a bad product. which in this case was not so.</li>
            <li> I will be using this as I now am begining to travel. Nice size and wonderful lighting to help me.</li>
            <li> Love this little compact mirror! Best purchase at a great price! These make great gifts! Will order again soon !</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, enough said. Mirrors are of excellent quality and the compact itself is well made. A bit heavy but it feels right when holding to use mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good traveling mirror for sure.  Bigger than I expected and cheap looking.  It&#x27;s so big so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gonna carry this around but for a trip I think this will be useful.</li>
            <li> Quite a bit larger than I was expecting, but good performance. Love the sparkles!</li>
            <li> For those who are visually challenged, this is a great compact.  The lighted mirror is great and the pink lid with the crystal is very girlie.  However, they may want to rethink the name &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; as it is rather large.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> Compact is pretty.  Bigger than I thought it was going to be.  However, the lights are not bright enough.  Also, I had to keep pushing the batteries in to keep it working.  I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> My sister bought me one through QVC. My daughter saw it and liked it so well that I found her one on Amazon. It is great to arch your eyebrows with or pull out unwanted facial hair that we older women get. Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> This is really nice, it comes with a little zipper pouch so you can carry it in your purse. It is just a little bit bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> ,Mama wanted a new compact, lighted like her old one. Sew this one on Amazon,looked good, good price. Got it home found out it&#x27;s GREAT,CLEAR,AND WELL LIT.maybe a little large for some, but good sized all-around.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2P1W2CN6TFWSR]]The floxite lighted compact is so pretty. It&#x27;s also the perfect size to fit in my purse and my hand. The light comes in so handy for those last minute checks before getting out of the car . The magnifying side is the also the lit side and is great for tweezing.</li>
            <li> perfect size, perfect light...love the magnification, my first 10x and now traveling with me.</li>
            <li> It is a bit bigger than I expected as other reviewers mentioned.  However, it&#x27;s not heavy and will work well for travel and allows me to see everything clearly.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Interesting to read the mixed reactions. I find the compact pretty. More importantly, it magnifies enough to actually be useful to me--it&#x27;s actually a godsend, especially when I am traveling. It would be nice if the lights were a bit brighter, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker. The only problem is that the lights are easily left on and then the batteries wear out. Still, replacing the batteries is not the end of the world (and I&#x27;ll be more careful next time). I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Works great. Keep extra batteries with you in case. This mirror is not cheap. It has a very refined weight and feel to it. It uses two standard CR2032 batteries. Every woman needs this. Guys, buy one for your wife, daughter, or mother. Make the women in your life happy!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but it is too bulky to carry around in my purse.  I end up leaving at home.  I am going to go buy a cheap mirror that weighs a couple of ounces to have in my purse.  Otherwise, the light is nice and it does what it says in terms of magnifying.</li>
            <li> This is not a regular compact sized mirror,it is a little bigger but it is still a great mirror .Thsi ended up being my stay at home mirror,led light is great for doing your eyebrows !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the light to be all that bright. It&#x27;s a set of LEDs that are very, very dim, and replacing the battery didn&#x27;t help. In an extremely dark room, it barely lit my face, and certainly not well enough to see to put on makeup. In a moderately lit room, you won&#x27;t notice the light on your face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button to turn the lights on is on the outside of the compact, and it&#x27;s very easily toggled when being tossed into a purse. The upside is that the batteries do last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the weak light source, it&#x27;s a bit bulky if you plan on just using it as a small mirror for your purse. The jeweled part on top is pretty enough, but the battery pack for the lights definitely adds some weight and depth to the bottom.</li>
            <li> I received this mirror as a gift from my mom, and I LOVE it! I actually bought a second one to keep in my purse and for traveling. I actually decorated the first one with deco-den parts and more crystals, but I&#x27;ll keep my new one its original pink.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!  I keep one in my purse and one in my work tote.  Have bought several for gifts and they all love them!  Would be lost if I did not have one of these on hand!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The mirror is very good quality.  However, I pressed the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button once to turn on the light, and then when I tried to turn it off it wouldn&#x27;t shut off!  So the light was on for days until the batteries wore down.  In fact, I couldn&#x27;t even figure out how to remove the batteries!  If you want a lighted mirror I would look elsewhere.  If you just want a good compact mirror with a good magnifying side, this may work for you.  The other downside, however, is that it is somewhat large and heavy.  This would have been worth it to me if the light had worked properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as other reviewers have said, the light is not very powerful.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror since it had good reviews.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have gone through the hassle of returning it, had the light worked.  Somethimes it came on and other times it didn&#x27;t.  So it HAD to be returned.  In hindsight, it was probably for the best.  For the price of this product, I found the casing to be cheap plastic.  The crystal was pretty but this didn&#x27;t make it worth the money.</li>
            <li> This item is great quality and very very pretty.  Very clear mirrors and the light is bright enough to see every detail.  Bigger than expected but perfect size to fit in your hand.  I highly recommend this for anyone in the market for a lighted compact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this compact mirror.  I leave it in my purse and use It for makeup touchups throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I get so many complements...hard to find a lighted compact.  It is big, which I love.  The LED lights are great.  I do wish the lights automatically turned off when you close it.  I am curious to know how ling the batteries last.  Over all I love it.  Well made and sturdy design.  Great buy</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on the 5 star reviews. I noticed there was one negative review and decided to go with the thoughts of  5 star reviewers instead.Big mistake! The item is complete garbage. It took forever to ship, the battery chamber is rusted and stinks like mildew, I put new batteries in and the lights stay on for maybe a second or two, then start to flutter. The only good part is the outer shell where the crystals are. 25.00 dollars is way too much for a shell of a mirror that doesn&#x27;t work. BUYER BEWARE  BUYER BEWARE  BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> They are great, but I don&#x27;t like the light!  You can&#x27;t see your face well you use it at night.</li>
            <li> Everything about this mirror was perfect. The size was a bit bigger than I expected, which I liked. Perfect pink color. I would have given this mirror five stars if the light had worked.</li>
            <li> Extra star because of the very pretty case. 10x is too much magnification. The light is too bright for such a small mirror.&lt;br /&gt;HAd to return.</li>
            <li> This compact is so pretty and so feminine looking.  I love the large size (4&amp;#34;) and the light is nice and bright.  It doesn&#x27;t come on when you open it, which is great because I won&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries dieing if it accidently came open in my purse, but comes on by pressing a little button on the side.  Yes, the light is only around the magnifying side but it is bright enough to illuminate the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; side as well.  This will come in so handy when traveling as it&#x27;s difficult to apply makeup well using poor hotel lighting, especially when hubby doesn&#x27;t like the curtains opened as he likes to wall around &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m sure those in the parking lot are glad I keep the curtains closed too!, lol.</li>
            <li> I used this mirror on my latest trip and it was all i had hoped for.  Small enough for packing and handy to use.  The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Needed that large magnifier for on the go in not a overly large package.  Love it!  May buy my mother one!</li>
            <li> Pretty and very clear!  Can see things clearly and the light is great, too! Love the pink color and crystals, too!</li>
            <li> I picked this up as a stocking stuffer for my wife and she loves it. Nice and big, good quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome little mirror!!!</li>
            <li> I needed something that would magnify better than my 8x mirror in order to pluck the eyelashes that are too stupid to grow in the right direction.  The diameter of this little 10x mirror narrows the view so much that it comes out looking like my 8x.  And I&#x27;ve found that for some reason, holding this mirror still is more difficult than holding the stand-up mirror.  It&#x27;s also kind of glitzy for my taste.</li>
            <li> Only one thing could make it better - portable stand so it is easier to use hands free in a hotel.</li>
            <li> its kinda of big....but its nice and lights up bright</li>
            <li> The light is useless &amp; it&#x27;s pretty large. However, instead of keeping it in my purse, I keep it with my makeup train case as I find it quite useful to have both a magnified and regular mirror in hand.  The magnified mirror is pretty good as I have seen some that are pretty distorted....this one is not.&lt;br /&gt;Again, not able to use in my purse as intended, but found it useful elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, only half of the LED lights lit up and they gave off very dismal illumination.  After 3 uses, lights don&#x27;t even come on.  Already have to replace batteries.</li>
            <li> This compact is larger than I thought it would be but it is very nice!  It would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift......it didn&#x27;t go over that well. but hey, you can see reflections in it. Amazing</li>
            <li> This is a great lighted, magnifiying mirror for travel. As I&#x27;m getting older, I can&#x27;t see to put my make-up on. This works great. I have the big version for home, and love it, but too big for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, great size and looks delightful.  I have been traveling quite a bit and need a big magnifying mirror for inserting my contacts and makeup application.  The little light that surrounds the mirror was just enough light in case you are someplace where the lighting sucks - like most hotels, someone else&#x27;s bathroom, or bedroom.  I thought - perfect, this will be just what I need.  Fast forward two weeks when I&#x27;m on my trip and the battery is dead.  I found out the hard way with my portable Sonicare toothbrush that you need to take out the batteries if you&#x27;re not going to use them for a while - and I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s the way with this little mirror.  It&#x27;s one of those lithium batteries that you don&#x27;t just have extras lying around the house so there will be a trip to the store and the battery goes in and out before each trip.  If there had just been some kind of on and off switch, that might have made a difference.  I still love the mirror but wish it was just a bit more user friendly.</li>
            <li> loved the product but could practically buy a new one for what the replacement batteries cost. It takes eight lithium batteries.</li>
