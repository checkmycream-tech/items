            <li> Very Good skin care product</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference (after two weeks) in the lines around my mouth and on my forehead. I am very pleased with this product. I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> i love it so far - haven&#x27;t used the product that long</li>
            <li> I enjoy DermaSet cream for two years and I felt I need to let everybody know how wonderful the cream is, and how it helped me look younger than I am.  I love the customer service at their company and how cooperative they always are.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I saw results in less than one week. I recommended this cream to ALL my friends.</li>
            <li> I love Dermaset! The cream works great and really firms the skin. I love how it goes right onto the skin and is light so I apply it right before I go to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I wake up and see and feel the noticeable difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my skin greasier, a huge plus because my skin is naturally more oilier!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t noticed any difference what so ever!&lt;br /&gt;A waste of $200</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already received so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this cream after I discovered how many high quality ingredients are in it; and it has made a huge difference for me in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;I think the signs of aging showed up on me earlier than most, but I really like the results and everyone around me is asking what I&#x27;m doing differently.</li>
            <li> Seems to work but I think I am allergic to it</li>
            <li> The Product was not sealed..possibly returned, I&#x27;m not sure..it makes me feel like I got used product</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft, my boyfriend cant keep his hands off:) I do see improvement of my wrinkles and puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 months and it&#x27;s one of the reason my complexion looks so soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been asked if I do botox or other procedures and I always tell them about my new skincare regimen. This product is worth it&#x27;s own weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Great for dryness&lt;br /&gt;One of my main complaints about anti-aging creams is how badly they dry me out. I like that I don&#x27;t need any extra moisturizers when using this cream for my fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many creams but this one worked best&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it with a bunch of other creams and ended up returning all but this one. Definitely will use it again and get it for friends.</li>
            <li> Okay. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love DermaSet.  I bought it for my grandmother and it is her favorite anti-aging product on the market and trust me she had lived long enough to try them all.  It smooth’s and brightens the skin like no other and she appreciates the mix of science with nature making it have that effect.  This cream moisturizes without making skin greasy.  She is 63 years old, and she’ve been getting loads of compliments on her skin since she started using this product.  She asked me to post this review for her, because she highly highly recommend using this product!</li>
            <li> Have used products that cost much less and did much more.</li>
