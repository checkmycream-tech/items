            <li> Stetson makes a nice after shave. The aroma is of very freshly tanned leater which is not an entirely good thing. You&#x27;ll be overwhelmed with the sell of raw alcohol at first but, if you like the scent, it will stay with you awhile. One thing. If you&#x27;re near out of aftershave, go buy this in a store because it took me nine days to get mine.</li>
            <li> My husband was impressed and that says alot.  He&#x27;s very picky.  He&#x27;s got great taste in whatever he buys, so if he likes it than it&#x27;s a really good product.  Thank you.</li>
