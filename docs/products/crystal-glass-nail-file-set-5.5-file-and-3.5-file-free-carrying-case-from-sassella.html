            <li>Love it, and is a quality product.</li>
            <li>I spend more time looking for the case and the top of it then the files.</li>
            <li>These are top of the line, a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>The cases help keep track of these as I have lost many nail files, but not these.</li>
            <li>I love these nail files.  </li>
            <li>Love these files.</li>

            <li>I was very impressed with this product, and am ordering more as gifts for my female friends!</li>
            <li>I love the crystal nail files, so much better on my nails compared to the emery boards.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love my files.</li>
            <li>I think they  are better for my nails than the metal files I have been using.  </li>
            <li>love it -</li>
            <li>Thinner means more versatile.</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>I lost one I had had for many years; nothing else comes close except this one - it&#x27;s just like the one I lost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve newly re-discovered these glass nail files and they work just beautifully.  </li>
            <li>easy to slip out of grasp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rinse them after use</li>
            <li>After reading the many reviews and trying to find the right glass nail file I am glad I took a chance and picked this brand.</li>
            <li>No ragged edges, just a fine dust when you are finished filing your nails.  </li>
            <li>The teeth are so fine</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think it would be able to file, but it does so very very well!</li>
            <li>Your nails will be smooth and not snag.</li>
            <li>This particular file is absolutely amazing as it is quick and accurate!  </li>
            <li>This one comes with a great carrying case so it won&#x27;t snap or get lost in the bottom of a big purse.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>these glass nail files leave your nails smooth and no split ends an the nails.  </li>
            <li>If I chip the edge of it, I just smooth it w a piece of sandpaper or emery board.  </li>
            <li>These file swiftly but always leave a smooth finish</li>
            <li>These files are good so far.</li>
            <li>They work great, leave the nail edge super smooth and if you don&#x27;t drop them or otherwise abuse them, they (should) last forever.</li>
            <li>But these beauties were so fine, and files so quickly, it was love at first swipe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy a different kind of nail file!</li>
            <li>I also love that I can clean it by running it under hot water.  </li>
            <li>It files the nail really quickly, leaving smooth edges and no leftover strips of nail.</li>
            <li>They work quickly and my nails are amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li>Just rinse to clean.</li>
            <li>and you can acutally clean them.  </li>
            <li>The files smooth the edges of my nails quickly &amp; easily &amp; they&#x27;re so pretty.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and should last for many years.</li>
            <li>Also great for rough cuticles on sides of nails and some callouses.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these to anyone that likes to take good care of their nails.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying these as gifts for the lady&#x27;s on my list, because I know they&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Also I like the idea that you can quick rinse (or even scrub it with soap and a brush) to keep this product clean.</li>
            <li>I only use crystal nail files now and this was such a great price!  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I received these files in the mail yesterday and was so excited I used them right away.</li>
            <li>Will never go back to a standard emory board, this file is beautifully crafted &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as fine as the previous glass nail files I had purchased years ago at an Art Fair.  </li>
            <li>This crystal file solved the problems: fast and mild!</li>
            <li>I pretty much don&#x27;t use nail clippers anymore because who needs them when this file is so quick and so fine?</li>
            <li>These nail files are SO much better than the old style nail files</li>
            <li>I had a really nice glass file for years that I dropped and broke awhile back.</li>
            <li>I now love my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product, FAST delivery, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>, glad I only paid $2 because of a coupon for the Sally&#x27;s one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I lost the one I had and didn&#x27;t stop searching until I found this very one!</li>
            <li>but it is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>These glass nail files work so much better than regular ones.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the file was double sided.  </li>
            <li>Flower decoration on end is pretty though.</li>
            <li>and I will never use any other kind of files on my nails again.  </li>
            <li>Small kids love the easy and painless way to remove hang nails.</li>
            <li>It quickly files my nails without shredding them (a problem I frequently have with my metal file).  </li>
            <li>All of a sudden they are not as strong as they have been over the years and that could be some of the problem.</li>
            <li>These files are nothing short of amazing,  I shall never use another emery board or other type of file  again, The lcarrying case is very useful</li>
            <li>other files I used in the past have had a good gripping area that is lacking in this product</li>
            <li>I really like this pair</li>
            <li>Really like them, like the 2 sizes and the fact that they come with a case.  </li>
            <li>Yet, the grains are much finer, so is milder to a nail.</li>
            <li>and this one has both sides that can be used and is much thinner!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>But the files do as promised &amp; work very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recommend this set to anyone who wants an easier time handling their nails.</li>
            <li>Always wash gently after use.</li>
            <li>My wife took the larger one and gave me the smaller one, both with their own cases.  </li>
            <li>And as much as I love this, I have no reason to try any other brand.  </li>
            <li>It is so much better than other glass files that I have gotten.  </li>
            <li>maybe they will use profits to make better more expensive product that is higher quality.</li>
            <li>They last for years and keep nails very smooth at the same time.  </li>
            <li>i love having a tiny one to carry in my purse as well as a larger one to keep at home.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I love these glass files which I bought to help bring my nails back to their natural state after two years of getting regular gel manicures.</li>
            <li>I bought these after repeatedly injuring myself on a cheap metal file with sharp edges which used to slip away from the nail and cut my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far it hasn&#x27;t worn out or broken since they&#x27;ve been dropped a few times and its still good as new because these were made in the Czech republic and are one piece of tempered glass with an acid etched grit that is so great for preserving my nail length and helps the peelies to completely stop and ridges will never split down the nail.</li>
            <li>Have ordered more than once because she misplaced old one.</li>
            <li>As a classical guitar player nails are critical and these nail files smooth the nail without tearing it.</li>
            <li>I wash it w a nail brush under running water when it becomes less effective, and when dry, it is like new.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried a crystal nail file - I will not go back to the trarditional ones.  </li>
            <li>This glass nail file has diversity because not only do I file my nails and buff my nails, but I have used it to file certain parts of my skin, normally I would just use nail clippers</li>
            <li>I am just growing my nails out but didn&#x27;t want to use the old nail files they always seemed to crack my nails.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re ready for the next time.</li>
            <li>As long as I remember to file my nails regularly, they no longer split or crack and look better than they have in a long time.</li>
            <li>Glass nail files smooth your nails like no other and do away with those little breaks which grab on to clothing, etc.  </li>
            <li>It does file down quickly so pay attention or your nails</li>
            <li>Since this was my first one, I don&#x27;t have any other brand for comparison.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t waste my money on other brands any more.  </li>
            <li>They took forever to file and got dull quickly even with frequent rinsing.</li>
            <li>I have had it a long time, used it dozens of times, and it is just like new.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike other crystal nail files, these really last (unless they break, and I dropped my first one a lot before that happened)--the texture is etched, not coated, so it doesn&#x27;t wear off with use.</li>
            <li>It takes down the nail really fast and without effort, doesn&#x27;t dull, and leaves my nails smooth as butter.</li>
            <li>To thick too clean under nails.</li>
            <li>It is possible to go back and forth in a sawing motion with these files (instead of one direction only as with old style files).  </li>
            <li>This will file a nail down so much quicker and with no tearing of the nail.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this instead of the other types of nail files or even brands.</li>

            <li> Love it, and is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I spend more time looking for the case and the top of it then the files.</li>
            <li> These are top of the line, a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> The cases help keep track of these as I have lost many nail files, but not these.</li>
            <li> I love these nail files.  </li>
            <li> Love these files.</li>
            <li> But Amazon provides there product at the most generous price.   </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product, and am ordering more as gifts for my female friends!</li>
            <li> I love the crystal nail files, so much better on my nails compared to the emery boards.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I love my files.</li>
            <li> I think they  are better for my nails than the metal files I have been using.  </li>
            <li> love it -</li>
            <li> Thinner means more versatile.</li>
            <li> What could be better?</li>
            <li> I lost one I had had for many years; nothing else comes close except this one - it&#x27;s just like the one I lost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve newly re-discovered these glass nail files and they work just beautifully.  </li>
            <li> easy to slip out of grasp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to rinse them after use</li>
            <li> After reading the many reviews and trying to find the right glass nail file I am glad I took a chance and picked this brand.</li>
            <li> No ragged edges, just a fine dust when you are finished filing your nails.  </li>
            <li> The teeth are so fine</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t think it would be able to file, but it does so very very well!</li>
            <li> Your nails will be smooth and not snag.</li>
            <li> This particular file is absolutely amazing as it is quick and accurate!  </li>
            <li> This one comes with a great carrying case so it won&#x27;t snap or get lost in the bottom of a big purse.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> these glass nail files leave your nails smooth and no split ends an the nails.  </li>
            <li> If I chip the edge of it, I just smooth it w a piece of sandpaper or emery board.  </li>
            <li> These file swiftly but always leave a smooth finish</li>
            <li> These files are good so far.</li>
            <li> They work great, leave the nail edge super smooth and if you don&#x27;t drop them or otherwise abuse them, they (should) last forever.</li>
            <li> But these beauties were so fine, and files so quickly, it was love at first swipe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy a different kind of nail file!</li>
            <li> I also love that I can clean it by running it under hot water.  </li>
            <li> It files the nail really quickly, leaving smooth edges and no leftover strips of nail.</li>
            <li> They work quickly and my nails are amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse to clean.</li>
            <li> and you can acutally clean them.  </li>
            <li> The files smooth the edges of my nails quickly &amp; easily &amp; they&#x27;re so pretty.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and should last for many years.</li>
            <li> Also great for rough cuticles on sides of nails and some callouses.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone that likes to take good care of their nails.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying these as gifts for the lady&#x27;s on my list, because I know they&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Also I like the idea that you can quick rinse (or even scrub it with soap and a brush) to keep this product clean.</li>
            <li> I only use crystal nail files now and this was such a great price!  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I received these files in the mail yesterday and was so excited I used them right away.</li>
            <li> Will never go back to a standard emory board, this file is beautifully crafted &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as fine as the previous glass nail files I had purchased years ago at an Art Fair.  </li>
            <li> This crystal file solved the problems: fast and mild!</li>
            <li> I pretty much don&#x27;t use nail clippers anymore because who needs them when this file is so quick and so fine?</li>
            <li> These nail files are SO much better than the old style nail files</li>
            <li> I had a really nice glass file for years that I dropped and broke awhile back.</li>
            <li> I now love my natural nails.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product, FAST delivery, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> , glad I only paid $2 because of a coupon for the Sally&#x27;s one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I lost the one I had and didn&#x27;t stop searching until I found this very one!</li>
            <li> but it is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> These glass nail files work so much better than regular ones.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the file was double sided.  </li>
            <li> Flower decoration on end is pretty though.</li>
            <li> and I will never use any other kind of files on my nails again.  </li>
            <li> Small kids love the easy and painless way to remove hang nails.</li>
            <li> It quickly files my nails without shredding them (a problem I frequently have with my metal file).  </li>
            <li> All of a sudden they are not as strong as they have been over the years and that could be some of the problem.</li>
            <li> These files are nothing short of amazing,  I shall never use another emery board or other type of file  again, The lcarrying case is very useful</li>
            <li> other files I used in the past have had a good gripping area that is lacking in this product</li>
            <li> I really like this pair</li>
            <li> Really like them, like the 2 sizes and the fact that they come with a case.  </li>
            <li> Yet, the grains are much finer, so is milder to a nail.</li>
            <li> and this one has both sides that can be used and is much thinner!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> But the files do as promised &amp; work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend this set to anyone who wants an easier time handling their nails.</li>
            <li> Always wash gently after use.</li>
            <li> My wife took the larger one and gave me the smaller one, both with their own cases.  </li>
            <li> And as much as I love this, I have no reason to try any other brand.  </li>
            <li> It is so much better than other glass files that I have gotten.  </li>
            <li> maybe they will use profits to make better more expensive product that is higher quality.</li>
            <li> They last for years and keep nails very smooth at the same time.  </li>
            <li> i love having a tiny one to carry in my purse as well as a larger one to keep at home.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I love these glass files which I bought to help bring my nails back to their natural state after two years of getting regular gel manicures.</li>
            <li> I bought these after repeatedly injuring myself on a cheap metal file with sharp edges which used to slip away from the nail and cut my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far it hasn&#x27;t worn out or broken since they&#x27;ve been dropped a few times and its still good as new because these were made in the Czech republic and are one piece of tempered glass with an acid etched grit that is so great for preserving my nail length and helps the peelies to completely stop and ridges will never split down the nail.</li>
            <li> Have ordered more than once because she misplaced old one.</li>
            <li> As a classical guitar player nails are critical and these nail files smooth the nail without tearing it.</li>
            <li> I wash it w a nail brush under running water when it becomes less effective, and when dry, it is like new.  </li>
            <li> First time I tried a crystal nail file - I will not go back to the trarditional ones.  </li>
            <li> This glass nail file has diversity because not only do I file my nails and buff my nails, but I have used it to file certain parts of my skin, normally I would just use nail clippers</li>
            <li> I am just growing my nails out but didn&#x27;t want to use the old nail files they always seemed to crack my nails.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re ready for the next time.</li>
            <li> As long as I remember to file my nails regularly, they no longer split or crack and look better than they have in a long time.</li>
            <li> Glass nail files smooth your nails like no other and do away with those little breaks which grab on to clothing, etc.  </li>
            <li> It does file down quickly so pay attention or your nails</li>
            <li> Since this was my first one, I don&#x27;t have any other brand for comparison.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t waste my money on other brands any more.  </li>
            <li> They took forever to file and got dull quickly even with frequent rinsing.</li>
            <li> I have had it a long time, used it dozens of times, and it is just like new.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other crystal nail files, these really last (unless they break, and I dropped my first one a lot before that happened)--the texture is etched, not coated, so it doesn&#x27;t wear off with use.</li>
            <li> It takes down the nail really fast and without effort, doesn&#x27;t dull, and leaves my nails smooth as butter.</li>
            <li> To thick too clean under nails.</li>
            <li> It is possible to go back and forth in a sawing motion with these files (instead of one direction only as with old style files).  </li>
            <li> This will file a nail down so much quicker and with no tearing of the nail.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this instead of the other types of nail files or even brands.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many emery boards and nail files that end up making my nails flaky since I have very thin nails.</li>
            <li> I got the impression these would last a long time, but frankly regular drugstore emery boards last longer, and are cheaper.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I had to buy another is because I lost my first one ... wont break or dull.</li>
            <li> last for long time</li>
            <li> They will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The only minor complaint I have is that my coloured nail polish remains on the file even after gentle brushing &amp; washing.</li>
            <li> This product files a nail VERY efficient -- perhaps 5 times faster than a common one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I was grinding my nails with rough sand paper, and I&#x27;m never going back to anything else.</li>
            <li> Also some competitors only put etching on one side, so the other side is smooth glass and useless.  </li>
            <li> flower decal thing is new (my files from several years ago did not have this) and looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Also, these are so tiny, they&#x27;re rather difficult to work with if you have large hands.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my toe nails and worked like I expected.</li>
            <li> so I am careful with them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful not to drop them, however, as they will break.  </li>
            <li> Bonus that it comes with a mini version for handbag, careful not to break the glass.  </li>
            <li> It is harder on my nails but</li>
            <li> Noticed material on file face does wear off after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should tries these.  </li>
            <li> The 3.5\\&quot; file, however was broken in a male (my man-person) related incident when he needed to pry something in the car.</li>
            <li> I like that the crystal does not wear down like emory boards and other nail files do.  </li>
            <li> I tried other glass nail files and found them to be coated and fake rather than the real thing.  </li>
            <li> One was so badly made the grit came right off the glass after only a few weeks...terrible.</li>
            <li> So I used to use a nail clipper once every few days, but it&#x27;s not good for the nail -- especially in the dry seasons, my nails get split.</li>
            <li> Would like a smaller plastic case for the small file!</li>
            <li> When I mean thinner, I put them both down on the table long edge to edge and this one was half the height of the other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about a year and a half now</li>
            <li> But a common file takes so long to file even ~0.5 mm of a nail.</li>
            <li> the width of this item is too narrow which presents problems when using.</li>
            <li> I use my other files to do the hard work and then use these to finish my nails.  </li>
            <li> VERY fast cutting so go slowly.</li>
            <li> small one for her purse and a case to protect them.  </li>
            <li> just wish the small file had a case also - so I could keep it in my purse</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with those uber thick nail files, they all seem to be seriously too thick to get under my nails, only the cheapo metal ones are thin until this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set because my nails were really bad for peeling</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received these files in the mail yesterday and was so excited I used them right away. I have gone through so many emery boards and nail files that end up making my nails flaky since I have very thin nails. But these beauties were so fine, and files so quickly, it was love at first swipe. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was grinding my nails with rough sand paper, and I&#x27;m never going back to anything else. I would definitely recommend these to anyone that likes to take good care of their nails.</li>
            <li> this is a re-order - my loved the first set, which didn&#x27;t come in this nice case.  The files are glass, and fragile, so expect to be v.careful, and to replace them at some point.  She was quite happy with the first set, which lasted almost two years.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and always keeps the mini one in her purse.</li>
            <li> Original and best.  Have been using these for years now, can&#x27;t fathom ever going back to non-crystal (or even another brand of crystal) nail file. I pretty much don&#x27;t use nail clippers anymore because who needs them when this file is so quick and so fine? I bring this to the manicurist&#x27;s with me and it gets compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other crystal nail files, these really last (unless they break, and I dropped my first one a lot before that happened)--the texture is etched, not coated, so it doesn&#x27;t wear off with use. I just scrub with a toothbrush and some soap when it gets gunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flower decal thing is new (my files from several years ago did not have this) and looks ridiculous. I scratched mine off. Whatever.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this! After reading the many reviews and trying to find the right glass nail file I am glad I took a chance and picked this brand. I love using my glass nail file; it makes my nails nice and smooth unlike the emery boards, when I do my laundry my nails are not getting snagged. I also like using this to buff my nails. This glass nail file has diversity because not only do I file my nails and buff my nails, but I have used it to file certain parts of my skin, normally I would just use nail clippers but I decided to use the nail file and it was great. Also sometimes I have nails from the side and I could not find the clippers and decided to use the nail file and it worked well. I have used it on my toe nails and worked like I expected. Care and maintenance is simple, just rinse with water and if you want to use soap every now and again. I highly recommend using this instead of the other types of nail files or even brands.</li>
            <li> Glass files are so much better than metal or Emory boards!  Give them a try!</li>
            <li> I really like this pair, they&#x27;re thinner than others (Sally&#x27;s swissco for one) and I can actually get it under the corner of my flatter nails.  When I mean thinner, I put them both down on the table long edge to edge and this one was half the height of the other.  I have a lot of trouble with those uber thick nail files, they all seem to be seriously too thick to get under my nails, only the cheapo metal ones are thin until this one.  Winner in my book, glad I only paid $2 because of a coupon for the Sally&#x27;s one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ve had these for about a year and a half now and I have to say I&#x27;m still very happy with them.  The 3.5\\&quot; file, however was broken in a male (my man-person) related incident when he needed to pry something in the car.</li>
            <li> Best Nail files made. Good  price and I liked the 2 pack. Your nails will be smooth and not snag.</li>
            <li> I heard about glass files awhile back, and I&#x27;ve wanted to try one ever since.  Since this was my first one, I don&#x27;t have any other brand for comparison.  And as much as I love this, I have no reason to try any other brand.  It quickly files my nails without shredding them (a problem I frequently have with my metal file).  I also love that I can clean it by running it under hot water.  I plan on buying these as gifts for the lady&#x27;s on my list, because I know they&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail file ever made!  It is very healthy for your nails and increases the growth process.  It does not splinter the nail ends as others files and emory boards do.  Everyone should be using this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a birthday gift for a friend who broke hers.&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderful nail files.  It was a bonus to be able to get&lt;br /&gt;a small one for her purse and a case to protect them.  She was&lt;br /&gt;delighted!</li>
            <li> Several years ago I had purchased a glass file and it recently broke.  I was hoping that this product that I purchased would be the same, but it was not as sturdy as the one I hoped to replace.  However, it is of good quality and I am sure it will work just fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact file for years and still LOVE IT!!!!  Not all crystal files are the same. This particular file is absolutely amazing as it is quick and accurate!  I lost the one I had and didn&#x27;t stop searching until I found this very one!</li>
            <li> Great nail File. I will never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> No ragged edges, just a fine dust when you are finished filing your nails.  My sisters and nieces love me for introducing them to crystal glass nail files.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and my Niece loved it.  I sent it as a birthday gift.  I have one of these and I will never use any other kind of files on my nails again.  In fact I bought one to use on my dogs.  They do not mind it because it does not give a vibration like regular and metal files do so it does not tickle them.</li>
            <li> I love this file!  It is so much better than other glass files that I have gotten.  It seems to have a finer grit.  Love it!</li>
            <li> great product even to clean under nails. maybe they will use profits to make better more expensive product that is higher quality.</li>
            <li> My daughter raved about the crystal glass nail file she bought on clearance.  She could not find them anywhere later on, so I purchased these and she says they are just as good and she would use nothing else.  Has a handy carrying case to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> this was my 2nd order,love the files!!!</li>
            <li> I only use crystal nail files now and this was such a great price!  I love the colors and it works so well to file my nails.</li>
            <li> I love my Crystal glass nail file set.  They are so much better than the others.  I would not trade them for anything.</li>
            <li> Love it, and is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I like the nail files but the case leaves a lot to be desired. I got it because I always lose or break the glass files in my purse so thought the case would be helpful.  I spend more time looking for the case and the top of it then the files. Have given up and tossed the case so no need to buy this if you are planning on the case being helpful.</li>
            <li> My wife likes these. Have ordered more than once because she misplaced old one.</li>
            <li> These are top of the line, a pleasure to use. The cases help keep track of these as I have lost many nail files, but not these.</li>
            <li> I had not use it but it is so pretty.  I bouthg them as a gift for a freind.  I need to ask her how she liked them.</li>
            <li> I love these nail files.  They last for years and keep nails very smooth at the same time.  They arrived in perfect shape and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Best file EVER invented! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love these files. Quick delivery. This is a great set. I especially like the two sizes. As always you can find great products on AMAZON.!!!</li>
            <li> I use my other files to do the hard work and then use these to finish my nails.  I did a lot of research and ending up getting these.  Really like them, like the 2 sizes and the fact that they come with a case.  They are glass so I am careful with them.  They will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> good file! last for long time</li>
            <li> This product files a nail VERY efficient -- perhaps 5 times faster than a common one. Yet, the grains are much finer, so is milder to a nail. As a piano player, I keep my nails as short as possible. But a common file takes so long to file even ~0.5 mm of a nail. So I used to use a nail clipper once every few days, but it&#x27;s not good for the nail -- especially in the dry seasons, my nails get split. This crystal file solved the problems: fast and mild! And it does NOT wear out.   Also I like the idea that you can quick rinse (or even scrub it with soap and a brush) to keep this product clean. If you go to the manufacturer&#x27;s website, you can even choose the design of the hand-printed motifs on the file. See [...] But Amazon provides there product at the most generous price.   I was very impressed with this product, and am ordering more as gifts for my female friends!</li>
            <li> Great 2 piece glass nail files. They do the job well. Def would buy again!</li>
            <li> I had one already but not as good as this and this one has both sides that can be used and is much thinner!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 sets!</li>
            <li> I love this set! The files smooth the edges of my nails quickly &amp; easily &amp; they&#x27;re so pretty. The only minor complaint I have is that my coloured nail polish remains on the file even after gentle brushing &amp; washing. But the files do as promised &amp; work very well.</li>
            <li> I love the crystal nail files, so much better on my nails compared to the emery boards. I thought one was going to be bigger but these do the job!</li>
            <li> I like that the crystal does not wear down like emory boards and other nail files do.  It does file down quickly so pay attention or your nails may become stubs!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding  bargain on a great set of nail files.  My wife took the larger one and gave me the smaller one, both with their own cases.  Glass nail files smooth your nails like no other and do away with those little breaks which grab on to clothing, etc.  ai would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> This set allows me to keep one in my purse and another somewhere else. I am very happy with the effectiveness of these files. Also very happy with how quickly the item was delivered.</li>
            <li> These glass nail files work so much better than regular ones. I&#x27;ll never buy a different kind of nail file!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve newly re-discovered these glass nail files and they work just beautifully.  Even my husband prefers them.  This one comes with a great carrying case so it won&#x27;t snap or get lost in the bottom of a big purse.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great.As a classical guitar player nails are critical and these nail files smooth the nail without tearing it.VERY fast cutting so go slowly.</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself and as a gift.  It was well received.  Would like a smaller plastic case for the small file!</li>
            <li> I bought this set because my nails were really bad for peeling and I had heard a crystal file might help that. Ive been super happy with the results, my nails are in great shape now that I use this file.</li>
            <li> I bought these after repeatedly injuring myself on a cheap metal file with sharp edges which used to slip away from the nail and cut my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference this glass file makes! The teeth are so fine, I didn&#x27;t think it would be able to file, but it does so very very well! It files the nail really quickly, leaving smooth edges and no leftover strips of nail. It doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on the fingers, like some of the metal files I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad saw this set and loved it too, so I ordered another one for him. I&#x27;ll recommend this set to anyone who wants an easier time handling their nails.</li>
            <li> Best file I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> wonderful set with an awesomely sturdy case to protect my investment. so far it hasn&#x27;t worn out or broken since they&#x27;ve been dropped a few times and its still good as new because these were made in the Czech republic and are one piece of tempered glass with an acid etched grit that is so great for preserving my nail length and helps the peelies to completely stop and ridges will never split down the nail. I will be getting one for the dog as its great for that too and much better for them to have their own.</li>
            <li> Best nail file I have every used...hard to find like this</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to use any pressure, it is so effective. cases work nicely. I will never go back to a metal file.</li>
            <li> these are great files. i love having a tiny one to carry in my purse as well as a larger one to keep at home. the crystal glass file is a great investment, never wearing out like an emery board does. very glad i made this purchase.</li>
            <li> These nail files are SO much better than the old style nail files I&#x27;ve been using forever.  It is possible to go back and forth in a sawing motion with these files (instead of one direction only as with old style files).  They work quickly and my nails are amazingly smooth.  It&#x27;s nice to know that these files can be cleaned and that they are supposed to never wear out.  I&#x27;m careful not to drop them, however, as they will break.  I recommend these files!</li>
            <li> the width of this item is too narrow which presents problems when using. easy to slip out of grasp. other files I used in the past have had a good gripping area that is lacking in this product</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, FAST delivery, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the file was double sided.  Yes, you can use both sides.  They are a bit thicker than a metal file but I will never go back to a metal file.  This will file a nail down so much quicker and with no tearing of the nail.  I love these.</li>
            <li> I love my files. My sister had once. I now have great nails. Thank you for offering these great files for purchace</li>
            <li> I will never use a metal nail file again.  Some say they have gotten glass nail files that. The texture wears off.  Not this one.  I have had it a long time, used it dozens of times, and it is just like new.  Just rinse to clean.</li>
            <li> Will never go back to a standard emory board, this file is beautifully crafted &amp; easy to use.  Bonus that it comes with a mini version for handbag, careful not to break the glass.  Always wash gently after use.</li>
            <li> I like using the glass nail files.  I think they  are better for my nails than the metal files I have been using.  The case Is an added feature.</li>
            <li> I tried other glass nail files and found them to be coated and fake rather than the real thing.  This is a really good product and gave it as a gift also.</li>
            <li> I am just growing my nails out but didn&#x27;t want to use the old nail files they always seemed to crack my nails. These files are good so far.</li>
            <li> First time I tried a crystal nail file - I will not go back to the trarditional ones.  They make a wonderful gift with the pretty flower decorations but that is just cosmetic, with or without the decorations I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I like the nail files with the exception it&#x27;s not as fine as the previous glass nail files I had purchased years ago at an Art Fair.  It is harder on my nails but in all fairness it could be my nails at this point in time.  All of a sudden they are not as strong as they have been over the years and that could be some of the problem.</li>
            <li> love it - just wish the small file had a case also - so I could keep it in my purse</li>
            <li> Great kit and a great price. got it as a gift for my sister and she uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great service. Made for both men and woman. Purchased one in Florida 5 years ago that still works great however I wanted to give them as a present.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with the Crystal Glass File Set. Would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I had a really nice glass file for years that I dropped and broke awhile back. I purchased various glass files from beauty stores trying to replace it without any luck. They took forever to file and got dull quickly even with frequent rinsing. One left my nails all roughed up. One was so badly made the grit came right off the glass after only a few weeks...terrible. Finally I turned to Amazon and hit the jackpot. This Crystal file from Sasella rocks! It takes down the nail really fast and without effort, doesn&#x27;t dull, and leaves my nails smooth as butter. Now that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; bout.</li>
            <li> This is the best file I&#x27;ve ever had.  Have one in each room.  I&#x27;m a gardener who doesn&#x27;t like to wear gloves.</li>
            <li> Noticed material on file face does wear off after only a few uses.  I had bought a crystal nail file years ago that I remember as being superior quality to this one.  Flower decoration on end is pretty though.</li>
            <li> To thick too clean under nails. Otherwise, it works well.</li>
            <li> Everyone should tries these.  They work so well and you can acutally clean them.  I have several different ones for different uses.</li>
            <li> The only reason I had to buy another is because I lost my first one ... wont break or dull. Does a great job on my nails... doesn&#x27;t make them split or crack.</li>
            <li> As I have fragile nails, a glass nail file was suggested to me, something iI had never even heard of.. These files are nothing short of amazing,  I shall never use another emery board or other type of file  again, The lcarrying case is very useful so I dont have to worry about an accidental breakage where I keep them. I have used them for about 2 weeks and it has made looking after my fragile nails a lot easier.</li>
            <li> these glass nail files leave your nails smooth and no split ends an the nails.  Very easy to clean and should last for many years.</li>
            <li> Thinner means more versatile. Also some competitors only put etching on one side, so the other side is smooth glass and useless.  This brand has two useable surfaces that won&#x27;t  wear off like some others... I wash it w a nail brush under running water when it becomes less effective, and when dry, it is like new.  Rigid carrying case is great protection.  If I chip the edge of it, I just smooth it w a piece of sandpaper or emery board.  I won&#x27;t waste my money on other brands any more.  Small kids love the easy and painless way to remove hang nails. Also great for rough cuticles on sides of nails and some callouses.</li>
            <li> I love these glass files which I bought to help bring my nails back to their natural state after two years of getting regular gel manicures. They work great, leave the nail edge super smooth and if you don&#x27;t drop them or otherwise abuse them, they (should) last forever. It&#x27;s easy to rinse them after use so they&#x27;re ready for the next time. As long as I remember to file my nails regularly, they no longer split or crack and look better than they have in a long time. I now love my natural nails.  What could be better?</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long.  I got the impression these would last a long time, but frankly regular drugstore emery boards last longer, and are cheaper.  Also, these are so tiny, they&#x27;re rather difficult to work with if you have large hands.</li>
            <li> I lost one I had had for many years; nothing else comes close except this one - it&#x27;s just like the one I lost.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> I gave a crystal file to all the women in my family for Christmas.  I have one in each purse, my bathroom and my car.  They go through airport scanners.</li>
            <li> I love these files! I would only buy crystal files again, except I probably won&#x27;t ever have to buy another file again (unless I break it). These file swiftly but always leave a smooth finish</li>
