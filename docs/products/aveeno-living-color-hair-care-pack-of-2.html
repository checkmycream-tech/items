            <li>The Aveeno Living Color was used with all family members and found to be a wonderful shampoo product.  </li>
            <li>All the best,    Jay</li>
            <li>Not this set, it&#x27;s been perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pleasant, earthy smelling shampoo</li>
            <li>This shampoo did a great job on Henna treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Just a run of the mill shampoo for me that I can get buying a 99 cent bottle of suave - which comes in some great scent choices</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great for henna colored hair.</li>
            <li>but after using this every day I made it to 8 weeks which was a nice surprise!  </li>
            <li>but it is a pleasant product to use.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel that pleasant.</li>
            <li>The lather is rich, the scent pleasant and best of all it kept my color on longer.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good and keeps my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>, smelled well, had some good ingredients</li>
            <li>Since I received this product through the vine program, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since I&#x27;m always looking for quality products that are at a good price and</li>
            <li>I am really picky about shampoo but this one is really wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I also like a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used a the Aveeno Nourish &amp; Shine shampoo before and liked it alright, so</li>
            <li>For the non-treated hair members of the family, the shampoo was equally effective.    </li>
            <li>And to be honest, I&#x27;m not as picky about shampoos as my wife.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, it lasts and doesn&#x27;t overpower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For this reason, many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; things are popping up and that is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a pleasantly scented shampoo that does what it sets out to do--keep color-treated hair looking fresh.</li>
            <li>My two daughters used most of it and it seemed to do the trick for waist length hair.  </li>
            <li>Better than others?</li>
            <li>like the scent, I like many of the ingredients...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>My hair texture is medium so according to the Aveeno product description, this product should have been appropriate for my colored hair.          </li>
            <li>so I was able to test out its claim of preserving color.  </li>
            <li>Does not strip the color and leave it feeling very clean and silky.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Living Color Shampoo is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I thought a color preserving shampoo would be great, and the bonus was that this Aveeno shampoo is supposed to be more natural.</li>
            <li>The rich lather and nice scent are fine.</li>
            <li>After going through most of a bottle, it seems to be going just fine.</li>
            <li>I love how light my hair feels after using the Living Color shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves it soft and shiny, and my wife doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;fly away\\</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>First - and first impressions - is that this shampoo does smell great.</li>
            <li>but they clean your hair better without stripping it.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s lightweight and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think that it was too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was a bit strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d pay the higher price for it, but when I asked my wife what she thought, she really liked this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo does a great job of leaving it feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Our hair looked fine after using it...</li>
            <li>With that said, this shampoo cleaned my hair just fine.  </li>
            <li>Just fine.</li>
            <li>I like nature&#x27;s gate, kiss my face &amp; jason products but don&#x27;t feel the need to spend huge amounts of money on haircare items.</li>
            <li>It has lupine botanicals which are supposed to smooth the cuticle of the hair and protect colored hair.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t use, even for free.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this shampoo in the mail, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Actually, even if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>In fact, I rarely have a hairstylist not ask me how my hair is so shiny and healthy</li>
            <li>If you have allergies to cheap perfume and cologne, DON&#x27;T buy this.</li>
            <li>The trademark of a good shampoo, for me, leaves my hair soft, light and feathery with lots of body.</li>
            <li>nice-- color lasts well, hair is soft and easy to control.  </li>
            <li>I just want my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>As dictated by my wife:  Shampoo feels clean with a scent that&#x27;s not over-powering.  </li>
            <li>I am going to look into the conditioner next to see if it works and smells as good.  </li>
            <li>I still have a good portion of the bottle left.</li>
            <li>Chock full of &#x27;em.      </li>
            <li>So, overall, a good shampoo that all the family members can use (to reduce bottle clutter in the bathroom), no matter what their hair color situation.</li>
            <li>Works well at bringing out the color from your hair though perhaps not as much as the leave in conditioner that accompany most home hair color treatments.</li>
            <li>For my daughters, all of whom have various degrees of color treated hair, the shampoo was liked better than the premium shampoos they&#x27;d been using at a higher price.    </li>
            <li>I assaociate lathering with clean, and I know that is pretty biased, but I just like that feeling.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice only having to use a wee bit.  </li>
            <li>wife liked the scent as well as the lather and how the shampoo left her hair.  </li>
            <li>It works well, but in my opinion, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Overall I really liked this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth trying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Living Color lives up to that standard quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>They got that part right.</li>
            <li>Less frizz and more shine, and healthy after air drying.</li>
            <li>I used about half the bottle to give a fair review</li>
            <li>They also found that the shampoo left their hair silky, smooth, and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it leaves my hair nice and soft, doesn&#x27;t dull my color, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Luckily this shampoo came up on Amazon Vine right as I had put on new color</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and likely will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it has preserved my color any better than my regular brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty flexible when it comes to hair products and cosmetics</li>
            <li>I normally have great, thick vibrant hair that gets lots of compliments, but this shampoo is not doing it for me.</li>
            <li>In that respect, it&#x27;s similar to other Aveeno shampoo products we&#x27;ve used, all of which have been pleasant alternatives to the industrial strength stuff.</li>
            <li>This shampoo dried out my hair and really didn&#x27;t do anything amazing for it.</li>
            <li>I do like Aveeno products for there gentle qualities</li>
            <li>It is also not densely concentrated, so it is much easier to get out of the bottle than salon products.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much of anything about the color-preservative claim.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product she wants to continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li>for the the real test - how does it work on hair?</li>
            <li>But not worse either.</li>
            <li>so this should have worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I learned much.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, although this was years ago, the public is getting smarter in the U.S. about iingredients as well.  </li>
            <li>They are cheap and used in commercial floor cleaners for stripping.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t lather as much</li>
            <li>but I would never use it long-term, I&#x27;d still opt for sulfate free shampoos above this.ong-term, I&#x27;d still opt for sulfate free shampoos above this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>There are trade-offs and, when all is said and done, we consumers will go with the product that will get the job done in the most natural way possible.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really think of much else to add other than they didn&#x27;t ask me to get any more...    </li>
            <li>New shampoos always do wonders on your hair for the first couple times.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t find that any drugstore brand protects from fading; I do have to pay more for that.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that, unlike similar products, Aveeno&#x27;s color preserving shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>However, it did not help much towards keeping the color vibrant.</li>
            <li>It really is a conventional shampoo, not one that can make any claims to have healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>So, a genuine scientific assessment would have to be done to find out if the small amount of this plant extract really helps protect colored hair in a special way.</li>
            <li>it as a normal shampoo, but don&#x27;t rely too much on it as a color preserver.</li>
            <li>Overall a very lacking item better left in a warehouse somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li>Aveeno Living Color, Color Preserving Shampoo for Medium-Thick Hair makes my hair as soft, silky and shiny as the Fekkai shampoo that costs four times as much, and after using this for a couple of months I&#x27;m certain that it also helps maintain my color as well as Fekkai.  </li>
            <li>My hair was super shiny afterwards, but that was only two uses.  </li>
            <li>The color in my hair stayed vibrant, though I still needed to color it to cover the gray hairs growing in.  </li>
            <li>There is so little lather that I found myself washing my hair twice and using A LOT more shampoo than what I would use normally to get the same clean feeling that I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>But they are a high foaming agent.  </li>
            <li>Last week I was complimented twice on my hair -- a real thrill at my age !!</li>
            <li>It feels like it never gets dry, never gets clean, almost as if I haven&#x27;t rinsed the shampoo out all the way...</li>
            <li>In fact, my color has pretty much stayed the same - judging from my eyes - since having it done.</li>
            <li>While it cleaned my hair just fine, I didn&#x27;t have any noticeable positive changes after using it for a few weeks, which is what would make me return to a product over and over.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it really preserves the color any better than any other shampoo, either, and it&#x27;s definitely not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as it claims on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bouncy, shiny, soft and smooth and the color has not faded as fast as it would with other shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li>(Pack of 2)]]) if you would like to preserve the shine of a newly dyed hair.</li>
            <li>I usually can simply blow dry my hair while crunching it with my fingers and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid to try this after many many failed attempts to find a good color preserving shampoo.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, since I began using it on a regular basis I have not had the usual lightening of the hair color or highlights.</li>
            <li>I generally have to color my hair every 8-12 weeks (depending on how much my roots show) to keep my hair looking natural.</li>
            <li>I have trouble finding a good shampoo that isn&#x27;t going to flatten my hair while trying to preserve the color, and conditioners just tend to weigh it down as well.</li>
            <li>I recently colored my hair and this seems to be doing it&#x27;s job as my grays aren&#x27;t coming back out as quickly.  </li>
            <li>I got the shampoo because I like Aveeno products and because, while Fekkai shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling really soft and (for the first time) really manageable, I was hoping for something close to the same result with a natural shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more floral than I would like, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li>Eliminating them not only keeps your hair in amazing shape without stripping it, maintains shine, but it also creates a thicker head of hair--or at least prevents the hair loss occurring from sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only needed a dime-sized amount and it lathered up really well.  </li>
            <li>and I have medium-thick hair that I color to be close to my natural color</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, given the performance and the definitely un-natural ingredients, I don&#x27;t know why Aveeno is charging so much for this.  </li>
            <li>In addition, this product did not preserve the dark color of my hair and after only a week of use, I could tell a noticeable change in my hair color - my dark brown hair was a lot lighter, more golden.      </li>
            <li>Gentle enough</li>
            <li>but I feel it is not a harsh shampoo.</li>
            <li>You do have to use more the recommended amount if your hair is thick.  </li>
            <li>I have been coloring my hair for 30 years, so it&#x27;s pretty dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and natural, not an overwhelming chemical perfume.  </li>
            <li>Normally my color only lasts 6 weeks max</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean and soft after shampooing, and the coloring stayed longer than when I used non-color preserving shampoo in the past.  </li>
            <li>I usually need a lot more shampoo for my long hair but</li>
            <li>As someone who worked in cosmetic ingredient sales (selling them to the scientists and major manufacturers, not selling cosmetics)</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s fine as a shampoo</li>
            <li>unfortunately what holds me back from loving this is that it contains sulfates.  </li>
            <li>Color Preserving Shampoo for the past month, just after my last salon appointment and have found that my hair color hasn&#x27;t been as quick to fade or lose vibrancy or shine.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I thought I hadn&#x27;t gotten all the shampoo out, but that wasn&#x27;t it...</li>
            <li>granted, the sulfate used is better than SLS which is the most common, but it&#x27;s still a bad thing.</li>

            <li> If you have allergies to cheap perfume and cologne, DON&#x27;T buy this.</li>
            <li> The trademark of a good shampoo, for me, leaves my hair soft, light and feathery with lots of body.</li>
            <li> nice-- color lasts well, hair is soft and easy to control.  </li>
            <li> I just want my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> As dictated by my wife:  Shampoo feels clean with a scent that&#x27;s not over-powering.  </li>
            <li> I am going to look into the conditioner next to see if it works and smells as good.  </li>
            <li> I still have a good portion of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> Chock full of &#x27;em.      </li>
            <li> So, overall, a good shampoo that all the family members can use (to reduce bottle clutter in the bathroom), no matter what their hair color situation.</li>
            <li> Works well at bringing out the color from your hair though perhaps not as much as the leave in conditioner that accompany most home hair color treatments.</li>
            <li> For my daughters, all of whom have various degrees of color treated hair, the shampoo was liked better than the premium shampoos they&#x27;d been using at a higher price.    </li>
            <li> I assaociate lathering with clean, and I know that is pretty biased, but I just like that feeling.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice only having to use a wee bit.  </li>
            <li> wife liked the scent as well as the lather and how the shampoo left her hair.  </li>
            <li> It works well, but in my opinion, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Overall I really liked this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth trying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Living Color lives up to that standard quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> They got that part right.</li>
            <li> Less frizz and more shine, and healthy after air drying.</li>
            <li> I used about half the bottle to give a fair review</li>
            <li> They also found that the shampoo left their hair silky, smooth, and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it leaves my hair nice and soft, doesn&#x27;t dull my color, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Luckily this shampoo came up on Amazon Vine right as I had put on new color</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and likely will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it has preserved my color any better than my regular brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty flexible when it comes to hair products and cosmetics</li>
            <li> I normally have great, thick vibrant hair that gets lots of compliments, but this shampoo is not doing it for me.</li>
            <li> In that respect, it&#x27;s similar to other Aveeno shampoo products we&#x27;ve used, all of which have been pleasant alternatives to the industrial strength stuff.</li>
            <li> This shampoo dried out my hair and really didn&#x27;t do anything amazing for it.</li>
            <li> I do like Aveeno products for there gentle qualities</li>
            <li> It is also not densely concentrated, so it is much easier to get out of the bottle than salon products.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much of anything about the color-preservative claim.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product she wants to continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> for the the real test - how does it work on hair?</li>
            <li> But not worse either.</li>
            <li> so this should have worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> I learned much.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, although this was years ago, the public is getting smarter in the U.S. about iingredients as well.  </li>
            <li> They are cheap and used in commercial floor cleaners for stripping.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t lather as much</li>
            <li> but I would never use it long-term, I&#x27;d still opt for sulfate free shampoos above this.ong-term, I&#x27;d still opt for sulfate free shampoos above this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> There are trade-offs and, when all is said and done, we consumers will go with the product that will get the job done in the most natural way possible.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really think of much else to add other than they didn&#x27;t ask me to get any more...    </li>
            <li> New shampoos always do wonders on your hair for the first couple times.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I don&#x27;t find that any drugstore brand protects from fading; I do have to pay more for that.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that, unlike similar products, Aveeno&#x27;s color preserving shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> However, it did not help much towards keeping the color vibrant.</li>
            <li> It really is a conventional shampoo, not one that can make any claims to have healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> So, a genuine scientific assessment would have to be done to find out if the small amount of this plant extract really helps protect colored hair in a special way.</li>
            <li> it as a normal shampoo, but don&#x27;t rely too much on it as a color preserver.</li>
            <li> Overall a very lacking item better left in a warehouse somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> Aveeno Living Color, Color Preserving Shampoo for Medium-Thick Hair makes my hair as soft, silky and shiny as the Fekkai shampoo that costs four times as much, and after using this for a couple of months I&#x27;m certain that it also helps maintain my color as well as Fekkai.  </li>
            <li> My hair was super shiny afterwards, but that was only two uses.  </li>
            <li> The color in my hair stayed vibrant, though I still needed to color it to cover the gray hairs growing in.  </li>
            <li> There is so little lather that I found myself washing my hair twice and using A LOT more shampoo than what I would use normally to get the same clean feeling that I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> But they are a high foaming agent.  </li>
            <li> Last week I was complimented twice on my hair -- a real thrill at my age !!</li>
            <li> It feels like it never gets dry, never gets clean, almost as if I haven&#x27;t rinsed the shampoo out all the way...</li>
            <li> In fact, my color has pretty much stayed the same - judging from my eyes - since having it done.</li>
            <li> While it cleaned my hair just fine, I didn&#x27;t have any noticeable positive changes after using it for a few weeks, which is what would make me return to a product over and over.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it really preserves the color any better than any other shampoo, either, and it&#x27;s definitely not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as it claims on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bouncy, shiny, soft and smooth and the color has not faded as fast as it would with other shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li> (Pack of 2)]]) if you would like to preserve the shine of a newly dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I usually can simply blow dry my hair while crunching it with my fingers and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to try this after many many failed attempts to find a good color preserving shampoo.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, since I began using it on a regular basis I have not had the usual lightening of the hair color or highlights.</li>
            <li> I generally have to color my hair every 8-12 weeks (depending on how much my roots show) to keep my hair looking natural.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding a good shampoo that isn&#x27;t going to flatten my hair while trying to preserve the color, and conditioners just tend to weigh it down as well.</li>
            <li> I recently colored my hair and this seems to be doing it&#x27;s job as my grays aren&#x27;t coming back out as quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got the shampoo because I like Aveeno products and because, while Fekkai shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling really soft and (for the first time) really manageable, I was hoping for something close to the same result with a natural shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more floral than I would like, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Eliminating them not only keeps your hair in amazing shape without stripping it, maintains shine, but it also creates a thicker head of hair--or at least prevents the hair loss occurring from sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only needed a dime-sized amount and it lathered up really well.  </li>
            <li> and I have medium-thick hair that I color to be close to my natural color</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, given the performance and the definitely un-natural ingredients, I don&#x27;t know why Aveeno is charging so much for this.  </li>
            <li> In addition, this product did not preserve the dark color of my hair and after only a week of use, I could tell a noticeable change in my hair color - my dark brown hair was a lot lighter, more golden.      </li>
            <li> Gentle enough</li>
            <li> but I feel it is not a harsh shampoo.</li>
            <li> You do have to use more the recommended amount if your hair is thick.  </li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for 30 years, so it&#x27;s pretty dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and natural, not an overwhelming chemical perfume.  </li>
            <li> Normally my color only lasts 6 weeks max</li>
            <li> Hair feels clean and soft after shampooing, and the coloring stayed longer than when I used non-color preserving shampoo in the past.  </li>
            <li> I usually need a lot more shampoo for my long hair but</li>
            <li> As someone who worked in cosmetic ingredient sales (selling them to the scientists and major manufacturers, not selling cosmetics)</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s fine as a shampoo</li>
            <li> unfortunately what holds me back from loving this is that it contains sulfates.  </li>
            <li> Color Preserving Shampoo for the past month, just after my last salon appointment and have found that my hair color hasn&#x27;t been as quick to fade or lose vibrancy or shine.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I thought I hadn&#x27;t gotten all the shampoo out, but that wasn&#x27;t it...</li>
            <li> granted, the sulfate used is better than SLS which is the most common, but it&#x27;s still a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Just before receiving my Aveeno Living Color shampoo, I had my hair colored - back to my natural dark brown and added caramel highlights.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to make the shampoo \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; it just falls flat on its face as a shampoo at all.    </li>
            <li> While using this shampoo, my hair lacked body and felt flat.  </li>
            <li> The normal everyday shampoo I typically use is Matrix Biolage for color treated hair so in fairness, I&#x27;m comparing the Aveeno product against a professional \\&quot;salon\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and it lathers like crazy</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not natural.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair soft but it took a few uses to determine it was the reason I was sneezing, had watery eyes and a headache.</li>
            <li> but really no different than with other shampoos we use.</li>
            <li> I think the naturals thing is just hype and advertising and the ingredients list isn&#x27;t all that different from any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> This works well for me although due to the sulfates I only use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have dark, color treated (Redken professional line) thick hair that has a tendency to \\&quot;trap\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner in my roots causing my hair to get greasy and flat if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> My hair is limp and icky even right after a wash and dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman with thick, coarse wavy hair that is starting to go gray.  </li>
            <li> Like other color perserving shampoos, the Aveeno Living Color leaves your hair feeling a bit \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; than regular shampoo but its weight was noticeably lighter than the \\&quot;heaviness\\&quot; that some of the other color preservative shampoos seem to leave.    </li>
            <li> with this shampoo I only needed a little bit.  </li>
            <li> As for \\&quot;preserving color,\\&quot; it left my blonde highlights looking dull.</li>
            <li> I color my hair at home every few months, and have thick straight</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using this shampoo, my hair feels flat, filmy, and oily.</li>
            <li> I try to use green products as much as possible since I don&#x27;t like chemicals going down the drain.</li>
            <li> What I initially realized when using this product is that there is very little lather.  </li>
            <li> And other ingredients would hold color longer</li>
            <li> The Aveena shampoo, in my experience, simply didn&#x27;t come close to the quality I get from my usual shampoo</li>
            <li> It does what it promises to do, it helped my hair color last longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I noticed that this shampoo is not as thick as my regular shampoo, I&#x27;m not sure if Aveeno&#x27;s other shampoos are the same since I have not tried any others from this brand.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the scent.</li>
            <li> Given that this is advertised as being for Medium-Thick hair, I presumed it would have little to no body-building properties, but it&#x27;s enough for me (someone who once had fairly thick hair that is now noticeably thinner as I progress through menopause).  </li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for years and hate how quickly the color starts to fade and the grey begins to show.  </li>
            <li> guess my first disappointment came when I took a look at the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too, even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of sudding but not alot with the amount recommended.  </li>
            <li> I also found it to be a little drying, ended up with frizzies.  </li>
            <li> And frankly, looking at the ingredients, it&#x27;s a little too chemically heavy in its composition for me.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and I use demi-permanent hair color-bright red.</li>
            <li> So I try to find a shampoo that moisturizes, protects my color, and still lets my hair be fluffy.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s sort of a yucky, limp, moisture.  </li>
            <li> FLUFFY:  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this formula was no different than the other color preserving shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about its claim for preserving color though as I did not notice the color staying for longer than usual.</li>
            <li> In addition, this product felt like it left a heavy film on my hair which made it virtually impossible to style.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly style my hair with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Because I never use sulfates, my color stays in longer, my hair doesn&#x27;t get split and dull, and I condition.</li>
            <li> At least that what I think.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the performance on my hair at least was about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have fairly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is medium to thick in your hand, and lathers well.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very strong (and bad!!), and it made me have miserable allergies due to the scent which stayed in my hair for several hours.</li>
            <li> but then neither did the regular, over-the-counter shampoo that&#x27;s not advertised as being tailor-made for colored hair work badly.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is quite artificial and the body of the shampoo is just a little too thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> the reality is that foam equals BAD in shampoos because it means it contains harsh stripping sulfates.  </li>
            <li> We are skeptical about that...</li>
            <li> If you like shampoos that lather well and thick on your head, you might hate this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t work badly</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and would stick with Suave or VO5.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am really picky about shampoo but this one is really wonderful.  The smell is lovely and it lathers like crazy so you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it.  I have short hair so it&#x27;s nice only having to use a wee bit.  I recently colored my hair and this seems to be doing it&#x27;s job as my grays aren&#x27;t coming back out as quickly.  At least that what I think.  I am going to look into the conditioner next to see if it works and smells as good.  I do like Aveeno products for there gentle qualities so I say a thumbs up on this product.  I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> We like this shampoo. The rich lather and nice scent are fine. It has lupine botanicals which are supposed to smooth the cuticle of the hair and protect colored hair. Our hair looked fine after using it...but really no different than with other shampoos we use. So, a genuine scientific assessment would have to be done to find out if the small amount of this plant extract really helps protect colored hair in a special way. We are skeptical about that... but it is a pleasant product to use.</li>
            <li> I generally have to color my hair every 8-12 weeks (depending on how much my roots show) to keep my hair looking natural. Just before receiving my Aveeno Living Color shampoo, I had my hair colored - back to my natural dark brown and added caramel highlights. Amazingly, since I began using it on a regular basis I have not had the usual lightening of the hair color or highlights. In fact, my color has pretty much stayed the same - judging from my eyes - since having it done. I have yet to go back in and have my hair redone (which is saving me quite a bit of money!). I love how light my hair feels after using the Living Color shampoo. A little goes a long way, too, even with my thick hair. I still have a good portion of the bottle left. The only negative is the scent. It&#x27;s a little more floral than I would like, but that&#x27;s a personal preference. All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and likely will continue to purchase it. I figure I can always use a different conditioner and cover up that flowery smell.</li>
            <li> This is a pleasantly scented shampoo that does what it sets out to do--keep color-treated hair looking fresh. However, I personally found it too drying for my already too-dry hair. I had to put on a load of conditioner. And frankly, looking at the ingredients, it&#x27;s a little too chemically heavy in its composition for me. It really is a conventional shampoo, not one that can make any claims to have healthy ingredients. This shampoo does contain sulfates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that, unlike similar products, Aveeno&#x27;s color preserving shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean.  It is also not densely concentrated, so it is much easier to get out of the bottle than salon products.  The results are nice-- color lasts well, hair is soft and easy to control.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the [[ASIN:B004D267RG Aveeno Living Color, Color Preserving Shampoo, for Medium-thick Hair, 0.817-Pound (Pack of 2)]]. The fragrance is quite artificial and the body of the shampoo is just a little too thick and creamy. It just doesn&#x27;t feel that pleasant. I think the naturals thing is just hype and advertising and the ingredients list isn&#x27;t all that different from any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman with thick, coarse wavy hair that is starting to go gray.  I only get my hair cut and colored once every four to six months because it is just too expensive to do it more often, so using a color preserving shampoo (and conditioner) is a must. I&#x27;ve used the Aveeno Living Color, Color Preserving Shampoo for the past month, just after my last salon appointment and have found that my hair color hasn&#x27;t been as quick to fade or lose vibrancy or shine.  Last week I was complimented twice on my hair -- a real thrill at my age !!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have fairly thick hair.  This shampoo does a great job of leaving it feeling clean and soft.  The fragrance is subtle and natural, not an overwhelming chemical perfume.  I can&#x27;t say much of anything about the color-preservative claim.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my blond hair or my wife&#x27;s chocolate-brown hair.  The shampoo leaves it soft and shiny, and my wife doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; hairs with this product.  In that respect, it&#x27;s similar to other Aveeno shampoo products we&#x27;ve used, all of which have been pleasant alternatives to the industrial strength stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for 30 years, so it&#x27;s pretty dry and damaged.  It&#x27;s also thick and wavy.  So I try to find a shampoo that moisturizes, protects my color, and still lets my hair be fluffy.  I also like a nice smell.  And fewer chemicals.   So...yeah... I&#x27;m picky.    MOISTURIZING:  Yes, this shampoo is moisturizing enough that I can get away without a conditioner if rushed.  But it&#x27;s sort of a yucky, limp, moisture.  I don&#x27;t like the feeling.    COLOR:  I don&#x27;t note that this product protects my color at all.  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t find that any drugstore brand protects from fading; I do have to pay more for that.    FLUFFY:  Not.  My hair is limp and icky even right after a wash and dry.  The first few times I thought I hadn&#x27;t gotten all the shampoo out, but that wasn&#x27;t it... it&#x27;s just this product - it flattens my hair.    SMELL:  *gag*      CHEMICALS:  Chock full of &#x27;em.      BOTTOM LINE:  Wouldn&#x27;t buy.  Won&#x27;t use, even for free.  I used about half the bottle to give a fair review but I won&#x27;t be finishing it.</li>
            <li> If you like shampoos that lather well and thick on your head, you might hate this.  I assaociate lathering with clean, and I know that is pretty biased, but I just like that feeling.  I felt as if I was just putting cream in my hair.  There was a little bit of sudding but not alot with the amount recommended.  I had a sample pack, so I can&#x27;t say that I have enough knowledge to recommend it based on color treatment.    My hair was super shiny afterwards, but that was only two uses.  New shampoos always do wonders on your hair for the first couple times.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try this after many many failed attempts to find a good color preserving shampoo. I&#x27;d used a the Aveeno Nourish &amp; Shine shampoo before and liked it alright, so I figured I&#x27;d try this one and see if I couldn&#x27;t extend the time between dye jobs. Unfortunately, this formula was no different than the other color preserving shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. In an attempt to make the shampoo \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; it just falls flat on its face as a shampoo at all.    After just a few days of using this shampoo, my hair feels flat, filmy, and oily. I normally have great, thick vibrant hair that gets lots of compliments, but this shampoo is not doing it for me. I can hardly style my hair with this shampoo. It feels like it never gets dry, never gets clean, almost as if I haven&#x27;t rinsed the shampoo out all the way...but after a second and third rinse, nope, not the case! It&#x27;s the product itself.    I can&#x27;t say that it really preserves the color any better than any other shampoo, either, and it&#x27;s definitely not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as it claims on the bottle. I think I&#x27;ll risk it and go back to something else, color be damned!</li>
            <li> This shampoo did a great job on Henna treated hair.  Does not strip the color and leave it feeling very clean and silky.</li>
            <li> The Aveeno Living Color was used with all family members and found to be a wonderful shampoo product.  For my daughters, all of whom have various degrees of color treated hair, the shampoo was liked better than the premium shampoos they&#x27;d been using at a higher price.    The Positives:  All of the females in the family found that the the Aveeno had a decidely nicer after-shampoo scent left in the hair.    They also found that the shampoo left their hair silky, smooth, and tangle free.  For the non-treated hair members of the family, the shampoo was equally effective.    Nuetral:  Like other color perserving shampoos, the Aveeno Living Color leaves your hair feeling a bit \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; than regular shampoo but its weight was noticeably lighter than the \\&quot;heaviness\\&quot; that some of the other color preservative shampoos seem to leave.    So, overall, a good shampoo that all the family members can use (to reduce bottle clutter in the bathroom), no matter what their hair color situation.</li>
            <li> My wife likes Aveeno products, so we tried this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t color my hair, but my wife does.  And to be honest, I&#x27;m not as picky about shampoos as my wife.  I just want my hair clean.  With that said, this shampoo cleaned my hair just fine.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d pay the higher price for it, but when I asked my wife what she thought, she really liked this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife liked the scent as well as the lather and how the shampoo left her hair.  It&#x27;s a product she wants to continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> I thought a color preserving shampoo would be great, and the bonus was that this Aveeno shampoo is supposed to be more natural. I try to use green products as much as possible since I don&#x27;t like chemicals going down the drain. I like nature&#x27;s gate, kiss my face &amp; jason products but don&#x27;t feel the need to spend huge amounts of money on haircare items. I color my hair at home every few months, and have thick straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Honestly, I didn&#x27;t love this shampoo. While it cleaned my hair just fine, I didn&#x27;t have any noticeable positive changes after using it for a few weeks, which is what would make me return to a product over and over. Just a run of the mill shampoo for me that I can get buying a 99 cent bottle of suave - which comes in some great scent choices so I can switch it up now and then.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I thought it was pretty good. It cleans well and it has a scent but I didn&#x27;t think that it was too strong or overpowering. I noticed that this shampoo is not as thick as my regular shampoo, I&#x27;m not sure if Aveeno&#x27;s other shampoos are the same since I have not tried any others from this brand. It works well, but in my opinion, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Living Color Shampoo is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  I only needed a dime-sized amount and it lathered up really well.  I usually need a lot more shampoo for my long hair but with this shampoo I only needed a little bit.  It also smells really good and keeps my hair shiny.  The color in my hair stayed vibrant, though I still needed to color it to cover the gray hairs growing in.  Overall I really liked this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was a bit strong for my taste.  Lots and lots of lather!!  My two daughters used most of it and it seemed to do the trick for waist length hair.  Can&#x27;t really think of much else to add other than they didn&#x27;t ask me to get any more...    All the best,    Jay</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo in the mail, so I decided to try it. Big mistake. It left my hair really fragile and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell. The shampoo left my hair feeling sticky and gross. As for \\&quot;preserving color,\\&quot; it left my blonde highlights looking dull. It&#x27;s not even worth trying.</li>
            <li> First - and first impressions - is that this shampoo does smell great. They got that part right. The scent is nice, it lasts and doesn&#x27;t overpower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the the real test - how does it work on hair? Just fine. After going through most of a bottle, it seems to be going just fine. Better than others? Well. No, not that I can tell. I can&#x27;t say it has preserved my color any better than my regular brand. But not worse either. Which is to say it works as described and that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only knock - and others have noted this too - are the ingredients. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff in here - sulfates, for example - that simply don&#x27;t need to be there. Aveeno - look for alternatives. There are trade-offs and, when all is said and done, we consumers will go with the product that will get the job done in the most natural way possible.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great.  I won&#x27;t go on and on about it...it&#x27;s shampoo, afterall.  I will say that it leaves my hair nice and soft, doesn&#x27;t dull my color, and smells nice.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend if you color your hair.  Actually, even if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo because I like Aveeno products and because, while Fekkai shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling really soft and (for the first time) really manageable, I was hoping for something close to the same result with a natural shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my first disappointment came when I took a look at the ingredients.  They&#x27;re not natural.  My second was the performance.  I mean, it&#x27;s fine as a shampoo and I have medium-thick hair that I color to be close to my natural color so this should have worked really well for me.  And it didn&#x27;t work badly but then neither did the regular, over-the-counter shampoo that&#x27;s not advertised as being tailor-made for colored hair work badly.  In fact, the performance on my hair at least was about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, given the performance and the definitely un-natural ingredients, I don&#x27;t know why Aveeno is charging so much for this.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> As someone who worked in cosmetic ingredient sales (selling them to the scientists and major manufacturers, not selling cosmetics) I learned much.  Fortunately, although this was years ago, the public is getting smarter in the U.S. about iingredients as well.  For this reason, many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; things are popping up and that is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent, I like many of the ingredients...unfortunately what holds me back from loving this is that it contains sulfates.  In Europe sulfates are avoided as they strip your hair of shine and color. And everyone there knows it. They are cheap and used in commercial floor cleaners for stripping. But they are a high foaming agent.  In the U.S., unfortunately, we incorrectly equate foam with \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and since they are inexpensive, you&#x27;ll find sulfates in most shampoos. Foam has nothing to do with how well it cleans and the reality is that foam equals BAD in shampoos because it means it contains harsh stripping sulfates.  However, now that the public has gotten smarter, you&#x27;ll also find loads of shampoos now finally saying \\&quot;no sulfates!\\&quot; on the front. This is why.  They don&#x27;t lather as much but they clean your hair better without stripping it.  In fact, I rarely have a hairstylist not ask me how my hair is so shiny and healthy yet I color it. It has a gloss. Because I never use sulfates, my color stays in longer, my hair doesn&#x27;t get split and dull, and I condition. Additionally, as we age our hair gets thinner. Sulfates actually CAUSE hair loss. Eliminating them not only keeps your hair in amazing shape without stripping it, maintains shine, but it also creates a thicker head of hair--or at least prevents the hair loss occurring from sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now granted, the sulfate used is better than SLS which is the most common, but it&#x27;s still a bad thing. And other ingredients would hold color longer so I don&#x27;t understand the reasoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it cleaned well, smelled well, had some good ingredients but I would never use it long-term, I&#x27;d still opt for sulfate free shampoos above this.ong-term, I&#x27;d still opt for sulfate free shampoos above this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner. I have very thick hair, and I use demi-permanent hair color-bright red. I have trouble finding a good shampoo that isn&#x27;t going to flatten my hair while trying to preserve the color, and conditioners just tend to weigh it down as well. Not this set, it&#x27;s been perfect. My hair looks fabulous! It&#x27;s bouncy, shiny, soft and smooth and the color has not faded as fast as it would with other shampoo/conditioners. It&#x27;s also easier to style. I recommend it, no it&#x27;s not \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;, but it works like a champ.</li>
            <li> Works well at bringing out the color from your hair though perhaps not as much as the leave in conditioner that accompany most home hair color treatments.</li>
            <li> I have dark, color treated (Redken professional line) thick hair that has a tendency to \\&quot;trap\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner in my roots causing my hair to get greasy and flat if I&#x27;m not careful. The trademark of a good shampoo, for me, leaves my hair soft, light and feathery with lots of body. Aveeno Living Color lives up to that standard quite nicely.  It&#x27;s a very pleasant, earthy smelling shampoo that&#x27;s lightweight and rinses easily.  It leaves my hair soft and smelling great. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Aveeno Living Color, Color Preserving Shampoo for Medium-Thick Hair makes my hair as soft, silky and shiny as the Fekkai shampoo that costs four times as much, and after using this for a couple of months I&#x27;m certain that it also helps maintain my color as well as Fekkai.  Given that this is advertised as being for Medium-Thick hair, I presumed it would have little to no body-building properties, but it&#x27;s enough for me (someone who once had fairly thick hair that is now noticeably thinner as I progress through menopause).  Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The one thing I can say about this shampoo is that it does a thorough job of cleaning your hair without harshness. I don&#x27;t know about its claim for preserving color though as I did not notice the color staying for longer than usual. The smell is not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;Use it as a normal shampoo, but don&#x27;t rely too much on it as a color preserver.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all.  Since I received this product through the vine program, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since I&#x27;m always looking for quality products that are at a good price and there appeared to be a lot of favorable reviews for this product so I was hopefully optimistic.      The normal everyday shampoo I typically use is Matrix Biolage for color treated hair so in fairness, I&#x27;m comparing the Aveeno product against a professional \\&quot;salon\\&quot; product. My hair texture is medium so according to the Aveeno product description, this product should have been appropriate for my colored hair.          What I initially realized when using this product is that there is very little lather.  There is so little lather that I found myself washing my hair twice and using A LOT more shampoo than what I would use normally to get the same clean feeling that I&#x27;m used to.  In addition, this product felt like it left a heavy film on my hair which made it virtually impossible to style.  I usually can simply blow dry my hair while crunching it with my fingers and it looks great.  While using this shampoo, my hair lacked body and felt flat.  In addition, this product did not preserve the dark color of my hair and after only a week of use, I could tell a noticeable change in my hair color - my dark brown hair was a lot lighter, more golden.      I would not purchase this product in the future.  I&#x27;m pretty flexible when it comes to hair products and cosmetics and I definitely will use a department store brand when I find a quality product.  The Aveena shampoo, in my experience, simply didn&#x27;t come close to the quality I get from my usual shampoo and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it nor use it again in the future.</li>
            <li> This shampoo dried out my hair and really didn&#x27;t do anything amazing for it. I was very disappointed and would stick with Suave or VO5. Overall a very lacking item better left in a warehouse somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> I did not find this shampoo to help my hair color.  I also found it to be a little drying, ended up with frizzies.  The smell is nice, but I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> As dictated by my wife:  Shampoo feels clean with a scent that&#x27;s not over-powering.  The consistency is medium to thick in your hand, and lathers well.  You do have to use more the recommended amount if your hair is thick.  Hair feels clean and soft after shampooing, and the coloring stayed longer than when I used non-color preserving shampoo in the past.  Less frizz and more shine, and healthy after air drying.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for years and hate how quickly the color starts to fade and the grey begins to show.  Luckily this shampoo came up on Amazon Vine right as I had put on new color so I was able to test out its claim of preserving color.  Normally my color only lasts 6 weeks max but after using this every day I made it to 8 weeks which was a nice surprise!  The lather is rich, the scent pleasant and best of all it kept my color on longer.</li>
            <li> I do like this color preserving shampoo. It does what it promises to do, it helped my hair color last longer than usual. However, it did not help much towards keeping the color vibrant. I think you might need to use another hair product (like this Shine Glaze from the same line [[ASIN:B004D2DQ6G Aveeno Living Color, Color Preserving Shine Glaze, 4 Fl Oz. (Pack of 2)]]) if you would like to preserve the shine of a newly dyed hair.</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft but it took a few uses to determine it was the reason I was sneezing, had watery eyes and a headache. The scent is very strong (and bad!!), and it made me have miserable allergies due to the scent which stayed in my hair for several hours. If you have allergies to cheap perfume and cologne, DON&#x27;T buy this. This is going in the garbage!</li>
            <li> This works well for me although due to the sulfates I only use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Works great for henna colored hair. Gentle enough and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner with this shampoo. Can&#x27;t say if it preserves my color but I feel it is not a harsh shampoo.</li>
