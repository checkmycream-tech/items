            <li>I love love love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I guess.</li>
            <li>Prices on theseroducts can vary so I was happy to find all 3 at what is normally the price of just shampoo.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li>I easily got a return no problem.</li>
            <li>Vendor was easy to work with.</li>

            <li>Super quick shipping!</li>
            <li>I did the brazilian blowout more than a month ago and bought this to maintain it as much as I can.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, Will buy again.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, and it did the bare minimum of what I expected.</li>
            <li>My favorite product for my naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine shoulder legnth very curly hair ...</li>
            <li>It keeps hair straight and smooth up to 4 days in spite of humidity or till you wash it.</li>
            <li>I still did not need to use the masque cause the shampoo and conditioner leaves the hair s√≥ nice that its is almost enough!</li>
            <li>This treatment will make you hair more controllable, will take away all the freeze and make the straightening process with a flat iron waaaay easier and faster, specially if using the thermal balm.</li>
            <li>exactly what i buy at l</li>
            <li>This treatment wont change your hair in a way that if you have it curly it will make it straight.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I have a brazillian blowout and have not found anything else that makes my hair straight and shiney.</li>
            <li>The products really help to keep it that way.</li>
            <li>The seller, however, was very gracious &amp; allowed me to return for a refund</li>
            <li>I can get my hair silky straight, I need products to hold the style &amp; keep it straight.</li>
            <li>I have really damage hair do to bleaching.</li>
            <li>better than the other stuff.</li>
            <li>Product came early and is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I live in a really humid place and since the treatment and this product frizz is not a problem anymore.</li>
            <li>I live in georgia where it is very humid.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any one who has the Brazilian blowout treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair is always so soft and straight after using the BBK.</li>
            <li>and I have received compliments asking if I have gotten a new cut.  </li>
            <li>, I really see the different in my hair</li>
            <li>The real deal and cheaper than at local salons.</li>
            <li>a professional</li>
            <li>Its my favorite and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>hair felt dry after using this &amp; it was really unruly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>So I think this might work well for someone who&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t naturally frizz out &amp; go in 10 different directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i noticed that my hair was always silkier longer than when I washed it at home with my other high end products (Redken,Pravana etc.).</li>
            <li>I have long, thin hair that is difficult at best.</li>

            <li> So I think this might work well for someone who&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t naturally frizz out &amp; go in 10 different directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i noticed that my hair was always silkier longer than when I washed it at home with my other high end products (Redken,Pravana etc.).</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair that is difficult at best.</li>
            <li> Product was open and crudely taped shut and bottles looked worn, so I don&#x27;t know if I got the real product or someone refilled bottles with cheap product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is even the real product as you cannot even buy it for that cost as a hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Straight and thick.</li>
            <li> It truly is different from any other shampoo and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> when you have course surly hair like mine and finally find somehting that works, you don&#x27;t care about a few extra $.</li>
            <li> Yes, I use it on my curly hair to provide extra conditioning and keep the frizzy down.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> It says to apply a moderate amount of product to towel dried hair from the roots to the ends.  </li>
            <li> Received when expected.</li>
            <li> Paired with a little bit of the masque.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but this product gunked my hair up &amp; made it very heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair was almost dead and this makes it shinning again!</li>
            <li> It always makes my hair feel greasy even with a small amount of product.  </li>
            <li> But honestly, it&#x27;s no match for L&#x27;Oreal force vector.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The straightening serum is weird.  </li>
            <li> It may seem expensive but</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t a bad product by any means, and I plan on passing it along to a friend.</li>

            <li> Does not do what it claims to do, my hair is curly but not to curly but it did not take the frizz out of my hair or straighten it at all big lie</li>
            <li> Great quality and great price! Deilvered on time as always</li>
            <li> Prices on theseroducts can vary so I was happy to find all 3 at what is normally the price of just shampoo.</li>

            <li> Great just like the ones I bought at the salon three for the price of one!</li>

            <li> definately cant beat the price. exactly what i buy at l</li>
            <li> After I get my hair done i noticed that my hair was always silkier longer than when I washed it at home with my other high end products (Redken,Pravana etc.). I saw that my stylist had this product on her back bar so I ordered it for home use. Yep now my hair is silkier longer when I do it at home too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go without these if you get Brazilian blowouts.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. A+A+A+</li>

            <li> Received when expected.</li>
            <li> great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> It would be five but I don&#x27;t like the way the balm leaves my hair. I have really damage hair do to bleaching. The shampoo and conditioner I love love love. Paired with a little bit of the masque.</li>
            <li> These are the products my stylist recommended to use after my Brazilian blowout to help lengthen the life of the blowout. Shipped quickly, Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I would like to know where and how this retailer purchased this product. I&#x27;m not sure this is even the real product as you cannot even buy it for that cost as a hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a professional I don&#x27;t want to support Companies that sell to Amazon distributors.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an awesome shampoo/conditioner/balm. It&#x27;s ok, I guess. It smells awesome, and it did the bare minimum of what I expected. But honestly, it&#x27;s no match for L&#x27;Oreal force vector.&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt dry after using this &amp; it was really unruly.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair - I have long, thin hair that is difficult at best. So I think this might work well for someone who&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t naturally frizz out &amp; go in 10 different directions.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad product by any means, and I plan on passing it along to a friend.</li>
