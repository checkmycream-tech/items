            <li>Its incredibly easy to remove too!!!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara---it looks very good on me, but the best part is---</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara that requires no make up remover to take off.</li>
            <li>I use Yves Saint Laurent mascara, it is great, but crumble.</li>
            <li>Just a great product  holds up  through  it all.</li>

            <li>this is the most incredible mascara that I have ever encountered in my life--and that&#x27;s not an exaggeration.  </li>
            <li>If non-smudging is your #1 mascara requirement - this is a good option.</li>
            <li>Resulting in healthier, more lashes, and longer lashes!</li>

            <li>My favorite mascara!</li>

            <li>What more could I ask for!</li>
            <li>About product: Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing - doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes off in tubes in the shower.</li>
            <li>This stuff is truely amazing.</li>
            <li>It is truely amazing.</li>
            <li>It so nice to walk in the restroom at work at 2pm</li>
            <li>Honestly life-changing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I keep the eyelash brush handy just in case I need to separate a lash or two.</li>
            <li>It is not making &amp;#34;panda eyes&amp;#34; and it is very easy to remove with just water.</li>
            <li>It washes off very easily.  </li>
            <li>even fuller for those of us ladies who like a real FULL lash look.</li>
            <li>So easy to get off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Long-lasting, water-proof but easily washed off, great wear and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best mascara in the universe.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to wear mascara bc</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a waterproof mascara mostly (to try to avoid smudges)</li>
            <li>, all in all I feel like there must be a better mascara out there that would not smudge, not glue my lashes together, add volume and thickness and hold a curl.</li>
            <li>Mascaras that I have bought for $5 work better than this.</li>
            <li>(I know for sure my crows feet have benefited).  </li>
            <li>I love this Mascara.</li>
            <li>Whatever the issue is, I hope they fix it, because, while the mascara is usable now, it was much better before and at some point I will have to stop spending $30 on mascara that I can&#x27;t use for more than a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>More cosmetic companies should create a tube-like masacara.</li>
            <li>I have extensions on the top.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it..</li>
            <li>I did not like that unnatural look, now sticking to buxom, way better</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara ...</li>
            <li>So all together, its an okay product....</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it for all the reasons expressed.</li>
            <li>All time favorite.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for quite some time and its my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>The mascara was ok.</li>
            <li>but I just love how this stuff washes off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a keeper for sure</li>
            <li>Drugstore mascaras work a ton better than this did.</li>
            <li>But overall, not as impressed as I thought I&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>It looks very nice whole day.</li>
            <li>I loved it at first.....</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to wash off</li>
            <li>I love it and am loyal for life!</li>
            <li>Super easy to remove it with warm water.</li>
            <li>Not the best volume but good enough - better to have some volume and no dark circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>My old Loreal Voluminous was great for adding thickness and volume, so I miss that.</li>
            <li>if-they-go-out-of-business amazing (and you never ever have to buy eye makeup remover, &#x27;cause it comes right off with water).  </li>
            <li>Then, at the end of the day it comes off easily with out the running.  </li>
            <li>You will never have racoon eyes again and this comes off easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>It also comes off easily with make up remover wipes.</li>
            <li>And it cleanses off easily (but doesn&#x27;t smudge before you want it to come off).</li>
            <li>and it easily comes off.</li>
            <li>It removes easily and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>tried Trish McEvoy High Volume Mascara (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132FPFY/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (this curent product).&lt;br /&gt;These are defiantly superior to Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (this one) but</li>
            <li>continues to smudge and/or takes my nicely curled lashes and makes them straight!</li>
            <li>When I swim in it, it doesn&#x27;t smudge but it does flake off which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it stays on an really gives your lashes a nice look.</li>
            <li>It kills me to pay the price, and it is not as readily available conveniently as I would like but after trying so many others it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>main reason for using tubing mascaras----it is how easy to take it off---you just wash your face with warm water and</li>
            <li>love this stuff, cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with over the counter mascaras at a very much lower price point.  </li>
            <li>This mascara not only makes my lashes longer and more prominent, it lasts all day!</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this product I felt sure it would be a higher end product.  </li>
            <li>I never get too excited about the samples I get when I order cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was worth what I paid for it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit---there are better looking mascaras (on me) out there, but this is a definite winner because all you need to wash it off is just warm water and that is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This mascara is not that special mascara as it sometimes crumbles under your eyes during the day.  </li>
            <li>so my natural lashes are able to grow and are actually becoming fuller.  </li>
            <li>Even though this stuff is more than I&#x27;m used to paying for a mascara, it is absolutely, 100%, without-a-doubt, kill-yourself-</li>
            <li>it keeps my lashes FULL and CURLED!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe, since I know that it&#x27;ll last me a good while.</li>
            <li>Having stubby eyelashes myself, this makes them look very long and extreamly nice!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed the curling effects but all the other great things I&#x27;ve read about this mascara are true.  </li>
            <li>You must apply it very carefully and ideally comb your lashes with an eyelash comb after application, otherwise it will glue your lashes together and it won&#x27;t be pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still debating but money&#x27;s worth aside, it is a good mascara that I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the girl who just wants a tiny bit of mascara on.</li>
            <li>Best features are the tiny brush that enables me to coat every single lash, from root to tip- &amp; also the technology that the mascara envelopes each lash forming a tube- sock like sheath over every insividual</li>
            <li>This worked great for about 3 weeks but then totally dried out.</li>
            <li>the per use cost is worth it.    </li>
            <li>It looked just a nice the next morning.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t go swimming, this mascara stays looking freshly applied all day, even after a</li>
            <li>and it has the same warm water removal).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth $30$ ?</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery from this vendor!</li>
            <li>It does not come off during the day, but because it coats the lashes, the mascara comes right off when you wash.</li>
            <li>The capsule it created around the lash just wipes/slides right off.  </li>
            <li>Aucoin Volume Mascara (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014LLC3I/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) provides just the right amount of lash amplification, with out lumps and clumps.</li>
            <li>Cannot speak more highly of this brand and this particular formula.</li>
            <li>I find that I only need one layer and it makes my lashes look long and beautiful all day.  </li>
            <li>At my age, I have to be very gentle with the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness for the free market competition that allows many other choices.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I took off this mascara, it looked like my lashes were coming out, but it was just the gel mascara coming off my lashes in \\&quot;lash</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure, buy it at your local Nordstrom or Neiman&#x27;s (they carry Trish).  </li>
            <li>the price is much higher.</li>
            <li>and here we are the first week of January</li>
            <li>I am just finishing up my first tube of this mascara and am thinking of buying five more next time just in case.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was my lashes in the sink and panicked, but then realized it was not.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it give super high volume</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>So, yes, it is good, but so is the L&#x27;Oreal telescopic that I usually wear for $8.  </li>
            <li>It was highly recommended, and reviews were very good, but I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li>Its only achievement is that it washes off easily...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly an improvement from the Loreal Voluminous mascara I was using</li>
            <li>When you take it off, all you need is a little warm water and your fingertips.  </li>
            <li>Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one, it is not crumble, but does not have much volume.</li>
            <li>that dries fast, keeps my lashes curled, doesn&#x27;t clump &amp; washes off with soap &amp; water (wear contacts</li>
            <li>Also, I have lashes that want to stay straight</li>
            <li>&#x27;s what I like about this mascara: It absolutely will never smudge.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well.</li>
            <li>The mascara balls up and gently peels away.</li>
            <li>It really makes your lashes stand out and separates them.</li>
            <li>These are very runny and don&#x27;t amplify lashes at all, but rather glue them together.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to remove mascara only with water.</li>
            <li>: I comb my eyelashes with a brush  before applying, wipe excess off the wand, and gently run the brush along my lashes.</li>
            <li>It does not give much volume at all.</li>
            <li>Very overpriced, too.</li>
            <li>Then this mascara came along and the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; feature really does work.</li>
            <li>Love the thin brush, love the texture of the mascara.</li>
            <li>It clumps up pretty quickly if you like to put a second layer on.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara for 4 years now and still love how convenient it is to remove (as stated in other reviews, comes off in pieces and doesn&#x27;t leave smudges anywhere).</li>
            <li>I have never spent this much on mascara before, but this stuff is completely worth it.  </li>
            <li>If you want completely water proof for swimming in a pool, I wouldn&#x27;t get it but for a sad movie or most else you will love it!</li>
            <li>Make sure to close the lip tight every time because it can dry out pretty quickly otherwise.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t particularly add to the volume of my lashes as the name would suggest.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again with the high price.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara, it gives my naturally curly eyelashes a nice touch of volume but not that much lengthening, I expected my eyelashes to look like a total knockout while using this mascara.</li>
            <li>My lashes grow at cross angles and that makes for easy clumping, but this process leads to long clump free lashes that last until you wash them off.</li>
            <li>it kind of reminds me of a latex paint that encapsulates the individual lashes, rather than the chalky, flaky stuff that is typical of mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I live in Mississippi, so I have been combatting the running mascara because of the humidity.  </li>
            <li>but then it&#x27;s time to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and long lasting</li>
            <li>This is by far my fav mascara!</li>
            <li>This meets that objective very well!</li>
            <li>&quot; of mascara that were on the lashes come off incredibly easily (and look like little spiders in the sink).</li>
            <li>washes off easily in more or less a solid piece - it looks like spiders in your sink!</li>
            <li>Will flake a bit once it gets old</li>
            <li>However, this one surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I combine my Latisse lashes with this mascara I will pit my lashes against any 20 year old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy when removed.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was old, and I should&#x27;ve bought it in the store.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it was old or what</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t make my eyes look as different as I thought it would (compared to others I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more smudges and easy to remove</li>
            <li>No more circles, and easy to take off at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a girl that usually sports a natural look but recently goes all out on the makeup when going out with the girls on weekends.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for anyone who has sensitive eyes, or who gets the dreaded racoon eye look from regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Seriously though, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I thought this was a fluke the first time and didn&#x27;t worry too much about it, but the last two were the same, so I guess they changed their formula, or are letting the tubes sit in a warehouse for too long before shipping.</li>
            <li>Saks &amp; Nordstrom&#x27;s for years...&amp; Trish High Volune is the only mascara for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; this mascara does not dry fast enough to keep my lashes curled.</li>
            <li>From all the reviews I read I was really expecting not only something different, but something that that seemed like a miracle for me.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint, of course, is price &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62; but there&#x27;s none better.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for Asian users unless you were gifted with thick lashes that might hold up to this.</li>
            <li>In fact, I rarely use eye make up remover anymore, just a little sometimes to get off my eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in the same conditions, in the same way (don&#x27;t pump the stick in and out of the tube, or use it on my eye lashes when the first coat has been dry for awhile) and the tube dries out within about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone looking for a long lasting mascara.</li>
            <li>A little freaked out at first by the tubes coming off</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to put a second layer after first slightly dries.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great mascara that requires no make up remover to take off.</li>
            <li> I use Yves Saint Laurent mascara, it is great, but crumble.</li>
            <li> Just a great product  holds up  through  it all.</li>
            <li> But for now I&#x27;m just happy to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Looks great.</li>
            <li> this mascara is honestly- the best!</li>
            <li> Great mascara for me.</li>
            <li> It stays on great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> this is the most incredible mascara that I have ever encountered in my life--and that&#x27;s not an exaggeration.  </li>
            <li> If non-smudging is your #1 mascara requirement - this is a good option.</li>
            <li> Resulting in healthier, more lashes, and longer lashes!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li> What more could I ask for!</li>
            <li> About product: Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing - doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes off in tubes in the shower.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truely amazing.</li>
            <li> It is truely amazing.</li>
            <li> It so nice to walk in the restroom at work at 2pm</li>
            <li> Honestly life-changing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I keep the eyelash brush handy just in case I need to separate a lash or two.</li>
            <li> It is not making &amp;#34;panda eyes&amp;#34; and it is very easy to remove with just water.</li>
            <li> It washes off very easily.  </li>
            <li> even fuller for those of us ladies who like a real FULL lash look.</li>
            <li> So easy to get off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting, water-proof but easily washed off, great wear and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best mascara in the universe.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to wear mascara bc</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a waterproof mascara mostly (to try to avoid smudges)</li>
            <li> , all in all I feel like there must be a better mascara out there that would not smudge, not glue my lashes together, add volume and thickness and hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Mascaras that I have bought for $5 work better than this.</li>
            <li> (I know for sure my crows feet have benefited).  </li>
            <li> I love this Mascara.</li>
            <li> Whatever the issue is, I hope they fix it, because, while the mascara is usable now, it was much better before and at some point I will have to stop spending $30 on mascara that I can&#x27;t use for more than a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> More cosmetic companies should create a tube-like masacara.</li>
            <li> I have extensions on the top.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it..</li>
            <li> I did not like that unnatural look, now sticking to buxom, way better</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ...</li>
            <li> So all together, its an okay product....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it for all the reasons expressed.</li>
            <li> All time favorite.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for quite some time and its my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> The mascara was ok.</li>
            <li> but I just love how this stuff washes off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a keeper for sure</li>
            <li> Drugstore mascaras work a ton better than this did.</li>
            <li> But overall, not as impressed as I thought I&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> It looks very nice whole day.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first.....</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to wash off</li>
            <li> I love it and am loyal for life!</li>
            <li> Super easy to remove it with warm water.</li>
            <li> Not the best volume but good enough - better to have some volume and no dark circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> My old Loreal Voluminous was great for adding thickness and volume, so I miss that.</li>
            <li> if-they-go-out-of-business amazing (and you never ever have to buy eye makeup remover, &#x27;cause it comes right off with water).  </li>
            <li> Then, at the end of the day it comes off easily with out the running.  </li>
            <li> You will never have racoon eyes again and this comes off easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> It also comes off easily with make up remover wipes.</li>
            <li> And it cleanses off easily (but doesn&#x27;t smudge before you want it to come off).</li>
            <li> and it easily comes off.</li>
            <li> It removes easily and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> tried Trish McEvoy High Volume Mascara (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132FPFY/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (this curent product).&lt;br /&gt;These are defiantly superior to Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (this one) but</li>
            <li> continues to smudge and/or takes my nicely curled lashes and makes them straight!</li>
            <li> When I swim in it, it doesn&#x27;t smudge but it does flake off which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> it stays on an really gives your lashes a nice look.</li>
            <li> It kills me to pay the price, and it is not as readily available conveniently as I would like but after trying so many others it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> main reason for using tubing mascaras----it is how easy to take it off---you just wash your face with warm water and</li>
            <li> love this stuff, cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with over the counter mascaras at a very much lower price point.  </li>
            <li> This mascara not only makes my lashes longer and more prominent, it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product I felt sure it would be a higher end product.  </li>
            <li> I never get too excited about the samples I get when I order cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was worth what I paid for it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit---there are better looking mascaras (on me) out there, but this is a definite winner because all you need to wash it off is just warm water and that is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This mascara is not that special mascara as it sometimes crumbles under your eyes during the day.  </li>
            <li> so my natural lashes are able to grow and are actually becoming fuller.  </li>
            <li> Even though this stuff is more than I&#x27;m used to paying for a mascara, it is absolutely, 100%, without-a-doubt, kill-yourself-</li>
            <li> it keeps my lashes FULL and CURLED!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe, since I know that it&#x27;ll last me a good while.</li>
            <li> Having stubby eyelashes myself, this makes them look very long and extreamly nice!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the curling effects but all the other great things I&#x27;ve read about this mascara are true.  </li>
            <li> You must apply it very carefully and ideally comb your lashes with an eyelash comb after application, otherwise it will glue your lashes together and it won&#x27;t be pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still debating but money&#x27;s worth aside, it is a good mascara that I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the girl who just wants a tiny bit of mascara on.</li>
            <li> Best features are the tiny brush that enables me to coat every single lash, from root to tip- &amp; also the technology that the mascara envelopes each lash forming a tube- sock like sheath over every insividual</li>
            <li> This worked great for about 3 weeks but then totally dried out.</li>
            <li> the per use cost is worth it.    </li>
            <li> It looked just a nice the next morning.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t go swimming, this mascara stays looking freshly applied all day, even after a</li>
            <li> and it has the same warm water removal).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth $30$ ?</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery from this vendor!</li>
            <li> It does not come off during the day, but because it coats the lashes, the mascara comes right off when you wash.</li>
            <li> The capsule it created around the lash just wipes/slides right off.  </li>
            <li> Aucoin Volume Mascara (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014LLC3I/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) provides just the right amount of lash amplification, with out lumps and clumps.</li>
            <li> Cannot speak more highly of this brand and this particular formula.</li>
            <li> I find that I only need one layer and it makes my lashes look long and beautiful all day.  </li>
            <li> At my age, I have to be very gentle with the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness for the free market competition that allows many other choices.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I took off this mascara, it looked like my lashes were coming out, but it was just the gel mascara coming off my lashes in \\&quot;lash</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure, buy it at your local Nordstrom or Neiman&#x27;s (they carry Trish).  </li>
            <li> the price is much higher.</li>
            <li> and here we are the first week of January</li>
            <li> I am just finishing up my first tube of this mascara and am thinking of buying five more next time just in case.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was my lashes in the sink and panicked, but then realized it was not.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it give super high volume</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> So, yes, it is good, but so is the L&#x27;Oreal telescopic that I usually wear for $8.  </li>
            <li> It was highly recommended, and reviews were very good, but I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Its only achievement is that it washes off easily...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly an improvement from the Loreal Voluminous mascara I was using</li>
            <li> When you take it off, all you need is a little warm water and your fingertips.  </li>
            <li> Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one, it is not crumble, but does not have much volume.</li>
            <li> that dries fast, keeps my lashes curled, doesn&#x27;t clump &amp; washes off with soap &amp; water (wear contacts</li>
            <li> Also, I have lashes that want to stay straight</li>
            <li> &#x27;s what I like about this mascara: It absolutely will never smudge.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well.</li>
            <li> The mascara balls up and gently peels away.</li>
            <li> It really makes your lashes stand out and separates them.</li>
            <li> These are very runny and don&#x27;t amplify lashes at all, but rather glue them together.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important to remove mascara only with water.</li>
            <li> : I comb my eyelashes with a brush  before applying, wipe excess off the wand, and gently run the brush along my lashes.</li>
            <li> It does not give much volume at all.</li>
            <li> Very overpriced, too.</li>
            <li> Then this mascara came along and the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; feature really does work.</li>
            <li> Love the thin brush, love the texture of the mascara.</li>
            <li> It clumps up pretty quickly if you like to put a second layer on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for 4 years now and still love how convenient it is to remove (as stated in other reviews, comes off in pieces and doesn&#x27;t leave smudges anywhere).</li>
            <li> I have never spent this much on mascara before, but this stuff is completely worth it.  </li>
            <li> If you want completely water proof for swimming in a pool, I wouldn&#x27;t get it but for a sad movie or most else you will love it!</li>
            <li> Make sure to close the lip tight every time because it can dry out pretty quickly otherwise.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t particularly add to the volume of my lashes as the name would suggest.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again with the high price.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, it gives my naturally curly eyelashes a nice touch of volume but not that much lengthening, I expected my eyelashes to look like a total knockout while using this mascara.</li>
            <li> My lashes grow at cross angles and that makes for easy clumping, but this process leads to long clump free lashes that last until you wash them off.</li>
            <li> it kind of reminds me of a latex paint that encapsulates the individual lashes, rather than the chalky, flaky stuff that is typical of mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I live in Mississippi, so I have been combatting the running mascara because of the humidity.  </li>
            <li> but then it&#x27;s time to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and long lasting</li>
            <li> This is by far my fav mascara!</li>
            <li> This meets that objective very well!</li>
            <li> &quot; of mascara that were on the lashes come off incredibly easily (and look like little spiders in the sink).</li>
            <li> washes off easily in more or less a solid piece - it looks like spiders in your sink!</li>
            <li> Will flake a bit once it gets old</li>
            <li> However, this one surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I combine my Latisse lashes with this mascara I will pit my lashes against any 20 year old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy when removed.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was old, and I should&#x27;ve bought it in the store.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it was old or what</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t make my eyes look as different as I thought it would (compared to others I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more smudges and easy to remove</li>
            <li> No more circles, and easy to take off at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a girl that usually sports a natural look but recently goes all out on the makeup when going out with the girls on weekends.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for anyone who has sensitive eyes, or who gets the dreaded racoon eye look from regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a fluke the first time and didn&#x27;t worry too much about it, but the last two were the same, so I guess they changed their formula, or are letting the tubes sit in a warehouse for too long before shipping.</li>
            <li> Saks &amp; Nordstrom&#x27;s for years...&amp; Trish High Volune is the only mascara for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; this mascara does not dry fast enough to keep my lashes curled.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews I read I was really expecting not only something different, but something that that seemed like a miracle for me.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, of course, is price &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62; but there&#x27;s none better.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for Asian users unless you were gifted with thick lashes that might hold up to this.</li>
            <li> In fact, I rarely use eye make up remover anymore, just a little sometimes to get off my eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in the same conditions, in the same way (don&#x27;t pump the stick in and out of the tube, or use it on my eye lashes when the first coat has been dry for awhile) and the tube dries out within about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everyone looking for a long lasting mascara.</li>
            <li> A little freaked out at first by the tubes coming off</li>
            <li> Do not attempt to put a second layer after first slightly dries.</li>
            <li> What it does do is dry out fast, as in less than a month.</li>
            <li> My only problem is not to put it on too  thick or my lashes, truly, would be too much for work!</li>
            <li> only MINOR improvement I would have is to make it (the brush?)</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes flat.</li>
            <li> It is the least clumping mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, it is absolutely smear and melt-proof, it does not flake until the next day, and it washes away in the shower without soap or remover (it clumps and rubs off).</li>
            <li> I have also received a couple tubes lately that where already VERY dry when I first got them.</li>
            <li> And I had to swallow hard to pay this much for mascara...</li>
            <li> What was really apparent in this few months that my first tube lasted me is that there is no point to mascara if it doesn&#x27;t improve the lashes you have, and this mascara hardly achieved that for me.</li>
            <li> Difficult to describe without making it sound &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> her lashes were so long and curled.</li>
            <li> You simply get your lashes wet and the mascara comes off in tubes - no smearing, no need for eye makeup remover, nothing.  </li>
            <li> Wears well and long.</li>
            <li> Does not flake of give you raccoon eyes and is long wearing.  </li>
            <li> Its the opposite of what you see these days -it&#x27;s not a huge big bottle, or a massive multi colored brush</li>
            <li> Does not smear or smudge even after a long day at work!</li>
            <li> the composition of the mascara seems completely different from any other mascara.  </li>
            <li> Have tried other brands and always come back to Trish</li>
            <li> It is the only product that doesn&#x27;t melt and create dark rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and you have to rinse them down the drain - they don&#x27;t simply dissolve...</li>
            <li> Whenever I find a product I REALLY like, it&#x27;s usually discontinued within a few months.</li>
            <li> NOT great for the girl who wants long luscious eye lashes.</li>
            <li> This is a big issue with most mascaras because by the afternoon I&#x27;ll have ugly dark smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Tiny wand that picks up little mascara.  </li>
            <li> It has teeny tiny little &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; that stick to lashes...</li>
            <li> When you want to take it off you just wet your lashes with water and</li>
            <li> Since I discovered this stuff, that absolutely never happens.  </li>
            <li> There is not much mascara on the wand, so it is time-consuming to apply.  </li>
            <li> but it goes on with absolutely no clumps.</li>
            <li> Immediately makes your lashes long, separated and dark.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m totally open to suggestions here in terms or application if I&#x27;m missing something, so let me know.</li>
            <li> It makes me look like I have lashes half again as long and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Especially mascara, which I hate wearing because it always, always wears off and smudges easily.  </li>
            <li> This formula is literally revolutionary, and I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would use any other mascara, or why other companies bother making their mascara some other way. &#x27;</li>
            <li> well that&#x27;s not exactly what you wear it for.  </li>
            <li> but it made my lashes stick to each other and look unnatural like spider legs.</li>
            <li> Trish McEvoy mascara dries slower than other brands.</li>
            <li> I forgot &#x27;bout all other variants.</li>
            <li> &quot; It does not prematurely dry out and leave little \\&quot;pills\\&quot; on the wand.</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes seem very long, stays on well, comes off without too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> The other half stays though, so my lashes are half-way curled all</li>
            <li> As someone else noted - odd that other make-up companies have not caught on and made this type of mascara too.  </li>
            <li> No flaking or dark circles.</li>
            <li> There is no smearing or dark circles from it running.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it still contains parabens, which I avoid in every product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the amount of money.</li>
            <li> Always end up with dark circles under my eyes as it smudges or flakes off.</li>
            <li> I realize this type of mascara isn&#x27;t for everyone but works for me with long lashes on the bottom where I usually have black mascara smudge under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does weigh down your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t add volume or lengthen them.  </li>
            <li> I always curl my lashes before applying mascara and when I put this mascara on it immediately weighs down my lashes and I lose half the curl.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll rub off what I can of the melted mascara taking my under eye makeup with it leaving my purple under eye circles visible creating a dark mess.</li>
            <li> water a lot, which means that I used to have to deal with running mascara &amp; black circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> neither does clinique&#x27;s lash power (at half the price</li>
            <li> In addition, my tube even came apart (again in less than a month).</li>
            <li> tried Blinc Mascaras in black and purple (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUNBZS/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave black circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> swam in it, in hot and cold water, and it never smudges.</li>
            <li> This stuff creates little tubes that make my lashes look long and thick.</li>
            <li> I use a cream eye makeup remover with water and a little pressure from fingers and it removes without residue.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is a gel formula that coats your lashes with little tubes.  </li>
            <li> the mascara rolls off in little clumps.</li>
            <li> a little water and to roll lashes in my finger</li>
            <li> One thing about the mascara that encases your lashes with the little tube-like fibers</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries a little slower than I&#x27;m used to, so I have to remember not to touch it immediately after application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark and will not run.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way it flaked off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> but I use it everyday, so</li>
            <li> It is difficult to screw the top back to the base.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dried out..</li>
            <li> Too heavy.</li>
            <li> And I have the thin asian eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I will say though that over the past year or so, the quality of the mascara seems to have gone down.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have always had trouble with mascara running and causing black lines under my eyes by the end of the day!</li>
            <li> After a few minutes of applying it, I am able to run my fingers over my lashes without it leaving that nasty typical mascara gunk.  </li>
            <li> It is not  easy to remove, it comes off with my lashes, it clumps.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but the price on amazon beats my local Nordstoms.</li>
            <li> i love mascara, and this product was horrible.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet cried with it on, so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> No more black eyes at all!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have to rub so hard to remove it at night.</li>
            <li> Terribly hard to remove, even with two eye makeup removers.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> I have used it all, had lash extensions and have very small sparse lashes.  </li>
            <li> It gives insane volume, goes on fast and -- this is the bonus part:  when removing it, it does not dissolve, it LOOSENS and slides off your lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, frail lashes.</li>
            <li> and I end up looking worse than wearing no mascara.</li>
            <li> (her lashes are worse than mine) for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> I had stopped wearing mascara because I was so tired of it</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll never use it again - waste of money :(</li>
            <li> This was an expensive mistake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got hooked on this before I realized it contains them.</li>
            <li> Weird brush, but quality meets expectations</li>
            <li> Trish McEvoy mascara is expensive.</li>
            <li> Quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Very thin brush.</li>
            <li> I used to avoid mascara because I hated removing it, but this one comes off in little rubber tubes.  </li>
            <li> This is very expensive, so thought it would work well.  </li>
            <li> but it was expensive and worthless.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by the quality of this very expensive mascara.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It stays on without flaking and comes off without smudging</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara that requires no make up remover to take off. It separates and lengthens incredibly.  When you want to take it off you just wet your lashes with water and it tubes of with no damage to you lashes. Resulting in healthier, more lashes, and longer lashes!</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way it flaked off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This mascara not only makes my lashes longer and more prominent, it lasts all day! No flaking or dark circles. To remove, just wash with soap and water. Highly recommend to everyone looking for a long lasting mascara.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best mascara in the universe.  It gives insane volume, goes on fast and -- this is the bonus part:  when removing it, it does not dissolve, it LOOSENS and slides off your lashes.  Think about it, Ladies:  no tugging, wiping or rubbing to get mascara off.  At my age, I have to be very gentle with the skin around my eyes.  This is the only mascara I use.</li>
            <li> Whenever I find a product I REALLY like, it&#x27;s usually discontinued within a few months. I hope Trish McEvoy always makes this mascara, because I just discovered it.      An Ulta employee was helping me pick a foundation color when I asked what mascara she was wearing bc her lashes were so long and curled. I have thin, frail lashes. She told me to try this mascara (they didn&#x27;t sell it at Ulta).  I have never been able to wear mascara bc I wear contacts, my eyes water and I end up looking worse than wearing no mascara. This mascara is totally non-irritating. It does not come off during the day, but because it coats the lashes, the mascara comes right off when you wash. I use a cream eye makeup remover with water and a little pressure from fingers and it removes without residue.  It also holds the curl of an eyelash curler. It&#x27;s pricey but I use it everyday, so the per use cost is worth it.    I would highly recommend for anyone who has sensitive eyes, or who gets the dreaded racoon eye look from regular mascara.</li>
            <li> The best mascara I have ever used. My eyes are set in a way that I always have mascara underneath if I don&#x27;t wear waterproof. That was until I found this mascara. It&#x27;s never under my eyes and stays on during skiing, tennis, hiking, running. I just slip it off my lashes at night when I wash my face and my nighttime routine has never been easier.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I have ever used.  It kills me to pay the price, and it is not as readily available conveniently as I would like but after trying so many others it is definitely worth it.  The brush is slim and works well.  The mascara never smudges or flakes.  To take it off I use cleanser or sometimes just water and it comes off in almost \\&quot;chunks\\&quot; so there&#x27;s never any leftover residue under the eyes. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> washes off easily in more or less a solid piece - it looks like spiders in your sink! There is no smearing or dark circles from it running.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I live in Mississippi, so I have been combatting the running mascara because of the humidity.  The texture of this product produces a solid coating that has yet to run.  After a few minutes of applying it, I am able to run my fingers over my lashes without it leaving that nasty typical mascara gunk.  I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in lash breakage since I&#x27;ve started using it so my natural lashes are able to grow and are actually becoming fuller.  Then, at the end of the day it comes off easily with out the running.  The capsule it created around the lash just wipes/slides right off.  I reccommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara.  For some reason, mascara never stays on my eyelashes, but instead, it ends up under my eyes giving me the racoon look.  Not this mascara!  I even wear it when I workout and it stays on.  I love it and am loyal for life!</li>
            <li> After 30 years of mascara smudging below my eyes I have found the one that stays on my lashes!! This stuff creates little tubes that make my lashes look long and thick. It will not come off till you rub with cleanser, even after you cry and sleep! I left it on for 2 days to test it and it was there till I used makeup remover. Buy it! It is well worth the price! Houston</li>
            <li> this is the most incredible mascara that I have ever encountered in my life--and that&#x27;s not an exaggeration.  I have allergies and my eyes water a lot, which means that I used to have to deal with running mascara &amp; black circles under my eyes.  Since I discovered this stuff, that absolutely never happens.  Even though this stuff is more than I&#x27;m used to paying for a mascara, it is absolutely, 100%, without-a-doubt, kill-yourself-if-they-go-out-of-business amazing (and you never ever have to buy eye makeup remover, &#x27;cause it comes right off with water).  This formula is literally revolutionary, and I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would use any other mascara, or why other companies bother making their mascara some other way. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I use Yves Saint Laurent mascara, it is great, but crumble. I decided to try this one, it is not crumble, but does not have much volume.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews I read I was really expecting not only something different, but something that that seemed like a miracle for me.  I have been searching for a waterproof mascara mostly (to try to avoid smudges) that dries fast, keeps my lashes curled, doesn&#x27;t clump &amp; washes off with soap &amp; water (wear contacts so an oily eye cleaner is out of the question).  This mascara is not that special mascara as it sometimes crumbles under your eyes during the day.  Also, I have lashes that want to stay straight &amp; this mascara does not dry fast enough to keep my lashes curled. This was an expensive mistake.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by the quality of this very expensive mascara.  It flaked and irritated my eyes.  I have had better luck with over the counter mascaras at a very much lower price point.  After reading the reviews on this product I felt sure it would be a higher end product.  I am wondering if this was a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; product since the quality was so low.</li>
            <li> Just a great product  holds up  through  it all. I fell a sleep with it on . It looked just a nice the next morning. Whith no raccoon eyes !</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect mascara! Best of the best! Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for the second time and will buy in the future</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara after reading all the positive reviews. It&#x27;s certainly an improvement from the Loreal Voluminous mascara I was using but it&#x27;s no holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like about this mascara: It absolutely will never smudge. This is a big issue with most mascaras because by the afternoon I&#x27;ll have ugly dark smudges under my eyes. Then I&#x27;ll rub off what I can of the melted mascara taking my under eye makeup with it leaving my purple under eye circles visible creating a dark mess. This mascara stays put. I&#x27;ve slept in it, swam in it, in hot and cold water, and it never smudges. When I swim in it, it doesn&#x27;t smudge but it does flake off which is fine with me. If I don&#x27;t go swimming, this mascara stays looking freshly applied all day, even after a nap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: 1. You must apply it very carefully and ideally comb your lashes with an eyelash comb after application, otherwise it will glue your lashes together and it won&#x27;t be pretty. 2. It doesn&#x27;t particularly add to the volume of my lashes as the name would suggest. My old Loreal Voluminous was great for adding thickness and volume, so I miss that. 3. It doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well. I always curl my lashes before applying mascara and when I put this mascara on it immediately weighs down my lashes and I lose half the curl. The other half stays though, so my lashes are half-way curled all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all I feel like there must be a better mascara out there that would not smudge, not glue my lashes together, add volume and thickness and hold a curl. But for now I&#x27;m just happy to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge. If non-smudging is your #1 mascara requirement - this is a good option.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive, so thought it would work well.  There is not much mascara on the wand, so it is time-consuming to apply.  The mascara dries up in the wand.  It is difficult to screw the top back to the base.  If it weren&#x27;t such a hassle, I would send it back.  Mascaras that I have bought for $5 work better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 5 years.  I have tried others that claim to do the same thing - - and nothing compares.  This mascara is a gel formula that coats your lashes with little tubes.  When you take it off, all you need is a little warm water and your fingertips.  NO makeup remover and no rubbing is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I took off this mascara, it looked like my lashes were coming out, but it was just the gel mascara coming off my lashes in \\&quot;lash form\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve never lost any eyelashes and actually feel like my skimpy lashes have benefited from continuous use of this mascara (I know for sure my crows feet have benefited).  In fact, I rarely use eye make up remover anymore, just a little sometimes to get off my eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I wouldn&#x27;t dream of ever using anything else.  If you aren&#x27;t sure, buy it at your local Nordstrom or Neiman&#x27;s (they carry Trish).  If you don&#x27;t like it, just return it.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I will use.  It&#x27;s very dark and will not run.  Will flake a bit once it gets old but then it&#x27;s time to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Makes your lashes seem very long, stays on well, comes off without too much trouble.  My second tube.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I will NOT use anything else from this point on.  This stuff is amazing.  I have used it all, had lash extensions and have very small sparse lashes.  This stuff stays put ALL DAY.  It so nice to walk in the restroom at work at 2pm and it still be there.  I am ordering this for my mom (her lashes are worse than mine) for her birthday.  Can&#x27;t wait for her to try it....</li>
            <li> I want to be a spokesperson for Trish McEvoy Mascara. I haven&#x27;t had to use makeup remover since I got it. It&#x27;s amazing - doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes off in tubes in the shower. Honestly life-changing.</li>
            <li> The only mascara that I use!!!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try this mascara. EVERY \\&quot;no smudge, water-resistant\\&quot; mascara I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried them all) continues to smudge and/or takes my nicely curled lashes and makes them straight! However, this one surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced my daily (waterproof) DiorShow habit with this mascara. I wore it to a post-work spinning class and it didn&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part... it keeps my lashes FULL and CURLED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only MINOR improvement I would have is to make it (the brush?) even fuller for those of us ladies who like a real FULL lash look.</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara. I will never use another brand again if i can help it. It elongates and thickens but is not clumpy ..and washing it off is a dream. No raccoon eyes anymore. The mascara balls up and gently peels away. My eyelashes have become longer and fuller since i started using this becuase i don&#x27;t have to rub so hard to remove it at night. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara! My only complaint, of course, is price &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62; but there&#x27;s none better.</li>
            <li> It is the least clumping mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, it is absolutely smear and melt-proof, it does not flake until the next day, and it washes away in the shower without soap or remover (it clumps and rubs off). It is PETA-pledged cruelty-free. My only complaint is that it still contains parabens, which I avoid in every product. Unfortunately, I got hooked on this before I realized it contains them. Since it is going on my lashes rather than my skin, I have continued to use it.</li>
            <li> This is really great mascara! It really makes your lashes stand out and separates them. It doesn&#x27;t  clump. The only draw back for some might be price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for 4 years now and still love how convenient it is to remove (as stated in other reviews, comes off in pieces and doesn&#x27;t leave smudges anywhere). I will say though that over the past year or so, the quality of the mascara seems to have gone down. I use it in the same conditions, in the same way (don&#x27;t pump the stick in and out of the tube, or use it on my eye lashes when the first coat has been dry for awhile) and the tube dries out within about two weeks. I have also received a couple tubes lately that where already VERY dry when I first got them. I thought this was a fluke the first time and didn&#x27;t worry too much about it, but the last two were the same, so I guess they changed their formula, or are letting the tubes sit in a warehouse for too long before shipping. Whatever the issue is, I hope they fix it, because, while the mascara is usable now, it was much better before and at some point I will have to stop spending $30 on mascara that I can&#x27;t use for more than a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the curling effects but all the other great things I&#x27;ve read about this mascara are true.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  Long-lasting, water-proof but easily washed off, great wear and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Okay. It doesn&#x27;t smudge, but neither does clinique&#x27;s lash power (at half the price and it has the same warm water removal). What it does do is dry out fast, as in less than a month. In addition, my tube even came apart (again in less than a month). Absolutely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!  Does not smear or smudge even after a long day at work!</li>
            <li> You will never have racoon eyes again and this comes off easily with soap and water.  More cosmetic companies should create a tube-like masacara.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not budge.  Some mascaras fall on your under eyes over the course of the day and make you look like you need some rest- this doesn&#x27;t do that.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Its the opposite of what you see these days -it&#x27;s not a huge big bottle, or a massive multi colored brush -but it works. great product! I use it for the lower lashes. I have extensions on the top. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> After a model/beauty consultant blogged about this mascara, I gave it a try.  Tiny wand that picks up little mascara.  Terribly hard to remove, even with two eye makeup removers.  Product triggered allergy attacks.  Thank goodness for the free market competition that allows many other choices.</li>
            <li> Only mascara I can wear for over 8 hours and then go to the gym and never have racoon eyes. It also comes off easily with make up remover wipes.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this mascara. It&#x27;s absolutely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Difficult to describe without making it sound &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34;.. but it WORKS!  It has teeny tiny little &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; that stick to lashes... but it goes on with absolutely no clumps. And it cleanses off easily (but doesn&#x27;t smudge before you want it to come off). I had stopped wearing mascara because I was so tired of it flaking and getting in my eyes by the end of the day. And I had to swallow hard to pay this much for mascara... but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this is the best mascara ever made.  no smudging or smearing.  the composition of the mascara seems completely different from any other mascara.  it kind of reminds me of a latex paint that encapsulates the individual lashes, rather than the chalky, flaky stuff that is typical of mascaras.  when i wash my face the \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; of mascara that were on the lashes come off incredibly easily (and look like little spiders in the sink). i cannot recommend this highly enough.  it is the spanx of the cosmetics world.</li>
            <li> Love the thin brush, love the texture of the mascara. Looks great. What more could I ask for! I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It is the best mascara I have EVER used.  It stays on until you take it off with water.  You simply get your lashes wet and the mascara comes off in tubes - no smearing, no need for eye makeup remover, nothing.  Just water.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara---it looks very good on me, but the best part is---it&#x27;s  a breeze to take off. I&#x27;ll admit---there are better looking mascaras (on me) out there, but this is a definite winner because all you need to wash it off is just warm water and that is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried different tubing mascaras and I have to say that this one has the best price to quality ration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Trish McEvoy High Volume Mascara (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132FPFY/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (this curent product).&lt;br /&gt;These are defiantly superior to Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (this one) but the price is much higher. I can not say that the quality out ways having to pay ~50$ for Trish McEvoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Blinc Mascaras in black and purple (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUNBZS/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and I have to say that even though these are cheaper---I don&#x27;t like them at all! These are very runny and don&#x27;t amplify lashes at all, but rather glue them together. I&#x27;m done with Blinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014LLC3I/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) provides just the right amount of lash amplification, with out lumps and clumps. It also allows for proper lash separation and stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for using tubing mascaras----it is how easy to take it off---you just wash your face with warm water and the mascara rolls off in little clumps. No more raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> I have never spent this much on mascara before, but this stuff is completely worth it.  It doesn&#x27;t run or smudge, period.  I have even cried while wearing this stuff, and there was nary a raccoon eye to be seen!  I find that I only need one layer and it makes my lashes look long and beautiful all day.  It&#x27;s the only mascara for me, I&#x27;ll never go back to another brand!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I have used it for years. It is the only product that doesn&#x27;t melt and create dark rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li> No more smudges and easy to remove</li>
            <li> Weird brush, but quality meets expectations</li>
            <li> Received, opened....mascara wand separated from mascara! Couldn&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> I love it. It is not making &amp;#34;panda eyes&amp;#34; and it is very easy to remove with just water. It looks very nice whole day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it.. I bought it in October and here we are the first week of January and it&#x27;s dried out.. It does weigh down your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t add volume or lengthen them.  Its only achievement is that it washes off easily... well that&#x27;s not exactly what you wear it for.  What was really apparent in this few months that my first tube lasted me is that there is no point to mascara if it doesn&#x27;t improve the lashes you have, and this mascara hardly achieved that for me. It&#x27;s not worth the amount of money.</li>
            <li> This is a tube mascara. I will never go back to regular mascara. It doesn&#x27;t flake, smudge, or wear off. Trish McEvoy mascara is expensive. Quite expensive. However when comparing it to BLINC, also excellent, Trish M pulls ahead. It does not clump on. You can control the volume and thickness of your lashes from \\&quot;wow\\&quot; to \\&quot;Are those fake?\\&quot; It does not prematurely dry out and leave little \\&quot;pills\\&quot; on the wand. I am 64. I use Latisse. When I combine my Latisse lashes with this mascara I will pit my lashes against any 20 year old. My only problem is not to put it on too  thick or my lashes, truly, would be too much for work! Will buy again...and again...and again.</li>
            <li> It does washes off well but it made my lashes stick to each other and look unnatural like spider legs. I did not like that unnatural look, now sticking to buxom, way better</li>
            <li> This stuff is truely amazing. Wears well and long. I get compliments on my eye lashes all the time when I wear it. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. So easy to get off with warm water. If you want completely water proof for swimming in a pool, I wouldn&#x27;t get it but for a sad movie or most else you will love it! Make sure to close the lip tight every time because it can dry out pretty quickly otherwise. Seriously though, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have always had trouble with mascara running and causing black lines under my eyes by the end of the day! This mascara does not do that at all!! It is truely amazing. I will never buy anything else ever again! I just wish her products were sold locally! Maybe some day! Thank you Trish!!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY mascara that does&#x27;t smear.  I got turned on to this by a friend and have never looked back.  It is expensive, but the price on amazon beats my local Nordstoms.</li>
            <li> i love mascara, and this product was horrible.  it didn&#x27;t thicken or lengthen at all - it was just clumpy :\  and took off some of my eyelashes when I tried to wash it off.  used it once and i&#x27;ll never use it again - waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Returned it. Too heavy. Made my eyelashes flat. And I have the thin asian eyelashes. I would not recommend for Asian users unless you were gifted with thick lashes that might hold up to this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave black circles under your eyes.  It washes off very easily.  Lancome mascara makes thicker lashes but it also gives you owl eyes.  I&#x27;ll stick with this.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ... Does not smudge and you just dampen your fingers at the end of the night and it rolls off in between your fingers.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5-6 years... Have tried other brands and always come back to Trish</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and long lasting</li>
            <li> this mascara is honestly- the best! it stays on an really gives your lashes a nice look. Having stubby eyelashes myself, this makes them look very long and extreamly nice! deff. recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara out there. Worth every penny!!!! Will be buying again and again!!!!! Its incredibly easy to remove too!!!</li>
            <li> The best! love this stuff, cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, it gives my naturally curly eyelashes a nice touch of volume but not that much lengthening, I expected my eyelashes to look like a total knockout while using this mascara. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it as efficiently? Then again I&#x27;m not a makeup guru/expert. I&#x27;m more of a girl that usually sports a natural look but recently goes all out on the makeup when going out with the girls on weekends. It does the job and I like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again with the high price. Maybe, since I know that it&#x27;ll last me a good while. Hopefully, at least 2 years. I&#x27;m still debating but money&#x27;s worth aside, it is a good mascara that I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not flake of give you raccoon eyes and is long wearing.  Also I do not need make-up remover to take off the mascara ---just a little water and to roll lashes in my finger and it easily comes off.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery from this vendor! About product: Absolutely love it! Trish McEvoy mascara dries slower than other brands. It stays all day on the lashes not under. Do not attempt to put a second layer after first slightly dries. It clumps eyelashes together. Super easy to remove it with warm water. Recommend!</li>
            <li> After I started using it I forgot &#x27;bout all other variants. I don&#x27;t like using make-up removers and for me it&#x27;s important to remove mascara only with water.</li>
            <li> I am just finishing up my first tube of this mascara and am thinking of buying five more next time just in case.  It simply does not smudge.  A little freaked out at first by the tubes coming off but now it&#x27;s no big deal.  Not the best volume but good enough - better to have some volume and no dark circles under your eyes.  As someone else noted - odd that other make-up companies have not caught on and made this type of mascara too.  I used my tube every day for about six months?? before it ran out.</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail of mascara. It makes me look like I have lashes half again as long and doesn&#x27;t smudge. It removes easily and goes on easily. One tip: I comb my eyelashes with a brush  before applying, wipe excess off the wand, and gently run the brush along my lashes. I keep the eyelash brush handy just in case I need to separate a lash or two. My lashes grow at cross angles and that makes for easy clumping, but this process leads to long clump free lashes that last until you wash them off.</li>
            <li> Best that I ever used!</li>
            <li> Great mascara for me. No runs, no smudges and comes off the same way. I realize this type of mascara isn&#x27;t for everyone but works for me with long lashes on the bottom where I usually have black mascara smudge under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first.....now - eh. It clumps up pretty quickly if you like to put a second layer on. It does not give much volume at all. It&#x27;s great for the girl who just wants a tiny bit of mascara on. NOT great for the girl who wants long luscious eye lashes. So all together, its an okay product....</li>
            <li> I never get too excited about the samples I get when I order cosmetics. Especially mascara, which I hate wearing because it always, always wears off and smudges easily.  But the Trish mascara came in a sample from Nordstrom.  I absolutely love it for all the reasons expressed. Very thin brush. Immediately makes your lashes long, separated and dark.  Stays on and comes off in strings.  At first I thought it was my lashes in the sink and panicked, but then realized it was not.  Went to Nordis and got a larger size.</li>
            <li> This is by far my fav mascara! I was a MakeUp Artist @ Saks &amp; Nordstrom&#x27;s for years...&amp; Trish High Volune is the only mascara for me!&lt;br /&gt; Best features are the tiny brush that enables me to coat every single lash, from root to tip- &amp; also the technology that the mascara envelopes each lash forming a tube- sock like sheath over every insividual lash!&lt;br /&gt;Bestbest best mascara!</li>
            <li> All time favorite. Recommended by a friend. It can be removed with water where rubber like flakes come off the lashes. Which is what I like about the mascara. It&#x27;s not messy when removed.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for quite some time and its my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge! BEST mascara EVER!!!</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended, and reviews were very good, but I am not happy at all. It is not  easy to remove, it comes off with my lashes, it clumps. Maybe it was old, and I should&#x27;ve bought it in the store. Very overpriced, too.</li>
            <li> The mascara was ok. I didn&#x27;t think it was worth what I paid for it! I would give it 3 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with mascara no matter what brand or price I pay. Always end up with dark circles under my eyes as it smudges or flakes off. I think I rub my eyes too often. Then this mascara came along and the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; feature really does work. No more circles, and easy to take off at night. Cannot speak more highly of this brand and this particular formula.</li>
            <li> No under eye line. Stays put. Don&#x27;t let the spider lines scare you when you take it off. Worth $30$ ? I don&#x27;t know but I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used!  I used to avoid mascara because I hated removing it, but this one comes off in little rubber tubes.  It&#x27;s incredible and even holds up well in workouts and water!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it give super high volume but I just love how this stuff washes off. It stays on great. I have even slept with it on and it looks perfect in the morning. Then I simply wash it off in the shower. It&#x27;s a keeper for sure</li>
            <li> This worked great for about 3 weeks but then totally dried out. Don&#x27;t know if it was old or what but it was expensive and worthless. Drugstore mascaras work a ton better than this did.</li>
            <li> So, yes, it is good, but so is the L&#x27;Oreal telescopic that I usually wear for $8.  One thing about the mascara that encases your lashes with the little tube-like fibers - they end up sort of all over your shower and you have to rinse them down the drain - they don&#x27;t simply dissolve...</li>
            <li> I got this because I have yet to get a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake off midday and leave me looking like a raccoon.  This meets that objective very well! I love how easy it is to wash off and it just comes off in pieces! No more black eyes at all!! I haven&#x27;t yet cried with it on, so I&#x27;m not sure if it will drip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries a little slower than I&#x27;m used to, so I have to remember not to touch it immediately after application.  What I don&#x27;t like is the lack of OOMPH - I don&#x27;t see a lot of volume here. If I put on two layers, it clumps the lashes together giving me the clown look.  If I try to separate them, it doesn&#x27;t have that thickness I was looking for. It really doesn&#x27;t make my eyes look as different as I thought it would (compared to others I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m totally open to suggestions here in terms or application if I&#x27;m missing something, so let me know. But overall, not as impressed as I thought I&#x27;d be.</li>
