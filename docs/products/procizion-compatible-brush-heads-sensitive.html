            <li>I was VERY IMPRESSED with the customer service...a \\&quot;commodity\\&quot; that I highly value and find rather rare these days!  </li>

            <li>Does it work as well or better than the genuine $27 brush?</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes are better than the original my MIA came with.</li>
            <li>These were easy to put on and work just like the name brand.</li>
            <li>Seriously, such a great alternative to the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; replacements that retail for much more.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads do fit the Mia 2 and work fine.  </li>
            <li>Yes they fit on my brush</li>
            <li>The sensitive brush head is ideal for most skin types, including sensitive.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great replacement head for the cost-conscious.</li>
            <li>great present for my mother since she has one and was needing refills anyways.</li>
            <li>The Brush Heads fit my Clairasonic Mia 2 and at a Lower Price.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>these fit my Mia 2 perfectly&lt;</li>
            <li>The snapped right in, and the center oscillates perfectly.</li>
            <li>They remove all dirt, oil, and makeup from my face, and leave my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Buy the original ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works as well as the original</li>
            <li>I have no redness/irritation with this brush and my skin is clean feeling.</li>
            <li>They &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; in the Clarisonic and snap in place, but when you turn on the handle they brushes don&#x27;t clean or vibrate as with the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>super cheap.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Better off buying the real thing</li>
            <li>Same quality, great seller, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love that they are gentle for sensitive skin, but paired with the Clarisonic they provide a great deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I think that the best part of these brush heads is that Procizion doesn&#x27;t make it sound like their the exact same thing like a lot of other companies do.</li>
            <li>These are not the ones that are made to go with my SonicCare Mia, but they do fit very well.  </li>
            <li>I love how my acne I did have as an adult has begun to diminish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied with these, particularly because they cost so much</li>
            <li>I bought a clarisonic brand brush head to compare but as of right now I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything.  </li>
            <li>I was right that it wasn&#x27;t working they way</li>
            <li>The price is great, which is what drew me to the product, however I am not sure if it is worth a repurchase.</li>
            <li>#34;gunked up&amp;#34; around the edges like the Mia brush does; much easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement for my Mia... couldn&#x27;t be happier to get double the product for half the price.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and easy to attach.</li>
            <li>I love the sensitive skin brush because if feels much softer on my face.  </li>
            <li>These are a way better value than the Clarisonic brush heads and perform just the same.</li>
            <li>and he asked if I&#x27;d be willing to try a new box of the brushes for free -- that the problem I had is unusual and that they stand by their brushes.  </li>
            <li>CON - the brush head gets stiffer over time; doesn&#x27;t stay soft - and I do clean the brush heads after every use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is really soft, very good for sensitive skin, but the quality is not good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used &amp;#34;normal skin&amp;#34; heads on my Mia2 by Clarisonic, but these sensitive skin replacement heads fit no problem and vibrate</li>
            <li>they are so much more affordable here that you can actually try out all the different types of heads and not spend $25</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle on my highly sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>but the bristles don&#x27;t oscillate like they do on the normal clairsonic head.</li>
            <li>They are much softer than the brand name Clarisonic Sensitive brush heads, and the middle section doesn&#x27;t rotate quite the right way either.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, fits clarisonic mia, but NOT soft.  </li>
            <li>I will order these again when I need new brushes again.</li>
            <li>The outer rings do not move at all, but the center does move, it definitely cleans my face better than just using my hands.</li>
            <li>These do the exact same thing at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>The only con that I had was that it shed the first couple of uses, which the Clarisonic ones never have.</li>
            <li>The only difference in that there were a couple of stray bristles that came out the first time I used the head, which I never noticed with the Clarisonic head.  </li>
            <li>My initial review of the produce was \\&quot;Disappointed\\&quot; because the first brush I tried stopped oscillating once the Clarsionic paused between areas of the face.</li>
            <li>The middle head didn&#x27;t want to spin at first but a little adjustment and works fine now.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and most everyone found it comparable, but for those with extremely sensitive skin like myself, it is way too harsh!</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased to get a brush that &amp;#34;seemed&amp;#34; to work the same for much less.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that the bristles are longer than the ones that came with my Mia, but they are soft and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these.  </li>
            <li>Would they really feel the same?</li>
            <li>They also have a soft feel to them.</li>
            <li>I would have to remove it and put it back in again to get it to work and having to do that every time the Clarisonic pauses was a real pain in the neck.  </li>
            <li>It is not the same as the real Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li>So to test it out I got an authentic clairsonic brush put it in and saw that it spins in the the center as well as the outside, but when I put this brush in it only vibrates and does not do the spinning action.</li>
            <li>Wow I never knew I could buy affordable brush heads for my clarisonic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and they will help clean your face a little.</li>
            <li>I would order the sensitive skin brush heads even if you want something more serious.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular refills...... ...  ...</li>
            <li>These are much  rougher than the official Clarisonic brushes and definitely not for extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the normal did only with a softer brush.</li>
            <li>I have the sensitive ones from Mia and these are very similar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-highly recommend these, I will be buying the variety pack to see if any other brush head is nicer for my skin, I usually use normal but excited to try the cashmere ones</li>
            <li>I bought the sensitive skin brushes, I previously had the Clarisonic normal head brushes and these are different.</li>

            <li> I was extremely pleased to get a brush that &amp;#34;seemed&amp;#34; to work the same for much less.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the bristles are longer than the ones that came with my Mia, but they are soft and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these.  </li>
            <li> Would they really feel the same?</li>
            <li> They also have a soft feel to them.</li>
            <li> I would have to remove it and put it back in again to get it to work and having to do that every time the Clarisonic pauses was a real pain in the neck.  </li>
            <li> It is not the same as the real Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> So to test it out I got an authentic clairsonic brush put it in and saw that it spins in the the center as well as the outside, but when I put this brush in it only vibrates and does not do the spinning action.</li>
            <li> Wow I never knew I could buy affordable brush heads for my clarisonic!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and they will help clean your face a little.</li>
            <li> I would order the sensitive skin brush heads even if you want something more serious.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular refills...... ...  ...</li>
            <li> These are much  rougher than the official Clarisonic brushes and definitely not for extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the normal did only with a softer brush.</li>
            <li> I have the sensitive ones from Mia and these are very similar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-highly recommend these, I will be buying the variety pack to see if any other brush head is nicer for my skin, I usually use normal but excited to try the cashmere ones</li>
            <li> I bought the sensitive skin brushes, I previously had the Clarisonic normal head brushes and these are different.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive aging skin and the sensitive brush that comes with the clarisonic was just a little to harsh</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these replacement heads for my clarisonic Pro, would they really fit?</li>
            <li> Oddly, the charge to the Mia doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.  </li>
            <li> I give this a BIG THUMBS DOWN.</li>
            <li> They do feel a little different than the Clarisonic brand brush heads -</li>
            <li> These brushes make changing out your brush head every three months less painful, since they&#x27;re so much more affordable.</li>
            <li> The outer rows of brushes are fanned out and don&#x27;t lay flushed against the other rows of brushes.</li>
            <li> 2 for half the price of one?</li>
            <li> These knock offs are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> And seriously you guys?</li>
            <li> Budgeting 25 a month for a brush head for my clarisonic seemed ridiculous, but 7 a month?</li>
            <li> if $25 every 3 months is too expensive, don&#x27;t buy a clairisonic.</li>
            <li> an always purchased the expensive brush replacements from Macys.</li>
            <li> The brush hair keeps losing. :(</li>
            <li> and I have been very disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> I bought the sensitive skin brushes, I previously had the Clarisonic normal head brushes and these are different. I didnt feel like the bristles were moving at all, I just felt like my handle was vibrating. I bought a clarisonic brand brush head to compare but as of right now I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything.  Update:  These don&#x27;t do anything! Yes they fit on my brush but the bristles don&#x27;t oscillate like they do on the normal clairsonic head. You can see it. When you turn on the brush the bristles stay still, so I guess if you don&#x27;t want to ever charge your brush you can use these.. And seriously you guys? if $25 every 3 months is too expensive, don&#x27;t buy a clairisonic. These knock offs are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are not the ones that are made to go with my SonicCare Mia, but they do fit very well.  I have noticed that the bristles are longer than the ones that came with my Mia, but they are soft and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> The sensitive brush head is ideal for most skin types, including sensitive. Perfect for exfoliating skin, shaving prep, and for use on the d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and body, these brush heads do it all</li>
            <li> So glad I stumbled up this find. I am always excited about finding great deals on no name dupes and this is no exception. Ive been using the Clarisonic for 2 years an always purchased the expensive brush replacements from Macys. These do the exact same thing at a fraction of the cost. Now if only someone could duplicate the beauty blender, Is be on cloud nine.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are better than the original my MIA came with. They are so soft and easy to attach. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive aging skin and the sensitive brush that comes with the clarisonic was just a little to harsh so I thought I would try this one and it was great!! I have no redness/irritation with this brush and my skin is clean feeling. I love this product and use it every evening! It helps my skin by removing all products after I have used my favorite make up remover. It is extremely gentle on my highly sensitive skin!  I love how my acne I did have as an adult has begun to diminish and I feel more confident!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP JUNK</li>
            <li> Works just like the one from Clarisonic</li>
            <li> I think that the best part of these brush heads is that Procizion doesn&#x27;t make it sound like their the exact same thing like a lot of other companies do. They&#x27;re not trying to trick you. These brush heads feel softer than the originals. The only con that I had was that it shed the first couple of uses, which the Clarisonic ones never have. All in All, this is a quality product and I&#x27;m glad that I took a chance on it. It was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads feel and look the same as the Clarisonic heads.  The only difference in that there were a couple of stray bristles that came out the first time I used the head, which I never noticed with the Clarisonic head.  Overall, a great replacement head for the cost-conscious.</li>
            <li> Pleasant and easy transaction.  I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Fits my Mia 2.  Works perfectly!!  Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular refills...... ...  ...</li>
            <li> It is really soft, very good for sensitive skin, but the quality is not good. The brush hair keeps losing. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used &amp;#34;normal skin&amp;#34; heads on my Mia2 by Clarisonic, but these sensitive skin replacement heads fit no problem and vibrate/rotate just like the normal did only with a softer brush. I&#x27;m glad to have found an affordable brush head - now I will replace them every 3 months as recommended.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my Mia... couldn&#x27;t be happier to get double the product for half the price.</li>
            <li> a great purchase.  felt brushes were very similar to clarisonic-brand brush replacements....except, that these brushes cost a fraction of the brand replacements.  will order this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I found these. They fit my Mia2 perfectly. They do feel a little different than the Clarisonic brand brush heads - these feel like you&#x27;re washing your face with a chamois. It&#x27;s very nice. I loved spending $15 for 2 instead of $25 for 1! I will definitely purchase these again in the future.</li>
            <li> These brush heads do fit the Mia 2 and work fine.  Oddly, the charge to the Mia doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.  PRO - the brush heads don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;gunked up&amp;#34; around the edges like the Mia brush does; much easier to keep clean. CON - the brush head gets stiffer over time; doesn&#x27;t stay soft - and I do clean the brush heads after every use.  I would order the sensitive skin brush heads even if you want something more serious.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to the regular Mia 2 brush head replacements and suck up the cost.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon! The middle head didn&#x27;t want to spin at first but a little adjustment and works fine now.</li>
            <li> The outer rings do not move at all, but the center does move, it definitely cleans my face better than just using my hands. Does it work as well or better than the genuine $27 brush? Jury is still out. I will keep buying because the price is nice.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these.  Buy the original ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how the others were able to get these to work.  They &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; in the Clarisonic and snap in place, but when you turn on the handle they brushes don&#x27;t clean or vibrate as with the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was money thrown away.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these replacement heads for my clarisonic Pro, would they really fit? Would they really feel the same? 2 for half the price of one? The answer is a resounding YES! Budgeting 25 a month for a brush head for my clarisonic seemed ridiculous, but 7 a month? I can totally justify that. I&#x27;m using my clarisonic daily again and I couldn&#x27;t possibly be happier.</li>
            <li> Better off buying the real thing</li>
            <li> These work great on my mia2. The snapped right in, and the center oscillates perfectly. A fantastic alternative and will buy again!</li>
            <li> great present for my mother since she has one and was needing refills anyways. thank you again</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between it and the Clarisonic.  Fits my Mia brush perfectly and bristles are nice and soft for my sensitive skin.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> super cheap. Works as well as the original</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my wife to replace the facial head for her Clarisonic at a third of the cost. Same quality, great seller, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The price is great, which is what drew me to the product, however I am not sure if it is worth a repurchase. The bristles do not feels as nice as the branded brush heads and sometimes they stiffen up. Also sometimes it does not lock in place properly and the vibrations are off so you have to take it off and put it back on again.</li>
            <li> These are much  rougher than the official Clarisonic brushes and definitely not for extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These brushes work for my Pro System. The outer rows of brushes are fanned out and don&#x27;t lay flushed against the other rows of brushes. They also have a soft feel to them.</li>
            <li> My initial review of the produce was \\&quot;Disappointed\\&quot; because the first brush I tried stopped oscillating once the Clarsionic paused between areas of the face. I would have to remove it and put it back in again to get it to work and having to do that every time the Clarisonic pauses was a real pain in the neck.  When the seller asked for a review I told him in an e-mail the problem and he asked if I&#x27;d be willing to try a new box of the brushes for free -- that the problem I had is unusual and that they stand by their brushes.  I said I would happily try again since I really wanted them to work because they are much more cost effective than the Clarisonic brushes.  New ones arrived within two days and I tried both immediately and both worked GREAT!  I love the sensitive skin brush because if feels much softer on my face.  I was VERY IMPRESSED with the customer service...a \\&quot;commodity\\&quot; that I highly value and find rather rare these days!  I will order these again when I need new brushes again.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect on my Mia... texture feels the same.  We&#x27;ll have to wait and see how it lasts.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, fits clarisonic mia, but NOT soft.  I&#x27;ve used the Clarisonic brushes, and they are not abrasive like these ones.  I give them three for the arrival time, price, and because they function.</li>
            <li> Cant be without this love it</li>
            <li> The Brush Heads fit my Clairasonic Mia 2 and at a Lower Price. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best deals I have found on AMAZON yet! The quality of these replacement brush heads is WAYYYYY better than I thought it would be! I&#x27;m using it with my MIA and it fits perfect. Great deal so don&#x27;t hesitate!!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement brushes for my Clarisonic Cleanser and they fit perfectly!  I love that they are gentle for sensitive skin, but paired with the Clarisonic they provide a great deep cleaning.  I will be buying these replacement brushes again!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Great brush heads! These were easy to put on and work just like the name brand. No complaints!</li>
            <li> They are much softer than the brand name Clarisonic Sensitive brush heads, and the middle section doesn&#x27;t rotate quite the right way either.  But at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and they will help clean your face a little.</li>
            <li> It is not the same as the real Clarisonic brush. I read the reviews and most everyone found it comparable, but for those with extremely sensitive skin like myself, it is way too harsh! It broke out my face and I have been very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Great brush heads!  For a fraction of the cost of Clarisonic heads, they work perfectly!</li>
            <li> I got these as a sample for review because they are a perfect match to my Mia 2. I have the sensitive ones from Mia and these are very similar.I used them 2-3 times per week while I&#x27;m in the shower with my face wash to exfoliate my face, and it does a really nice job!  I&#x27;m really satisfied with these, particularly because they cost so much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am still loving these brush heads. My skin feels wonderful! Never buying the more expensive ones again.</li>
            <li> Those brushes work well with my Clarisonic plus. The brush is softer than we have now.</li>
            <li> These are a way better value than the Clarisonic brush heads and perform just the same. They fit perfectly on my Clarisonic. They remove all dirt, oil, and makeup from my face, and leave my face feeling clean and smooth. The bristles are very soft and great for my sensitive skin! These are absolutely fantastic. If you haven&#x27;t tried them you definitely should!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are a must! Seriously, such a great alternative to the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; replacements that retail for much more.  I&#x27;m so glad I found these brushes and they fit on my brush perfectly.  These brushes make changing out your brush head every three months less painful, since they&#x27;re so much more affordable.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I thought it was great. I was extremely pleased to get a brush that &amp;#34;seemed&amp;#34; to work the same for much less.  As some time went by I realized that is wasn&#x27;t performing the way the clairsonic brush does. So to test it out I got an authentic clairsonic brush put it in and saw that it spins in the the center as well as the outside, but when I put this brush in it only vibrates and does not do the spinning action. I took it out several times pushed it in and tried to get it to work but no go.  I was right that it wasn&#x27;t working they way it should.  I give this a BIG THUMBS DOWN.</li>
            <li> Wow I never knew I could buy affordable brush heads for my clarisonic!&lt;br /&gt;- these fit my Mia 2 perfectly&lt;br /&gt;- they feel just like the clarisonic brush heads&lt;br /&gt;- they are so much more affordable here that you can actually try out all the different types of heads and not spend $25 each&lt;br /&gt;- now I am actually change the brush every 3 months cause paying $25 every 3 months was not working out for me&lt;br /&gt;- yes there are even cheaper brush heads on Amazon (I just found out) but this seller has great customer service like someone else said so I will definitely be buying from this seller in the future&lt;br /&gt;-highly recommend these, I will be buying the variety pack to see if any other brush head is nicer for my skin, I usually use normal but excited to try the cashmere ones&lt;br /&gt;- received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and soooo glad I did because I WILL be buying more from this seller!</li>
