            <li>There is no scent, it absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I apply it underneath and on my lids before bed.</li>

            <li>Also rub on body in shower after cleansing and rinse excess off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my face.</li>
            <li>I would consider this to anyone that natural and seeking an excellent option to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li>Grapeseed oil is good for hair cuticles which get smooth and sealed; the oil prevents the splitting of hair-ends.&lt;br</li>

            <li>that&#x27;s okay.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite bath oil.</li>
            <li>Should have known better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Grape Seed oil.</li>
            <li>I love grapeseed oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love NOW  oils</li>
            <li>they may not be more than food grade oils</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>In the winter I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li>It feels great instantly, and the best and most telling part is that it STAYS feeling good by the next day even after washing my hands.</li>

            <li>Use it on my skin and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>great :) highly recommended</li>
            <li>Great for bare skin moisturizer or even to combine in your own skin care recipes.</li>
            <li>The oil is perfect for a lubricant for ear stretching and perfect for getting dry ear lobes back up to date.</li>
            <li>This oil is a great companion with my new oil mix for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great nourishment for my natural hair!</li>
            <li>I LOVE light weigh of hospitals</li>
            <li>This is a very mild carrier oil selection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made learning about natural hair care and hair products one of my hobbies and after some research I found that grape seed oil is amazing for hair - any hair!</li>
            <li>it is perfect for those,who need moisture without feeling greasy or weighted down.  </li>
            <li>Grapeseed oil gives a fine sheen to hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>so I use strong products, this stuff keeps my face moisturized and flake free.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light and provides the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>This is a really light oil, but I don&#x27;t use this on my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great as a skin moisturizer, personal lubricant,hair conditioner... everything!</li>
            <li>Great oil for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>It is a wonderfully smooth oil used alone, or as a carrier.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, great for skin, hair nails and many other uses!</li>
            <li>I wish I had got the 4 oz size,  Works good, light, but I would have liked a little fragrance to it, it smells to oily.</li>
            <li>this oil is perfect and it is not too heavy!</li>
            <li>reason for all these benefits is the rich composition of the oil.</li>
            <li>These constituents have significant regenerative, moisturizing and nourishing properties.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product do far.</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with this oil.</li>
            <li>Great for massages, dry or itchy skin, etc.</li>
            <li>i have super sensitive skin, it is excellent mixed in with homemade lotions/creams.</li>
            <li>I keep it cool</li>
            <li>I was pleased with how fast it arrived and how well it blends with my oils.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>its a main oil in my life :)</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself.</li>
            <li>but it does soak in quickly so</li>
            <li>The oil is of good quality, pleasant smell,mixed well with other oils to create body related products.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Honestly when I orderred I got several oils and</li>
            <li>here hair was SOFT, SHINY, SMOOTH EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and sensitive and is so affordable.</li>
            <li>I love this for my adult acne skin....</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and without any leaking in the box and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>right now I&#x27;m using one of the others.</li>
            <li>I have oil cleansed for the past year, using coconut, almond, olive, and castor oil,but this by far is the best oil I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>Sweet almond oil contains vitamin A, B and E in addition to omega 9, omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids that help keep hair strong and healthy, preventing against breakage.</li>
            <li>You can use it alone or with different essential oil as a carrier oil and it will work great .</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed and got here super fast</li>
            <li>I ordered this and expected something amazing, but it&#x27;s only okay.</li>
            <li>I cleanse with olive oil and moisturize with the grape seed oil, and my skin is soo soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this item in hopes that it would add a scent to my organic hair spray which is just a mix of essential oils and fresh bottled water, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>I have never purchased grape seed oil before, but I think its high quality and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I put it in a smaller dropper bottle for easy application.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lessen the acne, but it certainly does not make me break out.</li>
            <li>Great product for missing essential oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than make up remover and coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>After using it for about 3 weeks I have really seen a difference in my face.</li>
            <li>My acne has cleared up and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn acne</li>
            <li>but i was really hoping for the smell.</li>
            <li>I have low porosity hair,do it is important that I use a lightweight oil.  </li>
            <li>Of all the oils I&#x27;ve tried this is the lightest and fastest absorbing.</li>
            <li>It has no odor and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>just tried it for the first time cooking with it.(asparagus so far)</li>
            <li>This has quickly became part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main features are high amount of Omega-6 (linoleic) fatty acid, of strong antioxidants (procyanidolic oligomers) and of Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>I also use it with a pinch of brown sugar to exfoliate my lips when they&#x27;re chapped, it leaves them very soft.</li>
            <li>no bad smell like other oils..</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>I researched natural</li>
            <li>awsome natural feel.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive like me then you will thank it .</li>
            <li>I use it on my body and my natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and moisturized and so it my skin.</li>
            <li>It does NOT feel oily, just soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I chopped off over 22&amp;#34; of relaxed hair over a year ago and now wear my hair in its natural state.</li>
            <li>Grapeseed oil retains the natural moisture and softness of hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The product arrived on schedule and professionally wrapped.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions at all.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Ranging from products for sensitive skin to dermatologist prescribed lotions to all natural products.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly as a moisturizer  also can use in the kitchen where I think its main purpose belongs, but the fringe benefits in skin care is very hard to ignore..</li>
            <li>This concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and other oils has really revived my natural coils.</li>
            <li>My skin started to clear up and has never felt softer and this is only after two uses!</li>
            <li>I use this grape seed oil as a carrier oil with my Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it am currently using it mixed with a few other oils to oil my scalp</li>
            <li>Now instead of constantly finding new pimples, I only have the occasional hormonal breakout.</li>
            <li>I have horrible reactions using pretty much any kind of lotion, face wash, or skin treatment.</li>

            <li> Great for bare skin moisturizer or even to combine in your own skin care recipes.</li>
            <li> The oil is perfect for a lubricant for ear stretching and perfect for getting dry ear lobes back up to date.</li>
            <li> This oil is a great companion with my new oil mix for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great nourishment for my natural hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE light weigh of hospitals</li>
            <li> This is a very mild carrier oil selection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made learning about natural hair care and hair products one of my hobbies and after some research I found that grape seed oil is amazing for hair - any hair!</li>
            <li> it is perfect for those,who need moisture without feeling greasy or weighted down.  </li>
            <li> Grapeseed oil gives a fine sheen to hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> so I use strong products, this stuff keeps my face moisturized and flake free.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light and provides the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a really light oil, but I don&#x27;t use this on my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great as a skin moisturizer, personal lubricant,hair conditioner... everything!</li>
            <li> Great oil for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> It is a wonderfully smooth oil used alone, or as a carrier.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, great for skin, hair nails and many other uses!</li>
            <li> I wish I had got the 4 oz size,  Works good, light, but I would have liked a little fragrance to it, it smells to oily.</li>
            <li> this oil is perfect and it is not too heavy!</li>
            <li> reason for all these benefits is the rich composition of the oil.</li>
            <li> These constituents have significant regenerative, moisturizing and nourishing properties.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product do far.</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed with this oil.</li>
            <li> Great for massages, dry or itchy skin, etc.</li>
            <li> i have super sensitive skin, it is excellent mixed in with homemade lotions/creams.</li>
            <li> I keep it cool</li>
            <li> I was pleased with how fast it arrived and how well it blends with my oils.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> its a main oil in my life :)</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly and feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself.</li>
            <li> but it does soak in quickly so</li>
            <li> The oil is of good quality, pleasant smell,mixed well with other oils to create body related products.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Honestly when I orderred I got several oils and</li>
            <li> here hair was SOFT, SHINY, SMOOTH EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and sensitive and is so affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this for my adult acne skin....</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and without any leaking in the box and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> right now I&#x27;m using one of the others.</li>
            <li> I have oil cleansed for the past year, using coconut, almond, olive, and castor oil,but this by far is the best oil I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> Sweet almond oil contains vitamin A, B and E in addition to omega 9, omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids that help keep hair strong and healthy, preventing against breakage.</li>
            <li> You can use it alone or with different essential oil as a carrier oil and it will work great .</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed and got here super fast</li>
            <li> I ordered this and expected something amazing, but it&#x27;s only okay.</li>
            <li> I cleanse with olive oil and moisturize with the grape seed oil, and my skin is soo soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item in hopes that it would add a scent to my organic hair spray which is just a mix of essential oils and fresh bottled water, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased grape seed oil before, but I think its high quality and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I put it in a smaller dropper bottle for easy application.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lessen the acne, but it certainly does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> Great product for missing essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than make up remover and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> After using it for about 3 weeks I have really seen a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> My acne has cleared up and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn acne</li>
            <li> but i was really hoping for the smell.</li>
            <li> I have low porosity hair,do it is important that I use a lightweight oil.  </li>
            <li> Of all the oils I&#x27;ve tried this is the lightest and fastest absorbing.</li>
            <li> It has no odor and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> just tried it for the first time cooking with it.(asparagus so far)</li>
            <li> This has quickly became part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main features are high amount of Omega-6 (linoleic) fatty acid, of strong antioxidants (procyanidolic oligomers) and of Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I also use it with a pinch of brown sugar to exfoliate my lips when they&#x27;re chapped, it leaves them very soft.</li>
            <li> no bad smell like other oils..</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I researched natural</li>
            <li> awsome natural feel.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive like me then you will thank it .</li>
            <li> I use it on my body and my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and moisturized and so it my skin.</li>
            <li> It does NOT feel oily, just soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I chopped off over 22&amp;#34; of relaxed hair over a year ago and now wear my hair in its natural state.</li>
            <li> Grapeseed oil retains the natural moisture and softness of hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The product arrived on schedule and professionally wrapped.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions at all.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Ranging from products for sensitive skin to dermatologist prescribed lotions to all natural products.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly as a moisturizer  also can use in the kitchen where I think its main purpose belongs, but the fringe benefits in skin care is very hard to ignore..</li>
            <li> This concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and other oils has really revived my natural coils.</li>
            <li> My skin started to clear up and has never felt softer and this is only after two uses!</li>
            <li> I use this grape seed oil as a carrier oil with my Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it am currently using it mixed with a few other oils to oil my scalp</li>
            <li> Now instead of constantly finding new pimples, I only have the occasional hormonal breakout.</li>
            <li> I have horrible reactions using pretty much any kind of lotion, face wash, or skin treatment.</li>
            <li> always nice to get a fresher product, a tint of green and very subtle scent, nothing offensive at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this small size to use for travel, but ordered the large bottle, too.</li>
            <li> I use a wide array of essential oils in my hair and this is one of my faves.</li>
            <li> a lot of people think oils are expensive for skin care, no more than you use its a money saver and so nice to your skin....</li>
            <li> the days of drying out your skin with SeaBreeze are long gone!).  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils</li>
            <li> her ends were previously extremely dry but after using these two?</li>
            <li> I also like to massage it into my forehead for my wrinkles that are appearing from age, sun and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It can be used for moisturizing dry skin and has not caused any irritation as products with fragrances can.</li>
            <li> I have also previously taken acutane, and am going back for my second round within the week, so I do have very dry acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I can only use a little on my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to massage my face and as a base before applying moisturizer, gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Do not dry or pat the body after a shower just rub a small amount of the oil on the body</li>
            <li> Mixes well with other oils as a skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Helps really during the cold seasons as we know that the scalp can become really dry then.</li>
            <li> Here are just a few reasons why you should think about incorporating it into your hair regimen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will order this product again as it is not easily available in my area.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not tooo oily.</li>
            <li> did use the bottle instead of the usual olive oil I cook with</li>
            <li> Applya a quarter size amount rubbed between hands to ends of hair for no more split ends.</li>
            <li> it is not too thick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they do the same as the expensive name branded ones!</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how I discovered this product, only to say that it provides 10 times the softness and luxury of my very expensive hand products.  </li>
            <li> Though expensive.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never go wrong w/ their products.</li>
            <li> and it has not gone bad yet</li>
            <li> Broke out my face really bad...</li>
            <li> This oil worked bvery well as a carrier oil in my home made bug repellent .</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great oil at a great price!</li>
            <li> This oil worked bvery well as a carrier oil in my home made bug repellent . I keep it cool and it has not gone bad yet , it has been several months now! I would recommend this product, great for skin, hair nails and many other uses!</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Good product. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Got my product o  time and it was what I expexted. Wish I could&#x27;ve had the bigger bottle shipled to me but that&#x27;s okay. I love everything about it am currently using it mixed with a few other oils to oil my scalp</li>
            <li> THIS IS USED IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE HAIR AND SKIN PRODUCTS AND I USE IT ON MY SKIN AT NIGHT AFTER I WASH MY FACE, AND MY SKIN ABSORBS IT IN. THIS IS GREAT MIXING LOTIONS AND HAIR CONDITIONER ETC.</li>
            <li> A bit thinner than I had hoped for... really more like mineral oil than anything vegetal.</li>
            <li> This is a really light oil, but I don&#x27;t use this on my skin. The Grapeseed oil is a part of a mixture of organic essential oils for my hair. This concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and other oils has really revived my natural coils.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face, hands, hair and remove make up. It&#x27;s so much easier than make up remover and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Part of my moisturizing regimen for my skin and hair (oily skin actually benefits from applying oils to it...the days of drying out your skin with SeaBreeze are long gone!).  Really like it.</li>
            <li> Honestly when I orderred I got several oils and right now I&#x27;m using one of the others. But it smells pleasant and gives good coverage on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath oil. I purchased this small size to use for travel, but ordered the large bottle, too.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil.. keeps my hair shinny and strong.. no bad smell like other oils.. it is not too thick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just perfect! I will definitely buy it again...</li>
            <li> This is a very mild carrier oil selection. It has no smell and while i do not use it on my face-i have super sensitive skin, it is excellent mixed in with homemade lotions/creams.</li>
            <li> This is a great light hair moisturizer. Mixes well with other oils as a skin moisturizer. Will try it as a deep conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how amazing this works!  My skin started to clear up and has never felt softer and this is only after two uses!</li>
            <li> Grapeseed Oil is wonderful for the skin, esp after a shower. Do not dry or pat the body after a shower just rub a small amount of the oil on the body</li>
            <li> After using it for about 3 weeks I have really seen a difference in my face. My acne has cleared up and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle.  This has quickly became part of my daily routine.  I use this in my daily moisturizer anf in face masks</li>
            <li> smells amazing!! Works great for a lotion!</li>
            <li> this product has proven to be great for massage, Yet to try it in the kitchen as suggested.  It will be great if the manufacturers can expressly prescribe what uses their products can be put.  Think I need a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> l got this because it&#x27;s supposed to be good for acne prone skin, and it is! It doesn&#x27;t lessen the acne, but it certainly does not make me break out. I have very stubborn acne so I use strong products, this stuff keeps my face moisturized and flake free.</li>
            <li> Broke out my face really bad... Even my ears. Not for sensitive skin at all. Should have known better.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair,skin and homemade hair conditioners. just tried it for the first time cooking with it.(asparagus so far)</li>
            <li> The oil is of good quality, pleasant smell,mixed well with other oils to create body related products.  Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Using as carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li> I used it for my hair. I loved it! It lasted me an entire year and I still have some left! I will def buy from NOW Foods again but I think I&#x27;ll try a different oil.</li>
            <li> It is very beautiful and amazing results</li>
            <li> Though expensive. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Grape Seed oil. Whether for cosmetic or food use. This is quality oil. I bought a smaller quantity for cosmetic use because you don&#x27;t need a lot, plus I didn&#x27;t want it to spoil.</li>
            <li> I love grapeseed oil as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s the perfect make-up remover and moisturizer that won&#x27;t break you out!</li>
            <li> This is so nice on my face! I love NOW  oils they may not be more than food grade oils but they do the same as the expensive name branded ones!</li>
            <li> Great for bare skin moisturizer or even to combine in your own skin care recipes.</li>
            <li> Suggested by an aesthetician and it&#x27;s great. Just leave some time for it to soak in because it&#x27;s concentrates goodness.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s the summer time I was looking for lighter oils to switch up my hair routine. I tried this when my jojoba oil ran out. I mixed it with other oils and I think it irritates my scalp. I will probably use this for my skin instead.</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin and this oil does not work for me. It caused a lot of whiteheads on my face so i stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended</li>
            <li> Grapeseed oil can be used for everything from cooking to massages!  great for after a shower, use it in your hair, in scrubs, everything!  Makes amazing fries too! :)</li>
            <li> I use this cuase its organic and good for your skin plus i think oil just feels good on the skin</li>
            <li> I use Grape Seed Oil as my facial moisturizer. It goes on very light and provides the right amount of moisture. I started using coconut oil but I have larger pores and found it can clog my pores. Grape seed oil doesn&#x27;t seem to do that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great I researched natural&lt;br /&gt;Products that are good for your skin bans I kept seeing this and I used it in my homemade skin moisturizer and it worked great! Good price too love it!</li>
            <li> I used this in my sister relaxed hair along with jbco as a deep conditioning treatment and her ends were previously extremely dry but after using these two? here hair was SOFT, SHINY, SMOOTH EVERYTHING! this oil is perfect and it is not too heavy!</li>
            <li> awsome natural feel. Its great to put some in your bath water or just use it like lotion. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Great nourishment for my natural hair!</li>
            <li> I love the grape seed oil and the service!</li>
            <li> I used it on me skin and it left an oily residue... so I wouldn&#x27;t use it for that...&lt;br /&gt;I did use the bottle instead of the usual olive oil I cook with and I felt it came out a lot healthier and lighter.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item in hopes that it would add a scent to my organic hair spray which is just a mix of essential oils and fresh bottled water, but to no avail. i suppose it serves its purpose as an added nutrient to my mixture but i was really hoping for the smell. but all in all good for conditioning and moisturizing. :)</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed and got here super fast</li>
            <li> This stuff is great as a skin moisturizer, personal lubricant,hair conditioner... everything! It&#x27;s safe and sensitive and is so affordable.</li>
            <li> Loved every bit of the oil, until my dog chewed up the bottle and spilled all the oil on my floor. The oil is perfect for a lubricant for ear stretching and perfect for getting dry ear lobes back up to date.</li>
            <li> I use the oil to apply to my scalp and let me say that I love it! Helps really during the cold seasons as we know that the scalp can become really dry then.</li>
            <li> exp was 2015..always nice to get a fresher product, a tint of green and very subtle scent, nothing offensive at all. It absorbs very quickly as a moisturizer  also can use in the kitchen where I think its main purpose belongs, but the fringe benefits in skin care is very hard to ignore..a lot of people think oils are expensive for skin care, no more than you use its a money saver and so nice to your skin....its a main oil in my life :)</li>
            <li> I would consider this to anyone that natural and seeking an excellent option to seal in moisture. This oil is odorless!</li>
            <li> I have begun to use this product in conjunction with my facial moisturizer and by itself. Keeps my skin supple.</li>
            <li> Great oil for multiple uses. I use it to massage my face and as a base before applying moisturizer, gives my skin a nice glow. There is no scent, it absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I apply it underneath and on my lids before bed. I also use it with a pinch of brown sugar to exfoliate my lips when they&#x27;re chapped, it leaves them very soft. I tried this remedy after hearing Dr. Oz say you can exfoliate anything with brown sugar and oilive oil but I was out of olive oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is a great companion with my new oil mix for my hair. Thank you I will buy  it again.</li>
            <li> It is a very light oil . If your skin is sensitive like me then you will thank it . You can use it alone or with different essential oil as a carrier oil and it will work great . My skin combination which is sensitive and acne prone but after using this it has become more hydrated and definitely happy !!</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase, recommend!</li>
            <li> I use it on my body and my natural hair. I love it. My hair is soft and moisturized and so it my skin. In the winter I&#x27;ll order more. It&#x27;s so light but I can tell it&#x27;s coating well</li>
            <li> I ordered this and expected something amazing, but it&#x27;s only okay. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet though, so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> What can I say?! This product is great! I use it on my face as a moisturizer and also for massage oil! works great :) highly recommended</li>
            <li> All NOW Carrier Oils are excellent and def a great value. You&#x27;ll never go wrong w/ their products.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this for my face. I broke out quite a bit. I have been mixing it with my conditioner and body lotion to use it up. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this for my adult acne skin....it helps with acne scars and when i get a zit...and as it is drying, it gets crusty looking and the oil helps with this.</li>
            <li> I use this product to massage it into my face for 10 minutes before bed and also my scalp so when I wake up and shower I can rinse it all off.  My hair line was beginning to look sparse like I was balding and two weeks after using this as a scalp massage oil I noticed a difference. I also like to massage it into my forehead for my wrinkles that are appearing from age, sun and dry skin.  This product does wonders!</li>
            <li> what a great product!  i spend a ton of money on Sephora products and am a freak about hand creams.  I cannot remember how I discovered this product, only to say that it provides 10 times the softness and luxury of my very expensive hand products.  AND I  now add a tsp of this to ALL my body care lotions and creams.  It feels great instantly, and the best and most telling part is that it STAYS feeling good by the next day even after washing my hands. It does NOT feel oily, just soft and moisturized. I put it in a smaller dropper bottle for easy application.</li>
            <li> I use this grape seed oil as a carrier oil with my Young Living Essential Oils. It is a wonderfully smooth oil used alone, or as a carrier. I have used this oil alone to moisturize my face, hands, and legs. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> My sister told me she puts grape seed oil on her skin when she goes to bed at night. I bought it and started mixing it with my night time moisturizer. I love it! It&#x27;s making a difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I chopped off over 22&amp;#34; of relaxed hair over a year ago and now wear my hair in its natural state. I&#x27;ve made learning about natural hair care and hair products one of my hobbies and after some research I found that grape seed oil is amazing for hair - any hair! Here are just a few reasons why you should think about incorporating it into your hair regimen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Grapeseed oil restores the cell membranes of a scalp, strengthens hair roots and reduces brittleness in hair, thus grapeseed oil treats hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;- Grapeseed oil eliminates hair loss through lowering the level of hormone dihydrotestosterone.&lt;br /&gt;- Grapeseed oil is good for hair cuticles which get smooth and sealed; the oil prevents the splitting of hair-ends.&lt;br /&gt;- Grapeseed oil retains the natural moisture and softness of hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Grapeseed oil gives a fine sheen to hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Regularly usage of grapeseed oil for hair solves the problem of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;- Grapeseed oil can be used as a heat protector for damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for all these benefits is the rich composition of the oil. It&#x27;s main features are high amount of Omega-6 (linoleic) fatty acid, of strong antioxidants (procyanidolic oligomers) and of Vitamin E. These constituents have significant regenerative, moisturizing and nourishing properties. I advise you to buy the biggest size because once you start seeing the benefits, you&#x27;ll use it for everything!</li>

I have low porosity hair,do it is important that I use a lightweight oil.  I will order this product again as it is not easily available in my area. Very pleased with this product do far.</li>
            <li> Great size and dispenser for use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive :)</li>
            <li> I add several oils together in a jar and use them in my bathroom after I shower my skin is more supple and softer. I am trying to get rid of cellulite and while I see no improvement there yet I have noticed it looks like the cellulite is breaking up..</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own cuticle oil.  I have never purchased grape seed oil before, but I think its high quality and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Of all the oils I&#x27;ve tried this is the lightest and fastest absorbing. The Now Company seems to make quality products. I have already repurchased this item. I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions at all.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and without any leaking in the box and is exactly what I wanted. I have already reordered it again. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> This was good. However, I had breakouts on my forehead. I can only use a little on my hair.</li>
            <li> Use it on my skin and love it. Great for massages, dry or itchy skin, etc. A staple.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. It can be used for moisturizing dry skin and has not caused any irritation as products with fragrances can. It absorbs into the skin quickly and feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself.</li>
            <li> I love it. Makes my skin feel so soft.  Also,  Best hair oil ever. Very light weight. Performing miracles.</li>
            <li> Visit http://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction and you&#x27;ll see The praises of the &amp;#34;oil cleanse method&amp;#34;. I love to use this as a moisturizer, and with help of a good AHA and BHA, I have noticed an incredible improvement in my acne. Now instead of constantly finding new pimples, I only have the occasional hormonal breakout. Awesome purchase and has many uses. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I have horrible reactions using pretty much any kind of lotion, face wash, or skin treatment. Ranging from products for sensitive skin to dermatologist prescribed lotions to all natural products. I have also previously taken acutane, and am going back for my second round within the week, so I do have very dry acne prone skin. I have oil cleansed for the past year, using coconut, almond, olive, and castor oil,but this by far is the best oil I&#x27;ve found yet. I cleanse with olive oil and moisturize with the grape seed oil, and my skin is soo soft and smooth now. It feels wonderful to massage on but it does soak in quickly so there is no oily feeling after like there are with some. My skin no longer flakes off in the middle if the day, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had for years. It does not clog pores or irritate my skin. My picky skin loves it.</li>
            <li> It is grape seed oil. I works for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try this with all my essential oils. Seems to be a great medium.</li>
            <li> This almond oil is great in your hair. I use a wide array of essential oils in my hair and this is one of my faves. It helps with damaged hair and gives you great results. Sweet almond oil contains vitamin A, B and E in addition to omega 9, omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids that help keep hair strong and healthy, preventing against breakage. I use it as an additive to my clay mask or as a pre-poo before washing my hair. I am never disappointed with this oil.</li>
            <li> Applya a quarter size amount rubbed between hands to ends of hair for no more split ends. Also rub on body in shower after cleansing and rinse excess off with warm water. 100X better than lotion!! A must have!!</li>
            <li> Excellent for hair and face.</li>
            <li> Very light, not too greasy.  Leaves the skin refreshed.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great! Feels nice on my face.</li>
            <li> I bough this to use as a carrier oil for my YL Essential Oils and I absolutely love it! It has no odor and is very moisturizing. I was pleased with how fast it arrived and how well it blends with my oils. I will definitely be buying again when I run out. This is a great quality product!</li>
            <li> I wish I had got the 4 oz size,  Works good, light, but I would have liked a little fragrance to it, it smells to oily.</li>
            <li> Great product for missing essential oils.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair. Not too heavy, not tooo oily. Castor oil drives me nuts. This is perfect. Thankyou!</li>
            <li> good oil would buy again!!</li>
