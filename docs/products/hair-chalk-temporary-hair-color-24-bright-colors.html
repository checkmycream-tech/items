            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>Then he called to find out where they got it so he could get some for her! :)</li>
            <li>This was as if I had ordered a hello kitty brand cup and this company sent me a Solo cup instead; then insisted that they had sent a CUP, so I must be satisfied.</li>
            <li>awesome at making new and exciting things with hair creations.</li>

            <li>This product is best used for small pieces like braids.</li>
            <li>This is so cool and so much fun!  </li>
            <li>It did not go on easy and it wipes right off.</li>
            <li>One chalk is only good for about one application.</li>
            <li>Many tutorials suggested that the whole head could be colored</li>
            <li>its not as much chalk like but more like pastels.</li>
            <li>My little girl loved thus hair chalk!</li>
            <li>and I was lucky to get this before Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really dries out/dreds my hair, but looks really cool and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>it comes out so pretty!</li>
            <li>but...that&#x27;s exactly what hair chalk is!</li>
            <li>I gave them to a friend with 4 blonde girls and they love them!</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have a huge passion for coloring your hair temporarily, I don&#x27;t really recommend buying these.</li>
            <li>And even if there weren&#x27;t, you could look up how to use them on google hair chalk is such a popular</li>
            <li>I thought it would be fun to chalk my hair.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice if box said in English &amp;#34;Hair Chalk...</li>
            <li>This is really fun to alter hair color......  </li>
            <li>I like them is fun to play with.</li>
            <li>I would return it, but the cost of shipping would not be worth it.</li>
            <li>and we had fun putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughters for a &#x27;fun&#x27; hair day.</li>
            <li>I got this alot earlier than expected, plus when i tried it, it looked AWESOME!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Ordered product and was pleased with the quickness of the shipping - Purchased it for my 9 year old daughter - wasn&#x27;t aware that I was getting artist pastel&#x27;s ,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great to have several shades of the same color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just gunna start out by saying it was my first time using hair chalk.</li>
            <li>Regular school chalk works better on the hair</li>
            <li>First, although I received a notice it shipped, it did not arrive in time for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Also the colors do not turn out exactly as they look.</li>
            <li>The pastels are pretty, but that&#x27;s all they are, coloring pastels from art class.</li>
            <li>This is cheaper and better than actually hair chalk.</li>
            <li>The color of each pastell is verry pretty</li>
            <li>it would probably be okay on blonde.</li>
            <li>and im very upset we waited almost two months to receive</li>
            <li>It also appears that, although labeled as hair chalk, it is really artist&#x27;s pastels.</li>
            <li>She did it the night before school and woke up absolutely covered in maroon chalk dye.</li>
            <li>I ordered Hair Chalk and i received art pastels that were straight from China.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t show up very well on my brown hair-</li>
            <li>This product shipped EXTREMELY fast --- and there are a lot of colors for the price.</li>
            <li>Not sure how safe it is!</li>
            <li>Besides, you never know if the stuff coming from other countries is safe because regulations vary.</li>
            <li>First of all, it wasn&#x27;t clear when I ordered it from Amazon that the shipper was in China...</li>
            <li>As far as no instructions, really you don&#x27;t need them!</li>
            <li>but I am less than satisfied.</li>
            <li>It breaks easily after it gets wet</li>
            <li>My hair is black and most colors didn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li>Many people are saying that this just the same as regular artists chalk, just way overpriced.</li>
            <li>It came from China, it was a lengthy delivery date and when I used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair, the color was vibrant (after you dampen hair).</li>
            <li>only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that since it&#x27;s chalk the colors kind of smashed into the sides of the packaging while shipping leaving bits of dust all over each other.</li>
            <li>Had to leran how to use this chalk,but the color pallette is great and for the price one cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out and it took 2-3 shampoos to get it out and make my hair feel normal again,</li>
            <li>it could take a few more days to ship&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>can only assume it&#x27;s regular pastel chalk, and maybe that is fine</li>
            <li>Was looking for an inexpensive way for my 11 year old to color her hair and this was it!  </li>
            <li>I watched YouTube videos of sweet young things carefully explaining to me e-x-a-c-t-l-y how to chalk my hair.</li>
            <li>It was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These came neatly packaged with a clear label, stating they are HAIR CHALK meant for HAIR and are in no way pastels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it came in a clear wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>AND it came directly from China.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised that it came in early.</li>
            <li>The whole box was written in Chinese.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 9 year old daughter and then had to look up directions for use.</li>
            <li>This was intended as a gift for a young child, as a hair product.</li>
            <li>A fun way to try different colors in your hair without a big commitment, as it washes out in one or two shampoos.</li>
            <li>Not great for African American hair... worked great on my (white) boyfriend&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Got these for my daughter for Christmas, but expected delivery was in first week of January.</li>
            <li>if I had really known that (not sure if true &amp;#34;hair chalk&amp;#34; is something different though), I could have purchased it from my local craft store.</li>
            <li>Hair chalk in general, i dont like.</li>
            <li>First off: My hair is REALLY dark brown.</li>
            <li>and it was just normal artist chalk in a blank white box - no instruction on how to dye hair</li>
            <li>and after it dries it is really hard to get it clean</li>
            <li>It is the same as soft pastels (not oil pastels) which is similar chalk.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright, but the process is long, messy, and your hair feels really crunchy and difficult to style.</li>
            <li>While using the pastel chalk, many have broken in my hand and overall, I would have been happier going to a local beauty store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anything really serious, just enough to kind of bother me a little bit.</li>
            <li>Not worth sending back seeing that I paid as much for the product as I did to ship it.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical, now I know I was right.</li>

            <li> Hair chalk in general, i dont like.</li>
            <li> First off: My hair is REALLY dark brown.</li>
            <li> and it was just normal artist chalk in a blank white box - no instruction on how to dye hair</li>
            <li> and after it dries it is really hard to get it clean</li>
            <li> It is the same as soft pastels (not oil pastels) which is similar chalk.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright, but the process is long, messy, and your hair feels really crunchy and difficult to style.</li>
            <li> While using the pastel chalk, many have broken in my hand and overall, I would have been happier going to a local beauty store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not anything really serious, just enough to kind of bother me a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not worth sending back seeing that I paid as much for the product as I did to ship it.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, now I know I was right.</li>
            <li> not sure it is really hair chalk.  </li>
            <li> It didnt stay on their hair, even after &#x27;setting&#x27; with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The pink colors are slightly more difficult to wash out, but they do eventually.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plain old regular chalk...</li>
            <li> When trying to apply the hair chalk, it breaks very easily and the color is very faint.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the hair chalk turned out to be just plain old artist pastels...</li>
            <li> Image is a little misleading because the chalks looked longer than actually are, but lots of different colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> What arrived was plain pastel chalk and FROM CHINA, no less.</li>
            <li> You get the hair wet, rub the chalk on, let it dry, and curl or flat iron it if you want it to stay longer!</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is after panting, my hair becomes so dry.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but not great for dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark red hair--auburn?</li>
            <li> The blues don&#x27;t stay in very long, but I used the pink one three weeks ago and it&#x27;s still in my hair.</li>
            <li> I googled the name of the pastels and they are sold as regular pastels at half the cost.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Spend a little extra and stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> It dries out my hair and just wasn&#x27;t what i expected...</li>
            <li> I saw on Amazon to wet hair....</li>
            <li> wet hair &amp; apply or something&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Way tinier than I expected.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re hair needs to be wet</li>
            <li> The size of the chalk is not even a quarter of an inch wide.  </li>
            <li> will read other reviews and look online for instructions -</li>
            <li> When their other grandma was visiting they did their hair &amp; Mimi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would just drive down the road and go to Michael&#x27;s or another \\&quot;Art supply\\&quot; store.</li>
            <li> We played around with it for half an hour with lackluster results.</li>
            <li> And the picture is deceptive, these are little nubs of chalk, less than half the size of these pictures here.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> Not like the icky dry powdery stuff in school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like little slivers of chalk.  </li>
            <li> it became very dry and hard to comb.</li>
            <li> What I disliked was that it did not work.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be easier to apply and wouldn&#x27;t destroy my hair all day.  </li>
            <li> well i wont buy again a waste of money</li>
            <li> What a waste of fuel and resources.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to waste your time and energy...stay away from this company at all costs.</li>
            <li> then this chalk it does not easily go on hair just on fingers.</li>
            <li> But the color came out pretty, and the process of doing the hair chalk on my hair wasn&#x27;t to bad.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little bit hard to rub on...</li>
            <li> What I received were ordinary artist pastels.  </li>
            <li> This was ordinary sidewalk chalk.  </li>
            <li> It does color your hair but it makes a real mess of things.</li>
            <li> Pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> The temporary hair color chalk is really hard on your hair.  </li>
            <li> yes I do agree that is what hair chalk is but was at least expecting some direction on how to apply</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money and it was useless.</li>
            <li> , it becomes all nasty and it feels yucky, but it looks fun</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected but the quality of it was horrible pieces were broken</li>
            <li> A big disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews before buying this and was confused.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately don&#x27;t have any instructions about how use.</li>
            <li> expensive for what it was.</li>
            <li> they sent the wrong item.</li>
            <li> This product, unfortunately, did not work at all; very poor results.</li>
            <li> Afraid to try this product on my hair.  </li>
            <li> awful it leaves your hair stiff and the colors dont show  </li>
            <li> Product from China - way too overpriced for what was received :-(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This stinks!</li>
            <li> but that was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product is very bad.</li>
            <li> Daughter was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just recieved my package of artist pastels . I read in the listing that this might happen. But I ordered hair chalk, NOT pastels. If that what I wanted , that&#x27;s what I would have ordered. Regardless that&#x27;s its basically the same thing, I&#x27;m bummed that I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just gunna start out by saying it was my first time using hair chalk. Hair chalk in general, i dont like. It dries out my hair and just wasn&#x27;t what i expected... But the color came out pretty, and the process of doing the hair chalk on my hair wasn&#x27;t to bad.</li>
            <li> What I like was the colors. What I disliked was that it did not work. Regular school chalk works better on the hair then this chalk it does not easily go on hair just on fingers.</li>
            <li> This product, unfortunately, did not work at all; very poor results. We followed the directions for wetting the hair and application. The chalk just matted up, no color at all</li>
            <li> the color did&#x27;t show up. i rubbed into my hair in order for the color to show and it broke my hair. Some color showed not enough. I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> This should be advertised as what it is...chalk pastels.  I will use it for art, but probably not my hair.  Good thing I have an art degree.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews before buying this and was confused. How could somebody believe they were buying artist pastels when on the website, it exclusively says hair chalk and provides instructions? Basically, those consumers had no idea what they were talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came neatly packaged with a clear label, stating they are HAIR CHALK meant for HAIR and are in no way pastels. There are also instructions on the back of the packaging. And even if there weren&#x27;t, you could look up how to use them on google hair chalk is such a popular product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that since it&#x27;s chalk the colors kind of smashed into the sides of the packaging while shipping leaving bits of dust all over each other. It&#x27;s not anything really serious, just enough to kind of bother me a little bit. But other than that, these chalks are wonderful and easy to use! I would totally recommend these to a friend!</li>
            <li> The hair chalk does not rub off on hair. When trying to apply the hair chalk, it breaks very easily and the color is very faint.  This is to me is not recommenced for the hair.</li>
            <li> The chalks looked great on hair and comes out easy with shampoo.</li>
            <li> The whites, grays, and blacks don&#x27;t work very well, but the brighter colors are great. It really dries out/dreds my hair, but looks really cool and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> My little girl loved thus hair chalk! She has tried every color :) she looks like a clown now a very cute clown</li>
            <li> Not the best thing I purchased; bought this for my granddaughter and is still in box....came with no instructions!! Would not recommend this</li>
            <li> Interesting, with beaty colors... Unfortunately don&#x27;t have any instructions about how use. I need some help on this! Could you?</li>
            <li> I received art Chalk not hair chalk I bought this as a gift for a child and im very upset we waited almost two months to receive and then it wasnt even what we ordered</li>
            <li> not sure it is really hair chalk.  gets all over your hands...</li>
            <li> I thought it would be fun to chalk my hair. I&#x27;m 53. Not a kid. Not cool. Just liked the pretty colors. I have dark red hair--auburn? I watched YouTube videos of sweet young things carefully explaining to me e-x-a-c-t-l-y how to chalk my hair. It did not work for me. I&#x27;ve tried all the colors in different ways and they don&#x27;t show up only hair at all. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this brand or my hair color or my technique. But it did not work. Nice chalk though. Not like the icky dry powdery stuff in school. I will find something else to do with this chalk.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the writeup that this was NOT regular pastels, but specifically for hair.&lt;br /&gt;there are NO instructions on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;it came in a clear wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;I can only assume it&#x27;s regular pastel chalk, and maybe that is fine anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I will read other reviews and look online for instructions - but that was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even hair chalk... It&#x27;s plain old regular chalk...Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money and it was useless.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Christmas present.  It came from CHINA and is all written in Chinese so I can&#x27;t read it or know what the box says.  There are NO instructions.  I saw on Amazon to wet hair....but it would be nice if box said in English &amp;#34;Hair Chalk...wet hair &amp; apply or something&amp;#34;  The colors look pretty--I am not using them cuz it is a gift so I don&#x27;t know how they work.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I thought I was getting hair chalk.  What I received were ordinary artist pastels.  I think something was lost in translation, seeing as this product came from China.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift and it was just normal artist chalk in a blank white box - no instruction on how to dye hair provided.&lt;br /&gt;too expensive for what it was.</li>
            <li> These chalks crumble when any pressure is applied to put it on the hair strand.  They don&#x27;t work well at all. My granddaughter is ending up using them as sidewalk chalk.</li>
            <li> This is really fun to alter hair color......  Perfect for blondes or light brown hair.  (Does not work so well for brunettes, because of the lack of contrast with the chalk.&lt;br /&gt;We have blonde hair in my family... so it is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for everyone...  washes out after a week....</li>
            <li> came with no directions and looks like drawing chalk and states on box as if it is drawing chalk</li>
            <li> I like them is fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Great I had so much fun ! Bought it for my friend and I it comes out so pretty! GREAT</li>
            <li> Love the chalks! Alot of fun for all and wonderful colors.The pink colors are slightly more difficult to wash out, but they do eventually.</li>
            <li> First, although I received a notice it shipped, it did not arrive in time for Christmas.  It shipped - but from one location in China to another - in China. Arrived in January. It also appears that, although labeled as hair chalk, it is really artist&#x27;s pastels. I am bummed out. Never ordering from this manufacturer again!</li>
            <li> Not great for African American hair... worked great on my (white) boyfriend&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The  packaging made no reference to using it on hair. It led you to believe it was simply pastels. There were no directions included. AND it came directly from China. We did find a way to make it work but I am less than satisfied.</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter for Christmas, but expected delivery was in first week of January. Pleasantly surprised that it came in early. Image is a little misleading because the chalks looked longer than actually are, but lots of different colors to choose from. Looking forwarding to trying these.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money. It is the same as soft pastels (not oil pastels) which is similar chalk. They are sold at any local craft store. I got mine at Michaels for $5. They are Artist&#x27;s Loft brand and there is 36 colors. They work great for summer styles.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected but the quality of it was horrible pieces were broken and it was nothing like it describes</li>
            <li> The pieces of chalk were not as big as I thought they would be based on the picture. Also the colors do not turn out exactly as they look.</li>
            <li> The temporary hair color chalk is really hard on your hair.  I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> Ordered product and was pleased with the quickness of the shipping - Purchased it for my 9 year old daughter - wasn&#x27;t aware that I was getting artist pastel&#x27;s , yes I do agree that is what hair chalk is but was at least expecting some direction on how to apply - doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to figure it out i&#x27;m sure, but definatly does not apply easily!!!  Product from China - way too overpriced for what was received :-( once you open it can&#x27;t be returned!!!!! the only way to see the product is to open the box...Unsatisfied</li>
            <li> This is not the product I wanted for my granddaughter.  I was disappointed with the purchase. I would return it, but the cost of shipping would not be worth it.</li>
            <li> Way tinier than I expected. One chalk is only good for about one application. Colors are nice, but you better wear gloves when applying!</li>
            <li> great items for special occasions and photo shoots.  awesome at making new and exciting things with hair creations. would recommend</li>
            <li> This product is best used for small pieces like braids. My daughter tried coloring the underneath of all of her hair. It took several applications for it to show up at all and she has light sandy brown hair. She did it the night before school and woke up absolutely covered in maroon chalk dye. Many tutorials suggested that the whole head could be colored but this is something that needs to be done the day of and washed out before bed. God forbid you should sweat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great to have several shades of the same color so it looks like to have high/low lights. The blues don&#x27;t stay in very long, but I used the pink one three weeks ago and it&#x27;s still in my hair. Great price for the amount of colors you get.</li>
            <li> Great product for a teenager experimenting with hair color and a parent who wants nothing permanent in her child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This is so cool and so much fun!  My daughter and I both love this, Super easy to use and it washed out.</li>
            <li> This was ordinary sidewalk chalk.  It did not transfer at all to the hair.  A big disappointment!  Did not work on any color hair.</li>
            <li> Colors are good. But I should wear gloves to paint. The biggest problem is after panting, my hair becomes so dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts, yet washes out easily.  I&#x27;ve even used it on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  She likes it too.  I&#x27;m thinking it would make a good gift for her.</li>
            <li> they sent the wrong item. not as advertised. i opened it and then found out it cannot be returned after opening.. no paperwork inside. just a crappy experience. i will give it to my artist daughter. the product does not work for my needs. you guys bite. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NLFWAA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> Many people are saying that this just the same as regular artists chalk, just way overpriced. At first I was skeptical, now I know I was right. Don&#x27;t buy this. Go to Hobby Lobby instead.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I like the product is good quality and it works in every color hair, also it gives the option to choose wich color I want to use.  I will recommend this product to friends and relatives</li>
            <li> The pastels are pretty, but that&#x27;s all they are, coloring pastels from art class. They don&#x27;t show up in hair at all and just stain everything else. Pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> Had to leran how to use this chalk,but the color pallette is great and for the price one cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re hair needs to be wet and after it dries it is really hard to get it clean, it becomes all nasty and it feels yucky, but it looks fun and we had fun putting it on.  I was hoping it would be easier to apply and wouldn&#x27;t destroy my hair all day.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out and it took 2-3 shampoos to get it out and make my hair feel normal again,</li>
            <li> This is not hair chalk at all but rather chalks to draw with, so it is not a total loss.  My child enjoys drawing and coloring her pictures with the chalk.  Do NOT buy this thinking you are getting hair color chalk.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters for a &#x27;fun&#x27; hair day. What a nightmare. It didnt stay on their hair, even after &#x27;setting&#x27; with a flat iron. It got fine chalk dust EVERYWHERE. It stains everything, even if you cant see the dust - its there!! AND it doesnt even stay on their hair. Awful.</li>
            <li> Yes it is artist chalk....but...that&#x27;s exactly what hair chalk is! This is cheaper and better than actually hair chalk. If you do not know how to apply it, look it up all the directions are the same. I love this chalk its great and the colors are vibrant!</li>
            <li> We played around with it for half an hour with lackluster results. It did not go on easy and it wipes right off. Had to google directions and tips.</li>
            <li> I got this alot earlier than expected, plus when i tried it, it looked AWESOME!! Google instructions online for help!</li>
            <li> I wish there were some tips on using them but they are in great condition and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This product is very bad. It ruined my hair it became very dry and hard to comb. Also, the colors was not the way it supposed to be. By time it turns to white.</li>
            <li> The color of each pastell is verry pretty but it&#x27;s a little bit hard to rub on... It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I went out looking for hair chalk. I found hair chalk. The colors are bright, but the process is long, messy, and your hair feels really crunchy and difficult to style. Great for costuming, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this for day to day temporary hair coloring.</li>
            <li> The product I recieved was not at all the product I ordered. Was not made for hair was a pastel for drawing. Not worth sending back seeing that I paid as much for the product as I did to ship it. Cash loss if I send back.</li>
            <li> Afraid to try this product on my hair.  When it arrived, I opened the package and found no instructions on how to apply or use it in my hair.  Nothing on the product mentioned anything about hair use.  All the instructions on it were for artisits to use it to draw with. Not sure how safe it is!</li>
            <li> This stinks! No directions and on the cover it says its for drawing purposes....&lt;br /&gt;Spend a little extra and stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an inexpensive way for my 11 year old to color her hair and this was it!  She loves using the different colors of chalk in her hair after her shower for the next day.</li>
            <li> First off: My hair is REALLY dark brown. People think it&#x27;s black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few colors that show very well: the blues, red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the length of them aren&#x27;t too great, because they break easily. Application is always annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a huge passion for coloring your hair temporarily, I don&#x27;t really recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews that complain about the package not saying that they are specifically hair chalk and that there are no instructions. My hairdresser shared that the hair chalk is really no different than regular artists chalk. As far as no instructions, really you don&#x27;t need them! You get the hair wet, rub the chalk on, let it dry, and curl or flat iron it if you want it to stay longer! That&#x27;s it! I have been told you can also buy oil free artists chalk at craft stores like Michaels. We were happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s pretty cheap, it works, and the selection of colors is fantastic! A fun way to try different colors in your hair without a big commitment, as it washes out in one or two shampoos. Don&#x27;t be a hair chalk snob, this stuff is fine, and have FUN!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 &amp; 12 to grand daughters.  When their other grandma was visiting they did their hair &amp; Mimi&#x27;s.  When she got home, pappy said OoLaLa! Then he called to find out where they got it so he could get some for her! :)</li>
            <li> awful it leaves your hair stiff and the colors dont show  well i wont buy again a waste of money</li>
            <li> I ordered Hair Chalk and i received art pastels that were straight from China. The whole box was written in Chinese. I googled the name of the pastels and they are sold as regular pastels at half the cost. It was a rip off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show up very well on my brown hair- it would probably be okay on blonde. I&#x27;ll draw with it.</li>
            <li> It does not work so well.  Daughter was very disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t come with any instructions so we had to search the internet trying to figure out how is supposed to work.  It was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was artists&#x27; pastels...not hair chalk, not made for the hair. It came from China, it was a lengthy delivery date and when I used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair, the color was vibrant (after you dampen hair). Some colors like orange did not come out after two shampoos which concerns me. My daughter is 5 and kept seeing commercials about hair chalk and wanted to try it. While using the pastel chalk, many have broken in my hand and overall, I would have been happier going to a local beauty store. Besides, you never know if the stuff coming from other countries is safe because regulations vary.</li>
            <li> This product shipped EXTREMELY fast --- and there are a lot of colors for the price. However, once I got the package, I was sure I had either ordered something in error or was sent the wrong product as there are no directions at all for hair chalking, and this appears to be a set of artist&#x27;s pastels.</li>
            <li> If this product is going to be sold as hair chalk it should be packaged as such and include directions. We bought this for our 9 year old daughter and then had to look up directions for use. If I had known the product came from China I would NEVER have purchased it. The best part is...You have to open it to see that it is a mis represented product and then you can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s been opened. What a rip off.</li>
            <li> The size of the chalk is not even a quarter of an inch wide.  It&#x27;s like little slivers of chalk.  I will never purchase this again.  And it also does not say anything about this being for the hair.  The package says it&#x27;s for artists and talks about using the chalk for art not hair.  NO instructions on how to apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! If I wanted chalk pastels...I would just drive down the road and go to Michael&#x27;s or another \\&quot;Art supply\\&quot; store. What a JOKE! What arrived was plain pastel chalk and FROM CHINA, no less. What a waste of fuel and resources. This was intended as a gift for a young child, as a hair product. If the seller intends to market this product as such, then it MUST be packaged as such...including directions, washing instructions, pictures explaining use, etc. This was as if I had ordered a hello kitty brand cup and this company sent me a Solo cup instead; then insisted that they had sent a CUP, so I must be satisfied. The packaging is 100% important for this product. The final blow was that this irresponsible company refused to pay for the return. So, I had both my credit card company and Amazon refuse the charges. If you don&#x27;t want to waste your time and energy...stay away from this company at all costs.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this was actually a hair chalk product but when I received it from China I found it was only artist chalk. It breaks easily after it gets wet and I could have gone to a local shop to get artist chalk cheaper if that is what I wanted to buy. It does color your hair but it makes a real mess of things.</li>
            <li> There were a couple of  issues with this order .  First of all, it wasn&#x27;t clear when I ordered it from Amazon that the shipper was in China...all the web page said was that &amp;#34;...it could take a few more days to ship&amp;#34;.  Turns out it took two weeks and I was lucky to get this before Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the hair chalk turned out to be just plain old artist pastels...if I had really known that (not sure if true &amp;#34;hair chalk&amp;#34; is something different though), I could have purchased it from my local craft store.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors. its not as much chalk like but more like pastels. it stays in hair for a week or so. but looks great on.</li>
            <li> I received the package yesterday and it&#x27;s regular artists pastels, from China. And the picture is deceptive, these are little nubs of chalk, less than half the size of these pictures here.</li>
            <li> i suppose i could try them in my hair, but i would rather use a product meant specifically for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but not great for dark hair. My hair is black and most colors didn&#x27;t show up. I gave them to a friend with 4 blonde girls and they love them!</li>
