            <li>When  is the world going to figure out how great this product is?!  </li>
            <li>The steamer came with 20 medium rollers which is awesome, however, I ordered 4 boxes of the caruso jumbo size rollers from amazon for the times in which I want a waterfall type roller set.</li>
            <li>hair will look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The pro beauty tools steamer works great.</li>
            <li>So happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>A great purchase.  </li>
            <li>It takes some time putting each roller on the steamer, and I&#x27;ve yet to figure out how to make my hair look good with these rollers.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Yes love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my Pro Ionic Steamer because it is a safe way to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>Leave the shield on the roller when you place it on top of the steam and leave it there for 10-15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>I think this is a safe way for her to learn how to roll her hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the results of steam setting my hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it as a replacement for my vidal sasson version that just stopped working after many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not quite sure why they don&#x27;t want to stay in.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!!!</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, and gives excellent results.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and easy and keeps all day!!  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and so it curls easily, but does not hold curl well.  </li>
            <li>This is an older product I have used for years, because with hot water my hair stays in good condition.</li>
            <li>Curls are nice, holding well, compatible to flat iron .</li>
            <li>I like very much this set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone with fine, poker straight hair, looking for body and curls.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS EVER ROLLED HER HAIR.  </li>
            <li>Leaving the shield on the steamer helps to seal in the steam better, while adding heat to the outside of the roller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(and it&#x27;s her first time), anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how fast it heats the rollers, just wish it came with bigger rollers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s quite ready for hot rollers yet.</li>
            <li>I have fuzzy hair and this is a way to get big curls that look great and the smoothness lasts more then a few days, but into the next day.</li>
            <li>I get fast curls and fast.  </li>
            <li>And the Pro Beauty system is so easy to use -- quick, effortless, and much smaller than those big sets.  </li>
            <li>I will try a few more times.  </li>
            <li>Most of the curler sets on the market look so nice, but they use dry heat and it not only ruins your hair, the curls don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>It steams quickly, in about 10 seconds and the curl holds a long time.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use traditional hot rollers.</li>
            <li>The first ones start falling out before the last ones are in.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and the curls last all day.  </li>
            <li>What I really like is it comes with 30 medium rollers which is the only size I use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend--very fast shipping and package carefully wrapped.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, and by the time I wrap it all around a roller, the outer part (root end) doesn&#x27;t get much heat.</li>
            <li>Since I recently bought a new shampoo and conditioner from my health store will use it up before trying the Unfinium shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li>Definetely works better than traditional type heat rollers, and the unit is small enough to take with you on trips.</li>
            <li>useful tips that we discovered as we rolled her little sister&#x27;s hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little piece that holds roller bent off on my first use.</li>
            <li>I need the same amount of time to achieve same look  comparing to  hot iron, with much less damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have bsl natural African-American hair and wanted to curl my hair without using a curling iron that utilizes dry heat.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally &amp; now use the ion steam setter for curling.</li>

            <li> The only drawback is when you take them out,if there&#x27;s an area that doesn&#x27;t look right, it&#x27;s hard to fix without a curling iron</li>
            <li> The curls were tight at first, but they would go limp after an hour and my hair was also frizzy.</li>
            <li> Some reader complained about the clicking noise when set on the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; setting, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and the setting works very well.  </li>
            <li> The curl doesn&#x27;t hold and my hair is thick and wavy naturally so there is no excuse.</li>
            <li> This one is shapped differently than previous ones, and I like this newer, sleeker design.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair &amp; scalp, had to get rid of hair dryers and curling irons.</li>
            <li> I need a few smaller ones.</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get used to rolling hair instead of the curling iron I used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Roll your hair tightly around the roller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is the best-kept secret is women&#x27;s hairstyling -- the ionic steam produces absolutely-beautiful, long-lasting curls that remain until I take a shower the next morning!  </li>
            <li> I ordered it a few days ago, and I received it today.  </li>
            <li> This product does not work as described, within one hour of using it my hair was a frizzy mess!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there are some negative reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> She has hair to her waist and VERY thick.  </li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong???  </li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed in them.</li>

            <li> The curls were tight at first, but they would go limp after an hour and my hair was also frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get fast curls and fast.  I only wish that they sent a variety of sizes. I need a few smaller ones. Yes love it.</li>
            <li> Most of the curler sets on the market look so nice, but they use dry heat and it not only ruins your hair, the curls don&#x27;t last.  This product is the best-kept secret is women&#x27;s hairstyling -- the ionic steam produces absolutely-beautiful, long-lasting curls that remain until I take a shower the next morning!  And the Pro Beauty system is so easy to use -- quick, effortless, and much smaller than those big sets.  When  is the world going to figure out how great this product is?!  I love it.  Highly recommend !!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Pro Ionic Steamer because it is a safe way to curl my hair.  I have bsl natural African-American hair and wanted to curl my hair without using a curling iron that utilizes dry heat.  I do not want heat damage to ruin my 4a/4b curl pattern .  The steamer came with 20 medium rollers which is awesome, however, I ordered 4 boxes of the caruso jumbo size rollers from amazon for the times in which I want a waterfall type roller set. I would reccomend this unit.</li>
            <li> It takes some time putting each roller on the steamer, and I&#x27;ve yet to figure out how to make my hair look good with these rollers.  I will try a few more times.  I hope I&#x27;m not stuck with some unusable rollers underneath my sink.  I am open to suggestions.</li>
            <li> I have fuzzy hair and this is a way to get big curls that look great and the smoothness lasts more then a few days, but into the next day. This is an older product I have used for years, because with hot water my hair stays in good condition. Also, by the time you put in all the curlers in your hair your done. and have big loopy curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there are some negative reviews on this product.  I ordered it a few days ago, and I received it today.  I took it out of the box, and my 12 year-old went berserk!  She has hair to her waist and VERY thick.  I wish I had taken pictures of her to post of her rolling her hair all by herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LET ME ADD THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS EVER ROLLED HER HAIR.  It came out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some useful tips that we discovered as we rolled her little sister&#x27;s hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Leave the shield on the roller when you place it on top of the steam and leave it there for 10-15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Then, when you take the roller off the steamer, remove the shield and place it there while you roll your hair.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Leaving the shield on the steamer helps to seal in the steam better, while adding heat to the outside of the roller.&lt;br /&gt;4)  Roll your hair tightly around the roller.&lt;br /&gt;5)  Leave rollers in your hair for 45-60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will look beautiful.  If my 12 year-old can do this (and it&#x27;s her first time), anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this set for myself, but will share it with my daughter.  I think this is a safe way for her to learn how to roll her hair.  I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s quite ready for hot rollers yet.</li>
            <li> I love the results of steam setting my hair.  It is fast and easy and keeps all day!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> The pro beauty tools steamer works great. I purchased it as a replacement for my vidal sasson version that just stopped working after many years.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the rollers. It comes with plenty but only one size, medium.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it heats the rollers, just wish it came with bigger rollers. I have long hair, and by the time I wrap it all around a roller, the outer part (root end) doesn&#x27;t get much heat. Definetely works better than traditional type heat rollers, and the unit is small enough to take with you on trips.</li>
            <li> Not made to last. The little piece that holds roller bent off on my first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a steam setter for about 10 years now.  This is myi third replacement.  It lasts a long time, and gives excellent results.  My hair is fine, and so it curls easily, but does not hold curl well.  With the use of this steam setter, myi hair retains body for 3-4 days.  It&#x27;s one of those products that I replace immediately when the one I&#x27;m using wears out.  This one is shapped differently than previous ones, and I like this newer, sleeker design.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  It is fast and the curls last all day.  So happy with my purchase.  I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone with fine, poker straight hair, looking for body and curls.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair &amp; scalp, had to get rid of hair dryers and curling irons. I let my hair dry naturally &amp; now use the ion steam setter for curling. My hair is shoulder length. It took a few times to get used to rolling hair instead of the curling iron I used for a long time. I recommend this , especially if your hair is damaged.  The moisture has been a godsend to my hair, no more static, no more electric shocks for my hubbie I am also using the Infinium 23 as recommended in the package. Since I recently bought a new shampoo and conditioner from my health store will use it up before trying the Unfinium shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair to use these curlers! The only drawback is when you take them out,if there&#x27;s an area that doesn&#x27;t look right, it&#x27;s hard to fix without a curling iron</li>
            <li> This product does not work as described, within one hour of using it my hair was a frizzy mess!! The curl doesn&#x27;t hold and my hair is thick and wavy naturally so there is no excuse. I also tried it on my daughters&#x27; hair and it didn&#x27;t work for them either. I will continue to use traditional hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I seldom write reviews, but these rollers work so well that I couldn&#x27;t resist.  I&#x27;ve used the Caruso steam rollers for years and they finally gave out, so since this looked so similar I bought these.  What I really like is it comes with 30 medium rollers which is the only size I use.  It steams quickly, in about 10 seconds and the curl holds a long time.  Some reader complained about the clicking noise when set on the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; setting, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and the setting works very well.  As a bonus, it comes with a sample of Infusion which is a leave in conditioner that you can add to the water.  There is also an off/off switch which the Caruso didn&#x27;t have, so I can leave them plugged in if I want to.  A great purchase.  I highly recommend--very fast shipping and package carefully wrapped.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure why they don&#x27;t want to stay in.  The first ones start falling out before the last ones are in.  Am I doing something wrong???  Kinda disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> I like very much this set.  Curls are nice, holding well, compatible to flat iron . I need the same amount of time to achieve same look  comparing to  hot iron, with much less damage to my hair.</li>
