            <li>After reading the reviews, I ordered this item and am delighted with it.  </li>

            <li>This tool is amazing at preventing the nail from getting imbedded into the skin.</li>
            <li>and my nephew has kindly taken over the job.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to have found this file for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The serrated ends are insufficiently abrasive to be effective.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t go under a toenail nicely nor file the nail.</li>
            <li>I have done my own work for years probably 12 times in 20 years.</li>
            <li>a nice weight and size.</li>
            <li>Great for maintaining toe nails that may push into your skin to keep from getting an ingrown toe nail, just be care full</li>

            <li>Very easy to handle, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
            <li>The Satin Edge 2-sided Ingrown Toenail File is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This file is very easy to use, and prevents ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li>:) Love it!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for a very good product.</li>
            <li>This file is the perfect size when placing in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>After a warm water soak, with this tool you will easily be able to navigate and deal with any issues.  </li>
            <li>This is the best tool I&#x27;ve found so far for dealing with ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li>Nice and strong.</li>
            <li>I recommend everyone who does pediures to own one of these it is so easy to use and get to what you need.</li>
            <li>Anyone doing there own pedicure should have this fine file</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d look on Amazon to find an appropriate tool.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d seen this item somewhere else for a lot more, but wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased it and would buy it for others .</li>
            <li>It is an okay tool to use for ingrown toenail.  </li>
            <li>but I certainly am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I would like to have a more flattened end piece on it, but works well as it is.  </li>
            <li>I did find it better than the file that many clippers have built in.  </li>
            <li>Product is just okay.</li>
            <li>Toe Nail File is better.</li>
            <li>Ergonomically satisfying.  </li>
            <li>Hiking and running and dropping many things on my toes.</li>
            <li>I have to keep them trim and these tools help me get safely in places to keep the in groins at bay.</li>
            <li>Its better then going after them with scissors that cut the skin and leave me hurting.</li>
            <li>I have had these problems for many years.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to compare it against that is any better, so</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s another tool by Satin Edge that I like better for my ingrown toenail</li>
            <li>I am an ingrown removel specialist and would be able to do my job without this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This replaced tweezers, fingers and clippers that always took off more toe than in grown toe nail every time.</li>
            <li>As it was I had to cut off the top of a track shoe to compete.</li>
            <li>Works best after a shower or long bath.</li>
            <li>Excellent on toes where the skin is more rough and hardened.</li>
            <li>I was able to lift the offending toenail and file it so that it became more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for those of us not very flexible.</li>
            <li>Worked awesomely on my ingrown toenail with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;rasps\\&quot; are very narrow/small, and I think a good toenail file could do just as well.</li>
            <li>Best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quality product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how easy it was to fix a problem that I thought was going to require a visit to a podiatrist.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Fits easily under my toe nail.</li>
            <li>Yes, this item does work and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I could pick up the ingrown toe nail easily with it.</li>
            <li>Well built and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to cut the in grown nail out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of very solid metal, which was a nice surprise, &amp; is a good quality product.</li>
            <li>Strong.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love the slim, tiny filing end to smooth the nail!!!</li>
            <li>Well finished tool, smooth and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>and i have to fix it with i fine nail file after.</li>
            <li>recommend this to ingrown toenail sufferers who either have the range of motion to use it effectively or who have someone available who is willing to help them use it.</li>
            <li>I gave the product five stars because the product was fine</li>
            <li>this is little tool is awesome..</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care to return the item because it was cheap, but I won&#x27;t be using to file my nails.</li>
            <li>the edges of he file part are just too smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and quickly helps.</li>
            <li>This surprised me as to how easy and effective it has been to use.  </li>
            <li>Never disappointed with anything I have ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>make sure to take a bath/foot bath first before you use it to soften the nail to make it easier to file.</li>
            <li>Unique solution for relief from h ingrown toe nail</li>
            <li>Perfect for getting into that very narrow space between toenail and skin.</li>
            <li>Gets in there to clean out the junk</li>
            <li>Liked the Body Toolz file better as I found the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of this file too coarse.</li>
            <li>Not really that great.  </li>
            <li>If your rough nail edge surface is exposed it works great, if it is ingrown</li>
            <li>This is a good tool for ingrown nails especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>this can definitely aid in correcting an ingrown problem once you learn how to use it,it does have fairly aggressive teeth</li>
            <li>Not bad for what it does.  </li>
            <li>this file is tiny and after you take a bath to warm up your foot, easily insertable between the nail and the skin to file that stubborn nail.</li>
            <li>Worked perfect and no more ingrown toenail!</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I would received my order quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a more fine tip that would really work under the nails.</li>
            <li>I soaked my toenail and in two treatments just filed away the nail to where it&#x27;s smooth for the first time in 2 months.  </li>
            <li>Super tool in just the right shape to use for filing ingrown toenail areas.  </li>
            <li>Very good tool for that hard to manicure area.</li>
            <li>This little tool is great.</li>
            <li>He was able to file nail away and totally clear the area</li>
            <li>Definitely worth getting if you have an issue with ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li>Both ends are useful, as are file edges.  </li>
            <li>well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find this to be as useful as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>If you have this problem, I think it is worth you money.</li>
            <li>The product is well made, but my own personal needs required an ingrown toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li>useful for oyher toes.</li>
            <li>Seems like it will be a long-lasting and useful tool</li>
            <li>The product was as I had expected, well machined and with a good grip.</li>
            <li>this was fun, a tool to do my toes properly.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>your toes, then be prepare to have fun.</li>
            <li>Right now, the dexterity and skills is like putting ships in a bottle together.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need it right now, but it seems like a sensible tool.  </li>
            <li>This item is completely not sharp in the teeth to be able to shape a nail or address an ingrown nail problem.</li>
            <li>We were both dubious that this tool would be useful, but when I saw it at amazon for a very reasonable price I decided we could give it a try.</li>
            <li>Do this early when you start feeling a nail is becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li>Most people think that ingrown toenails are the result of wearing tight fitting shoes.  </li>
            <li>He just left a little while ago and my feet have never felt so wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for something for a while that would help with the constant ingrown issues I have on my big toes, and this does the job great.  </li>
            <li>It is a very unusual tool</li>
            <li>works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>so I may need to work on it more later.  </li>
            <li>While the angle is nice, that does not prevent the nail from slipping off the surface of the file.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly that was presented on the description.</li>
            <li>Glad to finally find something so helpful for this situation.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediate relief after using it the first time.</li>
            <li>I ordered several more just in case.  </li>
            <li>This is certainly a much better tool than they currently carry in stores.  </li>
            <li>I really like this item!</li>
            <li>I was able to really file my right toenail such that it is no longer digging into the skin.</li>
            <li>It works reasonably well but mine rusted after the first use.</li>
            <li>I learned that they can come from wearing shoes that are too large.  </li>
            <li>basically just large ridges along the ends.</li>
            <li>It is way to large to get under my toe nails.  </li>
            <li>This has left me with less attractive toe nails.</li>
            <li>I needed a file and deciding which one to buy with these pictures was difficult as they are not showing great detail, this is exactly what I wanted thankfully!</li>
            <li>Love this little instrument, it files just enough off the toenail to feel better while letting it grow out.</li>
            <li>They work very will and provide immediate relief.</li>
            <li>This tool not helps much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But the angled edge is very valuable.  </li>
            <li>Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail file is made very well.  </li>
            <li>If the grooves were closer together or the file was wider, this would be much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic item to have around, especially if you have a tendency to get ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li>More substantial than expected.  </li>
            <li>I find it very helpful.</li>
            <li>This works so well and has really relieved a lot of the pain for me.  </li>
            <li>This file is very well made and does the job.</li>
            <li>regular file won&#x27;t fit to the side of the nail.</li>
            <li>one side is straight, another is rounded.</li>
            <li>very resistant and doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on ingrown nails, but I am handicapped and cannot bend and reach very well.  </li>
            <li>This will really help with ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li>but it really did get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Much thanks.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>This really made a difference in my life.</li>
            <li>This is made from stainless steel so it won&#x27;t rust.  </li>
            <li>The file side is very precision ground.</li>
            <li>I was glad I was able to deal with this before they became infected or got worse.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea, but this is too thick to get under the edge of my toenail that tends to be ingrown.</li>
            <li>I decided on the file due to the price and I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>This file is sharp, so make sure you don&#x27;t file skin accidentally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and have lost flexibility which means I can&#x27;t reach my toes</li>
            <li>High quality product as well.</li>
            <li>This nail product seems to be high quality construction and it does the job quite well.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>A warm soak and the right tools: no more pain, the nail is growing back again!</li>
            <li>The ends, however, are too fat to work around the edges of the nails and the rough sides aren&#x27;t that fine ...</li>
            <li>My old type is more expensive but has the nice thin file that fit comfortably under my toe nail.  </li>
            <li>I love this little mechanism.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this little toe nail file....</li>
            <li>The file is easy to use and gets rid of sharp points at the nail edge.</li>
            <li>However, that said real hang nails sometimes require professional Podiatrist treatment for a permanent fix.</li>
            <li>I never use such tool before but when have it I found its useful</li>
            <li>The net result is that this tool requires much more time and effort to perform the same amount of filing as the professional tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an old one that was a little wider, but these were more tapered and if using for toenails, are easier to get underneath the nail.  </li>
            <li>but my wife did the close up work to grind down the nail and smooth it out..</li>
            <li>improvent needed is a more finger friendly &amp;#34;torso&amp;#34;, too thin in middle handle.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>heavy duty and strong file.</li>
            <li>I should have spent little more money on higher quality tool.</li>
            <li>It is able to get into those hard to reach places when you are trying to work with ingrown toe nails.  </li>
            <li>,What i did was kind of chip away at it instead of trying to do the regular filing motion with short little pressure motions</li>
            <li>And, it is clearly a well made, quality item.</li>
            <li>Surprised at the utility of it.</li>
            <li>Nothing like going to the doctor to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for my personal pedicures.</li>
            <li>Overall quality seems to be much lower than the Body Toolz one.</li>
            <li>when your nail grows too far into the skin it hurts like hell.</li>
            <li>The ridges are WAY too far apart.</li>
            <li>A pair of common fingernail scissors works better.</li>
            <li>After running area under warm water, this tool works great at lifting delicate, sensitive &amp; painful area.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>The tool at relatively cheap price cannot be expected to equal the professional tool.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my problem is huge, but my toes require a small touch.</li>
            <li>can help relieve general foot pain as well.</li>
            <li>This product definitely shows its lower than professional level craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that both my toes are no longer numb where the nail was digging into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Gets right in there and lifts nail enough to cut it and files down side where it hurts your toe.</li>
            <li>this is an excellent tool for getting to those tight, painful places, relieves pressure on the toe.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this little item, along with cutting my toe nails correctly and wearing more loose fitting shoes my problem will be over.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much that the nail file on a pair of clippers was doing previously for me.</li>
            <li>I was able to soak my ingrown toenail each night and then use the curved end to lift it up and slowly file down the offending piece.</li>
            <li>I have that ingrown nail problem, using this helps get that little extra skin out and smooth down the nail enough, hopefully to help the grown on out and be done with the torture!!</li>
            <li>Thin enough to get in between the nail and skin easily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> After reading the reviews, I ordered this item and am delighted with it.  </li>
            <li> but that is to remove nail quicker for what you need to get done,all in all this was a good choice for the problem it was designed for</li>

            <li> Amazing for the cost.</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing at preventing the nail from getting imbedded into the skin.</li>
            <li> and my nephew has kindly taken over the job.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found this file for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The serrated ends are insufficiently abrasive to be effective.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t go under a toenail nicely nor file the nail.</li>
            <li> I have done my own work for years probably 12 times in 20 years.</li>
            <li> a nice weight and size.</li>
            <li> Great for maintaining toe nails that may push into your skin to keep from getting an ingrown toe nail, just be care full</li>
            <li> It does a good job of getting into the corners of your toenails that aren&#x27;t easily reached with clippers.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
            <li> The Satin Edge 2-sided Ingrown Toenail File is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This file is very easy to use, and prevents ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li> :) Love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for a very good product.</li>
            <li> This file is the perfect size when placing in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> After a warm water soak, with this tool you will easily be able to navigate and deal with any issues.  </li>
            <li> This is the best tool I&#x27;ve found so far for dealing with ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Nice and strong.</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone who does pediures to own one of these it is so easy to use and get to what you need.</li>
            <li> Anyone doing there own pedicure should have this fine file</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d look on Amazon to find an appropriate tool.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen this item somewhere else for a lot more, but wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Just OK.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased it and would buy it for others .</li>
            <li> It is an okay tool to use for ingrown toenail.  </li>
            <li> but I certainly am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I would like to have a more flattened end piece on it, but works well as it is.  </li>
            <li> I did find it better than the file that many clippers have built in.  </li>
            <li> Product is just okay.</li>
            <li> Toe Nail File is better.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically satisfying.  </li>
            <li> Hiking and running and dropping many things on my toes.</li>
            <li> I have to keep them trim and these tools help me get safely in places to keep the in groins at bay.</li>
            <li> Its better then going after them with scissors that cut the skin and leave me hurting.</li>
            <li> I have had these problems for many years.  </li>
            <li> Nothing to compare it against that is any better, so</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s another tool by Satin Edge that I like better for my ingrown toenail</li>
            <li> I am an ingrown removel specialist and would be able to do my job without this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This replaced tweezers, fingers and clippers that always took off more toe than in grown toe nail every time.</li>
            <li> As it was I had to cut off the top of a track shoe to compete.</li>
            <li> Works best after a shower or long bath.</li>
            <li> Excellent on toes where the skin is more rough and hardened.</li>
            <li> I was able to lift the offending toenail and file it so that it became more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for those of us not very flexible.</li>
            <li> Worked awesomely on my ingrown toenail with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;rasps\\&quot; are very narrow/small, and I think a good toenail file could do just as well.</li>
            <li> Best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quality product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how easy it was to fix a problem that I thought was going to require a visit to a podiatrist.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Fits easily under my toe nail.</li>
            <li> Yes, this item does work and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I could pick up the ingrown toe nail easily with it.</li>
            <li> Well built and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to cut the in grown nail out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of very solid metal, which was a nice surprise, &amp; is a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Strong.  </li>
            <li> Plus I love the slim, tiny filing end to smooth the nail!!!</li>
            <li> Well finished tool, smooth and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> and i have to fix it with i fine nail file after.</li>
            <li> recommend this to ingrown toenail sufferers who either have the range of motion to use it effectively or who have someone available who is willing to help them use it.</li>
            <li> I gave the product five stars because the product was fine</li>
            <li> this is little tool is awesome..</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care to return the item because it was cheap, but I won&#x27;t be using to file my nails.</li>
            <li> the edges of he file part are just too smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quickly helps.</li>
            <li> This surprised me as to how easy and effective it has been to use.  </li>
            <li> Never disappointed with anything I have ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> make sure to take a bath/foot bath first before you use it to soften the nail to make it easier to file.</li>
            <li> Unique solution for relief from h ingrown toe nail</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting into that very narrow space between toenail and skin.</li>
            <li> Gets in there to clean out the junk</li>
            <li> Liked the Body Toolz file better as I found the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of this file too coarse.</li>
            <li> Not really that great.  </li>
            <li> If your rough nail edge surface is exposed it works great, if it is ingrown</li>
            <li> This is a good tool for ingrown nails especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> this can definitely aid in correcting an ingrown problem once you learn how to use it,it does have fairly aggressive teeth</li>
            <li> Not bad for what it does.  </li>
            <li> this file is tiny and after you take a bath to warm up your foot, easily insertable between the nail and the skin to file that stubborn nail.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect and no more ingrown toenail!</li>
            <li> arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I would received my order quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a more fine tip that would really work under the nails.</li>
            <li> I soaked my toenail and in two treatments just filed away the nail to where it&#x27;s smooth for the first time in 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Super tool in just the right shape to use for filing ingrown toenail areas.  </li>
            <li> Very good tool for that hard to manicure area.</li>
            <li> This little tool is great.</li>
            <li> He was able to file nail away and totally clear the area</li>
            <li> Definitely worth getting if you have an issue with ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Both ends are useful, as are file edges.  </li>
            <li> well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find this to be as useful as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> If you have this problem, I think it is worth you money.</li>
            <li> The product is well made, but my own personal needs required an ingrown toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li> useful for oyher toes.</li>
            <li> Seems like it will be a long-lasting and useful tool</li>
            <li> The product was as I had expected, well machined and with a good grip.</li>
            <li> this was fun, a tool to do my toes properly.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> your toes, then be prepare to have fun.</li>
            <li> Right now, the dexterity and skills is like putting ships in a bottle together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need it right now, but it seems like a sensible tool.  </li>
            <li> This item is completely not sharp in the teeth to be able to shape a nail or address an ingrown nail problem.</li>
            <li> We were both dubious that this tool would be useful, but when I saw it at amazon for a very reasonable price I decided we could give it a try.</li>
            <li> Do this early when you start feeling a nail is becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li> Most people think that ingrown toenails are the result of wearing tight fitting shoes.  </li>
            <li> He just left a little while ago and my feet have never felt so wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for something for a while that would help with the constant ingrown issues I have on my big toes, and this does the job great.  </li>
            <li> It is a very unusual tool</li>
            <li> works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> so I may need to work on it more later.  </li>
            <li> While the angle is nice, that does not prevent the nail from slipping off the surface of the file.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly that was presented on the description.</li>
            <li> Glad to finally find something so helpful for this situation.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediate relief after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> I ordered several more just in case.  </li>
            <li> This is certainly a much better tool than they currently carry in stores.  </li>
            <li> I really like this item!</li>
            <li> I was able to really file my right toenail such that it is no longer digging into the skin.</li>
            <li> It works reasonably well but mine rusted after the first use.</li>
            <li> I learned that they can come from wearing shoes that are too large.  </li>
            <li> basically just large ridges along the ends.</li>
            <li> It is way to large to get under my toe nails.  </li>
            <li> This has left me with less attractive toe nails.</li>
            <li> I needed a file and deciding which one to buy with these pictures was difficult as they are not showing great detail, this is exactly what I wanted thankfully!</li>
            <li> Love this little instrument, it files just enough off the toenail to feel better while letting it grow out.</li>
            <li> They work very will and provide immediate relief.</li>
            <li> This tool not helps much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But the angled edge is very valuable.  </li>
            <li> Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail file is made very well.  </li>
            <li> If the grooves were closer together or the file was wider, this would be much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic item to have around, especially if you have a tendency to get ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li> More substantial than expected.  </li>
            <li> I find it very helpful.</li>
            <li> This works so well and has really relieved a lot of the pain for me.  </li>
            <li> This file is very well made and does the job.</li>
            <li> regular file won&#x27;t fit to the side of the nail.</li>
            <li> one side is straight, another is rounded.</li>
            <li> very resistant and doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on ingrown nails, but I am handicapped and cannot bend and reach very well.  </li>
            <li> This will really help with ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li> but it really did get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Much thanks.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> This really made a difference in my life.</li>
            <li> This is made from stainless steel so it won&#x27;t rust.  </li>
            <li> The file side is very precision ground.</li>
            <li> I was glad I was able to deal with this before they became infected or got worse.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, but this is too thick to get under the edge of my toenail that tends to be ingrown.</li>
            <li> I decided on the file due to the price and I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> This file is sharp, so make sure you don&#x27;t file skin accidentally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and have lost flexibility which means I can&#x27;t reach my toes</li>
            <li> High quality product as well.</li>
            <li> This nail product seems to be high quality construction and it does the job quite well.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> A warm soak and the right tools: no more pain, the nail is growing back again!</li>
            <li> The ends, however, are too fat to work around the edges of the nails and the rough sides aren&#x27;t that fine ...</li>
            <li> My old type is more expensive but has the nice thin file that fit comfortably under my toe nail.  </li>
            <li> I love this little mechanism.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little toe nail file....</li>
            <li> The file is easy to use and gets rid of sharp points at the nail edge.</li>
            <li> However, that said real hang nails sometimes require professional Podiatrist treatment for a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> I never use such tool before but when have it I found its useful</li>
            <li> The net result is that this tool requires much more time and effort to perform the same amount of filing as the professional tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an old one that was a little wider, but these were more tapered and if using for toenails, are easier to get underneath the nail.  </li>
            <li> but my wife did the close up work to grind down the nail and smooth it out..</li>
            <li> improvent needed is a more finger friendly &amp;#34;torso&amp;#34;, too thin in middle handle.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> heavy duty and strong file.</li>
            <li> I should have spent little more money on higher quality tool.</li>
            <li> It is able to get into those hard to reach places when you are trying to work with ingrown toe nails.  </li>
            <li> ,What i did was kind of chip away at it instead of trying to do the regular filing motion with short little pressure motions</li>
            <li> And, it is clearly a well made, quality item.</li>
            <li> Surprised at the utility of it.</li>
            <li> Nothing like going to the doctor to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li> This works very well for my personal pedicures.</li>
            <li> Overall quality seems to be much lower than the Body Toolz one.</li>
            <li> when your nail grows too far into the skin it hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> The ridges are WAY too far apart.</li>
            <li> A pair of common fingernail scissors works better.</li>
            <li> After running area under warm water, this tool works great at lifting delicate, sensitive &amp; painful area.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> The tool at relatively cheap price cannot be expected to equal the professional tool.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my problem is huge, but my toes require a small touch.</li>
            <li> can help relieve general foot pain as well.</li>
            <li> This product definitely shows its lower than professional level craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that both my toes are no longer numb where the nail was digging into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Gets right in there and lifts nail enough to cut it and files down side where it hurts your toe.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent tool for getting to those tight, painful places, relieves pressure on the toe.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this little item, along with cutting my toe nails correctly and wearing more loose fitting shoes my problem will be over.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much that the nail file on a pair of clippers was doing previously for me.</li>
            <li> I was able to soak my ingrown toenail each night and then use the curved end to lift it up and slowly file down the offending piece.</li>
            <li> I have that ingrown nail problem, using this helps get that little extra skin out and smooth down the nail enough, hopefully to help the grown on out and be done with the torture!!</li>
            <li> Thin enough to get in between the nail and skin easily.  </li>
            <li> The usual problem with ingrown toenails seems to be the unevenness or even sharpness of the edge of the toenail, but this lets you file that down smooth instead of having a podiatrist lift the nail and trim it.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of tools and this one is my new favorite because it lifts and has a file that can shave off the sharp points without having to dig as mush as I used to with different bulkier long nosed side cutter type tools that pried up to much and was painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it very carefully for only two days and the pain is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> The file serration is rounded and does not have the sharp edges that are on the more expensive tool.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is very small and easy to lose.  </li>
            <li> Saves a trip to the doctor to have it cut for you if you haven&#x27;t waited too long.</li>
            <li> I work on my feet long hour days (12-18 hrs) and my feet take a beating.</li>
            <li> so it is straight across and sticking out past the skin a little, but you might have  a different experience.)</li>
            <li> It seemed that nothing worked for very long.</li>
            <li> I washed it, patted it dry and put it away.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with ingrown toe nails (big toes) for several years now.  </li>
            <li> but hey Im not the only active person out there with well used feet.</li>
            <li> I have another one from other maker; which is larger and harder to insert between the toe and nail.  </li>
            <li> It is also thin enough to use to clean hard to reach areas of the toe nails.  </li>
            <li> This little tool hasn&#x27;t left her side since she got it!</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t stay sharp very long.</li>
            <li> It cannot be used as a file because it is far too dull.</li>
            <li> The two ended file allows you to get rid of the problem before it becomes more painful.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with ingrown toenails for years and did not know that such a tool existed until I was surfing your site.  </li>
            <li> This is the tool i&#x27;ve been missing when working with stubborn toenails that create such pain!  </li>
            <li> The 2 sided ingrown toenail files were nicer than expected.  </li>
            <li> and I received it before expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> then carefully file the edge of your toe nail...</li>
            <li> The spacing on the groves of the filing edges is rather large; the surface area of the file is very thin and not too long either.</li>
            <li> This product is not very easily to adapt for use by someone with limited range of motion.  </li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with other products can increase the relief.  </li>
            <li> The other straigth.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It works well on other nails and for the price, I give it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a lazy nail trimmer that needs short nails for cycling.  </li>
            <li> Too big to get to the very narrow edge in order to file away the deep-inside ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li> The edges are definitely grooved so that you can file hard to reach toenails.  </li>
            <li> The Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File I found hard to handle and cut toenail at the same time</li>
            <li> Would return it but not worth the time or effort.</li>
            <li> is not fine, has a serrated rough texture.&lt;br /&gt;Works in mycritical area.</li>
            <li> It looks like the ends of this thing were stamped with a butterknife to make them slightly bumpy.</li>
            <li> This is thick and wide and rough.</li>
            <li> works well but could be a little thinner</li>
            <li> Otherwise it will hurt a little.</li>
            <li> Ordered this, and with a little self surgery..</li>
            <li> I can now keep my toenails trimmed and filed with little effort.</li>
            <li> You insert one of the edges under the ingrown toenail and it helps file it down enough to get rid of some of the pain, or at least wedge something in while the ingrown nail grows out slowly.</li>
            <li> If I had had this little wizard&#x27;s tool 40 years ago it would have saved me having a doctor cut them out and missing 1/8th of my track season.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> my case I can use it on the inner side of my toe nail but on the other side it is painful since I have not enough</li>
            <li> but the file is really rough and thick making it hard to get under/around your nail.</li>
            <li> Not even a little flinch from me!</li>
            <li> my nails are just so weak and the files are so rough that my it sort of shreds the corners of my nails</li>
            <li> This is a quality tool and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, but for me, personally, the file is a little thick and difficult to get under my nail</li>
            <li> No more need to get pedicures if you have this.  </li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> This file + Outgro &#x3D; no more issues.</li>
            <li> Its small size lets you get into the crevices even if you have small toenails as I do.  </li>
            <li> No more pains.</li>
            <li> Terrible tool was a waste of time, it can&#x27;t be easily used and also was delivered 3 weeks after the date set via US mail.</li>
            <li> I have a very narrow foot</li>
            <li> I know this would have solved past ingrown toenail sharp edge problems or ones with the bottom edge sticking out past the rest of the nail because of a careless trim of the toenail.  </li>
            <li> The file is dull on the Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File, 8.1 Ounce.</li>
            <li> If I feel i&#x27;ve cut a little too close, I just grab this scary looking tool and do a little filing on the side.  </li>
            <li> Or at least I thought that.  </li>
            <li> Customer service was suggestively rude to me that my neighbors had stolen it and refused a refund or replacing it</li>
            <li> I have thick , curved  ingrown toe nails</li>
            <li> file tips are 1,65mm thick</li>
            <li> Made for very small hands.</li>
            <li> (should never have let my ingrown get that bad and used this earlier!).</li>
            <li> This file is thin and I can place it in places that need some filing.</li>
            <li> And maybe it will get worse, who knows.</li>
            <li> , This was a complete and one of worst experinces of negativatey&#x27;s at the site.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong</li>
            <li> It might be a disgusting thing but this tool definitely gets the s</li>
            <li> I hate having an ingrown toenail, no easy way to grow it out, but this helps.</li>
            <li> It was painful and frustrating.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who wears sneakers all the time and suffers from ingrown toe nails.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been painful for cutting the edges.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to file anything.</li>
            <li> By the time I asked for his help, I had 2 ingrown nails and working on them was painful.</li>
            <li> can be terribly painful to deal with</li>
            <li> I found that it too painful to use</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> I did not know a product like this existed, until I had a painful nail and started researching for cures!</li>
            <li> Truly horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This file is the perfect size when placing in sensitive areas.  They work very will and provide immediate relief.</li>
            <li> Just bought from Amazon. This tool not helps much. Too big to get to the very narrow edge in order to file away the deep-inside ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li> works exactly as advertised.  No surprises here.</li>
            <li> No more need to get pedicures if you have this.  It is able to get into those hard to reach places when you are trying to work with ingrown toe nails.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Most people think that ingrown toenails are the result of wearing tight fitting shoes.  Or at least I thought that.  I learned that they can come from wearing shoes that are too large.  I have a very narrow foot and I like fashionable shoes.  I thought I could get away with wearing B (medium width shoe) with heel grips and extra foot padding.  I was wrong!  As a result of my feet sliding forwards in my shoes (even with the padding) I started to develop ingrown toenails on both my big toes and I lost both toenails on both my 2nd toes.     I didn&#x27;t want to go to a podiatrist so I thought I&#x27;d look on Amazon to find an appropriate tool.  I debated on getting a file or getting one of those nippers.  I decided on the file due to the price and I am glad that I did.  I just received it in the mail today and decided to try it out.      I was able to really file my right toenail such that it is no longer digging into the skin. I can actually get the file underneath the edge where the nail meets the skin.  I worked on the left toenail, but it is now sore - so I may need to work on it more later.  The good thing is that both my toes are no longer numb where the nail was digging into the skin.  I was glad I was able to deal with this before they became infected or got worse.     This is a good tool for ingrown nails especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with ingrown toenails for years and did not know that such a tool existed until I was surfing your site.  It is an excellent and well worth the money.  It goes to the \\&quot;root of the problem and works great! I am going to buy a backup just in case.</li>
            <li> Very good tool for that hard to manicure area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen this item somewhere else for a lot more, but wasn&#x27;t sure it would work. I&#x27;m older and have lost flexibility which means I can&#x27;t reach my toes and my nephew has kindly taken over the job. By the time I asked for his help, I had 2 ingrown nails and working on them was painful. We were both dubious that this tool would be useful, but when I saw it at amazon for a very reasonable price I decided we could give it a try. This file is absolutely amazing!!! He was able to file nail away and totally clear the area so my nails can grow properly and do so without the pain (and bleeding) that the scissors always cause. He could lift tiny slivers of nail and use the scissors to cut the nail away. Not even a little flinch from me! He just left a little while ago and my feet have never felt so wonderful. We&#x27;re both very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy tool to help reshape ingrown toenails.  My only regret is that the files are not of a finer grit.  Both ends are very coarse.  If one end was finer grit like an emory board--that would make it great for me.</li>
            <li> I love this little mechanism. Very easy to handle, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and it does the trick. Definitely worth getting if you have an issue with ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> The Satin Edge 2-sided Ingrown Toenail File is very easy to use.  I am very happy to have found this file for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This little tool is great. I was able to soak my ingrown toenail each night and then use the curved end to lift it up and slowly file down the offending piece. 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> WORKING OUT WELL FOR ME VERY HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I like the tool because it makes it easier to file the corners of the nail. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Just OK. I was buying it for my Mom. But it doesn&#x27;t work for her ingrown toenail. So I kept it for myself, as a cleaning tool instead of a file.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s angled well for ingrown toenails, but it takes an inordinate amount of dexterity to do toes on either foot. And I&#x27;ve already had two times when my hand cramped because of the angle with which I had to try to use it. It does work, but with some effort. The \\&quot;rasps\\&quot; are very narrow/small, and I think a good toenail file could do just as well. You&#x27;ll have to take care anyway. Right now, the dexterity and skills is like putting ships in a bottle together. If you want to use reviews. I suggest using only those from people who have used it for a week or so.</li>
            <li> Super tool in just the right shape to use for filing ingrown toenail areas.  Surprised at the utility of it.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool. Perfect size and weight. I was going to a podiatrist every two weeks because a toenail that was cut all along the side (for a fungus) kept on going inside my skin. It was painful and frustrating. But then I bought this Toenail File and the [[ASIN:B000VDFKLK Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail Lifter]] and I have been able to tend to my nail myself! A warm soak and the right tools: no more pain, the nail is growing back again!</li>
            <li> Love this little instrument, it files just enough off the toenail to feel better while letting it grow out. My nails have been turning in since my hypothyroid diagnosis and this is a great tool ! Love it!</li>
            <li> Every one should have one of these as apart of your care for your feet.  I am glad I purchased it and would buy it for others . It was what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is like a microwave oven; you never need one until after you&#x27;ve had one... then you never want to be without one again.</li>
            <li> Great tool for ingrown toenails!</li>
            <li> Gets in there to clean out the junk</li>
            <li> It looks like the ends of this thing were stamped with a butterknife to make them slightly bumpy. It cannot be used as a file because it is far too dull. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for those of us not very flexible. Easy to use, quality product.  Helpful in trying to keep from having to have surgery.</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting into that very narrow space between toenail and skin. Plus I love the slim, tiny filing end to smooth the nail!!!</li>
            <li> This is the tool i&#x27;ve been missing when working with stubborn toenails that create such pain!  I soaked my toenail and in two treatments just filed away the nail to where it&#x27;s smooth for the first time in 2 months.  Used in conjunction with other products can increase the relief.  But the angled edge is very valuable.  I would definitely recommend this file.  I&#x27;ve now been using this file for 3 months and again, this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made, and it was an add-on item!</li>
            <li> ...with chronic ingrown toenail issues...get this product.  After a warm water soak, with this tool you will easily be able to navigate and deal with any issues.  Both ends are useful, as are file edges.  Can even prop up a corner with leverage for the ol&#x27; \\&quot;piece of cotton under the corner til it grows out\\&quot; trick....well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Good Product and Good Price</li>
            <li> Simply put......heavy metal (not plastic), inexpensive, and serves its&#x27; purpose!</li>
            <li> Do this early when you start feeling a nail is becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li> Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail file is made very well.  It is an okay tool to use for ingrown toenail.  Nothing like going to the doctor to get it fixed.  Thank U.</li>
            <li> The serrated ends are insufficiently abrasive to be effective.</li>
            <li> Since I like the ingrown lifter from the same company I decided to try this but the file is really rough and thick making it hard to get under/around your nail.</li>
            <li> Once again, thank you to the folks who wrote reviews.  After reading the reviews, I ordered this item and am delighted with it.  I&#x27;ve used it very carefully for only two days and the pain is completely gone.  I&#x27;m amazed at how easy it was to fix a problem that I thought was going to require a visit to a podiatrist.  And, it is clearly a well made, quality item. Amazing for the cost.</li>
            <li> The spacing on the groves of the filing edges is rather large; the surface area of the file is very thin and not too long either. While the angle is nice, that does not prevent the nail from slipping off the surface of the file. If the grooves were closer together or the file was wider, this would be much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care to return the item because it was cheap, but I won&#x27;t be using to file my nails.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly that was presented on the description. High quality product as well. It&#x27;s a keeper</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use this.  Maybe will try again and if I ever get the hang of it, will revise my review.</li>
            <li> This works very well for my personal pedicures.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic item to have around, especially if you have a tendency to get ingrown toenails.  Ingrown toenails files are best used after soaking your feet for a while.  Getting rid of ingrown toenails can help relieve general foot pain as well.</li>
            <li> It works reasonably well but mine rusted after the first use. I washed it, patted it dry and put it away. The next day it had rust spots on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with ingrowns. This tool has helped prevent them. I use it everyday when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Was always afraid to work on my own ingrown toenail. But, with this toil its a breeze. Will buy them again if needed too.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Body Toolz toenail file at the same time. Liked the Body Toolz file better as I found the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of this file too coarse. Overall quality seems to be much lower than the Body Toolz one. Would return it but not worth the time or effort.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice instrument.  More substantial than expected.  A quality item. Easy to use.  I find it very helpful.</li>
            <li> heavy duty and strong file. arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and works well!</li>
            <li> The 2 sided ingrown toenail files were nicer than expected.  I use them for different uses.  I had an old one that was a little wider, but these were more tapered and if using for toenails, are easier to get underneath the nail.  Nice seller and good product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much that the nail file on a pair of clippers was doing previously for me.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with ingrown toe nails (big toes) for several years now.  I had no idea there was a tiny file made for ingrown nails.  This works so well and has really relieved a lot of the pain for me.  Hopefully this little item, along with cutting my toe nails correctly and wearing more loose fitting shoes my problem will be over.</li>
            <li> Well finished tool, smooth and easy to grip. Since it was so well priced I was hesitant to order this but I certainly am glad that I did. If seen these that were nowhere as well made at triple the price.  Shipping was great and I received it before expected.</li>
            <li> I Think it might be working. my nails are just so weak and the files are so rough that my it sort of shreds the corners of my nails and i have to fix it with i fine nail file after.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with anything I have ordered from Amazon.Every item was as described.</li>
            <li> Works great at getting under the nail on the sides...most of my issues reside here.</li>
            <li> this is little tool is awesome.. I have that ingrown nail problem, using this helps get that little extra skin out and smooth down the nail enough, hopefully to help the grown on out and be done with the torture!!</li>
            <li> Great for maintaining toe nails that may push into your skin to keep from getting an ingrown toe nail, just be care full you do not puncture your skin while your using it.</li>
            <li> Great for your pedicure</li>
            <li> Works great for lifting the ingrown toenail so you can cut it.  Saves a trip to the doctor to have it cut for you if you haven&#x27;t waited too long.</li>
            <li> Terrible tool was a waste of time, it can&#x27;t be easily used and also was delivered 3 weeks after the date set via US mail. Customer service was suggestively rude to me that my neighbors had stolen it and refused a refund or replacing it and it does not even work well now that I have it in my home, This was a complete and one of worst experinces of negativatey&#x27;s at the site.</li>
            <li> This file is very well made and does the job. Only knock is that one end should have a thinner head. Would make it easier.</li>
            <li> I needed a file and deciding which one to buy with these pictures was difficult as they are not showing great detail, this is exactly what I wanted thankfully!</li>
            <li> Perfect tool for what it says it is for.  Excellent on toes where the skin is more rough and hardened.</li>
            <li> this can definitely aid in correcting an ingrown problem once you learn how to use it,it does have fairly aggressive teeth but that is to remove nail quicker for what you need to get done,all in all this was a good choice for the problem it was designed for and like I mentioned once you figure out the best way to use it,What i did was kind of chip away at it instead of trying to do the regular filing motion with short little pressure motions I hope this helps ingrown nails can be terribly painful to deal with</li>
            <li> Works as it should. I would like to have a more flattened end piece on it, but works well as it is.  I have thick , curved  ingrown toe nails and this has helped immensely.  No one has made me bleed w/ this thing.</li>
            <li> if you wake up in the middle of the night from the pain in your foot then this is for you. when your nail grows too far into the skin it hurts like hell. this file is tiny and after you take a bath to warm up your foot, easily insertable between the nail and the skin to file that stubborn nail. regular file won&#x27;t fit to the side of the nail. this does. it has a file on both sides. one side is straight, another is rounded. make sure to take a bath/foot bath first before you use it to soften the nail to make it easier to file.</li>
            <li> Fits easily under my toe nail.Glad to finally find something so helpful for this situation. May have to buy another!</li>
            <li> Impossible to file anything. The ridges are WAY too far apart.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Unique solution for relief from h ingrown toe nail</li>
            <li> very resistant and doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> Not really that great.  It was almost jagged on one end.</li>
            <li> I did not know a product like this existed, until I had a painful nail and started researching for cures!</li>
            <li> This product works very well on ingrown nails, but I am handicapped and cannot bend and reach very well.  This product is not very easily to adapt for use by someone with limited range of motion.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to ingrown toenail sufferers who either have the range of motion to use it effectively or who have someone available who is willing to help them use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for something for a while that would help with the constant ingrown issues I have on my big toes, and this does the job great.  It&#x27;s made of very solid metal, which was a nice surprise, &amp; is a good quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had persistent issues with ingrown nails on my big toes, including having a procedure done to strip one of my toenails. It seemed that nothing worked for very long. I saw a write up on this tool and ordered it. It does a good job of getting into the corners of your toenails that aren&#x27;t easily reached with clippers. I noticed immediate relief after using it the first time. It&#x27;s now become part of my regular routine. The product seems to be well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love this file!  The file is easy to use and gets rid of sharp points at the nail edge.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Thank you so much for a very good product.</li>
            <li> Works great and I have no complaints. Its the perfect tool. Nice and strong. You definitely will never have to worry about it breaking.</li>
            <li> I never use such tool before but when have it I found its useful</li>
            <li> I use this with the toenail kit  I purchased. It files and lifts the nail away from the toe. Great tool.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for this product. It was delivered on time and is a well made instrument/file. I like how it gets the edge of the toenail without tearing the skin and making things more uncomfortable. I would buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The usual problem with ingrown toenails seems to be the unevenness or even sharpness of the edge of the toenail, but this lets you file that down smooth instead of having a podiatrist lift the nail and trim it.  I don&#x27;t need it right now, but it seems like a sensible tool.  I know this would have solved past ingrown toenail sharp edge problems or ones with the bottom edge sticking out past the rest of the nail because of a careless trim of the toenail.  (In my experience the best way to not get ingrown toenails at all is to cut the toenail off so it is straight across and sticking out past the skin a little, but you might have  a different experience.)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find this to be as useful as I had hoped.  The edges are definitely grooved so that you can file hard to reach toenails.  I did find it better than the file that many clippers have built in.  If your rough nail edge surface is exposed it works great, if it is ingrown I found that it too painful to use (should never have let my ingrown get that bad and used this earlier!).</li>
            <li> if you are getting something to adjust the edge of your nails, get something else.  This item is completely not sharp in the teeth to be able to shape a nail or address an ingrown nail problem. the edges of he file part are just too smooth.</li>
            <li> Great tool if you suffer from ingrown nails.</li>
            <li> Too small. Made for very small hands. End tools ineffective. Returned item.</li>
            <li> Product is just okay. Probably won&#x27;t stay sharp very long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is about this file is.  Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong but I don&#x27;t think so.  Really no big deal.</li>
            <li> Miracle tool for ingrown toenails!! So glad I purchased this!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, but this is too thick to get under the edge of my toenail that tends to be ingrown. A pair of common fingernail scissors works better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful. I hate having an ingrown toenail, no easy way to grow it out, but this helps.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It might be a disgusting thing but this tool definitely gets the s*** out from under my nail.&lt;br /&gt;For anybody who has ingrown toenails, this is the tool for you.</li>
            <li> Just like the picture, it arrived when promised and I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> You can actually count the teeth on this file, that&#x27;s how coarse it is. Leaves nothing but mangled skin and torn nails in its wake. Truly horrible product.</li>
            <li> The file is dull on the Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File, 8.1 Ounce. The Body Toolz Ingrown Toe Nail File is better.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Strong.  Ergonomically satisfying.  I&#x27;m so happy with this.</li>
            <li> The concept is right, and the weight and balance are wonderful. The ends, however, are too fat to work around the edges of the nails and the rough sides aren&#x27;t that fine ... basically just large ridges along the ends. I was really hoping for a more fine tip that would really work under the nails. Still, though, this tool helps to start things off.</li>
            <li> This will really help with ingrown toenails.  If you have this problem, I think it is worth you money.</li>
            <li> I have well used feet. Hiking and running and dropping many things on my toes. This has left me with less attractive toe nails. I have to keep them trim and these tools help me get safely in places to keep the in groins at bay. May be TMI but hey Im not the only active person out there with well used feet. Its better then going after them with scissors that cut the skin and leave me hurting.</li>
            <li> This file + Outgro &#x3D; no more issues. :) Very happy.</li>
            <li> This is thick and wide and rough. It wouldn&#x27;t go under a toenail nicely nor file the nail. If you want to saw a nail, it may be for you. Otherwise plan on tearing up your toe.</li>
            <li> Thin enough to get in between the nail and skin easily.  I use it every time I clip my toenails now.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My only complaint is that it is very small and easy to lose.  So.....I ordered several more just in case.  I have had problems with ingrown toenails for some time.  This surprised me as to how easy and effective it has been to use.  The delivery service was excellent.</li>
            <li> This nail product seems to be high quality construction and it does the job quite well.  Recommend it.  However, that said real hang nails sometimes require professional Podiatrist treatment for a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> It does not work well. Waist of money.</li>
            <li> The Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File I found hard to handle and cut toenail at the same time</li>
            <li> The product is well made, but my own personal needs required an ingrown toenail clipper.  I gave the product five stars because the product was fine, it just didn&#x27;t suit my needs!</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly to get under ingrown toenails to file them so they do not dig into your toe.  It is also thin enough to use to clean hard to reach areas of the toe nails.  Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> While the file reached the area of my toenail that needs to be filed. it was only so-so in file efficiency.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who wears sneakers all the time and suffers from ingrown toe nails. This little tool hasn&#x27;t left her side since she got it!</li>
            <li> works well but could be a little thinner</li>
            <li> As good as &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; instruments.</li>
            <li> Just what the dr. Ordered.fixed problem</li>
            <li> This is a good tool for taking care of chronic ingrown toenails.  I have had these problems for many years.  This file is thin and I can place it in places that need some filing.</li>
            <li> This tool does wonders for you if you have an ingrown toenail. Gets right in there and lifts nail enough to cut it and files down side where it hurts your toe. Bought this and Satin Edge toenail lifter. Work great together. AHHHH what relief!!</li>
            <li> I bought this tool to help with filing an ingrown toenail.  It is a very unusual tool but it really did get the job done.  I was able to lift the offending toenail and file it so that it became more comfortable.  This is certainly a much better tool than they currently carry in stores.  If anyone needs relief from the pain of an ingrown toenail, this is the tool for you!</li>
            <li> Yes, this item does work and is so easy to use.  I only wish I didn&#x27;t need it.  Much thanks.</li>
            <li> Best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li> I really like this item! It works. Which I would have known about it years ago.</li>
            <li> Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;File is not fine, has a serrated rough texture.&lt;br /&gt;Works in mycritical area. Inner side of toe nail.&lt;br /&gt;The file tips are 1,65mm thick so you need some space to use on your nail side.&lt;br /&gt;Both tips are the same size and file. One is bent. The other straigth.&lt;br /&gt;In my case I can use it on the inner side of my toe nail but on the other side it is painful since I have not enough space.&lt;br /&gt;Not useful for oyher toes.</li>
            <li> It is what it is!  You can file nails with it.  Nothing to compare it against that is any better, so it is great!</li>
            <li> This is a quality tool and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, but for me, personally, the file is a little thick and difficult to get under my nail so I can file it.  It works well on other nails and for the price, I give it 4 stars.  There&#x27;s another tool by Satin Edge that I like better for my ingrown toenail and that&#x27;s the Ingrown Toenail File and Cleaner; I give this tool 5+ stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worked awesomely on my ingrown toenail with minimal pain. I have done my own work for years probably 12 times in 20 years. I have a lot of tools and this one is my new favorite because it lifts and has a file that can shave off the sharp points without having to dig as mush as I used to with different bulkier long nosed side cutter type tools that pried up to much and was painful.</li>
            <li> I have another one from other maker; which is larger and harder to insert between the toe and nail.  This one is thinner.  Easier to insert.</li>
            <li> A Must Have Tool.  After running area under warm water, this tool works great at lifting delicate, sensitive &amp; painful area.  I then go in with the ingrown toenail nipper.  Relief!!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect file for filing the edges of toenails that have become or might become ingrown. It is also very handy for cleaning under the nail edges.  It is the perfect very-narrow size.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my problem is huge, but my toes require a small touch. Otherwise it will hurt a little. And maybe it will get worse, who knows. This file is very easy to use, and prevents ingrown toenail. Problem solved.</li>
            <li> Not bad for what it does.  I have seen a similar item in the local stores for triple the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome for that nasty @$$ toe. It helped get between my nail and skin to move skin particles out. thanks.</li>
            <li> I am an ingrown removel specialist and would be able to do my job without this. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool I&#x27;ve found so far for dealing with ingrown toenails. Its small size lets you get into the crevices even if you have small toenails as I do.  I also like that one part is angled.</li>
            <li> The edges of my nail always grows into my toes. It&#x27;s been painful for cutting the edges.  This is a great help.  No more pains.</li>
            <li> Seems like it will be a long-lasting and useful tool</li>
            <li> This a great tool for stopping dreaded ingrown toenails. The two ended file allows you to get rid of the problem before it becomes more painful.</li>
            <li> So, I often get ingrown nails.. I&#x27;m just a lazy nail trimmer that needs short nails for cycling.  I had a nail starting to go into the red zone.  Ordered this, and with a little self surgery.. Magic!  1-2 days later the pain was gone.  Probably should have over nighted it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now If I feel i&#x27;ve cut a little too close, I just grab this scary looking tool and do a little filing on the side.  :) Love it!</li>
            <li> One can see the quality of this file, pick and file lifter as soon as you look at it.&lt;br /&gt;Sure I&#x27;ll have it for years to come.</li>
            <li> a nice weight and size. why didn&#x27;t they think of this sooner? this is an excellent tool for getting to those tight, painful places, relieves pressure on the toe.</li>
            <li> This really made a difference in my life. Now I don&#x27;t have to deal with pain.</li>
            <li> The product was as I had expected, well machined and with a good grip. I could pick up the ingrown toe nail easily with it.</li>
            <li> Best tool ever. I do pedicures daily and use it every day. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution for ingrown toe nails. Works best after a shower or long bath. I work on my feet long hour days (12-18 hrs) and my feet take a beating. This tool is amazing at preventing the nail from getting imbedded into the skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little toe nail file....&lt;br /&gt;soak your feet/foot in Epsom salt for about 10-15 mins...you want to soften the nail...then carefully file the edge of your toe nail...it works wonders!! As soon I feel the nail digging in again, I do this and it works!! painless and beats getting it surgically removing the nail (which I had one toe nail done years ago, and it HURTS!) wish I knew about this file...</li>
            <li> It is way to large to get under my toe nails.  I cannot use it and had to go buy the type I lost while traveling.  My old type is more expensive but has the nice thin file that fit comfortably under my toe nail.  This one here must be for giant toe nails!</li>
            <li> Well built and easy to use. Fair price.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool, easy to use and meets my needs.  I would received my order quickly with no problems. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is made from stainless steel so it won&#x27;t rust.  The file side is very precision ground.</li>
            <li> Perfect for ingrown toenails. I just used this to push cotton under my toenail so it grows out. Worked perfect and no more ingrown toenail!</li>
            <li> This replaced tweezers, fingers and clippers that always took off more toe than in grown toe nail every time. If I had had this little wizard&#x27;s tool 40 years ago it would have saved me having a doctor cut them out and missing 1/8th of my track season. As it was I had to cut off the top of a track shoe to compete. It was easy to cut the in grown nail out but my wife did the close up work to grind down the nail and smooth it out..made my day!...shu</li>
            <li> does the job. You insert one of the edges under the ingrown toenail and it helps file it down enough to get rid of some of the pain, or at least wedge something in while the ingrown nail grows out slowly. definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> helped to do what I wanted it to do very good and looked just like it said it would do yes would tell a friend if asked</li>
            <li> Anyone doing there own pedicure should have this fine file</li>
            <li> Looked used, but still worked after thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li> This file is sharp, so make sure you don&#x27;t file skin accidentally. It&#x27;s just what I needed. Great price~Great product!</li>
            <li> Great tool for removing ingrown toenails. I was surprised how well it worked. Highly recommend this product. Easy to use and quickly helps.</li>
            <li> I grin as i worked my toes this was fun, a tool to do my toes properly.&lt;br /&gt;Only improvent needed is a more finger friendly &amp;#34;torso&amp;#34;, too thin in middle handle.&lt;br /&gt;Love your toes, then be prepare to have fun.</li>
            <li> Works as intended.  Good reach under nail.</li>
            <li> Looks great. Can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> The tool at relatively cheap price cannot be expected to equal the professional tool.  This product definitely shows its lower than professional level craftsmanship.  The file serration is rounded and does not have the sharp edges that are on the more expensive tool.  The net result is that this tool requires much more time and effort to perform the same amount of filing as the professional tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The country of origin of this tool is Parkistan.  I should have spent little more money on higher quality tool.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this device.  Would recommend it highly.  I can now keep my toenails trimmed and filed with little effort.</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone who does pediures to own one of these it is so easy to use and get to what you need.</li>
            <li> Thank you this item will be used alot thank you for selling this. I will put it to good use.</li>
