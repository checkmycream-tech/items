    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent night cream.</li>
            <li>let sunshine touch my face without an SPF on it\\&quot; and \\&quot;maintain the best health</li>
            <li>My wife is very happy with this product</li>
            <li>Thank you I am very happy</li>
            <li>Discontinued use when the puppy decided the tube was a delicious chew toy.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve experienced none of that.</li>
            <li>If you are OFF-camera, I would suggest that ladies mix it with foundation, for a great result.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this because it has made my wife so happy and</li>
            <li>as they say: Happy Wife, Happy Life.</li>
            <li>It is very effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the product was surprisingly pleasant.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>have to say that I am delighted, even if the forehead creases never change.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but no miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Number one reason for my purchasing this product is Neutragena&#x27;s good reputation and the purity of all of its products..  </li>
            <li>One of the good things my sister taught me is to moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is good because I have heard a lot about plastic exfoliating beads in some exfoliating cleansers getting into the eyes and causing pain and damage.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, feels great and smells divine..</li>
            <li>I felt nicely moisturized, and there&#x27;s probably some benefit in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was not as effective as Loreal, but this is cheaper than those too, so I would say it balances it out.</li>
            <li>Application could be easier, but there plenty of products with this kind of application regime.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s effective rather than miraculous...</li>
            <li>I tried this product because the Neutrogena Healthy Skin eye cream worked well for me, so I hoped to have good results with this Neutrogena product on my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It does look nice though, after you use it.</li>
            <li>Honestly wish I had never tried it.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s still pretty good!</li>
            <li>This is nice cream, and it makes your face look better, but if you get a touch of it too close to your eye, it burns, and anything made for the eyes, should not have any chemical in it to burn the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 60s and perhaps this product would have been more effective if used when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think the finer wrinkles are better and I will have to see how it goes in eight weeks for the wrinkles they call marionette lines.</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love the idea of a product that can erase wrinkles?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was glad I did.</li>
            <li>ON-Camera, you can use a bit more, with senstional results.    </li>
            <li>While it does have instant results, I am more impressed by the long-term improvment in the under-eye area, and forehead.</li>
            <li>And like others have noticed, my skin does feel better moisturized after use.  </li>
            <li>one\\&quot;, Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle cream promises more than it can deliver.  </li>
            <li>Okay, Okay I don&#x27;t have wrinkles that would hold a day&#x27;s rain, but then again, I don&#x27;t want to have wrinkles like that, either.</li>
            <li>If it has a scent, I sure didn&#x27;t notice it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my eyes but have been using there to prevent any.  </li>
            <li>even more so than some of the prescription products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After a couple of hours after application, your face looks relaxed and healthy.</li>
            <li>She enjoyed it and noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li>She started using it and was immediately pleased.  </li>
            <li>In the weeks that have followed she has been even more pleased.  </li>
            <li>And my wife has stopped talking about botox which I don&#x27;t believe to be all that safe.  </li>
            <li>It worked better as a moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fine to medium wrinkles are softened for sure with extended use of the product.</li>
            <li>After using this product for more than a month, I can&#x27;t see that my wrinkles have been permanently reduced in any significant way.</li>
            <li>B000052YOL Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream Original Formula, SPF 15, 1.4  Ounce]]</li>
            <li>reports that the cream is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal and doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works wonders in reducing fine lines around the mouth and neck.  </li>
            <li>The applicator tip enabled precise placement of the cream.  </li>
            <li>At 66 this works great on my face and keeps me younger looking</li>
            <li>It fills in lines and makes your makeup go on smooth.  </li>
            <li>The cream was pleasant in feel and generally neutral; there were no oily sensations or the like.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s always beautiful to me, but even I have noticed a difference, especially in those so-called smile line areas and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; at the corners of the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I liked this Neutrogena product, particularly under my eyes.</li>
            <li>What I realized was that my face isn&#x27;t significantly lined.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of filling in fine lines and wrinkles, and improves deeper wrinkles - but didn&#x27;t eliminate them entirely.</li>
            <li>but at my advanced age I think something more drastic would be needed to have much of an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only hope Neutrogena does not stop making this; it is a wonderful product, just in time for my old age.</li>
            <li>excellent product as it is the first time I have seen results at all and in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>(perhaps it is all in how much you use, most creams do not require a &#x27;liberal&#x27; application to do their job - from my experience counseling patients as a pharmacy student).</li>
            <li>It seems well made but time will tell the true results.</li>
            <li>I have started eating only \\&quot;clean foods\\&quot;, drinking plenty of water &amp; a veggie/fruit juice in the morning &amp; evening, so the improvement could be a combination of this as well, but I am very happy that my skin is looking younger in just a couple weeks</li>
            <li>There are many similar products out there, at many price-points.     </li>
            <li>Growing up in California, you quickly lear that the sun is not your friend.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-wrinkle affects of this product as I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in fine lines around the eyes or in my smile lines from long term use, though I did find that this product did a great job at keeping my foundation from settling into creases (which can bring unwanted attention to fine lines that would otherwise be not so noticeable).  </li>
            <li>the other hand, this moisturizer is rich and creamy and makes my skin feel good, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Your skin will definitely feel more elastic!</li>
            <li>aware, that this product does contain a ton of parabens!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any \\&quot;fine links\\&quot;, so I can&#x27;t speak to the effect</li>
            <li>Watch for any skin reactions, as some people have more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Just like the old Cher commercial where she opined \\&quot;if a great body came in a bottle, everyone would have</li>
            <li>But I do have what I call smile lines.  </li>
            <li>I would say at the list price, it is probably worth a try - for women and for men.</li>
            <li>Seller left a nice note thanking me for the purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but suffice it to say the proof is right before my eyes.  </li>
            <li>However, I despise the way it smells (oddly cloyingly sweet) and would have preferred something fragrance free (my fault for not reading the product description more thoroughly).</li>
            <li>short, I think this could be a good product, but if you have sensitive skin like I do, I&#x27;d recommend proceeding with caution.</li>
            <li>: the cream is worth a try and certainly has effect.</li>
            <li>It worked best on my forehead wrinkles: one of them is almost completely gone and the other is barely noticable now.</li>
            <li>It is VERY EASY to use too much , which can result white flakes on the skin.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions properly, you will get better results.     </li>
            <li>No results are evident at this point.</li>
            <li>you just use this product, though, it works really well!</li>
            <li>She does wonder how long-lasting the results will be, but we can&#x27;t give a definite answer about that and won&#x27;t be able to for some weeks to come.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to give up on the deep wrinkles, since I have more of those, so I used this for 3 months, the idea being to finish the tube.  </li>
            <li>In addition to topical treatments you need to drink  plenty of water &amp; eat healthy.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin has just become too sensitive after rounds of accutane and acne topicals for usage of this product to be a comfortable</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nearly odorless, goes on smoothly, and blends well.</li>
            <li>You have to use it EXACTLY as the directions say &amp; use it every day.</li>
            <li>and this was her first specialized face cream.</li>
            <li>I just tried the cream for the first time.</li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as described in the morning and evening for about four weeks, before I noticed any difference, so you have to be patient.</li>
            <li>and really like it, so I was excited to try this new product.  </li>
            <li>since I would trust my retin-a over an over the counter anti-wrinkle cream however, I do use it on days where the weather is unusually dry as it does do a great job at smoothing out any superficial lines that I get from dry skin.</li>
            <li>Regular use of the cream over a period of time was relatively easy and not burdensome in any way.  </li>
            <li>As for me, I will be 65 this year (2013); and I notice a huge difference if I do not use this Neutrogena anti-wrinkle deep wrinkle filler each day.  </li>
            <li>Do you really look at yourself</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard so much about products with retinol that I wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li>The directions don&#x27;t indicate how much to use and whether to just dab it on or rub it in.  </li>
            <li>If you really want retinol then go to your dermatologist and get a prescription.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Although \\&quot;Deep Wrinkle Filler\\&quot; sounds like spackle, Neutrogena&#x27;s light cream actually works from the inside to smooth things out.</li>
            <li>If you have reasonable expectations, I&#x27;d suggest you buy a tube and try it out.</li>
            <li>I used it each morning &amp; night and never saw much change.  </li>
            <li>My thanks.</li>
            <li>This works really well on brow furrows.</li>
            <li>and it really smooths out my skin.</li>
            <li>So much so that she doesn&#x27;t need to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>But does anyone else notice a real difference?  </li>
            <li>The product seems to work very well as a anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I do feel it&#x27;s a good product, so I&#x27;m giving it at least a four.</li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s:   sensible packaging, both inner and outer  the applicator is well designed for applying the product in the desired location  nice consistency (not too gritty or greasy)  </li>
            <li>The only problem was it worked better on the left side of my face than the right.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has been using this, recommended it, and I found it to follow thru&#x27; with what it claimed, better than any other I had tried.  </li>
            <li>My wife is happy with the results on little lines, but still favors her Lancome products based upon long term experience.</li>
            <li>My left smile line almost disappeared over night, with just one application!  </li>
            <li>For me, this works better than other Neutrogena Anti-wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li>the classic frown lines seemed much diminished also the frown lines across the forehead.</li>
            <li>Topical vitamin A derivatives are generally used cosmetically as an anti-aging agent to increase the rate of skin turnover, and promote an increase in collagen giving fuller more youthful appearance to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product for three full weeks twice daily with no changes in the lines on my forehead</li>
            <li>I think the irritation is harmless, but I&#x27;d worry about triggering a more severe reaction down the road.</li>
            <li>Stay tuned for more information in a month and a half.</li>
            <li>LESS is MORE with this product, particulary for men.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work better than some more expensive wrinkle fillers I have purchased, I have been using for 2 weeks, I see an improvement in lines from nose to mouth &amp; forehead.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely given this product enough time to work, but I&#x27;ve not been able to notice any discernable change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty positive review, though clearly it cannot work</li>
            <li>My own observation is of a general facial softening and smoothing to a degree that is definitely noticeable if not</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t going to do this every day and really analyze your face, you may as well pass on it, but if you really feel the need for a cream like this and are curious, you may see some short term results, and even though 1 ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like much, there is a lot of cream in that tube!</li>
            <li>Overall, the pro&#x27;s outweigh the con&#x27;s if you are willing to pay the price!</li>
            <li>But my right smile line was still very noticable, but less pronounced.    </li>
            <li>A few of the fine wrinkles appeared better after 2 months of use, and that&#x27;s because they became somewhat pink instead</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this product now for two weeks and at least it has done no damage, which is great since I have extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>wife applies the cream at night time and has not complained of any tingling or redness</li>
            <li>While it made my skin softer, I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in fine lines or little wrinkles.</li>
            <li>So far after using this product for 2weeks have not seen any signifigant changes!</li>
            <li>(yes, Donnie Darko married a younger woman about 30 years ago).  </li>
            <li>I used the product as directed for a few weeks and experienced no tingling, irritation, or any of the other possible side effects.  </li>
            <li>We do not believe based on results so far that \\&quot;deep\\&quot; wrinkles will be completely filled, but we can see that the lines appear softer and less defined.  </li>
            <li>decided that I&#x27;d use the cream on my forehead wrinkles, which developed after a lifetime of using my eyebrows for expressing my emotions.</li>
            <li>She says it completely refines the texture of her skin.</li>
            <li>You cannot expect a miraculous result; however, it comes close, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>The deep wrinkles remained exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Use this cream under near your eyes, on your forefront, and the zones with wrinkles in general.</li>
            <li>I was curious about this product because at 29 I&#x27;m already starting to see lines on my face and was curious if I could use this productive more proactively.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would also work on my less pronounced laugh lines around my mouth, but I didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li>Since the bottle was so small, I used it under my eye makeup and as a special, intensive treatment under my eyes before bed.</li>
            <li>Also, because my eyes have tiny white dots beside them, my doctor recommended using a cream high in retinols to make the dots go away, I decided</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have the natural wrinkle rather than red irritated skin.</li>
            <li>After two weeks (which is when I&#x27;m writing this review), nearly all of the white dots were gone and the rest showed signs of change.  </li>
            <li>I outsourced this review to an older relative who noted: the treatment in question had real effect on the classic wrinkle/ frown between the eyes- even though I&#x27;d been getting to bed late-</li>
            <li>The active ingredient Retinol is also listed at the very end, which may indicate that there is really not that much in there.</li>
            <li>The younger woman at work came in the next week and raved about this, as did my older daughter; my younger daughter has not tried it yet.  </li>
            <li>You think that using it so frequently will cause it to run out, but if you use it exactly according to the direction, I can see it easily lasting you 6-8 weeks depending on how heavy handed you are.</li>
            <li>The cream has no fragrance and has not irritated my skin at all, so I really have no other complaints besides that it is just not very effective so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used higher priced products with less results, and so I&#x27;m inclined to recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a targeted moisturizer with limited anti-wrinkle benefits.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was glad I did.</li>
            <li> ON-Camera, you can use a bit more, with senstional results.    </li>
            <li> While it does have instant results, I am more impressed by the long-term improvment in the under-eye area, and forehead.</li>
            <li> And like others have noticed, my skin does feel better moisturized after use.  </li>
            <li> one\\&quot;, Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle cream promises more than it can deliver.  </li>
            <li> Okay, Okay I don&#x27;t have wrinkles that would hold a day&#x27;s rain, but then again, I don&#x27;t want to have wrinkles like that, either.</li>
            <li> If it has a scent, I sure didn&#x27;t notice it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my eyes but have been using there to prevent any.  </li>
            <li> even more so than some of the prescription products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> After a couple of hours after application, your face looks relaxed and healthy.</li>
            <li> She enjoyed it and noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> She started using it and was immediately pleased.  </li>
            <li> In the weeks that have followed she has been even more pleased.  </li>
            <li> And my wife has stopped talking about botox which I don&#x27;t believe to be all that safe.  </li>
            <li> It worked better as a moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fine to medium wrinkles are softened for sure with extended use of the product.</li>
            <li> After using this product for more than a month, I can&#x27;t see that my wrinkles have been permanently reduced in any significant way.</li>
            <li> B000052YOL Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream Original Formula, SPF 15, 1.4  Ounce]]</li>
            <li> reports that the cream is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal and doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works wonders in reducing fine lines around the mouth and neck.  </li>
            <li> The applicator tip enabled precise placement of the cream.  </li>
            <li> At 66 this works great on my face and keeps me younger looking</li>
            <li> It fills in lines and makes your makeup go on smooth.  </li>
            <li> The cream was pleasant in feel and generally neutral; there were no oily sensations or the like.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s always beautiful to me, but even I have noticed a difference, especially in those so-called smile line areas and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; at the corners of the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I liked this Neutrogena product, particularly under my eyes.</li>
            <li> What I realized was that my face isn&#x27;t significantly lined.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of filling in fine lines and wrinkles, and improves deeper wrinkles - but didn&#x27;t eliminate them entirely.</li>
            <li> but at my advanced age I think something more drastic would be needed to have much of an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only hope Neutrogena does not stop making this; it is a wonderful product, just in time for my old age.</li>
            <li> excellent product as it is the first time I have seen results at all and in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> (perhaps it is all in how much you use, most creams do not require a &#x27;liberal&#x27; application to do their job - from my experience counseling patients as a pharmacy student).</li>
            <li> It seems well made but time will tell the true results.</li>
            <li> I have started eating only \\&quot;clean foods\\&quot;, drinking plenty of water &amp; a veggie/fruit juice in the morning &amp; evening, so the improvement could be a combination of this as well, but I am very happy that my skin is looking younger in just a couple weeks</li>
            <li> There are many similar products out there, at many price-points.     </li>
            <li> Growing up in California, you quickly lear that the sun is not your friend.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-wrinkle affects of this product as I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in fine lines around the eyes or in my smile lines from long term use, though I did find that this product did a great job at keeping my foundation from settling into creases (which can bring unwanted attention to fine lines that would otherwise be not so noticeable).  </li>
            <li> the other hand, this moisturizer is rich and creamy and makes my skin feel good, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Your skin will definitely feel more elastic!</li>
            <li> aware, that this product does contain a ton of parabens!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any \\&quot;fine links\\&quot;, so I can&#x27;t speak to the effect</li>
            <li> Watch for any skin reactions, as some people have more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just like the old Cher commercial where she opined \\&quot;if a great body came in a bottle, everyone would have</li>
            <li> But I do have what I call smile lines.  </li>
            <li> I would say at the list price, it is probably worth a try - for women and for men.</li>
            <li> Seller left a nice note thanking me for the purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but suffice it to say the proof is right before my eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, I despise the way it smells (oddly cloyingly sweet) and would have preferred something fragrance free (my fault for not reading the product description more thoroughly).</li>
            <li> short, I think this could be a good product, but if you have sensitive skin like I do, I&#x27;d recommend proceeding with caution.</li>
            <li> : the cream is worth a try and certainly has effect.</li>
            <li> It worked best on my forehead wrinkles: one of them is almost completely gone and the other is barely noticable now.</li>
            <li> It is VERY EASY to use too much , which can result white flakes on the skin.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions properly, you will get better results.     </li>
            <li> No results are evident at this point.</li>
            <li> you just use this product, though, it works really well!</li>
            <li> She does wonder how long-lasting the results will be, but we can&#x27;t give a definite answer about that and won&#x27;t be able to for some weeks to come.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give up on the deep wrinkles, since I have more of those, so I used this for 3 months, the idea being to finish the tube.  </li>
            <li> In addition to topical treatments you need to drink  plenty of water &amp; eat healthy.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin has just become too sensitive after rounds of accutane and acne topicals for usage of this product to be a comfortable</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nearly odorless, goes on smoothly, and blends well.</li>
            <li> You have to use it EXACTLY as the directions say &amp; use it every day.</li>
            <li> and this was her first specialized face cream.</li>
            <li> I just tried the cream for the first time.</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as described in the morning and evening for about four weeks, before I noticed any difference, so you have to be patient.</li>
            <li> and really like it, so I was excited to try this new product.  </li>
            <li> since I would trust my retin-a over an over the counter anti-wrinkle cream however, I do use it on days where the weather is unusually dry as it does do a great job at smoothing out any superficial lines that I get from dry skin.</li>
            <li> Regular use of the cream over a period of time was relatively easy and not burdensome in any way.  </li>
            <li> As for me, I will be 65 this year (2013); and I notice a huge difference if I do not use this Neutrogena anti-wrinkle deep wrinkle filler each day.  </li>
            <li> Do you really look at yourself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard so much about products with retinol that I wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> The directions don&#x27;t indicate how much to use and whether to just dab it on or rub it in.  </li>
            <li> If you really want retinol then go to your dermatologist and get a prescription.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Although \\&quot;Deep Wrinkle Filler\\&quot; sounds like spackle, Neutrogena&#x27;s light cream actually works from the inside to smooth things out.</li>
            <li> If you have reasonable expectations, I&#x27;d suggest you buy a tube and try it out.</li>
            <li> I used it each morning &amp; night and never saw much change.  </li>
            <li> My thanks.</li>
            <li> This works really well on brow furrows.</li>
            <li> and it really smooths out my skin.</li>
            <li> So much so that she doesn&#x27;t need to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> But does anyone else notice a real difference?  </li>
            <li> The product seems to work very well as a anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I do feel it&#x27;s a good product, so I&#x27;m giving it at least a four.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:   sensible packaging, both inner and outer  the applicator is well designed for applying the product in the desired location  nice consistency (not too gritty or greasy)  </li>
            <li> The only problem was it worked better on the left side of my face than the right.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this, recommended it, and I found it to follow thru&#x27; with what it claimed, better than any other I had tried.  </li>
            <li> My wife is happy with the results on little lines, but still favors her Lancome products based upon long term experience.</li>
            <li> My left smile line almost disappeared over night, with just one application!  </li>
            <li> For me, this works better than other Neutrogena Anti-wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li> the classic frown lines seemed much diminished also the frown lines across the forehead.</li>
            <li> Topical vitamin A derivatives are generally used cosmetically as an anti-aging agent to increase the rate of skin turnover, and promote an increase in collagen giving fuller more youthful appearance to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for three full weeks twice daily with no changes in the lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> I think the irritation is harmless, but I&#x27;d worry about triggering a more severe reaction down the road.</li>
            <li> Stay tuned for more information in a month and a half.</li>
            <li> LESS is MORE with this product, particulary for men.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work better than some more expensive wrinkle fillers I have purchased, I have been using for 2 weeks, I see an improvement in lines from nose to mouth &amp; forehead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely given this product enough time to work, but I&#x27;ve not been able to notice any discernable change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty positive review, though clearly it cannot work</li>
            <li> My own observation is of a general facial softening and smoothing to a degree that is definitely noticeable if not</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t going to do this every day and really analyze your face, you may as well pass on it, but if you really feel the need for a cream like this and are curious, you may see some short term results, and even though 1 ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like much, there is a lot of cream in that tube!</li>
            <li> Overall, the pro&#x27;s outweigh the con&#x27;s if you are willing to pay the price!</li>
            <li> But my right smile line was still very noticable, but less pronounced.    </li>
            <li> A few of the fine wrinkles appeared better after 2 months of use, and that&#x27;s because they became somewhat pink instead</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this product now for two weeks and at least it has done no damage, which is great since I have extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> wife applies the cream at night time and has not complained of any tingling or redness</li>
            <li> While it made my skin softer, I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in fine lines or little wrinkles.</li>
            <li> So far after using this product for 2weeks have not seen any signifigant changes!</li>
            <li> (yes, Donnie Darko married a younger woman about 30 years ago).  </li>
            <li> I used the product as directed for a few weeks and experienced no tingling, irritation, or any of the other possible side effects.  </li>
            <li> We do not believe based on results so far that \\&quot;deep\\&quot; wrinkles will be completely filled, but we can see that the lines appear softer and less defined.  </li>
            <li> decided that I&#x27;d use the cream on my forehead wrinkles, which developed after a lifetime of using my eyebrows for expressing my emotions.</li>
            <li> She says it completely refines the texture of her skin.</li>
            <li> You cannot expect a miraculous result; however, it comes close, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> The deep wrinkles remained exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> Use this cream under near your eyes, on your forefront, and the zones with wrinkles in general.</li>
            <li> I was curious about this product because at 29 I&#x27;m already starting to see lines on my face and was curious if I could use this productive more proactively.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would also work on my less pronounced laugh lines around my mouth, but I didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> Since the bottle was so small, I used it under my eye makeup and as a special, intensive treatment under my eyes before bed.</li>
            <li> Also, because my eyes have tiny white dots beside them, my doctor recommended using a cream high in retinols to make the dots go away, I decided</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have the natural wrinkle rather than red irritated skin.</li>
            <li> After two weeks (which is when I&#x27;m writing this review), nearly all of the white dots were gone and the rest showed signs of change.  </li>
            <li> I outsourced this review to an older relative who noted: the treatment in question had real effect on the classic wrinkle/ frown between the eyes- even though I&#x27;d been getting to bed late-</li>
            <li> The active ingredient Retinol is also listed at the very end, which may indicate that there is really not that much in there.</li>
            <li> The younger woman at work came in the next week and raved about this, as did my older daughter; my younger daughter has not tried it yet.  </li>
            <li> You think that using it so frequently will cause it to run out, but if you use it exactly according to the direction, I can see it easily lasting you 6-8 weeks depending on how heavy handed you are.</li>
            <li> The cream has no fragrance and has not irritated my skin at all, so I really have no other complaints besides that it is just not very effective so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used higher priced products with less results, and so I&#x27;m inclined to recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a targeted moisturizer with limited anti-wrinkle benefits.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and this is by far #1</li>
            <li> After several days of use, we found that beneficial results were minimal (possibly even a placebo effect); however, the heat and redness from the retinol were apparent with each application.  </li>
            <li> My wife has tried several products in the past (partial to Lancome), and reports positively about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: her report is that deeper lines seem softer, and smaller lines have become subjectively less numerous (she could not make an actual count).</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until the product arrived that I took a long, serious look in the mirror for the first time in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t purchase it after running out of this tube, though, since the difference I&#x27;ve noticed is negligible since I already use the moisturizer and don&#x27;t like having to wait so long for both products to sink in before applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tride this on those lines and a few others and was surprised to notice an almost immediate difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now, and I&#x27;ve only seen a slight reduction in the appearance of deep wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> and I suppose this cream helps a little, but I don&#x27;t feel the effect is long lasting, and I am not a big fan of putting lots of chemicals on my face for vanity reasons.  </li>
            <li> I saw some of the other reviews that said their skin was irritated and red after use</li>
            <li> I have been using on my deep creases between my eyes for about eight weeks and have noticed only a small change.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is already used to the retinol that is is the other Neutrogena product that I use, this Deep Wrinkle Filler didn&#x27;t cause me irritation, the way it did for some other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles are definitely there, but not as defined as they were previously, and my forehead feels</li>
            <li> If you give the product a few weeks and only use it once a day, the irritation should subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife was recently talking about undergoing some botox treatments to eliminate a few wrinkles she has aquired as she attempts to reach my age....</li>
            <li> Product arrived sooner than expected and well packed.</li>
            <li> You will like this product if you have reasonable expectations, and you will hate it if you really think a tube of cream is going to erase all your wrinkles.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I began to breakout after using this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product as recommended but it proved to be far too irritating for my skin (think redness and stinging).  </li>
            <li> cap is so tight I have to pull it off with my teeth.</li>
            <li> She reports that you should take care to apply the cream carefully as to location and amount, as the tube is small and you don&#x27;t want to waste any of the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of redness around the lip line but they tell you that will happen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that a little cream there couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks and saw little to no results.</li>
            <li> I noticed, after leaving for a trip without the wrinkle cream, the little breakouts I was having vanished after about a week.</li>
            <li> The few I have on my forehead were quite a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> Use it for a few weeks and see what happens.</li>
            <li> They are still quite pronounced, so no huge improvement, but some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this product for awhile, and like another reviewer stated, the cap is awful, I do tend to unscrew the top instead of pull the little cone cap off like</li>
            <li> There does come a time when one is past the point of no return</li>
            <li> A small amount of product produced a lot of heat, a feeling of irritation and swelling that did erase the test wrinkle</li>
            <li> You would think the manufacturer would realize by the time you are getting wrinkles, you are usually getting arthritis as well.</li>
            <li> I think people should realize there is no magic cream.  </li>
            <li> Note: If you need glasses to see, it&#x27;s difficult to apply this product properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little longer use, I noticed a subtle difference in the age spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I even tried cutting back the frequency to use it less frequently to see if that might improve the feel of this product, but it was still painful and without any noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to know whether the product caused the breakout or if it was something else.</li>
            <li> At least I could hide the discoloration with make-up, something I couldn&#x27;t do for the wrinkle.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few months, my lines literally appear worse than before I started this cream.</li>
            <li> And if there was any plumping involved, it was too subtle to notice.  </li>
            <li> did notice a subtle difference in my age spots after using the product for about a week.</li>
            <li> It takes a tube or two to notice a serious difference, but the softening effect is immediate.</li>
            <li> Also, as someone else mentioned it was extremely difficult to remove the cap from this tube; I had to use a small pair of pliers to remove the cap, because I have arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li> Con&#x27;s  a bit expensive for the small amount that is supplied    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with the results.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product, but I have acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Not drastic but very subtle after about a week.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of biting the inside of my lip and, in the process, push on my skin around my lips.  </li>
            <li> The problem with products like this is the marketing department goes into hyper-drive over-hyping it, and you end up with disappointed customers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rank this meh.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent product as it is the first time I have seen results at all and in a few weeks. I have tried other products and this is by far #1</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I turned 42.  Therefore, when Amazon.com offered me the opportunity to use and review Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Anti-wrinkle Deep Wrinkle Filler, I jumped at the opportunity.  It wasn&#x27;t until the product arrived that I took a long, serious look in the mirror for the first time in a long time.  What I realized was that my face isn&#x27;t significantly lined.  Who knew?  Do you really look at yourself all that closely?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I am in my 40s and I do have signs of aging.  I used the product as directed for a few weeks and experienced no tingling, irritation, or any of the other possible side effects.  Nor did I experience a miraculous change in my appearance.  I felt nicely moisturized, and there&#x27;s probably some benefit in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all truthfulness, I was jumping the gun, however unintentionally.  I will now tuck this tube into my medicine cabinet and revisit my need for the product in a year or two.</li>
            <li> We have used the Loreal products earlier, the ones which come in red, instead of this one, which is in blue packaging.    It was not as effective as Loreal, but this is cheaper than those too, so I would say it balances it out. Application could be easier, but there plenty of products with this kind of application regime. If you follow the instructions properly, you will get better results.     In any such treatment products, consistency is the key. follow the instructions, and patiently wait for a number of weeks to see results, there is no quickfix, unless you spend a lot of money, or get injections!</li>
            <li> It may be that I am asking for miracles here. There does come a time when one is past the point of no return and I think I&#x27;m there, unless I try injections and fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this product now for two weeks and at least it has done no damage, which is great since I have extra sensitive skin. There is a little bit of redness around the lip line but they tell you that will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;ve been a senior citizen for awhile now and I think no amount of applied creams will help everything. I do think the finer wrinkles are better and I will have to see how it goes in eight weeks for the wrinkles they call marionette lines. Stay tuned for more information in a month and a half. In the meantime, I do feel it&#x27;s a good product, so I&#x27;m giving it at least a four.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard so much about products with retinol that I wanted to try it out. Who wouldn&#x27;t love the idea of a product that can erase wrinkles?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency for allergies which can sometime include symptoms involving the skin. With prior experience in having reactions to fragrances, foundation makeup and even eyeliner and powder, I know that my immune system can go hyper so I decided to test this product away from the eyes. I was glad I did. A small amount of product produced a lot of heat, a feeling of irritation and swelling that did erase the test wrinkle temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this degree of reaction, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on a daily or even on a regular basis. I think the irritation is harmless, but I&#x27;d worry about triggering a more severe reaction down the road. I&#x27;d also be reluctant to use makeup on the irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feeling is that the irritation caused the swelling which made the wrinkle go away. This isn&#x27;t a permanent solution for wrinkles. I&#x27;d rather have the natural wrinkle rather than red irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this twice a day as directed and by the fifth day my skin hurt on the surface as well as deeper like a bruise.  After a week of not using the product, I tried it once a day instead. Within 4-5 days my skin started hurting again in the same way at which time I discontinued use. No results are evident at this point.</li>
            <li> I saw some of the other reviews that said their skin was irritated and red after use but I&#x27;ve experienced none of that. I&#x27;ve had no redness, tingling, or any sensation that there&#x27;s retinol in this product. I didn&#x27;t even think it was working!  I&#x27;ve used for over 4 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any visible improvement.  The directions don&#x27;t indicate how much to use and whether to just dab it on or rub it in.  I didn&#x27;t know whether I should be using a dime size drop or a quarter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap is so tight I have to pull it off with my teeth. I will use it till it&#x27;s gone so then I&#x27;ll report back if there&#x27;s any visible improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.  If you really want retinol then go to your dermatologist and get a prescription. Another suggestion is [[ASIN:B0035TFXGO Avon Anew Ultimate Night Age Repair Cream]].  It&#x27;s an excellent night cream.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a month or so, I did notice improvment.  It is VERY EASY to use too much , which can result white flakes on the skin.  LESS is MORE with this product, particulary for men.  There are many similar products out there, at many price-points.     This does work, and can compare to high-end department store brand&#x27;s at a fraction of the price.  If you are OFF-camera, I would suggest that ladies mix it with foundation, for a great result.  For OFF-camera guy&#x27;s, use it sparingly.  ON-Camera, you can use a bit more, with senstional results.    While it does have instant results, I am more impressed by the long-term improvment in the under-eye area, and forehead. Give it a try,but use care in application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now, and I&#x27;ve only seen a slight reduction in the appearance of deep wrinkles on my forehead. I&#x27;m not very impressed with the results.    The cream has no fragrance and has not irritated my skin at all, so I really have no other complaints besides that it is just not very effective so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using on my deep creases between my eyes for about eight weeks and have noticed only a small change. Wouldn&#x27;t bother to buy it.</li>
            <li> After using this product for more than a month, I can&#x27;t see that my wrinkles have been permanently reduced in any significant way. And if there was any plumping involved, it was too subtle to notice.  It could be a placebo affect, but I do see an overall improvement in the appearance of my skin. And like others have noticed, my skin does feel better moisturized after use.  I&#x27;ve used higher priced products with less results, and so I&#x27;m inclined to recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a targeted moisturizer with limited anti-wrinkle benefits.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  After only 2-3 weeks I definitely saw a difference, and I only used it once a day.</li>
            <li> I tried this for two weeks.  I took close-ups of my deep wrinkles -- I don&#x27;t advise anyone else to do this; it&#x27;s a bummer.  I also treated just one side of my face for the two weeks recommended, so that I could see if there was a difference between the sides.  After two weeks I have to say hat No, there is not a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this moisturizer is rich and creamy and makes my skin feel good, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B000052YOL Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream Original Formula, SPF 15, 1.4  Ounce]] for several years as my daily SPF moisturizer (it&#x27;s one of Paula Begoun&#x27;s picks) and really like it, so I was excited to try this new product.  Since my skin is already used to the retinol that is is the other Neutrogena product that I use, this Deep Wrinkle Filler didn&#x27;t cause me irritation, the way it did for some other reviewers.  If you give the product a few weeks and only use it once a day, the irritation should subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this claims to instantly fill wrinkles, I don&#x27;t notice that at all.  What I have noticed is that my skin feels smoother and softer after using this.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase it after running out of this tube, though, since the difference I&#x27;ve noticed is negligible since I already use the moisturizer and don&#x27;t like having to wait so long for both products to sink in before applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just use this product, though, it works really well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now. I wanted to address the deep wrinkles on my forehead and the age spots on my cheeks. I don&#x27;t really have any \\&quot;fine links\\&quot;, so I can&#x27;t speak to the effect there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a subtle difference in my age spots after using the product for about a week. The few I have on my forehead were quite a bit lighter. This is probably because I used quite a bit of the product there, because that&#x27;s where the wrinkles are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little longer use, I noticed a subtle difference in the age spots on my cheeks. They are still quite pronounced, so no huge improvement, but some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to give up on the deep wrinkles on my forehead, but after several weeks, I did notice a difference. The wrinkles are definitely there, but not as defined as they were previously, and my forehead feels smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product was surprisingly pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal and doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I began to breakout after using this product. It&#x27;s always hard to know whether the product caused the breakout or if it was something else. But, it happened, so I thought I&#x27;d share that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle cream, this isn&#x27;t it. If, however, you are committed to using the product diligently over a period of time in order to gain some improvement, you may want to consider this product.</li>
            <li> Although \\&quot;Deep Wrinkle Filler\\&quot; sounds like spackle, Neutrogena&#x27;s light cream actually works from the inside to smooth things out. It does a good job of filling in fine lines and wrinkles, and improves deeper wrinkles - but didn&#x27;t eliminate them entirely. So it&#x27;s effective rather than miraculous...but that&#x27;s still pretty good!</li>
            <li> I outsourced this review to an older relative who noted: the treatment in question had real effect on the classic wrinkle/ frown between the eyes- even though I&#x27;d been getting to bed late- the classic frown lines seemed much diminished also the frown lines across the forehead. Not so the lines from nose to mouth but at my advanced age I think something more drastic would be needed to have much of an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty positive review, though clearly it cannot work miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for three full weeks twice daily with no changes in the lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> You will like this product if you have reasonable expectations, and you will hate it if you really think a tube of cream is going to erase all your wrinkles. The problem with products like this is the marketing department goes into hyper-drive over-hyping it, and you end up with disappointed customers. So here&#x27;s what to expect. It will reduce the appearance of some wrinkles. It will not make you 21 again. Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So should you get it? If you have reasonable expectations, I&#x27;d suggest you buy a tube and try it out. Watch for any skin reactions, as some people have more sensitive skin. Use it for a few weeks and see what happens. I suggest doing a before and after photo so you can really objectively compare. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Just like the old Cher commercial where she opined \\&quot;if a great body came in a bottle, everyone would have one\\&quot;, Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle cream promises more than it can deliver.  After several days of use, we found that beneficial results were minimal (possibly even a placebo effect); however, the heat and redness from the retinol were apparent with each application.  Face it - there is no remedy for facial wrinkles in a bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife used this cream and reported back on her impressions; I also watched for changes in her facial lines to give a second opinion about effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She reports that the cream is easy to use.  The applicator tip enabled precise placement of the cream.  The cream was pleasant in feel and generally neutral; there were no oily sensations or the like.  Regular use of the cream over a period of time was relatively easy and not burdensome in any way.  She reports that you should take care to apply the cream carefully as to location and amount, as the tube is small and you don&#x27;t want to waste any of the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: her report is that deeper lines seem softer, and smaller lines have become subjectively less numerous (she could not make an actual count). This is a mid-term report as we haven&#x27;t gone for several months yet.  She does wonder how long-lasting the results will be, but we can&#x27;t give a definite answer about that and won&#x27;t be able to for some weeks to come. We are still seeing incremental improvements after several weeks. We do not believe based on results so far that \\&quot;deep\\&quot; wrinkles will be completely filled, but we can see that the lines appear softer and less defined.  We both agree on this observation.  My own observation is of a general facial softening and smoothing to a degree that is definitely noticeable if not overly dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our conclusion: the cream is worth a try and certainly has effect. Whether or not you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s quite enough effect, you will have to decide for yourself; and longer term trials are needed to see if the effect lasts for months rather than weeks.</li>
            <li> Okay, Okay I don&#x27;t have wrinkles that would hold a day&#x27;s rain, but then again, I don&#x27;t want to have wrinkles like that, either. So, I figured that I&#x27;d give this stuff a try to see if it will do anything over and above my \\&quot;never let sunshine touch my face without an SPF on it\\&quot; and \\&quot;maintain the best health possible.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that I&#x27;d use the cream on my forehead wrinkles, which developed after a lifetime of using my eyebrows for expressing my emotions. Also, because my eyes have tiny white dots beside them, my doctor recommended using a cream high in retinols to make the dots go away, I decided that a little cream there couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is dispensed in the tiniest of drops, and patted onto the preferred areas twice a day. If it has a scent, I sure didn&#x27;t notice it.  It did tingle a tiny bit, especially using an exfolliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week, I noticed that the white spots were getting smaller, although I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the forehead creases. After two weeks (which is when I&#x27;m writing this review), nearly all of the white dots were gone and the rest showed signs of change.  It may not have been enough exposure, but the forehead creases showed no changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am delighted, even if the forehead creases never change. I&#x27;ll continue to use the cream on any of the white dots if they re-occur.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but no miracle worker. It goes on smooth, feels great and smells divine..&lt;br /&gt;but, it does not provide miracles on deep lines.&lt;br /&gt;It does plump lines somewhat, but again... no drastic changes...&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars...</li>
            <li> I tried this product because the Neutrogena Healthy Skin eye cream worked well for me, so I hoped to have good results with this Neutrogena product on my wrinkles.  I used it each morning &amp; night and never saw much change.  A few of the fine wrinkles appeared better after 2 months of use, and that&#x27;s because they became somewhat pink instead (I assume from irritation).  At least I could hide the discoloration with make-up, something I couldn&#x27;t do for the wrinkle. I didn&#x27;t want to give up on the deep wrinkles, since I have more of those, so I used this for 3 months, the idea being to finish the tube.  The deep wrinkles remained exactly the same.  Also, as someone else mentioned it was extremely difficult to remove the cap from this tube; I had to use a small pair of pliers to remove the cap, because I have arthritis in my hands. You would think the manufacturer would realize by the time you are getting wrinkles, you are usually getting arthritis as well.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Anti-wrinkle Deep Wrinkle Filler, 1-Ounce.     Pro&#x27;s:   sensible packaging, both inner and outer  the applicator is well designed for applying the product in the desired location  nice consistency (not too gritty or greasy)  favorable scent (does not make you smell like a medicine cabinet)  does reduce the number of visible lines and wrinkles    Con&#x27;s  a bit expensive for the small amount that is supplied    Overall, the pro&#x27;s outweigh the con&#x27;s if you are willing to pay the price!</li>
            <li> This is nice cream, and it makes your face look better, but if you get a touch of it too close to your eye, it burns, and anything made for the eyes, should not have any chemical in it to burn the eyes.  It does look nice though, after you use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-wrinkle affects of this product as I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in fine lines around the eyes or in my smile lines from long term use, though I did find that this product did a great job at keeping my foundation from settling into creases (which can bring unwanted attention to fine lines that would otherwise be not so noticeable).  I don&#x27;t reach for this product often since I would trust my retin-a over an over the counter anti-wrinkle cream however, I do use it on days where the weather is unusually dry as it does do a great job at smoothing out any superficial lines that I get from dry skin.</li>
            <li> This seems to work better than some more expensive wrinkle fillers I have purchased, I have been using for 2 weeks, I see an improvement in lines from nose to mouth &amp; forehead.  Don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my eyes but have been using there to prevent any.  I think people should realize there is no magic cream.  I believe to improve your skin you need to nourish internally as well.  In addition to topical treatments you need to drink  plenty of water &amp; eat healthy.  I have started eating only \\&quot;clean foods\\&quot;, drinking plenty of water &amp; a veggie/fruit juice in the morning &amp; evening, so the improvement could be a combination of this as well, but I am very happy that my skin is looking younger in just a couple weeks</li>
            <li> So far after using this product for 2weeks have not seen any signifigant changes! Would not recommend this product or purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> I was curious about this product because at 29 I&#x27;m already starting to see lines on my face and was curious if I could use this productive more proactively.  I used this product as recommended but it proved to be far too irritating for my skin (think redness and stinging).  I even tried cutting back the frequency to use it less frequently to see if that might improve the feel of this product, but it was still painful and without any noticeable results.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of over the counter and prescription products before, but for some reason I found the irritation of this product to be especially pronounced, even more so than some of the prescription products I&#x27;ve used.  I think my skin has just become too sensitive after rounds of accutane and acne topicals for usage of this product to be a comfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I think this could be a good product, but if you have sensitive skin like I do, I&#x27;d recommend proceeding with caution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely given this product enough time to work, but I&#x27;ve not been able to notice any discernable change. I applied it as recommended but the wrinkles are still there. I&#x27;m in my 60s and perhaps this product would have been more effective if used when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nearly odorless, goes on smoothly, and blends well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Please don&#x27;t discontinue!</li>
            <li> After a couple of hours after application, your face looks relaxed and healthy. Use this cream under near your eyes, on your forefront, and the zones with wrinkles in general. Your skin will definitely feel more elastic!</li>
            <li> Number one reason for my purchasing this product is Neutragena&#x27;s good reputation and the purity of all of its products..  My daughter has been using this, recommended it, and I found it to follow thru&#x27; with what it claimed, better than any other I had tried.  My thanks.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference when I use this product.  Not drastic but very subtle after about a week.  I don&#x27;t use the tip to apply, I just rub it into the wrinkles</li>
            <li> You have to use it EXACTLY as the directions say &amp; use it every day. It will take about 2 weeks, but you will start to notice a difference. You think that using it so frequently will cause it to run out, but if you use it exactly according to the direction, I can see it easily lasting you 6-8 weeks depending on how heavy handed you are. I can&#x27;t wait to see results after about 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife has tried several products in the past (partial to Lancome), and reports positively about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science: Topical vitamin A derivatives are generally used cosmetically as an anti-aging agent to increase the rate of skin turnover, and promote an increase in collagen giving fuller more youthful appearance to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife applies the cream at night time and has not complained of any tingling or redness (perhaps it is all in how much you use, most creams do not require a &#x27;liberal&#x27; application to do their job - from my experience counseling patients as a pharmacy student). My wife is happy with the results on little lines, but still favors her Lancome products based upon long term experience. P-)</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for six months. She is 43 and this was her first specialized face cream. She enjoyed it and noticed an improvement. The product did not irritate her skin and she uses it nightly. After six months she still had a 1/3 of a tube left, so while pricey, it can last for some time. It has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Diminishes lines so they r not so noticeable.  I used it specifically around my mouth where ur jaw sages &amp; have deep lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Begin forwarded message:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From: Chris Elkendier &amp;#60;elkendier@gmail.com&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Date: April 25, 2014 at 9:29:09 AM CDT&lt;br /&gt;To: cesandman@aol.com, Mom &amp;#60;Susieaw@aol.com&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Subject: Rogue sent me a bday card</li>
            <li> Growing up in California, you quickly lear that the sun is not your friend.  One of the good things my sister taught me is to moisturize your skin.  Therefore at 54, I do not have virtually no wrinkles.  But I do have what I call smile lines.  Those deep lines from the bottom of your nose to the sides of your mouth.    I tride this on those lines and a few others and was surprised to notice an almost immediate difference.  The only problem was it worked better on the left side of my face than the right.  My left smile line almost disappeared over night, with just one application!  But my right smile line was still very noticable, but less pronounced.    Therefore, this product does appear to work but you may notice different rates of effectiveness in different areas.  I would say at the list price, it is probably worth a try - for women and for men.</li>
            <li> My wife was recently talking about undergoing some botox treatments to eliminate a few wrinkles she has aquired as she attempts to reach my age.... (yes, Donnie Darko married a younger woman about 30 years ago).  I saw this product and got it for her to try.  She started using it and was immediately pleased.  In the weeks that have followed she has been even more pleased.  She&#x27;s always beautiful to me, but even I have noticed a difference, especially in those so-called smile line areas and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; at the corners of the eyes.  They have been eliminated.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but suffice it to say the proof is right before my eyes.  And my wife has stopped talking about botox which I don&#x27;t believe to be all that safe.  My wife is very happy with this product and I think you will like it too.</li>
            <li> This works really well on brow furrows.</li>
            <li> Product arrived sooner than expected and well packed. Seller left a nice note thanking me for the purchase. I just tried the cream for the first time. It seems well made but time will tell the true results. I will update in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I would definitely not recommend this product.  It leaves a greasy appearance and feel.  It makes my skin break out anywhere I apply it.  After using this for a few months, my lines literally appear worse than before I started this cream. Honestly wish I had never tried it.</li>
            <li> Thank you I am very happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rank this meh. I used it for 3 weeks and saw little to no results. Discontinued use when the puppy decided the tube was a delicious chew toy. Note: If you need glasses to see, it&#x27;s difficult to apply this product properly.</li>
            <li> At 66 this works great on my face and keeps me younger looking</li>
            <li> I liked this Neutrogena product, particularly under my eyes. Since the bottle was so small, I used it under my eye makeup and as a special, intensive treatment under my eyes before bed. While it made my skin softer, I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in fine lines or little wrinkles. It worked better as a moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> I use it as an eye cream and it really smooths out my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Cannot be without this product.  Works wonders in reducing fine lines around the mouth and neck.  I love this product.  I recommend this product to all women.  It works.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite wrinkle cream. She says it completely refines the texture of her skin. So much so that she doesn&#x27;t need to exfoliate. This is good because I have heard a lot about plastic exfoliating beads in some exfoliating cleansers getting into the eyes and causing pain and damage. With this product that is one step you can skip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fine to medium wrinkles are softened for sure with extended use of the product. It takes a tube or two to notice a serious difference, but the softening effect is immediate. I recommend this because it has made my wife so happy and as they say: Happy Wife, Happy Life.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for over a year, and my wrinkles have deepened within that time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year, it works!!!!  It is very effective.  I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Product works as described I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for awhile, and like another reviewer stated, the cap is awful, I do tend to unscrew the top instead of pull the little cone cap off like you are supposed to.  Being in my 40&#x27;s, I have the lines they speak of and I suppose this cream helps a little, but I don&#x27;t feel the effect is long lasting, and I am not a big fan of putting lots of chemicals on my face for vanity reasons.  I was also not fully religious about applying this daily, so I can&#x27;t shout out that it works or it doesn&#x27;t work like it claims to.  I think there is also a psychological effect that comes with a product like this, you put it on, expect to see wrinkles diminish and therefore you do.  But does anyone else notice a real difference?  Who knows.  If you aren&#x27;t going to do this every day and really analyze your face, you may as well pass on it, but if you really feel the need for a cream like this and are curious, you may see some short term results, and even though 1 ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like much, there is a lot of cream in that tube!</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as described in the morning and evening for about four weeks, before I noticed any difference, so you have to be patient. It worked best on my forehead wrinkles: one of them is almost completely gone and the other is barely noticable now. I was hoping it would also work on my less pronounced laugh lines around my mouth, but I didn&#x27;t see any results there.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, that this product does contain a ton of parabens! The active ingredient Retinol is also listed at the very end, which may indicate that there is really not that much in there.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work very well as a anti-wrinkle cream. After using it daily for about two months, I definitely noticed a difference. However, I despise the way it smells (oddly cloyingly sweet) and would have preferred something fragrance free (my fault for not reading the product description more thoroughly). Also, it made me break out. I noticed, after leaving for a trip without the wrinkle cream, the little breakouts I was having vanished after about a week. When I arrived home and resumed the regimen, I broke out again. I&#x27;m not happy with the product, but I have acne-prone skin. So it&#x27;s a word of caution to girls with skin like me who seem simultaneously cursed with the problems of adolescence (acne) and middle age (wrinkles).</li>
            <li> You cannot expect a miraculous result; however, it comes close, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I have passed this on to my two daughters (bought both of them a tube) and to one younger woman in her 40&#x27;s at work.  The younger woman at work came in the next week and raved about this, as did my older daughter; my younger daughter has not tried it yet.  As for me, I will be 65 this year (2013); and I notice a huge difference if I do not use this Neutrogena anti-wrinkle deep wrinkle filler each day.  I have a bad habit of biting the inside of my lip and, in the process, push on my skin around my lips.  When I put this cream around that area, I immediately notice a difference.  The wrinkle around my eyes have all but disappeared.  I only hope Neutrogena does not stop making this; it is a wonderful product, just in time for my old age.</li>
            <li> For me, this works better than other Neutrogena Anti-wrinkle creams. It fills in lines and makes your makeup go on smooth.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I hope this product is NOT being discontinued.</li>
