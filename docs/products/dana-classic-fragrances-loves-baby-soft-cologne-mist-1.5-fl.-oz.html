            <li> Blast from the past scent</li>
            <li> This smells very cheap. Its cheap and had a powdery baby powder like scent. If anything this should just be a room freshner. not my kind of scent. A little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Yes!! It&#x27;s the same as I remember it! A sweet, slightly flowery, baby powder scent that takes me right back to 1982 when I got my first bottle for Christmas. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t smell the same but it DOES! It&#x27;s wonderful. The bottle looks nice on my vanity, too. VERY happy with this purchase.</li>
