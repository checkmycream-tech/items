            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I got them because for the price they seemed to be the best deal, but they are not.</li>
            <li>This was the best thing I ever did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, VERY happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>is very pleasant</li>
            <li>and these were amazing!!</li>
            <li>They are incredibly greasy and disintegrate in your hands.</li>
            <li>They do smell incredible, however.</li>
            <li>Wiping it off on a sheet of one of these is brilliant.</li>
            <li>And they smell good too!</li>
            <li>These work surprisingly well and smell great!!</li>
            <li>This is a great idea to take in your purse or for traveling.</li>
            <li>The smell is great</li>
            <li>I used them at work (with the boss&#x27; blessing, lol) and everyone who came by my desk asked, &amp;#34;What smells so good?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This Christmas I added them as &amp;#34;stocking stuffers.&amp;#34;  Great quality</li>
            <li>However, they don&#x27;t work that great for me.</li>
            <li>I buy them at the dollar store all the time and they smell soo great.</li>
            <li>these are great.  </li>
            <li>Made a great stocking stuffer for my sister.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>They smell great and they work just well, but they do feel oily which may be so tha</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>noticed that this product does not have acetone in it so it does not have that foul nail polish remover smell, which is GREAT.</li>
            <li>Very nice nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>These smell very nice, but they have not worked at all to remove my nail polish.</li>
            <li>These are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are perfect, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better for a nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I carry these in my bag and they come in handy!</li>
            <li>They are convenient (if they worked), portable, and have a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant and one pad handles all fingers.</li>
            <li>Has a wonderful smell and removes the&lt;br /&gt;polish very quickly.</li>
            <li>but this is perfect if you don&#x27;t want that strong remover smell.</li>
            <li>Good pads.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re good to keep in the office for those days when you just have to get the chipped polish off your nails.</li>
            <li>and sometimes one pad per finger with a good bit of scrubbing involved.  </li>
            <li>The concept is nice and the smell is great.</li>
            <li>Loved them will continue to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Smell good , work well.</li>
            <li>the shipping was good too.&lt;br /&gt;Happy.</li>
            <li>Most of them smell great.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a most have now!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>These work better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried on my nails!</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>we love these; they work so well!</li>
            <li>Love them !</li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>these smell SO AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It may be great if you&#x27;re used to acetone free removers.</li>
            <li>I purchased them based on customer reviews, and now I honestly wonder...</li>
            <li>And also, have to use a lot of pads to remove the nail polish as it&#x27;s not that effective.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Thesr are handy, portable and the container is leak proof.</li>
            <li>they smell nice.</li>
            <li>The pads just kind of disintegrate as you use them.</li>
            <li>They remove the polish well and give a nice moisture treatment to the nails.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these, great gift idea too!</li>
            <li>super great deal.</li>
            <li>I can do 5 toes with one pad and they are textured to help remove the polish more effectively.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how easy it removes the most stubborn nail polish and leaves the nails feeling really good.  </li>
            <li>They also arrived quickly!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Love the scents on these.</li>
            <li>and then 1-2 coats of Nubar Diamonte or Seche Vite top</li>
            <li>I love how convenient they are to toss in your purse--otherwise I would end up damaging my nails by peeling the polish off.</li>
            <li>My nails and cuticles do feel more moisturized when using these; I think there&#x27;s oil in them.</li>
            <li>They smell great and very compact.</li>
            <li>Remove polish much better than acetone.  </li>
            <li>love love love these</li>
            <li>I have even tried to just put them on my nails and let it soak in before rubbing and it still isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li>And these smell better.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell and the oil that it provides to my nails</li>
            <li>I know this is better for me</li>
            <li>great product well packaged will do business again thanks</li>
            <li>I LOVE these scented pads.  </li>
            <li>you get soo many</li>
            <li>I do nail art and have many brushes and tools that I use for nail</li>
            <li>I would recommend and will buy this again :)</li>
            <li>Wish I would have purchased more for my daughter&#x27;s bridal shower favors and ran out of shipping time.</li>
            <li>These are very moisturizing to your nails and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>used as cute gifts for yw and women - nice and love the easy clean on my nails too</li>
            <li>(my normal method)&lt;br /&gt; - The cuticle oil is very nice.</li>
            <li>There easy to use, smell great and make skin and nails seem soft, Instead of chemically!</li>
            <li>LA Colors Nail Polish Remover Pads are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy for travel, too.</li>
            <li>and I can easily do all 10 nails with one pad.  </li>
            <li>These pads smell good; the package stays closed; they smell good; and they remove nail polish.</li>
            <li>They remove polish effectively and yet are very gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I gladly purchased a 6 pack because I know I&#x27;ll use every single one with joy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not counting this as a huge problem, but</li>
            <li>Fantastic size to store, carry in a purse, even a pocket if need be.  </li>
            <li>These were odor snd alcohol free.</li>
            <li>i shared with my co-worker and all found them to be fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have never used anything acetone free</li>
            <li>but they work really well and smell nice.</li>
            <li>, I bought more right away to stick in everyone&#x27;s Christmas</li>
            <li>super easy for on the go.</li>
            <li>How can everyone/anyone be so excited about them?</li>
            <li>First of all, if you travel anywhere you sure don&#x27;t want to carry a bottle of polish remover with you.  </li>
            <li>Love these they are so small and easy to carry and work great</li>
            <li>Box Nail Polish Remover Cuticle Oil Clean]]</li>
            <li>very tiny but takes nail polish off nicely and smells even better.  </li>
            <li>First, the smell is great - much better than other acetone polish removers.</li>
            <li>Ok very oily.</li>
            <li>I really do the love the scents of these</li>
            <li>They make the process quick and painless.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly, as described.</li>
            <li>Not only do they smell good but they also feel nice on your nails and do not dry out your cuticles.</li>
            <li>while this doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the more common polish remover pads, it does a good job for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
            <li>Fun but not efficient.</li>
            <li>my 7 year old daughter loved them and I was okay with her using them because they are harsh oder free.</li>
            <li>The oiliness washes right off.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m right.  </li>
            <li>When they arrived (I had them shipped to work), I passed them out at work and we all removed our nailpolish right at our desks...</li>
            <li>My first time using it was with light mint colored nail polish, at first it seemed to work, but its VERY oily.</li>
            <li>Again VERY oily but its nice and compact so far looks very purse friendly ( just make sure the lid is tightly screwed) and nail friendly.</li>
            <li>Smell sure is better than chemical heavy stuff.</li>
            <li>Effective even onthe super dark colors I use on my nails.</li>
            <li>These pads smell amazing, absolutely NO hint of acetone or anything whatsoever.</li>
            <li>You only need to use (2) pads at the most which will remove&lt;br /&gt;the polish for 10 fingernails.</li>
            <li>then others I have tried, and definitely smells better than the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite appealing, however, and much better than the brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove polish on multiple nails with one pad,about the size of a silver dollar.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a fan</li>
            <li>so this was a first</li>
            <li>and i can say first off the smell</li>
            <li>I LOOOOVE these so much!</li>
            <li>They are NOT drying at all and work really well!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how the pads smell exactly like the fruit.  </li>
            <li>they smell so so much better than the traditional nail polish remover!</li>
            <li>The only difficulty I have is I often pull out more than one at a time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this not knowing exactly what it would be like.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have said, the pads are oily but for me, that was actually nice.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of polish the other reviewers use.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t used them as they were part of party favors for other people but the containers looked nice.</li>
            <li>It has an oily feel and does require a good amount of rubbing to get the polish off (especially if you have a good amount on) plus the size of the pads are small hence the need to use multiple pads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend La Fresh nails pads.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better on non-glitter/metallic polishes, with just a regular flat polish I can easily use one pad for a whole hand.  </li>
            <li>I like them and the little containers are cute!</li>
            <li>I know non-acetone polish remover will always be less effective</li>
            <li>The only downer is that it has an oily residue but comes of extremely easy under water or hand sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;Also.</li>
            <li>than drying out your nails and skin from strong toxic acetone, these actually feel oily and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Snags just a little bit on glitter and leaves a light residue on fingers (easily wiped/washed off).</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li>wanted to like them so much.</li>
            <li>(the pear was really yummy smelling).</li>
            <li>Work very well.  </li>
            <li>they dont work very well</li>
            <li>Just fruity soda-pop fragrances that really work.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t stand the smell of nail polish remover, you really need to try these.</li>
            <li>I really like these pads</li>
            <li>and it take so much work.</li>
            <li>These polish remover pads work really well - much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried - a</li>
            <li>I actually was able to use a single pad (they&#x27;re more like wipes btw) for all ten nails-</li>
            <li>Soon much better than conventional liquid remover....</li>
            <li>These LA Colors remover pads are amazing for me because they are slightly oily and leave my nails feeling soft and silky while still peeling off the nail polish in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe these are not more popular and have not taken over the market of nail polish removers...</li>
            <li>come in a cute compact case you can carry around in your purse, keep at your desk, in your locker, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than having to buy a big bottle of remover and then buy separate cotton balls, these have individual pre-soaked pads; all in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fresh clean scents but they leave so much behind.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i would  highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone using nail polish.</li>
            <li>these little things work like magic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that if you are wearing several coats of polish, it takes about two pads per hand, but I have individually wrapped pads from a major cosmetics maker, and although it takes only about half as many pads, they cost about $.50 each -- much, much more than these pads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These little rounds will ultimately get through all of it, but I have to hold it on, rub, scrub, scrape....and pretty much use 2-3 (or more) rounds per nail.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - Smells a lot better than acetone on a cotton round</li>
            <li>but I am almost having more trouble using my fingers with these sheets.</li>
            <li>a bit tricky getting used to from your normal cotton ball and acetone.</li>
            <li>Works way better and is more convenient than polish remover and much less harsh on my nails!</li>
            <li>I only have use of my right hand</li>
            <li>I rely on reviews quite a bit when I make a purchase of something new.</li>
            <li>no harsh smell!  </li>
            <li>These pads are flimsy and messy and don&#x27;t easily remove my polish.</li>
            <li>However a little goes a long way - I can usually do both hands with 3 pads and even when the pad looks full of polish it still does a good job removing polish.</li>
            <li>I will still use my old fashioned cotton ball and bottle of non acetone polish remover, these pads now have a home in my nail polish case for the times I do my nails on the go.</li>
            <li>The scents are much nicer than traditional polish remover.</li>
            <li>I bought for my daughter, so no harsh smell.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>it keeps the bristles soft and cleans off the excess nail polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply a base coat, 2-3 coats of polish, and then a top coat and these pads remove everything pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>I usually use one pad for one or two fingers (maybe because I use darker colors or multiple top coats) but regardless, they still work</li>
            <li>I wear light polish so it only takes a few to remove it.</li>
            <li>Went to the drugstore (major chain) looking for them after a co-worker introduced me to them, but they didn&#x27;t have them.  </li>
            <li>While it is a little oily, I only use one sheet per hand then one to clean it up.</li>
            <li>( so far ive only opened the pear scented one ).</li>
            <li>cuticles feeling dry like normal acetone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall i ended up going back to the acetone and cotton ball to clean up the messy nail polish/oil residue.</li>
            <li>well worth the little extra cost.</li>
            <li>They smell fantastic, leave your hands almost feeling moisturized rather than really dry like nail polish remover, and I only had to use (2) wipes, normally I use at least 2-4 cotton balls.</li>
            <li>But due to their ineffectiveness, I will be returning to the stronger, larger, and better polish remover pads I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>These do require a little more rubbing than acetone, but I can usually get all the polish off both hands with 1-2 pads.</li>
            <li>Maybe since this is my first time im not very handy at it?</li>

            <li> I used them at work (with the boss&#x27; blessing, lol) and everyone who came by my desk asked, &amp;#34;What smells so good?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This Christmas I added them as &amp;#34;stocking stuffers.&amp;#34;  Great quality</li>
            <li> However, they don&#x27;t work that great for me.</li>
            <li> I buy them at the dollar store all the time and they smell soo great.</li>
            <li> these are great.  </li>
            <li> Made a great stocking stuffer for my sister.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> They smell great and they work just well, but they do feel oily which may be so tha</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> noticed that this product does not have acetone in it so it does not have that foul nail polish remover smell, which is GREAT.</li>
            <li> Very nice nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> These smell very nice, but they have not worked at all to remove my nail polish.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are perfect, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better for a nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I carry these in my bag and they come in handy!</li>
            <li> They are convenient (if they worked), portable, and have a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant and one pad handles all fingers.</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful smell and removes the&lt;br /&gt;polish very quickly.</li>
            <li> but this is perfect if you don&#x27;t want that strong remover smell.</li>
            <li> Good pads.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re good to keep in the office for those days when you just have to get the chipped polish off your nails.</li>
            <li> and sometimes one pad per finger with a good bit of scrubbing involved.  </li>
            <li> The concept is nice and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> Loved them will continue to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Smell good , work well.</li>
            <li> the shipping was good too.&lt;br /&gt;Happy.</li>
            <li> Most of them smell great.</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a most have now!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> These work better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried on my nails!</li>
            <li> I love these things!</li>
            <li> we love these; they work so well!</li>
            <li> Love them !</li>
            <li> Love these!  </li>
            <li> these smell SO AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It may be great if you&#x27;re used to acetone free removers.</li>
            <li> I purchased them based on customer reviews, and now I honestly wonder...</li>
            <li> And also, have to use a lot of pads to remove the nail polish as it&#x27;s not that effective.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Thesr are handy, portable and the container is leak proof.</li>
            <li> they smell nice.</li>
            <li> The pads just kind of disintegrate as you use them.</li>
            <li> They remove the polish well and give a nice moisture treatment to the nails.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these, great gift idea too!</li>
            <li> super great deal.</li>
            <li> I can do 5 toes with one pad and they are textured to help remove the polish more effectively.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how easy it removes the most stubborn nail polish and leaves the nails feeling really good.  </li>
            <li> They also arrived quickly!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Love the scents on these.</li>
            <li> and then 1-2 coats of Nubar Diamonte or Seche Vite top</li>
            <li> I love how convenient they are to toss in your purse--otherwise I would end up damaging my nails by peeling the polish off.</li>
            <li> My nails and cuticles do feel more moisturized when using these; I think there&#x27;s oil in them.</li>
            <li> They smell great and very compact.</li>
            <li> Remove polish much better than acetone.  </li>
            <li> love love love these</li>
            <li> I have even tried to just put them on my nails and let it soak in before rubbing and it still isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li> And these smell better.</li>
            <li> but I love the smell and the oil that it provides to my nails</li>
            <li> I know this is better for me</li>
            <li> great product well packaged will do business again thanks</li>
            <li> I LOVE these scented pads.  </li>
            <li> you get soo many</li>
            <li> I do nail art and have many brushes and tools that I use for nail</li>
            <li> I would recommend and will buy this again :)</li>
            <li> Wish I would have purchased more for my daughter&#x27;s bridal shower favors and ran out of shipping time.</li>
            <li> These are very moisturizing to your nails and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> used as cute gifts for yw and women - nice and love the easy clean on my nails too</li>
            <li> (my normal method)&lt;br /&gt; - The cuticle oil is very nice.</li>
            <li> There easy to use, smell great and make skin and nails seem soft, Instead of chemically!</li>
            <li> LA Colors Nail Polish Remover Pads are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy for travel, too.</li>
            <li> and I can easily do all 10 nails with one pad.  </li>
            <li> These pads smell good; the package stays closed; they smell good; and they remove nail polish.</li>
            <li> They remove polish effectively and yet are very gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I gladly purchased a 6 pack because I know I&#x27;ll use every single one with joy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not counting this as a huge problem, but</li>
            <li> Fantastic size to store, carry in a purse, even a pocket if need be.  </li>
            <li> These were odor snd alcohol free.</li>
            <li> i shared with my co-worker and all found them to be fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have never used anything acetone free</li>
            <li> but they work really well and smell nice.</li>
            <li> , I bought more right away to stick in everyone&#x27;s Christmas</li>
            <li> super easy for on the go.</li>
            <li> How can everyone/anyone be so excited about them?</li>
            <li> First of all, if you travel anywhere you sure don&#x27;t want to carry a bottle of polish remover with you.  </li>
            <li> Love these they are so small and easy to carry and work great</li>
            <li> Box Nail Polish Remover Cuticle Oil Clean]]</li>
            <li> very tiny but takes nail polish off nicely and smells even better.  </li>
            <li> First, the smell is great - much better than other acetone polish removers.</li>
            <li> Ok very oily.</li>
            <li> I really do the love the scents of these</li>
            <li> They make the process quick and painless.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly, as described.</li>
            <li> Not only do they smell good but they also feel nice on your nails and do not dry out your cuticles.</li>
            <li> while this doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the more common polish remover pads, it does a good job for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
            <li> Fun but not efficient.</li>
            <li> my 7 year old daughter loved them and I was okay with her using them because they are harsh oder free.</li>
            <li> The oiliness washes right off.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m right.  </li>
            <li> When they arrived (I had them shipped to work), I passed them out at work and we all removed our nailpolish right at our desks...</li>
            <li> My first time using it was with light mint colored nail polish, at first it seemed to work, but its VERY oily.</li>
            <li> Again VERY oily but its nice and compact so far looks very purse friendly ( just make sure the lid is tightly screwed) and nail friendly.</li>
            <li> Smell sure is better than chemical heavy stuff.</li>
            <li> Effective even onthe super dark colors I use on my nails.</li>
            <li> These pads smell amazing, absolutely NO hint of acetone or anything whatsoever.</li>
            <li> You only need to use (2) pads at the most which will remove&lt;br /&gt;the polish for 10 fingernails.</li>
            <li> then others I have tried, and definitely smells better than the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite appealing, however, and much better than the brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove polish on multiple nails with one pad,about the size of a silver dollar.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a fan</li>
            <li> so this was a first</li>
            <li> and i can say first off the smell</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE these so much!</li>
            <li> They are NOT drying at all and work really well!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how the pads smell exactly like the fruit.  </li>
            <li> they smell so so much better than the traditional nail polish remover!</li>
            <li> The only difficulty I have is I often pull out more than one at a time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing exactly what it would be like.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have said, the pads are oily but for me, that was actually nice.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of polish the other reviewers use.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used them as they were part of party favors for other people but the containers looked nice.</li>
            <li> It has an oily feel and does require a good amount of rubbing to get the polish off (especially if you have a good amount on) plus the size of the pads are small hence the need to use multiple pads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend La Fresh nails pads.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better on non-glitter/metallic polishes, with just a regular flat polish I can easily use one pad for a whole hand.  </li>
            <li> I like them and the little containers are cute!</li>
            <li> I know non-acetone polish remover will always be less effective</li>
            <li> The only downer is that it has an oily residue but comes of extremely easy under water or hand sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;Also.</li>
            <li> than drying out your nails and skin from strong toxic acetone, these actually feel oily and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Snags just a little bit on glitter and leaves a light residue on fingers (easily wiped/washed off).</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> wanted to like them so much.</li>
            <li> (the pear was really yummy smelling).</li>
            <li> Work very well.  </li>
            <li> they dont work very well</li>
            <li> Just fruity soda-pop fragrances that really work.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t stand the smell of nail polish remover, you really need to try these.</li>
            <li> I really like these pads</li>
            <li> and it take so much work.</li>
            <li> These polish remover pads work really well - much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried - a</li>
            <li> I actually was able to use a single pad (they&#x27;re more like wipes btw) for all ten nails-</li>
            <li> Soon much better than conventional liquid remover....</li>
            <li> These LA Colors remover pads are amazing for me because they are slightly oily and leave my nails feeling soft and silky while still peeling off the nail polish in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe these are not more popular and have not taken over the market of nail polish removers...</li>
            <li> come in a cute compact case you can carry around in your purse, keep at your desk, in your locker, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than having to buy a big bottle of remover and then buy separate cotton balls, these have individual pre-soaked pads; all in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fresh clean scents but they leave so much behind.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i would  highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone using nail polish.</li>
            <li> these little things work like magic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that if you are wearing several coats of polish, it takes about two pads per hand, but I have individually wrapped pads from a major cosmetics maker, and although it takes only about half as many pads, they cost about $.50 each -- much, much more than these pads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These little rounds will ultimately get through all of it, but I have to hold it on, rub, scrub, scrape....and pretty much use 2-3 (or more) rounds per nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Smells a lot better than acetone on a cotton round</li>
            <li> but I am almost having more trouble using my fingers with these sheets.</li>
            <li> a bit tricky getting used to from your normal cotton ball and acetone.</li>
            <li> Works way better and is more convenient than polish remover and much less harsh on my nails!</li>
            <li> I only have use of my right hand</li>
            <li> I rely on reviews quite a bit when I make a purchase of something new.</li>
            <li> no harsh smell!  </li>
            <li> These pads are flimsy and messy and don&#x27;t easily remove my polish.</li>
            <li> However a little goes a long way - I can usually do both hands with 3 pads and even when the pad looks full of polish it still does a good job removing polish.</li>
            <li> I will still use my old fashioned cotton ball and bottle of non acetone polish remover, these pads now have a home in my nail polish case for the times I do my nails on the go.</li>
            <li> The scents are much nicer than traditional polish remover.</li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter, so no harsh smell.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> it keeps the bristles soft and cleans off the excess nail polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply a base coat, 2-3 coats of polish, and then a top coat and these pads remove everything pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> I usually use one pad for one or two fingers (maybe because I use darker colors or multiple top coats) but regardless, they still work</li>
            <li> I wear light polish so it only takes a few to remove it.</li>
            <li> Went to the drugstore (major chain) looking for them after a co-worker introduced me to them, but they didn&#x27;t have them.  </li>
            <li> While it is a little oily, I only use one sheet per hand then one to clean it up.</li>
            <li> ( so far ive only opened the pear scented one ).</li>
            <li> cuticles feeling dry like normal acetone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall i ended up going back to the acetone and cotton ball to clean up the messy nail polish/oil residue.</li>
            <li> well worth the little extra cost.</li>
            <li> They smell fantastic, leave your hands almost feeling moisturized rather than really dry like nail polish remover, and I only had to use (2) wipes, normally I use at least 2-4 cotton balls.</li>
            <li> But due to their ineffectiveness, I will be returning to the stronger, larger, and better polish remover pads I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> These do require a little more rubbing than acetone, but I can usually get all the polish off both hands with 1-2 pads.</li>
            <li> Maybe since this is my first time im not very handy at it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to understand how so many stellar reviews can be wrong</li>
            <li> A pack csn last a long time</li>
            <li> Pads smell nice, not too fruity, but they lack any sort of texture making it very difficult to remove polish.</li>
            <li> regular polish remover tends to dry out my hands and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> The individual sheets are very thin and it takes me multiple to clean off my nails.</li>
            <li> Much better than traditional acetone bottle which spills and smells bad.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving in your car during summer they could dry out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a dry oil feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> These little pads don&#x27;t dry out and actually work.</li>
            <li> I really do not recommend these.</li>
            <li> I usually do a base coat, 2x color, and a top coat in salon-quality brands like OPI on my fingers and toes, and I had to use three pads just to get all of the polish off of one big toe!</li>
            <li> They say you only need one pad, but I needed 4-5 to remove heavy, dark polish.</li>
            <li> Same for toes usually.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate since this is a Christmas Present and has not yet been given.</li>
            <li> I use a base coat occasionally, then 2 coats polish, plus a top coat -- the usual, in other words.</li>
            <li> I believe I got a bad batch, because most of the pads in each container are dried out!</li>
            <li> My only complaint, is if you wear dark polish, you need one sheet per nail -</li>
            <li> I use a base coat, a minimum of 2 coats of color and a top coat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rather than that awful smell of polish remover, the cantaloupe one smells so good it makes you want to eat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather</li>
            <li> do like to wash my hands afterward though, as there is a little residue, and it does feel a little strange using such thin pads, but I suppose you could double-up.</li>
            <li> And the chemicals seemed less harsh on my nails and hands.</li>
            <li> Other stuff in the past either takes forever to take off my polish, or it ends up destroying my nails and causing them to peel.</li>
            <li> Since they are a bit thin you might end up going through 5 at a time for all 10 fingers ( using front and back).</li>
            <li> I like the scents--they smell like jolly ranchers or other fruit-flavored candies--but if you are sensitive to artificial smells</li>
            <li> but perhaps if you don&#x27;t have problems with stiff, sore fingers</li>
            <li> no polish remaining, no strong alcohol smell.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m the first one to leave a bad review.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small price to pay to not have to deal with the smell.</li>
            <li> I also love that they don&#x27;t contain any awful cancer-causing acetone in them either.</li>
            <li> What I love about this is it does not have that awful stinky smell of liquid remover.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is kinda greasy, but that also means it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin as badly.  </li>
            <li> polish my nails at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> but you have to use at least three for both hands.</li>
            <li> For metallics I need a pad for every two fingers or so, and glitter is at least that</li>
            <li> Each pad is this and flimsy and it took me at least 10 pads or so to do just a couple of nails.</li>
            <li> These have no smell of regular polish remover which usually makes me sick.  </li>
            <li> If anyone out there uses nail art brushes, you know that using regular nail polish remover makes the bristles hard and annoying.</li>
            <li> I just used it and it&#x27;s such a step up from my stupid dollar-store acetone remover.</li>
            <li> Have yet to get polish off even ONE nail with one or two of these thin, thin pads.</li>
            <li> but the pads are thin and stick together</li>
            <li> Pads are very thin and sometimes hard to get apart.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using cotton balls and bottles of nasty smelling remover.</li>
            <li> I was immensely skeptical at the start.</li>
            <li> the pads are very thin and slippery</li>
            <li> The pads are very thin and cling to one another meaning that it requires you to peel them off</li>
            <li> I give myself a weekly manicure that consists of: Nail Envy strengthener, sometimes (but not always) a base coat, 2 coats of polish/lacquer, sometimes (but not always)</li>

            <li> These work so great!!! I love them! They smell awesome!! I only need about 3 and it takes off my polish on my nails!! Definitely will buy again when I run out! It&#x27;s a most have now! ❤️</li>
            <li> Instead of the 6 we got three.and all of them watermelon. What a rip off</li>
            <li> LA Colors Nail Polish Remover Pads are excellent.  Has a wonderful smell and removes the&lt;br /&gt;polish very quickly. You only need to use (2) pads at the most which will remove&lt;br /&gt;the polish for 10 fingernails. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice nail polish remover.  Gentler then others I have tried, and definitely smells better than the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> these smell SO AMAZING. I just want to eat them.</li>
            <li> i had no idea, even after reading the five star reviews, that these would work as well and smell as well as touted.  But they do and do.  i would  highly recommend.  well worth the little extra cost.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING! They smell fantastic, leave your hands almost feeling moisturized rather than really dry like nail polish remover, and I only had to use (2) wipes, normally I use at least 2-4 cotton balls. The size is perfect - I have one in my bathroom, desk drawer at the office and one in my purse! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving in your car during summer they could dry out. Highly recommend these, great gift idea too!</li>
            <li> I really do not recommend these. They are incredibly greasy and disintegrate in your hands. They do smell incredible, however. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I will never go back to using cotton balls and bottles of nasty smelling remover. LA Colors Nail Polish Remover Pads are so easy to use. And they smell good too! I gladly purchased a 6 pack because I know I&#x27;ll use every single one with joy. They make the process quick and painless.</li>
            <li> Have yet to get polish off even ONE nail with one or two of these thin, thin pads. How can everyone/anyone be so excited about them? Especially at this price!!! I use a base coat occasionally, then 2 coats polish, plus a top coat -- the usual, in other words. These are DUDS. I purchased them based on customer reviews, and now I honestly wonder...</li>
            <li> while this doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the more common polish remover pads, it does a good job for the price.&lt;br /&gt;like other reviewers have said, the pads are oily but for me, that was actually nice.  regular polish remover tends to dry out my hands and cuticles.  the pads are very thin and slippery and I found them to work best when folded in half.&lt;br /&gt;I polish my nails at least once a week.  I use a base coat, a minimum of 2 coats of color and a top coat.  It took 2 of these pads to remove all the polish from one hand, and then an additional pad to go back over the surrounding skin and remove any smeared color (one pad for BOTH hands).&lt;br /&gt;while I will still use my old fashioned cotton ball and bottle of non acetone polish remover, these pads now have a home in my nail polish case for the times I do my nails on the go.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it&#x27;s very oily. And also, have to use a lot of pads to remove the nail polish as it&#x27;s not that effective.</li>
            <li> Good pads. Put them in a mani-pedi gift basket and it was a nit.</li>
            <li> Love the scents on these.</li>
            <li> The scents are much nicer than traditional polish remover. I use these at home, too. I wear light polish so it only takes a few to remove it.</li>
            <li> These work great! Plus it smells great! I bought for my daughter, so no harsh smell. Although I wish it was made in the USA!</li>
            <li> I received a 3 pack of the same scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. While it is a little oily, I only use one sheet per hand then one to clean it up. The oiliness washes right off. Works way better and is more convenient than polish remover and much less harsh on my nails! I love these!</li>
            <li> I can use these at work and no one can smell the nail polish remover smell.  If i was home I would use regular nail polish remover but this is perfect if you don&#x27;t want that strong remover smell.</li>
            <li> I am going to leave the same review for these pads as I did for [[ASIN:B007TXSIYQ LOT 24 KleanColor Wizard Pads Display Box Nail Polish Remover Cuticle Oil Clean]] because even though they are different manufacturers I had the same results from both.  Maybe it&#x27;s me.  It&#x27;s hard to understand how so many stellar reviews can be wrong and I&#x27;m right.  Here is my 2 cents just the same:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I&#x27;m the first one to leave a bad review. I rely on reviews quite a bit when I make a purchase of something new. So please read the details of my specific use of the products and take it into consideration if it sounds similar to yours:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Smells a lot better than acetone on a cotton round (my normal method)&lt;br /&gt; - The cuticle oil is very nice. Does not leave my nails/cuticles feeling dry like normal acetone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Doesn&#x27;t take off nail polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. I don&#x27;t know what kind of polish the other reviewers use. I use OPI, Nubar, or China Glaze. I give myself a weekly manicure that consists of: Nail Envy strengthener, sometimes (but not always) a base coat, 2 coats of polish/lacquer, sometimes (but not always) an embellishment (glitter, crackle, etc.) and then 1-2 coats of Nubar Diamonte or Seche Vite top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little rounds will ultimately get through all of it, but I have to hold it on, rub, scrub, scrape....and pretty much use 2-3 (or more) rounds per nail. And as the kids say now \\&quot;Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for dat!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like them so much. They are convenient (if they worked), portable, and have a pleasant aroma. Since they seem to work for others so well, I&#x27;ll probably give them to some of the ladies at work.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea to take in your purse or for traveling. There are 32 pads in each container. They say you only need one pad, but I needed 4-5 to remove heavy, dark polish. The smell is great (the pear was really yummy smelling). This is an oily remover, so you&#x27;ll need to wash your hands after using it, and I wouldn&#x27;t use it to prep your nails prior to polishing. I used them at work (with the boss&#x27; blessing, lol) and everyone who came by my desk asked, &amp;#34;What smells so good?&amp;#34; This won&#x27;t replace your regular remover, but is a definite accessory!</li>
            <li> these little things work like magic. super easy for on the go. i keep one in my purse, one at the office and another in my car!</li>
            <li> Much better than traditional acetone bottle which spills and smells bad.</li>
            <li> Takes off even the toughest polish.</li>
            <li> These do require a little more rubbing than acetone, but I can usually get all the polish off both hands with 1-2 pads. I love how convenient they are to toss in your purse--otherwise I would end up damaging my nails by peeling the polish off. My nails and cuticles do feel more moisturized when using these; I think there&#x27;s oil in them. I like the scents--they smell like jolly ranchers or other fruit-flavored candies--but if you are sensitive to artificial smells these might not be for you.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these polish remover pads after using the more expensive Cutex brand (and their Equate equivalent). These pads are flimsy and messy and don&#x27;t easily remove my polish. The smell is quite appealing, however, and much better than the brands I&#x27;ve used in the past. And the chemicals seemed less harsh on my nails and hands. But due to their ineffectiveness, I will be returning to the stronger, larger, and better polish remover pads I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is the BEST nail polish remover I have ever had.  The fragrances are wonderful.  The remover works fantastically.  Fantastic size to store, carry in a purse, even a pocket if need be.  I use them after receiving one as a gift.  This Christmas I added them as &amp;#34;stocking stuffers.&amp;#34;  Great quality</li>
            <li> I love these! Not only do they smell good but they also feel nice on your nails and do not dry out your cuticles. They also arrived quickly!!</li>
            <li> Work very well.  Nice fragrances.  Easy for travel, too.</li>
            <li> These were odor snd alcohol free. I was able to remove polish on multiple nails with one pad,about the size of a silver dollar. I only have use of my right hand and these were amazing!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to receive nail polish remover pads, as it says. But instead I got 6 nail polish bottles that I won´t use. Very unsatisfied, as I got a different product than the one I paid for, waste of money.</li>
            <li> These pads don&#x27;t work that well.  It takes a minimum of three to remove even one coat of polish from my nails.  However, they aren&#x27;t stinky so they&#x27;re good to keep in the office for those days when you just have to get the chipped polish off your nails.</li>
            <li> These pads smell amazing, absolutely NO hint of acetone or anything whatsoever. As for actually removing polish, I&#x27;ve found I needed to use 3-5 pads to fully remove all the nail polish on my hands. It has an oily feel and does require a good amount of rubbing to get the polish off (especially if you have a good amount on) plus the size of the pads are small hence the need to use multiple pads.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these aren&#x27;t everywhere!  Went to the drugstore (major chain) looking for them after a co-worker introduced me to them, but they didn&#x27;t have them.  I was really surprised.  When they arrived (I had them shipped to work), I passed them out at work and we all removed our nailpolish right at our desks...no harsh smell!  It&#x27;s almost like a dry oil feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like to wash my hands afterward though, as there is a little residue, and it does feel a little strange using such thin pads, but I suppose you could double-up.</li>
            <li> These little pads don&#x27;t dry out and actually work. A pack csn last a long time and I travrl often</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! i shared with my co-worker and all found them to be fabulous. The do take off the nail polish but you have to use at least three for both hands. They smell great and very compact. I recommend these to everyone especially if you are a constant nail polish pick like myself.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  Great for travel!  Remove polish much better than acetone.  Smell wonderful!  I can&#x27;t imagine a reason to use acetone polish ever again.</li>
            <li> I just used it and it&#x27;s such a step up from my stupid dollar-store acetone remover. I actually was able to use a single pad (they&#x27;re more like wipes btw) for all ten nails- I was immensely skeptical at the start. Plus it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Snags just a little bit on glitter and leaves a light residue on fingers (easily wiped/washed off).</li>
            <li> The scents are great!  It seems to work better on non-glitter/metallic polishes, with just a regular flat polish I can easily use one pad for a whole hand.  For metallics I need a pad for every two fingers or so, and glitter is at least that and sometimes one pad per finger with a good bit of scrubbing involved.  I know non-acetone polish remover will always be less effective so I&#x27;m not counting this as a huge problem, but it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
            <li> they dont work very well</li>
            <li> I cannot believe these are not more popular and have not taken over the market of nail polish removers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a cute compact case you can carry around in your purse, keep at your desk, in your locker, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than having to buy a big bottle of remover and then buy separate cotton balls, these have individual pre-soaked pads; all in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than that awful smell of polish remover, the cantaloupe one smells so good it makes you want to eat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than drying out your nails and skin from strong toxic acetone, these actually feel oily and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-acetone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love these, I bought more right away to stick in everyone&#x27;s Christmas stocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better for a nail polish remover. I&#x27;m never going back to regular polish remover again!</li>
            <li> First, the smell is great - much better than other acetone polish removers. However, they don&#x27;t work that great for me. The individual sheets are very thin and it takes me multiple to clean off my nails. I have rheumatoid arthritis and my hands are especially affected. I bought this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use cotton balls to remove polish but I am almost having more trouble using my fingers with these sheets. I have even tried to just put them on my nails and let it soak in before rubbing and it still isn&#x27;t much better. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a fan but perhaps if you don&#x27;t have problems with stiff, sore fingers you won&#x27;t mind the amount of rubbing you may have to do.</li>
            <li> Thesr are handy, portable and the container is leak proof. I carry these in my bag and they come in handy! Couldnt find them in stores suddenly and SCRAMBLED to find a stash! Smell is pleasant and one pad handles all fingers. Same for toes usually. Effective even onthe super dark colors I use on my nails. Consider these a must have.</li>
            <li> Pads are very thin and sometimes hard to get apart. However a little goes a long way - I can usually do both hands with 3 pads and even when the pad looks full of polish it still does a good job removing polish.</li>
            <li> These polish remover pads work really well - much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried - a they smell nice.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly, as described. i haven&#x27;t used them as they were part of party favors for other people but the containers looked nice.</li>
            <li> These pads smell good; the package stays closed; they smell good; and they remove nail polish. It&#x27;s true that if you are wearing several coats of polish, it takes about two pads per hand, but I have individually wrapped pads from a major cosmetics maker, and although it takes only about half as many pads, they cost about $.50 each -- much, much more than these pads. And these smell better.</li>
            <li> The pads are a bit tricky getting used to from your normal cotton ball and acetone. The pads are very thin and cling to one another meaning that it requires you to peel them off or you&#x27;ll end up using up to 3 at a time.I have never used anything acetone free so this was a first and i can say first off the smell is very pleasant ( so far ive only opened the pear scented one ). My first time using it was with light mint colored nail polish, at first it seemed to work, but its VERY oily. The nail polish from my nails mixed with the oils from the pad leaked all over my hands. Maybe since this is my first time im not very handy at it? Overall i ended up going back to the acetone and cotton ball to clean up the messy nail polish/oil residue. Since they are a bit thin you might end up going through 5 at a time for all 10 fingers ( using front and back). The concept is nice and the smell is great. Again VERY oily but its nice and compact so far looks very purse friendly ( just make sure the lid is tightly screwed) and nail friendly. Dont know if i will buy again after im done with all six. Well see</li>
            <li> These work better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried on my nails! Other stuff in the past either takes forever to take off my polish, or it ends up destroying my nails and causing them to peel. These LA Colors remover pads are amazing for me because they are slightly oily and leave my nails feeling soft and silky while still peeling off the nail polish in a timely manner.  No damage to my nails, no polish remaining, no strong alcohol smell.  Just fruity soda-pop fragrances that really work. I love these things! I apply a base coat, 2-3 coats of polish, and then a top coat and these pads remove everything pretty easily.  I&#x27;ve even used them to remove stubborn glitter polishes. I would definitely recommend these polish remover pads to anyone looking to pamper their nails.</li>
            <li> These are great!! If you can&#x27;t stand the smell of nail polish remover, you really need to try these. My only complaint, is if you wear dark polish, you need one sheet per nail - but that&#x27;s a small price to pay to not have to deal with the smell. You can even remove the polish at work and no one would know.</li>
            <li> I really like these pads and I can easily do all 10 nails with one pad.  The only problem is that it is kinda greasy, but that also means it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin as badly.  I like them and the little containers are cute!</li>
            <li> I hate I am almost done with this pack but I love the smell and the oil that it provides to my nails</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE these so much! I buy them at the dollar store all the time and they smell soo great. You could sell me anything if it smelled like the melon scent! They are NOT drying at all and work really well! I also love that they don&#x27;t contain any awful cancer-causing acetone in them either. Will always repurchase.</li>
            <li> Fun but not efficient. I enjoy the fresh clean scents but they leave so much behind. I&#x27;m spoiled by harmful acetone based removers and their quickness.  I know this is better for me but the pads are thin and stick together and it take so much work. But I&#x27;ve only used two tins so bear with me. It may be great if you&#x27;re used to acetone free removers. Smell sure is better than chemical heavy stuff.</li>
            <li> these are great.  very tiny but takes nail polish off nicely and smells even better.  super great deal.</li>
            <li> There easy to use, smell great and make skin and nails seem soft, Instead of chemically! Loved them will continue to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my 7 year old daughter loved them and I was okay with her using them because they are harsh oder free.</li>
            <li> These smell very nice, but they have not worked at all to remove my nail polish.</li>
            <li> Made a great stocking stuffer for my sister. She was very happy with the smells and while I haven&#x27;t seen her use them I have heard no complains about their efficacy.</li>
            <li> I believe I got a bad batch, because most of the pads in each container are dried out!</li>
            <li> great product well packaged will do business again thanks</li>
            <li> Ok very oily. Not drying.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  First of all, if you travel anywhere you sure don&#x27;t want to carry a bottle of polish remover with you.  What I love about this is it does not have that awful stinky smell of liquid remover.  I was amazed at how the pads smell exactly like the fruit.  They remove polish effectively and yet are very gentle on your skin.  I always pack one in my suitcase when I travel.  Highly recommend this to anyone using nail polish.</li>
            <li> These have no smell of regular polish remover which usually makes me sick.  They smell great and they work just well, but they do feel oily which may be so tha it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate since this is a Christmas Present and has not yet been given.</li>
            <li> Pads smell nice, not too fruity, but they lack any sort of texture making it very difficult to remove polish. I usually do a base coat, 2x color, and a top coat in salon-quality brands like OPI on my fingers and toes, and I had to use three pads just to get all of the polish off of one big toe! The pads just kind of disintegrate as you use them. They are inexpensive, gentler on the nails, and eventually work, but I would probably not purchase again.</li>
            <li> we love these; they work so well! they smell so so much better than the traditional nail polish remover! thank you!</li>
            <li> These are very moisturizing to your nails and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> Love them ! Smell good , work well. The oily feel makes you feel like your nail and skin are being protected ... Soon much better than conventional liquid remover....</li>
            <li> I LOVE these scented pads.  They don&#x27;t have that offensive &amp;#34;polish remover&amp;#34; smell.  They remove the polish well and give a nice moisture treatment to the nails.</li>
            <li> you get soo many but they work really well and smell nice.</li>
            <li> These work surprisingly well and smell great!!</li>
            <li> These smell wonderful and work well.  The only difficulty I have is I often pull out more than one at a time.  I just have to separate the multiple sheet and put the unused ones back into the container.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works great.</li>
            <li> I hate to be an ass, but these suck. I got them because for the price they seemed to be the best deal, but they are not. Each pad is this and flimsy and it took me at least 10 pads or so to do just a couple of nails. I highly recommend La Fresh nails pads. I can do 5 toes with one pad and they are textured to help remove the polish more effectively.</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of curiousity.  I was looking for liquid acetone nail remover.  This was the best thing I ever did. I absolutely love how easy it removes the most stubborn nail polish and leaves the nails feeling really good.  I am now recommending it to all my clients.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing exactly what it would be like. I do nail art and have many brushes and tools that I use for nail art.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that this product does not have acetone in it so it does not have that foul nail polish remover smell, which is GREAT. You can carry it around in your purse and take it out on the go somewhere. The only downer is that it has an oily residue but comes of extremely easy under water or hand sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;Also. If anyone out there uses nail art brushes, you know that using regular nail polish remover makes the bristles hard and annoying. Wiping it off on a sheet of one of these is brilliant. it keeps the bristles soft and cleans off the excess nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, VERY happy with the purchase. Most of them smell great. (I particulary hated grape ) and the shipping was good too.&lt;br /&gt;Happy. I would recommend and will buy this again :)</li>
            <li> Love these!  Wish I would have purchased more for my daughter&#x27;s bridal shower favors and ran out of shipping time.</li>
            <li> used as cute gifts for yw and women - nice and love the easy clean on my nails too</li>
            <li> Love these they are so small and easy to carry and work great</li>
            <li> I really do the love the scents of these but I can never seem to get all 10 fingers with one pad. I usually use one pad for one or two fingers (maybe because I use darker colors or multiple top coats) but regardless, they still work and I will order again when I start to run low.</li>
