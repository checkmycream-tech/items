            <li>major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net, great deal, but they &amp;#34;expire&amp;#34; in three months.</li>
            <li>Great find for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to see that they make Vaseline in travel size containers.  </li>
            <li>Well, this is just petroleum jelly, so we win there.</li>
            <li>great price, delivered sooner than ETA</li>
            <li>There are so many for the price which is great!!  </li>
            <li>Great lip therapy and a really good price.</li>
            <li>I have had my challenges looking for a good chapstick to cure my lips from the dryness.  </li>
            <li>A lot comes in the package, which is good for me since now</li>
            <li>Everything else is about as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li>Good buy, lots of tubes.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to shea butter, cocoa butter and beeswax so finding something that I can use on my lips is very challenging.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping, excellent packaging.</li>
            <li>&#x27;love the vaseline lip therapy!  </li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm on the market!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Make sure you inquire about the expiration date before you purchase this item!</li>
            <li>Glad to find a dozen!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product in and of itself.</li>
            <li>It is so inexpensive and amazing.</li>
            <li>This was a great way to get 12, at a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff.  </li>
            <li>So wash your lips with a warm paper towel, do not scrub</li>
            <li>It moisturizes nicely and immediately restores moisture to my lips when I haven&#x27;t applied lip balm in a while.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for a glossy finish over lipstick or a nice glisten on natural lips!  </li>
            <li>Good product and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with my Vasaline lip stuff!</li>
            <li>it has a very nice, mild scent, which is almost unnoticeable and therefore does not irritate your lips.</li>
            <li>great job vaseline, for a consistent &amp; reliable product!  </li>
            <li>perfect if you have sensitive skin and lips.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy a large quantity at a very good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this lip balm I thought it was great.</li>
            <li>It feels very smooth on your lips and evenly distributes the product.</li>
            <li>I was so glad  to see that Amazon had the Vaseline Lip Therapy Tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many year</li>
            <li>so I could toss it when I got better.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a better deal</li>
            <li>After weeks of use I noticed my lips were burning and more chapped</li>
            <li>and my lips have healed up and are much better now.</li>
            <li>I love this lipgloss :)</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my lips, and sometimes my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>They work much better thwn any chapstic or carmex.</li>
            <li>I do believe there are better lip balms out there that are specifically made to add moisturizer to the lips</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over 20 years and have never found anything better.</li>
            <li>If only it had SPF it would be perfect!</li>
            <li>They changed the packages many years ago</li>
            <li>So if an accutane patient tells you a lip product works, TRUST THEM! :)</li>
            <li>I love the price.</li>
            <li>Well, it is Vaseline, so what more is there to say?</li>
            <li>I always apply my &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; lipgloss on top, i.e. Burts Bees.</li>
            <li>Please keep and keep cheap amazon!</li>
            <li>my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love these, no flavor which I like</li>
            <li>You never know when something might be discontinued and as this is my favorite healing &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;, I have learned to stock up.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I (and some people I know) have been using it for years, and still love it.</li>
            <li>Love these, use them all the time.  </li>
            <li>I tried 2 to start with and love them.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Vaseline Lip Therapy and love how my lips always feel hydrated and look shiny too.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about buying any more for awhile.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It easily fits into my pocket or purse and applies very clean and easy!</li>
            <li>they fit in my jean pocket easily!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for lips, and doesn&#x27;t dry them out.  </li>
            <li>I love having so many available</li>
            <li>My mom and husband both of very dry cracked lips and this is one of the products that still work the best.</li>
            <li>My lips seem to dry out easily and vaseline works the best on them.  </li>
            <li>The formula is relatively light, so it does require more reapplications than Aquaphor (which is the recommended lip treatment for accutane patients).</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want flavored lip balm that makes me lick it off more quickly and use more.</li>
            <li>and then when I squeeze extra out to get a good layer on the lips it does not flow well across the skin - clumping!  </li>
            <li>These are not always easy to find in drugstores</li>
            <li>They arrived with a very quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I keep these in my jacket and briefcase pockets for easy and discrete</li>
            <li>Unlike Carmex, this product does not have that strong menthol taste and smell some people dislike.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, absorbs quickly, and keeps your lips moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>this product really should remind us all that just because it&#x27;s not the most cute or most fancy packaging</li>
            <li>It is very mild and free of added scents and flavors.</li>
            <li>So since I use Vaseline, I am fine.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect little package to carry around a bit of vaseline with you.  </li>
            <li>product is pretty decent on its own; and amazing if you factor in the price.</li>
            <li>In one day it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>, flake free lips was here all along.</li>
            <li>Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Formula</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Original Review on January 6, 2011.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I found this, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>Comes on the original sealed display cards.</li>
            <li>purchased for my wife , she prefers this version to original lip therapy</li>
            <li>think the tube type is clean to use.</li>
            <li>A good product; it stays and help on cracked lips better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and am very satisfied, it keeps my lips from chafing in the very dry climate of Arizona</li>
            <li>No noticeable smell and makes lips better fast.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about Vaseline Lip Therapy.</li>
            <li>is the only reliable treatment I have found, superior to the waxy chap sticks found in the grocery stores.</li>
            <li>Vaseline is seriously the best thing to use for your lips.  </li>
            <li>I used to go through Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm really quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been able to find this at my Walmart for 92 cents, which is kind of unbelievable since it&#x27;s such a great product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this stuff is so hard to find in local stores, but this is a great deal on a great lanolin-free lip balm.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely smooth and kissable ;)</li>
            <li>I love the round tip more than those angled tips that you find in most lip treatments.</li>
            <li>The right product at the right price!</li>
            <li>She makes sure to have one with her at pretty much at all times.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easy to use</li>
            <li>It came on time and this is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>these little tubes are great for carrying with you.</li>
            <li>Very good product; used daily, never have a problem with over dryness--which is a regular problem for me when not using it.</li>
            <li>These are handy to keep at my desk at work; in my purse; next to my bed; everywhere...  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that the Vaseline chap stick is the only kind that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>totally worth it</li>
            <li>I really love this and am glad I can buy them for this price as this particular kind has been hard to find.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because Vaseline appears to be discontinuing the product, and I won&#x27;t be able to find something easily to use in dry weather.  </li>
            <li>It comes right off -</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is better for your lips then carmex since seems more harsh and actually causes your lips to peel more often.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips moisturized, it&#x27;s cheap, and I think it works better than any other type of lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So this particular product is a dream comes true for me as I can apply it whenever and wherever I need to.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to have to trade in my old Softlips for Vaseline Advanced Lip</li>
            <li>I have wayyyy too much!</li>
            <li>only to find my lips even more chapped than before and a urge to reapply the balm every 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also keep an extra on hand for guests in need, &#x27;cause this is one item you sure don&#x27;t want to share.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Much better price than Chapstick and does the same thing.</li>
            <li>It is quite a bit more expensive but it truly is a fantastic product! :)</li>
            <li>.. love it &amp; would buy again next year</li>
            <li>I got this type of lip balm because many sources (e.g. Mayo Clinic) have found that most lip balm brands include various agents that actually cause chapped lips!</li>
            <li>My lip is usually dried, but it makes me keep good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sure enough, as soon as I stopped using lip balms and switched to pure petroleum jelly, acne around my lips practically disappeared.</li>
            <li>not convinced that I like the container the way it works, I tend to think that I don&#x27;t have enough and squeeze for more, and as a result I end up with too much on my lips.</li>
            <li>I loved the product so much, I continued to use it all spring as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it is a safe product to use in the long term.</li>
            <li>Really great for those with allergies to other stuff, these are pure white pj, in a very convenient package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very decent lip treatment.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better for dry winter lips.  </li>
            <li>An inner jacket pocket and pants pockets have worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks again amazon.</li>
            <li>but I really do prefer to buy the lip balms that slide up when you twist them.</li>
            <li>but this still didn&#x27;t work as much, so</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I lose chap-stick and ordering this much has helped me to always have some around.</li>
            <li>They arrived very promptly, as well.</li>
            <li>She says it keeps her lips very well moisturized.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so much easier to carry around than a jar.</li>
            <li>and it works much longer than any lip balm Ive used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really just petrolium jelly, so I don&#x27;t know if it really can expire of</li>
            <li>Thanks to Paula&#x27;s Choice</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone and also the supplier is very responsive in his filling orders.  </li>
            <li>Would love to have uv protection in them but am not aware of a uv version yet.</li>
            <li>These usually cost between $2 and $3 individually in a store, so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended using Vaseline because it doesn&#x27;t have any active drying ingredients like most balms and chapsticks do.</li>
            <li>Although it does not smell that great (actually, doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all), I find myself continuing to use it every single day and have gone through numerous tubes.</li>
            <li>I cannot find Vaseline Lip therapy in the stores any more, it is real frustrating, so I am so glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li>Great product and hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive lips and have allergic reactions to all lipstick, lip gloss and other lip products ( i tried sooooo many kinds).</li>
            <li>There is a tiny hole at the very top of the half circle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I swear by this stuff since high school.</li>
            <li>It keeps your lips soft and works much better than chap stick or any of those other over priced products.</li>
            <li>Normally I would never want to use a petroleum based product but in this case I felt like I had no choice.</li>
            <li>Also, When the tips of my fingers get dry from cleaning dishes, I apply this too and by the next morning, it&#x27;s soft and smooth again!</li>
            <li>The tube itself feels a bit flimsy, because the plastic they use to make the tube is very soft.</li>
            <li>I guess the jelly couldn&#x27;t go through the small hole at the top</li>
            <li>I bought a box, threw out all the old ones, and replaced them with new.</li>
            <li>For those of us who cannot use any kind of lip protection other than lipstick due to an allergy to bees and beeswax, this is the answer.  </li>
            <li>This pure Vaseline is the only lip balm I&#x27;ve found that helps.</li>
            <li>It feels like each time I push the tube in that I&#x27;m either not getting ANY, getting too little and push more, or all the sudden</li>
            <li>Love these - hard to find.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time keeping lips smooth in winter until I found this!</li>
            <li>and I needed to apply the vaseline lip balm frequently.</li>
            <li>I developed cracked lips on the outer part of my mouth at the corners and nothing worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Mentholatum Natural Ice Medicated Lip Protectant SPF 15, Mentholatum 0.16-Ounce</li>
            <li>Fast, simple, and hassle-free business!</li>
            <li>I frequently use this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my lips</li>
            <li>Leaves your lips soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>So I stopped using this Vaseline Lip Therapy with moisturizers advanced formula and used  plain old petroleum jelly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a positive addiction for me, not just daily or for specific chapped lips, but all the time.&lt;br /&gt;LW</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hypoallergenic and it really works to keep my lips from chapping all year long</li>
            <li>It really helps dry lips.</li>
            <li>(usually they make it through as long as the top is screwed on and they stay in the pants pocket)  </li>
            <li>I had some trouble when pregnant with the fruity stuff you buy in the grocery store check out lanes.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing I can use so far and so bought a 12 pack!</li>
            <li>Yes, it is twice as expensive but MUCH, MUCH better!</li>
            <li>My lips get dry really easily year round.</li>
            <li>No other product, and I&#x27;ve tried every conceivable lip balm, is its equal.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I think the soft tube also leads to over-application, since a tiny squeeze can displace A LOT of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started putting regular old vaseline on it</li>
            <li>Yes, you can say she simply shouldn&#x27;t apply lip balms elsewhere than directly to the lips</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this product for years and years to come, as it has left my lips soft, moisturized and kissable!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard many people (including myself) say that they are &#x27;addicted&#x27; to their lip balm.</li>
            <li>I still have these little guys laying around the house for my quick spots like next to the bed, in the bathroom and one on my desk at work in case I forget to bring the sliding tube lip</li>
            <li>Much prefer the mentha extreme from BBB in the mall.  </li>
            <li>This feels very natural and keeps our dry lips moist.  </li>
            <li>The most recent and terribly cold winter weather left my lips very chapped.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited when I found out they made them in little tubes for me to carry in my purse vs me carrying around a small tub of vasaline.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the squeeze tube is much cleaner than the little tubs of it that requires you to dip your finger in the lip balm to apply it.</li>
            <li>Buying a 12 pack may seem like a little much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net, great deal, but they &amp;#34;expire&amp;#34; in three months.</li>
            <li> Great find for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to see that they make Vaseline in travel size containers.  </li>
            <li> Well, this is just petroleum jelly, so we win there.</li>
            <li> great price, delivered sooner than ETA</li>
            <li> There are so many for the price which is great!!  </li>
            <li> Great lip therapy and a really good price.</li>
            <li> I have had my challenges looking for a good chapstick to cure my lips from the dryness.  </li>
            <li> A lot comes in the package, which is good for me since now</li>
            <li> Everything else is about as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Good buy, lots of tubes.</li>

            <li> The item was shipped nicely/reasonably and all arrived in good condition.</li>

            <li> Received my order quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to shea butter, cocoa butter and beeswax so finding something that I can use on my lips is very challenging.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping, excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> &#x27;love the vaseline lip therapy!  </li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm on the market!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Make sure you inquire about the expiration date before you purchase this item!</li>
            <li> Glad to find a dozen!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product in and of itself.</li>
            <li> It is so inexpensive and amazing.</li>
            <li> This was a great way to get 12, at a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff.  </li>
            <li> So wash your lips with a warm paper towel, do not scrub</li>
            <li> It moisturizes nicely and immediately restores moisture to my lips when I haven&#x27;t applied lip balm in a while.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for a glossy finish over lipstick or a nice glisten on natural lips!  </li>
            <li> Good product and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with my Vasaline lip stuff!</li>
            <li> it has a very nice, mild scent, which is almost unnoticeable and therefore does not irritate your lips.</li>
            <li> great job vaseline, for a consistent &amp; reliable product!  </li>
            <li> perfect if you have sensitive skin and lips.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy a large quantity at a very good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this lip balm I thought it was great.</li>
            <li> It feels very smooth on your lips and evenly distributes the product.</li>
            <li> I was so glad  to see that Amazon had the Vaseline Lip Therapy Tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many year</li>
            <li> so I could toss it when I got better.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better deal</li>
            <li> After weeks of use I noticed my lips were burning and more chapped</li>
            <li> and my lips have healed up and are much better now.</li>
            <li> I love this lipgloss :)</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my lips, and sometimes my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> They work much better thwn any chapstic or carmex.</li>
            <li> I do believe there are better lip balms out there that are specifically made to add moisturizer to the lips</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 20 years and have never found anything better.</li>
            <li> If only it had SPF it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> They changed the packages many years ago</li>
            <li> So if an accutane patient tells you a lip product works, TRUST THEM! :)</li>
            <li> I love the price.</li>
            <li> Well, it is Vaseline, so what more is there to say?</li>
            <li> I always apply my &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; lipgloss on top, i.e. Burts Bees.</li>
            <li> Please keep and keep cheap amazon!</li>
            <li> my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love these, no flavor which I like</li>
            <li> You never know when something might be discontinued and as this is my favorite healing &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;, I have learned to stock up.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I (and some people I know) have been using it for years, and still love it.</li>
            <li> Love these, use them all the time.  </li>
            <li> I tried 2 to start with and love them.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Vaseline Lip Therapy and love how my lips always feel hydrated and look shiny too.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about buying any more for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It easily fits into my pocket or purse and applies very clean and easy!</li>
            <li> they fit in my jean pocket easily!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for lips, and doesn&#x27;t dry them out.  </li>
            <li> I love having so many available</li>
            <li> My mom and husband both of very dry cracked lips and this is one of the products that still work the best.</li>
            <li> My lips seem to dry out easily and vaseline works the best on them.  </li>
            <li> The formula is relatively light, so it does require more reapplications than Aquaphor (which is the recommended lip treatment for accutane patients).</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want flavored lip balm that makes me lick it off more quickly and use more.</li>
            <li> and then when I squeeze extra out to get a good layer on the lips it does not flow well across the skin - clumping!  </li>
            <li> These are not always easy to find in drugstores</li>
            <li> They arrived with a very quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> I keep these in my jacket and briefcase pockets for easy and discrete</li>
            <li> Unlike Carmex, this product does not have that strong menthol taste and smell some people dislike.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, absorbs quickly, and keeps your lips moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> this product really should remind us all that just because it&#x27;s not the most cute or most fancy packaging</li>
            <li> It is very mild and free of added scents and flavors.</li>
            <li> So since I use Vaseline, I am fine.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little package to carry around a bit of vaseline with you.  </li>
            <li> product is pretty decent on its own; and amazing if you factor in the price.</li>
            <li> In one day it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> , flake free lips was here all along.</li>
            <li> Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Formula</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Original Review on January 6, 2011.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I found this, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> Comes on the original sealed display cards.</li>
            <li> purchased for my wife , she prefers this version to original lip therapy</li>
            <li> think the tube type is clean to use.</li>
            <li> A good product; it stays and help on cracked lips better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and am very satisfied, it keeps my lips from chafing in the very dry climate of Arizona</li>
            <li> No noticeable smell and makes lips better fast.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Vaseline Lip Therapy.</li>
            <li> is the only reliable treatment I have found, superior to the waxy chap sticks found in the grocery stores.</li>
            <li> Vaseline is seriously the best thing to use for your lips.  </li>
            <li> I used to go through Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm really quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been able to find this at my Walmart for 92 cents, which is kind of unbelievable since it&#x27;s such a great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this stuff is so hard to find in local stores, but this is a great deal on a great lanolin-free lip balm.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely smooth and kissable ;)</li>
            <li> I love the round tip more than those angled tips that you find in most lip treatments.</li>
            <li> The right product at the right price!</li>
            <li> She makes sure to have one with her at pretty much at all times.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy to use</li>
            <li> It came on time and this is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> these little tubes are great for carrying with you.</li>
            <li> Very good product; used daily, never have a problem with over dryness--which is a regular problem for me when not using it.</li>
            <li> These are handy to keep at my desk at work; in my purse; next to my bed; everywhere...  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that the Vaseline chap stick is the only kind that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> totally worth it</li>
            <li> I really love this and am glad I can buy them for this price as this particular kind has been hard to find.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Vaseline appears to be discontinuing the product, and I won&#x27;t be able to find something easily to use in dry weather.  </li>
            <li> It comes right off -</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is better for your lips then carmex since seems more harsh and actually causes your lips to peel more often.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips moisturized, it&#x27;s cheap, and I think it works better than any other type of lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So this particular product is a dream comes true for me as I can apply it whenever and wherever I need to.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to have to trade in my old Softlips for Vaseline Advanced Lip</li>
            <li> I have wayyyy too much!</li>
            <li> only to find my lips even more chapped than before and a urge to reapply the balm every 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also keep an extra on hand for guests in need, &#x27;cause this is one item you sure don&#x27;t want to share.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Much better price than Chapstick and does the same thing.</li>
            <li> It is quite a bit more expensive but it truly is a fantastic product! :)</li>
            <li> .. love it &amp; would buy again next year</li>
            <li> I got this type of lip balm because many sources (e.g. Mayo Clinic) have found that most lip balm brands include various agents that actually cause chapped lips!</li>
            <li> My lip is usually dried, but it makes me keep good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sure enough, as soon as I stopped using lip balms and switched to pure petroleum jelly, acne around my lips practically disappeared.</li>
            <li> not convinced that I like the container the way it works, I tend to think that I don&#x27;t have enough and squeeze for more, and as a result I end up with too much on my lips.</li>
            <li> I loved the product so much, I continued to use it all spring as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it is a safe product to use in the long term.</li>
            <li> Really great for those with allergies to other stuff, these are pure white pj, in a very convenient package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very decent lip treatment.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better for dry winter lips.  </li>
            <li> An inner jacket pocket and pants pockets have worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks again amazon.</li>
            <li> but I really do prefer to buy the lip balms that slide up when you twist them.</li>
            <li> but this still didn&#x27;t work as much, so</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I lose chap-stick and ordering this much has helped me to always have some around.</li>
            <li> They arrived very promptly, as well.</li>
            <li> She says it keeps her lips very well moisturized.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so much easier to carry around than a jar.</li>
            <li> and it works much longer than any lip balm Ive used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really just petrolium jelly, so I don&#x27;t know if it really can expire of</li>
            <li> Thanks to Paula&#x27;s Choice</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone and also the supplier is very responsive in his filling orders.  </li>
            <li> Would love to have uv protection in them but am not aware of a uv version yet.</li>
            <li> These usually cost between $2 and $3 individually in a store, so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended using Vaseline because it doesn&#x27;t have any active drying ingredients like most balms and chapsticks do.</li>
            <li> Although it does not smell that great (actually, doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all), I find myself continuing to use it every single day and have gone through numerous tubes.</li>
            <li> I cannot find Vaseline Lip therapy in the stores any more, it is real frustrating, so I am so glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> Great product and hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive lips and have allergic reactions to all lipstick, lip gloss and other lip products ( i tried sooooo many kinds).</li>
            <li> There is a tiny hole at the very top of the half circle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff since high school.</li>
            <li> It keeps your lips soft and works much better than chap stick or any of those other over priced products.</li>
            <li> Normally I would never want to use a petroleum based product but in this case I felt like I had no choice.</li>
            <li> Also, When the tips of my fingers get dry from cleaning dishes, I apply this too and by the next morning, it&#x27;s soft and smooth again!</li>
            <li> The tube itself feels a bit flimsy, because the plastic they use to make the tube is very soft.</li>
            <li> I guess the jelly couldn&#x27;t go through the small hole at the top</li>
            <li> I bought a box, threw out all the old ones, and replaced them with new.</li>
            <li> For those of us who cannot use any kind of lip protection other than lipstick due to an allergy to bees and beeswax, this is the answer.  </li>
            <li> This pure Vaseline is the only lip balm I&#x27;ve found that helps.</li>
            <li> It feels like each time I push the tube in that I&#x27;m either not getting ANY, getting too little and push more, or all the sudden</li>
            <li> Love these - hard to find.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time keeping lips smooth in winter until I found this!</li>
            <li> and I needed to apply the vaseline lip balm frequently.</li>
            <li> I developed cracked lips on the outer part of my mouth at the corners and nothing worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Mentholatum Natural Ice Medicated Lip Protectant SPF 15, Mentholatum 0.16-Ounce</li>
            <li> Fast, simple, and hassle-free business!</li>
            <li> I frequently use this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my lips</li>
            <li> Leaves your lips soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> So I stopped using this Vaseline Lip Therapy with moisturizers advanced formula and used  plain old petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a positive addiction for me, not just daily or for specific chapped lips, but all the time.&lt;br /&gt;LW</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hypoallergenic and it really works to keep my lips from chapping all year long</li>
            <li> It really helps dry lips.</li>
            <li> (usually they make it through as long as the top is screwed on and they stay in the pants pocket)  </li>
            <li> I had some trouble when pregnant with the fruity stuff you buy in the grocery store check out lanes.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I can use so far and so bought a 12 pack!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is twice as expensive but MUCH, MUCH better!</li>
            <li> My lips get dry really easily year round.</li>
            <li> No other product, and I&#x27;ve tried every conceivable lip balm, is its equal.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think the soft tube also leads to over-application, since a tiny squeeze can displace A LOT of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started putting regular old vaseline on it</li>
            <li> Yes, you can say she simply shouldn&#x27;t apply lip balms elsewhere than directly to the lips</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this product for years and years to come, as it has left my lips soft, moisturized and kissable!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many people (including myself) say that they are &#x27;addicted&#x27; to their lip balm.</li>
            <li> I still have these little guys laying around the house for my quick spots like next to the bed, in the bathroom and one on my desk at work in case I forget to bring the sliding tube lip</li>
            <li> Much prefer the mentha extreme from BBB in the mall.  </li>
            <li> This feels very natural and keeps our dry lips moist.  </li>
            <li> The most recent and terribly cold winter weather left my lips very chapped.</li>
            <li> so I was very excited when I found out they made them in little tubes for me to carry in my purse vs me carrying around a small tub of vasaline.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the squeeze tube is much cleaner than the little tubs of it that requires you to dip your finger in the lip balm to apply it.</li>
            <li> Buying a 12 pack may seem like a little much</li>
            <li> glides on smooth, doesn&#x27;t taste that bad, lasts long and when it finally &#x27;dries&#x27; i totally feel as though it was absorbed into my lips</li>
            <li> I swear, some people complain about having dry lips when they&#x27;re really just slightly dehydrated.</li>
            <li> Every lip balm out there seems to have one thing or another that I react too, even aloe and other ingredients for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a lot easier to apply and lug around than a small container of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Long lasting with no chalky feeling at all.</li>
            <li> These tubes last a long time.</li>
            <li> I began using this roughly 1.5 years ago and, although I had been looking for something that smelled fruity and girly, I ultimately find myself constantly coming back to this product.</li>
            <li> I kept getting really dry red marks on the corners of my lips and no matter what I used it wouldn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> who is not only not capable of shipping in a reasonable amount of time, but ships the thin Vaseline carton in the soft paper envelope by US Mail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is a little more expensive on Amazon than I bought it at the local Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve had very chapped and cracked lips</li>
            <li> The taste is neutral and not strange, should you accidentally swallow a bit, with the texture you would expect from other Vaseline products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am a long time fan of vaseline lip therapy~i&#x27;ve been using it for years!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 12 pack of vaseline lip therapy because I could no longer find it at wal-mart and other such places in my area.  </li>
            <li> My dry winter lips get relief with this product.</li>
            <li> the stuff becomes more or less solid at cold temperatures.</li>
            <li> , so my lips become very dry</li>
            <li> I only use it about once a week, if or when my lips are feeling a little rough and dry.  </li>
            <li> (none I can currently recommend), but this product will be what I use from now on as an everyday \\&quot;lip therapy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Of course it was crushed in the Mail.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, as you can imagine, it is not very practical to wash my hands, apply Vaseline from the jar, wash my fingers again.</li>
            <li> In the couple of months I&#x27;ve been using this, despite the extreme dryness of this polar vortex winter, my need to apply moisturizers to my lips has fallen greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only allows a small stream out at a time</li>
            <li> I do wear an SPF sunscreen if I go on the sun but other than that it&#x27;s always Vaseline lip therapy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something for my extremely chapped lips</li>
            <li> my new secret weapon.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;inactive&#x27; ingredients and mositurizers caused irritation and burning to my lips and are not so &#x27;inactive&#x27; but actively causing problems.</li>
            <li> and I was desperate for a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> At least not for me, not quick enough, and/or not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to hunt them down.</li>
            <li> I use them often to keep the dryness down.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get out once there is less than half left in the tube as well.</li>
            <li> The dry lips that come with Accutane isn&#x27;t like your ordinary chapped lips.</li>
            <li> The bottom of my first tube gave out and got greasy crap all over the place after I tried squeezing it after walking around in sub-0 temperatures with the tube in my outer jacket pocket (outside the insulation and thus exposed to the elements).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within two days my horribly chapped lips went back to their normal soft texture...</li>
            <li> I then realized I was experiencing a similar negative or allergic reaction to the ingredients too!  </li>
            <li> My father used to carry the little tubes of Vaseline in his pockets when I was little, then I started.  </li>
            <li> Towards the end of the tube it gets a little liquid-y.</li>
            <li> Buying all kinda of lip balms with little or no results.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of lip therapy like carmax and burt&#x27;s beeswax and my lips were not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Because of were it is most located I have horrible dry lips.</li>
            <li> I purchase these in bulk and find them all over the house and car, they even get washed and dried</li>
            <li> However, if you have trouble finding this in stores</li>
            <li> and i still havent even used half the pack!</li>
            <li> I have used carmex for years before I switched to just this plain vaseline</li>
            <li> The application end is a hard plastic rounded and has a little hole that you squeeze the container to get the Vaseline out and then run the plastic rounded end on your lips to apply all over.</li>
            <li> in hot or cold weather !</li>
            <li> And a 12 pack means I can give one to my husband, put one in each bathroom, and lose 9 in my purse ... which is what usually happens anyhow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep using them past this date though.</li>
            <li> I usually order a dozen of these Vaseline Lip Therapy tubes at a time.  </li>
            <li> pack of twelve was a bit excessive</li>
            <li> Helps keep my lips soft without an unpleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used another brand of lip balm until the other day I got sick and decided to pick up a different one</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in the store</li>
            <li> I ordered these, because it seems hard to find this product.  </li>
            <li> I like the Vaseline Lip Therapy pocket applicator, but they&#x27;re hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> The lip therapy in tubes is hard to find and I&#x27;ve used it for years</li>
            <li> My mom was having a hard time finding this in stores</li>
            <li> Not as addicting as Chapstick, at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Its winter, and its cold outside, my lips were visibly chapped and they hurt because I continued to \\&quot;moisturize\\&quot;</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find any other lip balm on the market that moisturizes my lips like Vaseline does.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a very expensive way to buy Vaseline - you could buy a jar for the same price.</li>
            <li> The most expensive lip color will look awful on chapped lips!</li>
            <li> I was once so desperately in pain from dry and cracked lips that I had to resort to using butter!</li>
            <li> Vaseline lip therapy advanced formula instantly eased that annoying chapped feeling and protected my lips from the dreadful winter wind chill.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product for chapped, damaged lips and skin -- aggravated by cold and wet winters.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is silly or not</li>
            <li> Duh!  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find in any drugstore.</li>
            <li> and she said she had to stop using it as it made her lips worse.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to using vasaline on my lips</li>
            <li> The bad - a little on the oily side.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a friend who was unable to find the Vaseline brand name in the tube in our area.  </li>
            <li> It has been difficult to find vaseline lip gloss in the stores, so, in case they are discontinuing the product, I purchased a couple dozen.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when this packaged arrived at my doorstep, all twelve pieces were set to expire within two months.</li>
            <li> and then the crimped bottom failed.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my lips from being chapped during the cold winter months as well.</li>
            <li> This truly heals my unhappy chapped winter lips like nothing ever has.</li>
            <li> not so cold 17 degrees !</li>
            <li> he uses them like crazy!</li>
            <li> I really hate the method in which the container distributes the lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I would warn people that if you overuse your lips with become covered with the nasty (Vaseline), coating all the time.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was so glad  to see that Amazon had the Vaseline Lip Therapy Tube. It is the only thing I use on my lips. The stores seemed to have stopped buying them, so I went to Amazon. Thanks again amazon. I do recommend this product. It keeps your lips soft and works much better than chap stick or any of those other over priced products.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff.  Not as addicting as Chapstick, at least in my opinion. I&#x27;ve used this product for many year but it&#x27;s hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> This product helps my lips from drying out. I wear oxygen which causes my mouth, lips and nose to be drier.</li>
            <li> Great product wonderful everything</li>
            <li> Original Review on January 6, 2011.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used another brand of lip balm until the other day I got sick and decided to pick up a different one so I could toss it when I got better. Its winter, and its cold outside, my lips were visibly chapped and they hurt because I continued to \\&quot;moisturize\\&quot; them by licking my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within two days my horribly chapped lips went back to their normal soft texture... My lips are happy again!! I think I&#x27;m going to have to trade in my old Softlips for Vaseline Advanced Lip Therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced that I like the container the way it works, I tend to think that I don&#x27;t have enough and squeeze for more, and as a result I end up with too much on my lips. Maybe its just a result of practice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also one of those people whom are severely allergic to... Everything! Trying to find a product that will not cause an adverse reaction is always a pain, so I&#x27;m so happy I bit the bullet and decided to pick this product up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is a little more expensive on Amazon than I bought it at the local Wal-Mart. I was hoping for a better deal so I could buy it in bulk, like 12 of them at a time! It was under a dollar for my purchase at wally world and now its approx $1.23 per item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited: February 7, 2011&lt;br /&gt;So after buying 3 tubes of this lip therapy, I still think the product is awesome, but I&#x27;ve decided I can&#x27;t stand the tubes! I never ended up getting the hang of it, and because of that specifically I&#x27;ve decided not to buy it. I&#x27;m not sure if it is silly or not but I really do prefer to buy the lip balms that slide up when you twist them. Now I&#x27;ve started using Nivea Hydrating Lip Care. It feels like each time I push the tube in that I&#x27;m either not getting ANY, getting too little and push more, or all the sudden I have wayyyy too much! I still have these little guys laying around the house for my quick spots like next to the bed, in the bathroom and one on my desk at work in case I forget to bring the sliding tube lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/11/14: I found a DIY lipbalm I started making a couple of months ago that has replaced this product.ork in case I forget to bring the sliding tube lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/11/14: I found a DIY lipbalm I started making a couple of months ago that has replaced this product.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy that limits the products I can put on my lips.  I purchased this because Vaseline appears to be discontinuing the product, and I won&#x27;t be able to find something easily to use in dry weather.  Now I&#x27;m set for years!</li>
            <li> great stuff !! in hot or cold weather ! not so cold 17 degrees ! Still works great !! Would recommend to anyone indoors or out !!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this lip balm I thought it was great. After weeks of use I noticed my lips were burning and more chapped and I needed to apply the vaseline lip balm frequently. I had given my daughter a tube and she said she had to stop using it as it made her lips worse.  Duh!  I then realized I was experiencing a similar negative or allergic reaction to the ingredients too!  So I stopped using this Vaseline Lip Therapy with moisturizers advanced formula and used  plain old petroleum jelly and my lips have healed up and are much better now. The &#x27;inactive&#x27; ingredients and mositurizers caused irritation and burning to my lips and are not so &#x27;inactive&#x27; but actively causing problems.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 10 stars, I would!! I have had my challenges looking for a good chapstick to cure my lips from the dryness.  I developed cracked lips on the outer part of my mouth at the corners and nothing worked for me.  I didn&#x27;t want to carry around a big Vaseline tub of petroleum but this still didn&#x27;t work as much, so I did a lot of research and read that Vaseline manufactures Lip Therapy tubes the size of chapsticks.  I found these on Amazon and great package for the price!! A lot comes in the package, which is good for me since now I have my family using it and it took about 2 weeks before I saw drastic results. I use this daily and during the day I use it several times.  I constantly keep my lips moist. Just as I have before but this time this product cured my dryness and cracked corners on my mouth. Overall, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Product expires in 3 months. Returned!</li>
            <li> I love this lipgloss :)</li>
            <li> The bad - a little on the oily side.  Everything else is about as good as it gets.  I choose to put it on at night just before bed.  The next day my lips stay moist all day.  I only use it about once a week, if or when my lips are feeling a little rough and dry.  The best lip therapy I&#x27;ve used.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For those of us who cannot use any kind of lip protection other than lipstick due to an allergy to bees and beeswax, this is the answer.  Good product and easy to carry around. Very hard to find in any drugstore. The 12 pac is great as you can keep them in the car and around the house.  Would love to have uv protection in them but am not aware of a uv version yet.</li>
            <li> i was a Chapstick addict. Now it&#x27;s all about these. My dry winter lips get relief with this product.</li>
            <li> &#x27;love the vaseline lip therapy!  it&#x27;s perfect for a glossy finish over lipstick or a nice glisten on natural lips!  i am a long time fan of vaseline lip therapy~i&#x27;ve been using it for years!  1 in my purse, 1 in my car, 1 in my desk and 1 always in my pocket!  great job vaseline, for a consistent &amp; reliable product!  i always know what i get with vaseline lip therapy and count on it to give my lips the softness that i want and the protection that i need!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little package to carry around a bit of vaseline with you.  I use it mostly on my lips, and sometimes my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> These are so healing. They work much better thwn any chapstic or carmex. No greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in stores anymore and was happy to find itnon Amazon. I have very sensitive lips and have allergic reactions to all lipstick, lip gloss and other lip products ( i tried sooooo many kinds). This is the only thing I can use so far and so bought a 12 pack!</li>
            <li> You never can have enough when you are looking for them. It really helps dry lips. We put one on each table, each coat pocket, etc. No need to hunt them down.</li>
            <li> Chapstick used to have petroleum jelly with a slant tip, no longer.  Would like to know about this tube before buying alot of them.</li>
            <li> this product really should remind us all that just because it&#x27;s not the most cute or most fancy packaging doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work like a charm. im out spending 5-10$ on lip colors, moisturizers, etc and the secret to baby smooth, flake free lips was here all along. glides on smooth, doesn&#x27;t taste that bad, lasts long and when it finally &#x27;dries&#x27; i totally feel as though it was absorbed into my lips cause i don&#x27;t need to keep reapplying and when i press them togeter it&#x27;s completely smooth and kissable ;) my new secret weapon.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is better for your lips then carmex since seems more harsh and actually causes your lips to peel more often. I have used carmex for years before I switched to just this plain vaseline</li>
            <li> Good buy, lots of tubes.</li>
            <li> It came on time and this is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve had very chapped and cracked lips and I was desperate for a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried [[ASIN:B002DPUXZM Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube, .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]] only to find my lips even more chapped than before and a urge to reapply the balm every 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried [[ASIN:B000052YE5 Mentholatum Natural Ice Medicated Lip Protectant SPF 15, Mentholatum 0.16-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 12)]] and the symptoms weren&#x27;t improving. It was basically the same as the Burt&#x27;s Bees product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since realized that these lip balms prevent cracked lips, but don&#x27;t help add moisturizer to the lips to repair them. At least not for me, not quick enough, and/or not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline Lip Therapy was the next on my list, and my lips feel moisturized and don&#x27;t require me to reapply every 30 minutes. I do believe there are better lip balms out there that are specifically made to add moisturizer to the lips (none I can currently recommend), but this product will be what I use from now on as an everyday \\&quot;lip therapy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a medicine the drys out the skin/lips...  To keep my lips from chapping my doctor recommended vaseline. These are handy to keep at my desk at work; in my purse; next to my bed; everywhere...  this is why the 12 pack was a good choice for me...  and it is working to keep my lips moist.</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty finding this item in some of the larger stores.  Just happeneded to find it on Amizo.  The item was shipped nicely/reasonably and all arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> This product is the very best! I have been using it for over 20 years and have never found anything better. It is hard to find in the store so I bought the 12 pack. I could not be more pleased with my Vasaline lip stuff!</li>
            <li> Vaseline Lip Therapy is the best stuff you can use on your lips to prevent and cure chapping. The most expensive lip color will look awful on chapped lips! Once the colder weather comes in, I stash these in my car, my purses, coat pockets, at work, etc. I&#x27;d rather have lots on hand rather than run out. I also keep an extra on hand for guests in need, &#x27;cause this is one item you sure don&#x27;t want to share. I was once so desperately in pain from dry and cracked lips that I had to resort to using butter! That&#x27;ll never happen to me again. (This is a good item to pick up at a club warehouse store.)</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction! Speedy delivery.  Product arrived just as described. Fast, simple, and hassle-free business! Thanks! Will recommend to others. A+++</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm on the market! If only it had SPF it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping, excellent packaging. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I had some trouble when pregnant with the fruity stuff you buy in the grocery store check out lanes. But this stuff is just petroleum jelly without all the extra crud. And a 12 pack means I can give one to my husband, put one in each bathroom, and lose 9 in my purse ... which is what usually happens anyhow.</li>
            <li> Love these - hard to find.</li>
            <li> Why add &amp;#34;FLAVOR&amp;#34; to petroleum Jelly? And why now call it &amp;#34;petrolatum&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t but this product because it looked different from the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; vaseline lip therapy consisting of ONLY 100% petroleum jelly. I guess people didn&#x27;t want to put &amp;#34;petroleum&amp;#34; on their lips, so to fool them,the Vaseline company changed the name to &amp;#34;petrolatum&amp;#34; and added flavor. I finally researched &amp;#34;petrolatum&amp;#34; and found it was just another name for &amp;#34;petroleum jelly&amp;#34;. Consider me fooled. Also, it was shipped and sold by OTCMASTER who is not only not capable of shipping in a reasonable amount of time, but ships the thin Vaseline carton in the soft paper envelope by US Mail. Of course it was crushed in the Mail.</li>
            <li> I like the neutral fragrance.  I don&#x27;t like the ones that smell medicated or fruity.</li>
            <li> A good product; it stays and help on cracked lips better than other products I have used. Recommended</li>
            <li> I use this during the winter on my lips and hands from time to time.  Much better price than Chapstick and does the same thing.</li>
            <li> Best lip protection ever. Long lasting with no chalky feeling at all. I have and will use this stuff forever with no hesitation.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and I have Sjogrens, so my lips become very dry It helps me a lot. Thanks</li>
            <li> My father used to carry the little tubes of Vaseline in his pockets when I was little, then I started.  They changed the packages many years ago but I stuck with the product.  I purchase these in bulk and find them all over the house and car, they even get washed and dried (usually they make it through as long as the top is screwed on and they stay in the pants pocket)  This product keeps my lips moisturized and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to using vasaline on my lips so I was very excited when I found out they made them in little tubes for me to carry in my purse vs me carrying around a small tub of vasaline.  I do use it a lot during the day and go through about 1 tube every 2 weeks.  It is hard to get out once there is less than half left in the tube as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a friend who was unable to find the Vaseline brand name in the tube in our area.  When I found this, I was excited.  But my friend was speechless  --- Friend loves this product!  Received my order quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Every lip balm out there seems to have one thing or another that I react too, even aloe and other ingredients for sensitive skin.  This has just petrolatum and a flavoring which I can&#x27;t taste.  I wish I could use a lip balm that had SPF, but haven&#x27;t found one I don&#x27;t react to.</li>
            <li> A great value. I lose chap-stick and ordering this much has helped me to always have some around. I would warn people that if you overuse your lips with become covered with the nasty (Vaseline), coating all the time. So wash your lips with a warm paper towel, do not scrub just let the towel sit cleaning off lips.</li>
            <li> I ordered these, because it seems hard to find this product.  It&#x27;s wonderful for lips, and doesn&#x27;t dry them out.  There are so many for the price which is great!!  They arrived very promptly, as well.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised. Very good value and just what I wanted. I will order again. I was happy to find this.</li>
            <li> I am currently taking ACCUTANE, which is basically synonym for your-lips-will-suffer-in-hell. I swear, some people complain about having dry lips when they&#x27;re really just slightly dehydrated. The dry lips that come with Accutane isn&#x27;t like your ordinary chapped lips. If I haven&#x27;t applied lip balm in an hour my lips will start to crack, peel, and even bleed. So if an accutane patient tells you a lip product works, TRUST THEM! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty decent on its own; and amazing if you factor in the price. It moisturizes nicely and immediately restores moisture to my lips when I haven&#x27;t applied lip balm in a while. The formula is relatively light, so it does require more reapplications than Aquaphor (which is the recommended lip treatment for accutane patients). it has a very nice, mild scent, which is almost unnoticeable and therefore does not irritate your lips. I love the round tip more than those angled tips that you find in most lip treatments. It feels very smooth on your lips and evenly distributes the product. The tube itself feels a bit flimsy, because the plastic they use to make the tube is very soft. Sometimes I think the soft tube also leads to over-application, since a tiny squeeze can displace A LOT of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very decent lip treatment. I&#x27;ve always been able to find this at my Walmart for 92 cents, which is kind of unbelievable since it&#x27;s such a great product. However, if you have trouble finding this in stores I suggest buying it in bulk on Amazon. It is quite a bit more expensive but it truly is a fantastic product! :)</li>
            <li> It has been difficult to find vaseline lip gloss in the stores, so, in case they are discontinuing the product, I purchased a couple dozen.  They arrived on the day promised, in perfect condition.  Very happy with this transaction.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand NOT having these on hand.  &#x27;Nough said.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. She says it keeps her lips very well moisturized. I love the price. She makes sure to have one with her at pretty much at all times.</li>
            <li> We have tried just about every &amp;#34;lip therapy&amp;#34; out there, and we will only use this brand and type.  We don&#x27;t like added flavor or a waxy feel.  This feels very natural and keeps our dry lips moist.  Great product and hard to find in local stores.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I kept getting really dry red marks on the corners of my lips and no matter what I used it wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I started putting regular old vaseline on it and it went away so I tried this and got the same result.  Vaseline is seriously the best thing to use for your lips.  I bought this pack of 12 because I couldn&#x27;t find them in CVS or rite aid and I didn&#x27;t feel like going all the way to target.  Now I have one in my bag, one at work, one on my nightstand, one in my car and still have 6 to spare.</li>
            <li> perfect if you have sensitive skin and lips. No noticeable smell and makes lips better fast.</li>
            <li> My lip is usually dried, but it makes me keep good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I think the tube type is clean to use.</li>
            <li> Well, it is Vaseline, so what more is there to say? I&#x27;ll tell you what - it&#x27;s a very expensive way to buy Vaseline - you could buy a jar for the same price. But it&#x27;s so much easier to carry around than a jar. So you pay for convenience.</li>
            <li> I cannot find Vaseline Lip therapy in the stores any more, it is real frustrating, so I am so glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> The most recent and terribly cold winter weather left my lips very chapped. Vaseline lip therapy advanced formula instantly eased that annoying chapped feeling and protected my lips from the dreadful winter wind chill. I loved the product so much, I continued to use it all spring as an everyday moisturizer. I also like that the squeeze tube is much cleaner than the little tubs of it that requires you to dip your finger in the lip balm to apply it. Unlike Carmex, this product does not have that strong menthol taste and smell some people dislike. It is very mild and free of added scents and flavors.</li>
            <li> Great stuff; great price! I contantly use this one since I have chelitis and it seems to help moisturize my lips. I always apply my &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; lipgloss on top, i.e. Burts Bees.</li>
            <li> these little tubes are great for carrying with you. they fit in my jean pocket easily! the Vaseline is a great protectant against chapped lips. Towards the end of the tube it gets a little liquid-y. We get a great price for them on amazon with the subscribe and save. They ship well.</li>
            <li> Great!!!! I had a hard time keeping lips smooth in winter until I found this! Please keep and keep cheap amazon!</li>
            <li> I really hate the method in which the container distributes the lip balm.  There is a tiny hole at the very top of the half circle.  It only allows a small stream out at a time and then when I squeeze extra out to get a good layer on the lips it does not flow well across the skin - clumping!  As I press my lips together in hopes of spreading the goop it gets in my mouth and has the nastiest taste of any lip balm I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT my favorite.  Much prefer the mentha extreme from BBB in the mall.  Yes, it is twice as expensive but MUCH, MUCH better!</li>
            <li> Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Formula 0.35Ounce (Pack of 12)&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing &amp; good price.. love it &amp; would buy again next year</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy to use</li>
            <li> These are on my &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34; list, and I get 12 of them every month.</li>
            <li> Really great for those with allergies to other stuff, these are pure white pj, in a very convenient package.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this stuff is so hard to find in local stores, but this is a great deal on a great lanolin-free lip balm. Comes on the original sealed display cards.</li>
            <li> Great lip therapy and a really good price. Took a while to arrive but happy to buy again</li>
            <li> I bought one box of this stuff like 3 years ago and i still havent even used half the pack! Defiantly recommend.</li>
            <li> Stays on and keeps working because you don&#x27;t want to lick it off. Excellent for northern climates!</li>
            <li> Love these, no flavor which I like and it works much longer than any lip balm Ive used. Not medicated like carmex which i also like</li>
            <li> These are a great deal, but be weary if you&#x27;re concerned about expiration dates. Mine arrived October 15, 2014 and they &amp;#34;expire&amp;#34; Jan 2015 - that&#x27;s just three months away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really just petrolium jelly, so I don&#x27;t know if it really can expire of it&#x27;s just a CYA thing Unilever has to do per the FDA. The packages came in perfect condition. When opened, the tubes have a bit of an oily (Vaseline) feeling, but no biggie. It comes right off - nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net, great deal, but they &amp;#34;expire&amp;#34; in three months. I&#x27;ll probably keep using them past this date though.</li>
            <li> I have 25 tubes for spares! Lol! You never know when something might be discontinued and as this is my favorite healing &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;, I have learned to stock up. During winter, my lips do split quite a bit. All I have to do is put them on before I sleep and it heals after 2 nights of application! Also, When the tips of my fingers get dry from cleaning dishes, I apply this too and by the next morning, it&#x27;s soft and smooth again! Nothing else works like this, not even regular Vaseline!</li>
            <li> I had been dealing with chapped lips forever! Buying all kinda of lip balms with little or no results. This pure Vaseline is the only lip balm I&#x27;ve found that helps. I do wear an SPF sunscreen if I go on the sun but other than that it&#x27;s always Vaseline lip therapy. What a difference!</li>
            <li> Always keep well stocked up on this the best ever</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and this is a great price. I don&#x27;t want flavored lip balm that makes me lick it off more quickly and use more. These usually cost between $2 and $3 individually in a store, so this is a great deal. I bought a box, threw out all the old ones, and replaced them with new.</li>
            <li> I have recently discovered what causes acne around my lips - the lip balms. Thanks to Paula&#x27;s Choice I learned that the petroleum jelly molecule is too big to clog pores. Sure enough, as soon as I stopped using lip balms and switched to pure petroleum jelly, acne around my lips practically disappeared. Yes, you can say she simply shouldn&#x27;t apply lip balms elsewhere than directly to the lips but I can&#x27;t help it; it always transfers to the area around the lips too. So since I use Vaseline, I am fine. Nevertheless, as you can imagine, it is not very practical to wash my hands, apply Vaseline from the jar, wash my fingers again. So this particular product is a dream comes true for me as I can apply it whenever and wherever I need to. Plus it&#x27;s cheap. Great find for me.</li>
            <li> Got these for my husband....he uses them like crazy!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product in and of itself. Very smooth, absorbs quickly, and keeps your lips moisturized for hours. Unfortunately, when this packaged arrived at my doorstep, all twelve pieces were set to expire within two months. I can&#x27;t use 12 lip balms in two months so I had to return them. Make sure you inquire about the expiration date before you purchase this item!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I (and some people I know) have been using it for years, and still love it. It moisturizes and isn&#x27;t greasy. Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Love these, use them all the time.  Convenient and doesn&#x27;t have Phenol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to see that they make Vaseline in travel size containers.  I tried 2 to start with and love them.  I ordered a case and will have them through the winter and longer.  I use to only use Carmex, but they changed their formula and I can no longer use them.  I then searched for alternatives and found this.  I recommend this product.  The application end is a hard plastic rounded and has a little hole that you squeeze the container to get the Vaseline out and then run the plastic rounded end on your lips to apply all over.</li>
            <li> These are not always easy to find in drugstores so I bought 12. I am &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; to scents, so vaseline has been my lip therapy of choice. Glad to find a dozen!</li>
            <li> This product has no additives, so for me it&#x27;s hypoallergenic and it really works to keep my lips from chapping all year long</li>
            <li> Vaseline Lip Therapy is the greatest lip relief ever made. No other product, and I&#x27;ve tried every conceivable lip balm, is its equal. It&#x27;s not just a routine. It&#x27;s a positive addiction for me, not just daily or for specific chapped lips, but all the time.&lt;br /&gt;LW</li>
            <li> I used to use the tube of roll-on lip balm, but didn&#x27;t feel like my lips were receiving enough moisture. I switched to Vaseline Lip Therapy and love how my lips always feel hydrated and look shiny too. It helps keep my lips from being chapped during the cold winter months as well. It easily fits into my pocket or purse and applies very clean and easy!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Great product!</li>
            <li> These tubes last a long time. I used to go through Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm really quickly. After a year or two of using Burt&#x27;s Bees I started getting an irritation around my lips after using Burt&#x27;s Bees (pomegranate scent). I stopped using it for a number of months and tried to use it again but the irritation returned. I ended up trying Vaseline and have not had any issues. Normally I would never want to use a petroleum based product but in this case I felt like I had no choice. My lips get dry really easily year round. The Vaseline solved my issue. Hopefully it is a safe product to use in the long term.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better for dry winter lips.  I really love this and am glad I can buy them for this price as this particular kind has been hard to find.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips moisturized, it&#x27;s cheap, and I think it works better than any other type of lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to shea butter, cocoa butter and beeswax so finding something that I can use on my lips is very challenging. My dermatologist recommended using Vaseline because it doesn&#x27;t have any active drying ingredients like most balms and chapsticks do. Yes, this is basically just Vaseline in a tube. But it&#x27;s a lot easier to apply and lug around than a small container of the real thing.</li>
            <li> I frequently use this product. I was able to buy a large quantity at a very good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and I highly recommend. Use it all day on my lips,  every day.&lt;br /&gt;Small tubes are perfect for pockets and purses.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my lips and I&#x27;ve found that the Vaseline chap stick is the only kind that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love having so many available so there&#x27;s always one around - nightstand, purse, pocket, car, etc.</li>
            <li> I got this type of lip balm because many sources (e.g. Mayo Clinic) have found that most lip balm brands include various agents that actually cause chapped lips! I&#x27;ve heard many people (including myself) say that they are &#x27;addicted&#x27; to their lip balm. Well, it turns out that yes, we kinda were. Because our cure was causing our &#x27;disease&#x27;. Mayo and others specifically recommend putting &#x27;just petroleum jelly&#x27; on. Well, this is just petroleum jelly, so we win there. In the couple of months I&#x27;ve been using this, despite the extreme dryness of this polar vortex winter, my need to apply moisturizers to my lips has fallen greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, WARNING: the stuff becomes more or less solid at cold temperatures. The bottom of my first tube gave out and got greasy crap all over the place after I tried squeezing it after walking around in sub-0 temperatures with the tube in my outer jacket pocket (outside the insulation and thus exposed to the elements). I guess the jelly couldn&#x27;t go through the small hole at the top and then the crimped bottom failed. Keeping the tube next to your body in the cold keeps it plenty warm for application though. An inner jacket pocket and pants pockets have worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do wish they made a version that was just some wax and petrol jelly without the harmful additives. I prefer the solid tube style to this. But I couldn&#x27;t find anything like that.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with Vaseline Lip Therapy. I was looking for something for my extremely chapped lips so I went out and got this. In one day it has made a huge difference. I will only ever use this product for my chapped lips. It is so inexpensive and amazing.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my lips soft without an unpleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> My wives lips puff up like Angelina&#x27;s when she uses regular chap sticks so she uses this stuff and loves it. 2nd order in last three years.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 12 pack of vaseline lip therapy because I could no longer find it at wal-mart and other such places in my area.  My lips seem to dry out easily and vaseline works the best on them.  I have tried other brands of lip therapy like carmax and burt&#x27;s beeswax and my lips were not satisfied.  Buying a 12 pack may seem like a little much but I can put a tube in different purses and leave it there.  I also carry a  tube in in my coat pockets too.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about buying any more for awhile.</li>
            <li> Only Chapstick I use!! Love it</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff since high school. Put this on before bed and your lips are silky and healed the next morning. You can even use it to remove makeup in a pinch!</li>
            <li> I like the Vaseline Lip Therapy pocket applicator, but they&#x27;re hard to find in the stores.  This was a great way to get 12, at a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and am very satisfied, it keeps my lips from chafing in the very dry climate of Arizona</li>
            <li> I usually order a dozen of these Vaseline Lip Therapy tubes at a time.  They arrived with a very quick delivery.  I use them often to keep the dryness down.  I would recommend this product to anyone and also the supplier is very responsive in his filling orders.  Thank you.  BOB&#x27;S OPINION</li>
            <li> I was on Burt&#x27;s Bees for a bit before I discovered this cheaper alternative. This truly heals my unhappy chapped winter lips like nothing ever has. I use it in the summer in place of lipgloss. The taste is neutral and not strange, should you accidentally swallow a bit, with the texture you would expect from other Vaseline products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pack of twelve was a bit excessive so I gave away tubes to friends, who have subsequently converted to the stuff.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Vaseline Lip Therapy. I began using this roughly 1.5 years ago and, although I had been looking for something that smelled fruity and girly, I ultimately find myself constantly coming back to this product. I have been unable to find any other lip balm on the market that moisturizes my lips like Vaseline does. Although it does not smell that great (actually, doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all), I find myself continuing to use it every single day and have gone through numerous tubes. I have one in my purse, one in my nightstand and one in my car so I am never without it where ever I go! I will be purchasing this product for years and years to come, as it has left my lips soft, moisturized and kissable!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price- you can&#x27;t find any lip balm that compares to this for the price&lt;br /&gt;2. Leaves your lips soft and moisturized&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. No fruity or girly smells but totally worth it</li>
            <li> Very good product; used daily, never have a problem with over dryness--which is a regular problem for me when not using it.</li>
            <li> great price, delivered sooner than ETA</li>
            <li> The right product at the right price!</li>
            <li> Bought in bulk to keep my personal supply stocked and to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! What a great deal!!!!</li>
            <li> The lip therapy in tubes is hard to find and I&#x27;ve used it for years but it&#x27;s disappearing from store shelves</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have eczama. Because of were it is most located I have horrible dry lips. By putting on a lip gloss and this I have hours of protection from the elements. Perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li> purchased for my wife , she prefers this version to original lip therapy</li>
            <li> My mom and husband both of very dry cracked lips and this is one of the products that still work the best. My mom mentioned that after using this, her lips start healing overnight. My mom was having a hard time finding this in stores so I got her this 12-pack.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product for chapped, damaged lips and skin -- aggravated by cold and wet winters.  I keep these in my jacket and briefcase pockets for easy and discrete application.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only reliable treatment I have found, superior to the waxy chap sticks found in the grocery stores.</li>
