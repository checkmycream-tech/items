    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 years now with great results!</li>
            <li>PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>This is the best system I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed,</li>
            <li>, do you know I have one of the best complexions of all the girls in my school?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I did, my face is perfect now</li>
            <li>I would wash my face...and it worked perfectly in the shower.  </li>
            <li>very happy.      </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT!!  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent, has cleared up his skin</li>
            <li>Always loved this stuff!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best acne system out there, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>(although I&#x27;d add a good moisturizer with sunblook, especially love Olay 7x).</li>
            <li>and it worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>I am sooooo happy.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this Acne Treatment System.</li>
            <li>this is a great buy</li>
            <li>I was happy with them.....</li>
            <li>She drank lots of water, ate healthy foods like salads and fruit, exercised--despite her best attempts, nothing would improve her complexion.</li>
            <li>The price is much better than \\&quot;Proactiv\\&quot; and the best part is that we can order as he needs it, not on \\&quot;auto ship\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>They are not as good as Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>She had to play around with the routine for a while to get optimum results.</li>
            <li>This product has been great for me and makes me feel better about my skin.  </li>
            <li>The price is great, and the results - FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I love it great product A</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Make sure you aren&#x27;t wearing something nice when you wash your face!</li>
            <li>- Bottles are not as nice as Proactiv, they tend to get \\&quot;Krusty Tops\\&quot;  - I switched to this product for about a month already,</li>
            <li>Somewhat effective at preventing break-outs but doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as P-activ.  </li>
            <li>Thats pretty good for my acne!</li>
            <li>I am very happy to have found Klear Action because I can afford it</li>
            <li>I bought klear action and was impressed.</li>
            <li>I really liked it more than the Pro Activ (\\&quot;PA\\&quot;) cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This has been the best product for clear skin I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty good system, and my skin is fairly blemish free.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne for many years</li>
            <li>It cleared most of her face except for the area in the forehead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the system is better than just soap-and-water, but it&#x27;s not the solution I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>nice and cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used &amp;quot;Proactive&amp;quot; but I couldn&#x27;t imagine it working much better.</li>
            <li>The toner is a differnt color and the Medication lotion is more watery.    </li>
            <li>what better deal is out there.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels better and looks better, dare I say...</li>
            <li>I am glad it worked for others</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks most of the blotchyness was gone.  </li>
            <li>:) It will also lighten hair</li>
            <li>I have to say that I truly love this product.  </li>
            <li>sure many have tried so many methods.</li>
            <li>Give it a month or so.. or more.. these things take time..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard Proactive is good, but why join a &amp;quot;club&amp;quot; and pay twice as much?</li>
            <li>This truely works!</li>
            <li>PROACTIV is a great product, when all 3 main items (Face-Wash,Toner,Lotion) are used daily it is very effective in controlling break outs and the size of pimples.  </li>
            <li>and you will most likely be happy with it.</li>
            <li>I could easily go a month or two before using another shorter treatment before it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>good results and a decent value.</li>
            <li>for anyone who thinks proactiv is too strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>MY skin took about 2-3 weeks of getting use to the product before I started to see huge results and trust me</li>
            <li>- I could see huge results after 2-3 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>so it should be okay for most face, and it seems to be working better than PA in getting rid of my acnes; however, it does not seem to be able to prevent pimples, which disappoints me; 2) second, pimples are like bacteria: after a while, they start resisting the treatment and will persist no matter</li>
            <li>This product has made me pimple free...</li>
            <li>Proactiv Solution:  - Great Product, when used correctly and daily.  </li>
            <li>In the summer months I use it twice a day with a light oil-free moisturizer w/ SPF.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried what feels like every over-the-counter product available.  </li>
            <li>At the 4 month mark I tried to be cheap and use AcneFree.  </li>
            <li>If proactiv works, stick with it, the price is worth the better skin.</li>
            <li>After a few months of use, I can honestly say this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was that consistent in using it.</li>
            <li>For twenty dollars it is definately worth giving a try!</li>
            <li>My husband originally wanted to order proactiv, but we do not like to purchase these types of products on an \\&quot;auto</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it says it can cause sunburn easily so make sure you wear sunblock!</li>
            <li>Also a Great Product, same exact medications as Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>I keep ending up with bright orange and red spots on shirts and towels because of it.  </li>
            <li>ive been using klear action for years now, and it clears my skin up nicely.</li>
            <li>It actually felt good on my skin, I didn&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer afterward, which I always do.  </li>
            <li>My son used Proactive for several months with good results</li>
            <li>According to my son the Klear Action works just as good as the higher priced Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through 2 rounds of Acutane in my lifetime and Klear Action is the best face cleaning system I&#x27;ve found out there to control my acne and keep my skin clear without having to go back to the dermatologist for more prescriptions.</li>
            <li>The first few days, I was sure this was a great product.  </li>
            <li>After 2 months I had about 2-5 pimples a month that came and WENT QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement almost immediately, and now I RARELY have a pimple, and if I do get one, it is short-lived, not painful, etc.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for less than a week and my skin looks great, and</li>
            <li>- Great for oily skin, not to harsh for my med type of skin.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser does not do a great job of exfoliating, and the toner was a bit harsh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>stopped using it recently, just to see if my skin had improved on its own.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews I decided to give Klear Action a try, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>This ended up being no problem at all because, to me, Klear Action cleared my skin better than the proactiv.  </li>
            <li>so I only use Klear Action once a day with a good rich oil-free moisturizer w/ SPF.  </li>
            <li>Klear Action is the best acne product I&#x27;ve used and has definitely helped my mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because it was half priced and available at the drug store, but to my surprise, I have never had better skin!</li>
            <li>You can buy it right in the grocery store, not online</li>
            <li>The stress of school, work, and taking care of two small children was really taking a toll on my skin, and I&#x27;m so happy I took a gamble on this budget friendly product.</li>
            <li>This is a definite must for easily irritated, acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than other treatments advertised and it really works great.</li>
            <li>Grapeseed Oil is classified as an essential oil and is very light and won&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
            <li>but overall these products are just okay.  </li>
            <li>This product is better than Proactive because it works the same, but its cheaper!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different products that promise results, but don&#x27;t deliver.    </li>
            <li>She just got more pimples and peeling red skin.</li>
            <li>After 2 years of red, peeling, skin and more pimples, she was disheartened and hopeless.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this is the only one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>Now I just keep it up twice a day to make sure zits don&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>I was considering proactiv but with most of our income going to diapers price was a big consideration</li>
            <li>The first thing I notice was that my coloring and texture were evening out.</li>
            <li>I went back to Klear Action and am VERY pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>All the ingredients are the same, infact you get more product in the toner.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for whoever is interested in ProActiv.</li>
            <li>If you are interested give it a try.</li>
            <li>As with many acne products I find - they seem to go ineffective for me after a short time.</li>
            <li>I do still get a few here and there and the condition of my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as good as it was with Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Save the 20 bucks, buy the Klear Action!!!!</li>
            <li>Reviews were pretty positive, so I ordered a set from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I will never again use Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Oxy, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>first, the KA set seems quite gentle</li>
            <li>I started out using it once a day, since I normally dry out with most cleansers.</li>
            <li>I wish they would bring this product back on the market, it worked great and made dark spot fade faithfully.</li>
            <li>She found that the toner was too strong for her face, but we put it on her back and that clears up the acne situation there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a generic of Pro Active but for me this worked much better than the name brand stuff!!</li>
            <li>, my husband&#x27;s looks infinately better and its so easy to use with only 3 quick little steps</li>
            <li>Right after the birth of my daughter, my skin seemed to be miraculously clear for the first time in my life, but as the hormones re-balanced themselves, I started to break out on my cheeks and chin.  </li>
            <li>It has not cleared my acne completely, but has improved it greatly minimizing breakouts, and making my skin soft and less embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>I am now including Oil of Olay&#x27;s Total Effects Moisturizer in my regimen to decrease those fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my son who has a real problem with acne.</li>
            <li>It really works for me.</li>
            <li>I used Pro Activ for three years before giving up, as it just didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>I think it really depends on the person.  </li>
            <li>You get the cleanser, toner, and repair lotion in one kit, so I think the cost is reasonable.   </li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and I was not so blotchy red.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare, but this did it for me.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t really help, and it didn&#x27;t really hurt.</li>
            <li>Get real.</li>
            <li>Now I am much more careful!</li>
            <li>In fact lets say a large corporation like Proactiv could hire such a firm or their own employees to put a smaller but better company and competition out of business.</li>
            <li>I was tempted by the price tag of this product which was much less than that of other acne packages, but maybe if I had paid more money I would have gotten more noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I began using Klear Action 10 months ago and saw results w/in the first week.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using Klear Action, I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it.</li>
            <li>You have to buy a whole new kit.</li>
            <li>Comparing it to Proactiv (my favorite till I found this), I noticed the deep pore cleanser was a more diluted product and seemed to have less graininess for that bit of facial scrub consistency.  </li>
            <li>The Klear Action face wash is much better than Proactive because it isn&#x27;t watery when it gets wet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently blemish free and my skin is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It was pretty drying to my skin, but only for the first week or two.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for the people who did not get the promised results from proactiv, give this a try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone considering Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>This system does not include a mask which is one of the things I like best about Proactiv since it seems to clear up bad pimples very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The KA repair lotion is more watery than the PA lotion, but it disappears once applied to the face, unlike the PA lotion which would stay visible for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The KA toner seems to be a little more stringent than the PA toner, but not unduly so on my skin which is a little bit more sensitive than the normal face (according to my dermatologist).  </li>
            <li>For new users I would give it about 2-3 weeks to see a differnce in your skin.</li>
            <li>I tried this and it seemed to work for the first week, but after that my acne was back as normal.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very soft</li>
            <li>My son is very conscious about his acne</li>
            <li>and once i received my klear action, my skin was dramatically clearer in two days!</li>
            <li>Nope, not if you&#x27;re using Klear Action it isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>BREAKOUTS STILL HAPPEN, BUT MUCH LESS AND CLEAR UP VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but positive comments to make about this product, which I understand is basically a generic rendition of ProActive, at 1/2 the price.   </li>
            <li>However, I have been on it now for 5 weeks and the only thing I can say that is positive about it is that it has evened out my skin color and made my skin glow without make up.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of price, pure and simple.  </li>
            <li>Seems like I could never be totally clear of it.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin clear around the clock.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend Klear Action to anyone with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>But because of the price, I&#x27;ll probably continue to use Klear Action.</li>
            <li>I tried Klear Action because it said it was just like Proactive</li>
            <li>and I still do, Klear Action and Proactive have not cured my acne</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about money when I buy Klear Action</li>
            <li>Anways,I have been using the Klear Action for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>, I am willing to deal with that as long as I am not breaking out.</li>
            <li>But for my daughter who is 15 years old, it&#x27;s not 100% improvement.</li>
            <li>but I saw a review for Klear Action and thought we would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>(Any class action lawyers here?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was browsing drugstore.com and saw this product called Klear Action.  </li>
            <li>far, Klear Action can keep my pimples under control.  </li>
            <li>I am 27 years old.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my skin tone with Biore Ice Cleanser but not with Klear Action.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I have always just washed my face with regular store bought acne wash, and it never seemed to help much.  </li>
            <li>Klear Action Acne Treatment:  -</li>
            <li>I ordered Klear Action with hope of a cure.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy Klear Action instead.  </li>
            <li>I have been using clear action now for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>I then tried Klear Action.</li>
            <li>Now Klear Action is discontinued because \\&quot;it is</li>
            <li>Start Klear Action once a day or longer with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Right before I go to bed, I would apply the Lotion (the Medication) which would take 30-45 sec.</li>
            <li>But after a few weeks, my skin wasn&#x27;t looking any better, and it was getting really dry.  </li>
            <li>It works quite well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much.</li>
            <li>Overall though the benefit of being acne free outweighs the cost of a couple towels and a few shirts.    </li>
            <li>Another minor negative thing about Klear Action product is that it doesn&#x27;t lather too well, making you think you need more soap which uses the product up quicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d previously consistently had one or two blemishes, but after a few weeks with Klear Action, I&#x27;ve been totally clear *knock on wood</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have about Klear Action is that the scent is a little overwhelming at first</li>
            <li>It definitely dries out your skin a little bit, mostly because of the toner, so I use a couple of other products in conjunction with Klear Action to limit the dryness.</li>
            <li>I still give this product 5 stars because completely clear skin makes the clothing issue and lighter hair such a trivial matter.</li>
            <li>After applying the Grapeseed Oil I apply the third step of Klear Action, the lotion.</li>
            <li>so if the Klear Action had not been working as well as Proactiv he would have refused to use it and would have gone back.   </li>
            <li>Out of desperation I purchased the KlearAction kit for her, and were we ever surprised to see that IT ACTUALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I would actually recommend Biore Ice Cleanser over Klear Action.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give Klear Action a shot, because it was $20 and was like a generic brand to Proactive.</li>
            <li>- Medications are the same, but Klear Action&#x27;s Face wash has no micro scrubbers.  </li>
            <li>I was doing moderately well using Neutrogena products when I decided to try Klear Action.  </li>
            <li>The only change over the month I have been using Klear Action is a noticeable drying of my skin which I have had to use a separate moisturizer to combat.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this system is not as effective as the Proactiv system I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After letting that dry for a couple minutes, I apply my Oil of Olay Regenerist cream which is also very helpful with overall complexion, softness and eradicates dryness, as well.</li>
            <li>I found Klear Action since last summer and have been using it almost on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference after only the second week using this, but note that it will take about 5 - 6 weeks of continuous use to stay completely clear.  </li>
            <li>However, this product never completely cleared any of my stubborn acne, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it works on some acne but not all of it.</li>
            <li>Despite all of that, I would still recommend Klear Action (after Biore) because it did help with minor blemishes.</li>
            <li>and I recommend 3 times a day for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>It lasts (for her) about one to two months, as packaged, which breaks down to a very affordable $15- a month.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m impressed,</li>
            <li> , do you know I have one of the best complexions of all the girls in my school?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I did, my face is perfect now</li>
            <li> I would wash my face...and it worked perfectly in the shower.  </li>
            <li> very happy.      </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent, has cleared up his skin</li>
            <li> Always loved this stuff!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best acne system out there, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;d add a good moisturizer with sunblook, especially love Olay 7x).</li>
            <li> and it worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> I am sooooo happy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this Acne Treatment System.</li>
            <li> this is a great buy</li>
            <li> I was happy with them.....</li>
            <li> She drank lots of water, ate healthy foods like salads and fruit, exercised--despite her best attempts, nothing would improve her complexion.</li>
            <li> The price is much better than \\&quot;Proactiv\\&quot; and the best part is that we can order as he needs it, not on \\&quot;auto ship\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> They are not as good as Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> She had to play around with the routine for a while to get optimum results.</li>
            <li> This product has been great for me and makes me feel better about my skin.  </li>
            <li> The price is great, and the results - FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I love it great product A</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Make sure you aren&#x27;t wearing something nice when you wash your face!</li>
            <li> - Bottles are not as nice as Proactiv, they tend to get \\&quot;Krusty Tops\\&quot;  - I switched to this product for about a month already,</li>
            <li> Somewhat effective at preventing break-outs but doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as P-activ.  </li>
            <li> Thats pretty good for my acne!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found Klear Action because I can afford it</li>
            <li> I bought klear action and was impressed.</li>
            <li> I really liked it more than the Pro Activ (\\&quot;PA\\&quot;) cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This has been the best product for clear skin I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> It is a pretty good system, and my skin is fairly blemish free.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for many years</li>
            <li> It cleared most of her face except for the area in the forehead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the system is better than just soap-and-water, but it&#x27;s not the solution I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> nice and cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used &amp;quot;Proactive&amp;quot; but I couldn&#x27;t imagine it working much better.</li>
            <li> The toner is a differnt color and the Medication lotion is more watery.    </li>
            <li> what better deal is out there.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels better and looks better, dare I say...</li>
            <li> I am glad it worked for others</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks most of the blotchyness was gone.  </li>
            <li> :) It will also lighten hair</li>
            <li> I have to say that I truly love this product.  </li>
            <li> sure many have tried so many methods.</li>
            <li> Give it a month or so.. or more.. these things take time..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard Proactive is good, but why join a &amp;quot;club&amp;quot; and pay twice as much?</li>
            <li> This truely works!</li>
            <li> PROACTIV is a great product, when all 3 main items (Face-Wash,Toner,Lotion) are used daily it is very effective in controlling break outs and the size of pimples.  </li>
            <li> and you will most likely be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I could easily go a month or two before using another shorter treatment before it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> good results and a decent value.</li>
            <li> for anyone who thinks proactiv is too strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> MY skin took about 2-3 weeks of getting use to the product before I started to see huge results and trust me</li>
            <li> - I could see huge results after 2-3 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> so it should be okay for most face, and it seems to be working better than PA in getting rid of my acnes; however, it does not seem to be able to prevent pimples, which disappoints me; 2) second, pimples are like bacteria: after a while, they start resisting the treatment and will persist no matter</li>
            <li> This product has made me pimple free...</li>
            <li> Proactiv Solution:  - Great Product, when used correctly and daily.  </li>
            <li> In the summer months I use it twice a day with a light oil-free moisturizer w/ SPF.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried what feels like every over-the-counter product available.  </li>
            <li> At the 4 month mark I tried to be cheap and use AcneFree.  </li>
            <li> If proactiv works, stick with it, the price is worth the better skin.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I can honestly say this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was that consistent in using it.</li>
            <li> For twenty dollars it is definately worth giving a try!</li>
            <li> My husband originally wanted to order proactiv, but we do not like to purchase these types of products on an \\&quot;auto</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it says it can cause sunburn easily so make sure you wear sunblock!</li>
            <li> Also a Great Product, same exact medications as Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> I keep ending up with bright orange and red spots on shirts and towels because of it.  </li>
            <li> ive been using klear action for years now, and it clears my skin up nicely.</li>
            <li> It actually felt good on my skin, I didn&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer afterward, which I always do.  </li>
            <li> My son used Proactive for several months with good results</li>
            <li> According to my son the Klear Action works just as good as the higher priced Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 2 rounds of Acutane in my lifetime and Klear Action is the best face cleaning system I&#x27;ve found out there to control my acne and keep my skin clear without having to go back to the dermatologist for more prescriptions.</li>
            <li> The first few days, I was sure this was a great product.  </li>
            <li> After 2 months I had about 2-5 pimples a month that came and WENT QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement almost immediately, and now I RARELY have a pimple, and if I do get one, it is short-lived, not painful, etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a week and my skin looks great, and</li>
            <li> - Great for oily skin, not to harsh for my med type of skin.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser does not do a great job of exfoliating, and the toner was a bit harsh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> stopped using it recently, just to see if my skin had improved on its own.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews I decided to give Klear Action a try, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> This ended up being no problem at all because, to me, Klear Action cleared my skin better than the proactiv.  </li>
            <li> so I only use Klear Action once a day with a good rich oil-free moisturizer w/ SPF.  </li>
            <li> Klear Action is the best acne product I&#x27;ve used and has definitely helped my mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it was half priced and available at the drug store, but to my surprise, I have never had better skin!</li>
            <li> You can buy it right in the grocery store, not online</li>
            <li> The stress of school, work, and taking care of two small children was really taking a toll on my skin, and I&#x27;m so happy I took a gamble on this budget friendly product.</li>
            <li> This is a definite must for easily irritated, acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than other treatments advertised and it really works great.</li>
            <li> Grapeseed Oil is classified as an essential oil and is very light and won&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
            <li> but overall these products are just okay.  </li>
            <li> This product is better than Proactive because it works the same, but its cheaper!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different products that promise results, but don&#x27;t deliver.    </li>
            <li> She just got more pimples and peeling red skin.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of red, peeling, skin and more pimples, she was disheartened and hopeless.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this is the only one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Now I just keep it up twice a day to make sure zits don&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> I was considering proactiv but with most of our income going to diapers price was a big consideration</li>
            <li> The first thing I notice was that my coloring and texture were evening out.</li>
            <li> I went back to Klear Action and am VERY pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> All the ingredients are the same, infact you get more product in the toner.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for whoever is interested in ProActiv.</li>
            <li> If you are interested give it a try.</li>
            <li> As with many acne products I find - they seem to go ineffective for me after a short time.</li>
            <li> I do still get a few here and there and the condition of my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as good as it was with Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Save the 20 bucks, buy the Klear Action!!!!</li>
            <li> Reviews were pretty positive, so I ordered a set from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I will never again use Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Oxy, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li> first, the KA set seems quite gentle</li>
            <li> I started out using it once a day, since I normally dry out with most cleansers.</li>
            <li> I wish they would bring this product back on the market, it worked great and made dark spot fade faithfully.</li>
            <li> She found that the toner was too strong for her face, but we put it on her back and that clears up the acne situation there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a generic of Pro Active but for me this worked much better than the name brand stuff!!</li>
            <li> , my husband&#x27;s looks infinately better and its so easy to use with only 3 quick little steps</li>
            <li> Right after the birth of my daughter, my skin seemed to be miraculously clear for the first time in my life, but as the hormones re-balanced themselves, I started to break out on my cheeks and chin.  </li>
            <li> It has not cleared my acne completely, but has improved it greatly minimizing breakouts, and making my skin soft and less embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> I am now including Oil of Olay&#x27;s Total Effects Moisturizer in my regimen to decrease those fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son who has a real problem with acne.</li>
            <li> It really works for me.</li>
            <li> I used Pro Activ for three years before giving up, as it just didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> I think it really depends on the person.  </li>
            <li> You get the cleanser, toner, and repair lotion in one kit, so I think the cost is reasonable.   </li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and I was not so blotchy red.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare, but this did it for me.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t really help, and it didn&#x27;t really hurt.</li>
            <li> Get real.</li>
            <li> Now I am much more careful!</li>
            <li> In fact lets say a large corporation like Proactiv could hire such a firm or their own employees to put a smaller but better company and competition out of business.</li>
            <li> I was tempted by the price tag of this product which was much less than that of other acne packages, but maybe if I had paid more money I would have gotten more noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I began using Klear Action 10 months ago and saw results w/in the first week.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using Klear Action, I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it.</li>
            <li> You have to buy a whole new kit.</li>
            <li> Comparing it to Proactiv (my favorite till I found this), I noticed the deep pore cleanser was a more diluted product and seemed to have less graininess for that bit of facial scrub consistency.  </li>
            <li> The Klear Action face wash is much better than Proactive because it isn&#x27;t watery when it gets wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently blemish free and my skin is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It was pretty drying to my skin, but only for the first week or two.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the people who did not get the promised results from proactiv, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone considering Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> This system does not include a mask which is one of the things I like best about Proactiv since it seems to clear up bad pimples very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The KA repair lotion is more watery than the PA lotion, but it disappears once applied to the face, unlike the PA lotion which would stay visible for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The KA toner seems to be a little more stringent than the PA toner, but not unduly so on my skin which is a little bit more sensitive than the normal face (according to my dermatologist).  </li>
            <li> For new users I would give it about 2-3 weeks to see a differnce in your skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it seemed to work for the first week, but after that my acne was back as normal.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> My son is very conscious about his acne</li>
            <li> and once i received my klear action, my skin was dramatically clearer in two days!</li>
            <li> Nope, not if you&#x27;re using Klear Action it isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> BREAKOUTS STILL HAPPEN, BUT MUCH LESS AND CLEAR UP VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but positive comments to make about this product, which I understand is basically a generic rendition of ProActive, at 1/2 the price.   </li>
            <li> However, I have been on it now for 5 weeks and the only thing I can say that is positive about it is that it has evened out my skin color and made my skin glow without make up.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of price, pure and simple.  </li>
            <li> Seems like I could never be totally clear of it.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin clear around the clock.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Klear Action to anyone with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> But because of the price, I&#x27;ll probably continue to use Klear Action.</li>
            <li> I tried Klear Action because it said it was just like Proactive</li>
            <li> and I still do, Klear Action and Proactive have not cured my acne</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about money when I buy Klear Action</li>
            <li> Anways,I have been using the Klear Action for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> , I am willing to deal with that as long as I am not breaking out.</li>
            <li> But for my daughter who is 15 years old, it&#x27;s not 100% improvement.</li>
            <li> but I saw a review for Klear Action and thought we would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> (Any class action lawyers here?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was browsing drugstore.com and saw this product called Klear Action.  </li>
            <li> far, Klear Action can keep my pimples under control.  </li>
            <li> I am 27 years old.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin tone with Biore Ice Cleanser but not with Klear Action.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I have always just washed my face with regular store bought acne wash, and it never seemed to help much.  </li>
            <li> Klear Action Acne Treatment:  -</li>
            <li> I ordered Klear Action with hope of a cure.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy Klear Action instead.  </li>
            <li> I have been using clear action now for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I then tried Klear Action.</li>
            <li> Now Klear Action is discontinued because \\&quot;it is</li>
            <li> Start Klear Action once a day or longer with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Right before I go to bed, I would apply the Lotion (the Medication) which would take 30-45 sec.</li>
            <li> But after a few weeks, my skin wasn&#x27;t looking any better, and it was getting really dry.  </li>
            <li> It works quite well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much.</li>
            <li> Overall though the benefit of being acne free outweighs the cost of a couple towels and a few shirts.    </li>
            <li> Another minor negative thing about Klear Action product is that it doesn&#x27;t lather too well, making you think you need more soap which uses the product up quicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously consistently had one or two blemishes, but after a few weeks with Klear Action, I&#x27;ve been totally clear *knock on wood</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about Klear Action is that the scent is a little overwhelming at first</li>
            <li> It definitely dries out your skin a little bit, mostly because of the toner, so I use a couple of other products in conjunction with Klear Action to limit the dryness.</li>
            <li> I still give this product 5 stars because completely clear skin makes the clothing issue and lighter hair such a trivial matter.</li>
            <li> After applying the Grapeseed Oil I apply the third step of Klear Action, the lotion.</li>
            <li> so if the Klear Action had not been working as well as Proactiv he would have refused to use it and would have gone back.   </li>
            <li> Out of desperation I purchased the KlearAction kit for her, and were we ever surprised to see that IT ACTUALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li> I would actually recommend Biore Ice Cleanser over Klear Action.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give Klear Action a shot, because it was $20 and was like a generic brand to Proactive.</li>
            <li> - Medications are the same, but Klear Action&#x27;s Face wash has no micro scrubbers.  </li>
            <li> I was doing moderately well using Neutrogena products when I decided to try Klear Action.  </li>
            <li> The only change over the month I have been using Klear Action is a noticeable drying of my skin which I have had to use a separate moisturizer to combat.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this system is not as effective as the Proactiv system I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After letting that dry for a couple minutes, I apply my Oil of Olay Regenerist cream which is also very helpful with overall complexion, softness and eradicates dryness, as well.</li>
            <li> I found Klear Action since last summer and have been using it almost on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference after only the second week using this, but note that it will take about 5 - 6 weeks of continuous use to stay completely clear.  </li>
            <li> However, this product never completely cleared any of my stubborn acne, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it works on some acne but not all of it.</li>
            <li> Despite all of that, I would still recommend Klear Action (after Biore) because it did help with minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> and I recommend 3 times a day for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> It lasts (for her) about one to two months, as packaged, which breaks down to a very affordable $15- a month.  </li>
            <li> I was worried to use a different product other than Proactive and when I heard about Klear Action.</li>
            <li> It took about a month for it to completely clear up my skin, and it didn&#x27;t aggravate my skin unlike other so-called \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; acne products.</li>
            <li> Klear Action is half the price and allows you to buy it one kit at a time, instead of \\&quot;joining a club\\&quot; and sending kits to you constantly.  </li>
            <li> Compared to Pro Activ, the Klear Action (\\&quot;KA\\&quot;) cleanser is milky and much less abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Klear Action works just as well, and costs less than 1/2 of what ProActive costs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thirty yrs old, a new mom, a long time lover of expensive facial washes/creams... who always had 99% clear skin, but that dreaded 1% bothered the heck out of me.</li>
            <li> Always take negative or positive reviews with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> I have been a dedicated user of the Klear Action system but also continue to purchase the Proactive mask which is expensive but lasts a really long time and is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but it keeps my skin clear and SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily religiously and will not bother trying any other product.  </li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for a few years before trying Klear Action.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s really no point -- especially with the price differential.</li>
            <li> I used to use proactiv and stopped twice for long periods because it kept drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> did not clear up all acne.</li>
            <li> as frustrating as it is, but it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li> I do still have some black heads on my nose, but black heads in other areas are much diminished!</li>
            <li> big pimples are hard to clear up with this treatment</li>
            <li> I started applying once a day instead of twice, but it didn&#x27;t matter, my skin kept getting dry</li>
            <li> to dry.      </li>
            <li> My blemishes were under control, to a point, but my skin was constantly dry.  </li>
            <li> not at all dry (even with the benzoyl peroxide in the repairing lotion).  </li>
            <li> you wouldn&#x27;t think twice about applying it every single night.  </li>
            <li> Whether this helps the Klear Action work, I am not sure, but it makes my skin soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry, very cold climate with extreme wind almost constantly so the drying was a bad side effect but might be more sought for other users in more humid climates.     </li>
            <li> I notice the same results from Proactive as I do with Klear Action except I notice that Klear Action doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin near as bad as Proactive did.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I would have in using this product is that it will discolor turtlenecks and other colored clothing that it comes in contact with (even after the lotion is dry on your skin), due to the peroxide in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv and Klear Action works just as well, but at half the cost!!</li>
            <li> my only problem is that they don&#x27;t sell it locally where i am, so while i&#x27;m waiting for it to ship i usually break out.</li>
            <li> In winter months my skin gets very dry</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this system is that the acne repair lotion (the small bottle) absolutely destroys clothes and towels.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this product works as expected for the price.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I could start seeing the results and after a month or so all my acne was gone and hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Proactiv, but the price and the commitment to their \\&quot;club\\&quot; was not really up my alley.  </li>
            <li> What I really do not like about this cleanser is that its extremely overdrying.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered extreme acne.</li>
            <li> The face wash doesn&#x27;t have the little crystals in it, which I actually prefer because the crystals in Proactive is a little harsher on my skin</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other \\&quot;acne system\\&quot;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s possible my skin has become dependent on it to stay clear (which is unfortunate)</li>
            <li> For half the price it works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Over a few weeks my skin felt softer and the breakouts are minimal.</li>
            <li> Also, I use a sugar scrub once every other day before the cleanser to help remove dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Klear Action for at least a couple years now and am having a hard time finding it in stores.  </li>
            <li> and it was half the cost of Proactive.</li>
            <li> This product is almost identical to the Proactiv solution advertised in magazines, yet it is less then half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it worked so well for the other people here, maybe it was just my skin.</li>
            <li> I switched because Proactiv was just getting too expensive, and the fact that Klear Action is half the price appealed to me.  </li>
            <li> I then tried something called Acne Free from University Medical Products, which was just terrible -- it was super-drying and the \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; was no lotion at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been using proactive for 5 years and decided I waqs tired of spending $46 every ten weeks.</li>
            <li> And the moisturizer does not work on extremely dried out skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique 3 step, Proactiv Treatment system, and even Alpha Hydroxy and prefer Klear Action,  because it&#x27;s not too expensive</li>
            <li> It also dried my skin out pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> with that being said though my acne has NOT improved even a little bit!  </li>
            <li> After using the face wash and toner, I apply a small amount of Grapeseed Oil to my face.</li>
            <li> So, long story short I was getting frustrated.</li>
            <li> - Expensive, 3 piece kit would cost about $45.00 and it would last about 4 months.          </li>
            <li> Within a week, completely clear and I was in bad shape.</li>
            <li> I switched from using Oxy Pads to this after the Oxy Pads simply weren&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try other products, though, because I do think that Proactiv is just too expensive.</li>
            <li> The other day, while we were driving along in the car and she was peering into the vanity mirror, she casually announced, \\&quot;Mom</li>
            <li> I also noticed a very small amount of graininess in the treatment lotion.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who had a serious breakout.</li>
            <li> sibling suffers from worse acne and uses Proactiv with about the same results.  </li>
            <li> however i recently broke out during my period really badly</li>
            <li> I think it is actually worse.  </li>
            <li> My acne has not improved, or has it gotten worse.     </li>
            <li> Even after thoroughly washing my hands its destructive power remains.  </li>
            <li> Who suffers?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I was worried that if I changed my skin care regimend my face would breakout really bad.</li>
            <li> I just bought it for my brother (who has bad acne) to see how it works on him.  </li>
            <li> I dont have bad Acne, but I did tend to break out 2-3 times a month before I started useing proactiv.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you never used Proactiv, you might get some benefit from this, but if you used Proactiv before, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> She hated it, and it did not help her at all.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always suffered extreme acne. I&#x27;ve been through 2 rounds of Acutane in my lifetime and Klear Action is the best face cleaning system I&#x27;ve found out there to control my acne and keep my skin clear without having to go back to the dermatologist for more prescriptions. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 years now with great results! I would recommend Klear Action to anyone with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My wife was using Proactiv, but we decided to try and save some money and try this.     But it is not even close to the quality of Proactiv.  She hated it, and it did not help her at all.    In this case, you definitely get what you pay for.   I suppose if you never used Proactiv, you might get some benefit from this, but if you used Proactiv before, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for a few years before trying Klear Action.  I switched because Proactiv was just getting too expensive, and the fact that Klear Action is half the price appealed to me.  It is a pretty good system, and my skin is fairly blemish free.  I do still get a few here and there and the condition of my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as good as it was with Proactiv. But because of the price, I&#x27;ll probably continue to use Klear Action.</li>
            <li> I was worried to use a different product other than Proactive and when I heard about Klear Action. I was worried that if I changed my skin care regimend my face would breakout really bad. I tried Klear Action because it said it was just like Proactive and it was half the cost of Proactive. The Klear Action face wash is much better than Proactive because it isn&#x27;t watery when it gets wet like Proactive does and it isn&#x27;t so gritty either. I notice the same results from Proactive as I do with Klear Action except I notice that Klear Action doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin near as bad as Proactive did. The only complaint I have about Klear Action is that the scent is a little overwhelming at first but that was just my reaction to it, now the scent doesn&#x27;t bug me. I have suffered from acne for many years and I still do, Klear Action and Proactive have not cured my acne but they keep my skin under control. I am very happy to have found Klear Action because I can afford it and I don&#x27;t have to worry about money when I buy Klear Action like I did when I used Proactive.</li>
            <li> Having tried tons of stuff all my life, I was not to hopeful.  Still i figured I would give it a try and it worked great for me.  Perhaps it is my age is a factor.  I am now 35.  I have had acne all my life.  Recently it seemed to be flaring up.  So, i tried this and damn IT WORKED PERFECT.  It did not bother my skin either. I am sooooo happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using proactive for 5 years and decided I waqs tired of spending $46 every ten weeks. Anways,I have been using the Klear Action for about 2 weeks and I immediately broke out. The face wash doesn&#x27;t have the little crystals in it, which I actually prefer because the crystals in Proactive is a little harsher on my skin then I would like however, I am willing to deal with that as long as I am not breaking out. I am going back to Proactive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son who has a real problem with acne. He tried it for a month and it made a big difference in his appearance. We just ordered another one. It&#x27;s much cheaper than other treatments advertised and it really works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv and Klear Action works just as well, but at half the cost!!</li>
            <li> ive been using klear action for years now, and it clears my skin up nicely. acne seems to be hereditary in my family and this is the only thing that works for me. my only problem is that they don&#x27;t sell it locally where i am, so while i&#x27;m waiting for it to ship i usually break out. it&#x27;s possible my skin has become dependent on it to stay clear (which is unfortunate) however i recently broke out during my period really badly and once i received my klear action, my skin was dramatically clearer in two days! i would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Klear Action is the best acne product I&#x27;ve used and has definitely helped my mild to moderate acne. It definitely dries out your skin a little bit, mostly because of the toner, so I use a couple of other products in conjunction with Klear Action to limit the dryness. After using the face wash and toner, I apply a small amount of Grapeseed Oil to my face. Grapeseed Oil is classified as an essential oil and is very light and won&#x27;t clog your pores. It makes your skin feel very soft and I have almost zero dryness. After applying the Grapeseed Oil I apply the third step of Klear Action, the lotion. After letting that dry for a couple minutes, I apply my Oil of Olay Regenerist cream which is also very helpful with overall complexion, softness and eradicates dryness, as well. This is the best system I&#x27;ve used and I used to use ProActiv and there&#x27;s really no point -- especially with the price differential.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who had a serious breakout. It cleared most of her face except for the area in the forehead. It may be that she didn&#x27;t use it twice a day. She only used it at night. I have occasional break outs especially in the summer. It really works for me. I will give it a 5 star for myself. But for my daughter who is 15 years old, it&#x27;s not 100% improvement. I would say it improved 85%.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of price, pure and simple.  I just could not afford the Proactiv and was looking for something else.  Unfortunately, this system is not as effective as the Proactiv system I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The lotion does help with the dryness.  The scrub does help with some of the smaller pimples. but overall these products are just okay.  They are not as good as Proactiv.  This system does not include a mask which is one of the things I like best about Proactiv since it seems to clear up bad pimples very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the system is better than just soap-and-water, but it&#x27;s not the solution I was looking for.  I&#x27;m going to try other products, though, because I do think that Proactiv is just too expensive.</li>
            <li> The first few days, I was sure this was a great product.  It actually felt good on my skin, I didn&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer afterward, which I always do.  But after a few weeks, my skin wasn&#x27;t looking any better, and it was getting really dry.  I started applying once a day instead of twice, but it didn&#x27;t matter, my skin kept getting dry and I kept getting pimples.  After five weeks, I had to discontinue use.  I&#x27;m not sure why it worked so well for the other people here, maybe it was just my skin.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product.  My son used Proactive for several months with good results but I saw a review for Klear Action and thought we would give it a try.  According to my son the Klear Action works just as good as the higher priced Proactiv.  My son is very conscious about his acne so if the Klear Action had not been working as well as Proactiv he would have refused to use it and would have gone back.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This product is better than Proactive because it works the same, but its cheaper!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this Acne Treatment System. I have been using it every day and have had two pimples over the last 2-months. I am no longer breaking out around &amp;quot;THAT time of the Month&amp;quot; and my blemishes have lightened. . . this is a great buy and I love it</li>
            <li> In my 26 years I have tried numerous over the counter and prescription products. I used Retin-A, tetracycline, erthromyacin, benzoyl peroxide, etc. I used accutane at 18 and worked wonders for me for several years. However, at 26 the acne is creeping back up again, and accutane is not an option any longer (TTC and rumored to be taken off the market.) So, long story short I was getting frustrated. I bought klear action and was impressed. It works quite well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much. I&#x27;m impressed, good results and a decent value. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products that promise results, but don&#x27;t deliver.    This one does! It took about a month for it to completely clear up my skin, and it didn&#x27;t aggravate my skin unlike other so-called \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; acne products. The stress of school, work, and taking care of two small children was really taking a toll on my skin, and I&#x27;m so happy I took a gamble on this budget friendly product. I will never again use Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Oxy, Neutrogena, etc. This is a definite must for easily irritated, acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> nice and cheap. did not clear up all acne. big pimples are hard to clear up with this treatment</li>
            <li> My 12 year-old daughter, who has the biological body of a 16 year-old, had been seeing a dermatologist since she was 10 (she had already been living with acne since she was 9). None of the prescription medications worked, even though she faithfully stuck with the various routines. She just got more pimples and peeling red skin. She drank lots of water, ate healthy foods like salads and fruit, exercised--despite her best attempts, nothing would improve her complexion. After 2 years of red, peeling, skin and more pimples, she was disheartened and hopeless. &lt;BR&gt;     Out of desperation I purchased the KlearAction kit for her, and were we ever surprised to see that IT ACTUALLY WORKS.  She had to play around with the routine for a while to get optimum results. For example, in the winter she does 1 facial wash and only 1 lotion application per day, while in summer she does 2 washes and 2 lotion applications daily.   She found that the toner was too strong for her face, but we put it on her back and that clears up the acne situation there. &lt;BR&gt;      The other day, while we were driving along in the car and she was peering into the vanity mirror, she casually announced, \\&quot;Mom, do you know I have one of the best complexions of all the girls in my school?\\&quot;  &lt;BR&gt;       I have nothing but positive comments to make about this product, which I understand is basically a generic rendition of ProActive, at 1/2 the price.   It lasts (for her) about one to two months, as packaged, which breaks down to a very affordable $15- a month.  I urge you to try it!</li>
            <li> I used Pro Activ for three years before giving up, as it just didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I then tried something called Acne Free from University Medical Products, which was just terrible -- it was super-drying and the \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; was no lotion at all.  It actually gave me acne breakouts.  (Any class action lawyers here?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was browsing drugstore.com and saw this product called Klear Action.  Reviews were pretty positive, so I ordered a set from Amazon.  Compared to Pro Activ, the Klear Action (\\&quot;KA\\&quot;) cleanser is milky and much less abrasive.  I really liked it more than the Pro Activ (\\&quot;PA\\&quot;) cleanser.  The KA toner seems to be a little more stringent than the PA toner, but not unduly so on my skin which is a little bit more sensitive than the normal face (according to my dermatologist).  The KA repair lotion is more watery than the PA lotion, but it disappears once applied to the face, unlike the PA lotion which would stay visible for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does this work?  I think it really depends on the person.  There are two aspects to consider here: 1) first, the KA set seems quite gentle so it should be okay for most face, and it seems to be working better than PA in getting rid of my acnes; however, it does not seem to be able to prevent pimples, which disappoints me; 2) second, pimples are like bacteria: after a while, they start resisting the treatment and will persist no matter what anti-acne product you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, Klear Action can keep my pimples under control.  [...]</li>
            <li> The cleanser and the cream work well. They prevent the gigantic ones, thought occasionally I still get tiny ones.</li>
            <li> This product has made me pimple free...I am 27 years old. &lt;br /&gt;It took 8 weeks to start working on me(twice a day).  I am glad I was that consistent in using it. &lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it recently, just to see if my skin had improved on its own.  But my pimples came back so I am using it again daily.  I have tried many products and this is the only one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> When I started using this cleanser, I started to see results in a week. Thats pretty good for my acne! I don&#x27;t get alot of acne, but when I do, it stays with me forever. However, this product never completely cleared any of my stubborn acne, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it works on some acne but not all of it. What I really do not like about this cleanser is that its extremely overdrying. And the moisturizer does not work on extremely dried out skin. I don&#x27;t know if the toner helped at all, but if you want to save money, just buy the cleanser if you can. I would actually recommend Biore Ice Cleanser over Klear Action. You can buy it right in the grocery store, not online and it only cost $5.99 for 6.7 oz. I saw a difference in my skin tone with Biore Ice Cleanser but not with Klear Action. Another minor negative thing about Klear Action product is that it doesn&#x27;t lather too well, making you think you need more soap which uses the product up quicker. Despite all of that, I would still recommend Klear Action (after Biore) because it did help with minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used &amp;quot;Proactive&amp;quot; but I couldn&#x27;t imagine it working much better. I&#x27;d previously consistently had one or two blemishes, but after a few weeks with Klear Action, I&#x27;ve been totally clear *knock on wood*. I&#x27;m currently blemish free and my skin is extremely soft. Definitely use a moisturizer with SPF if you&#x27;re going out during the day and I recommend 3 times a day for the first few weeks. Now I just keep it up twice a day to make sure zits don&#x27;t come back. It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff. I&#x27;ve heard Proactive is good, but why join a &amp;quot;club&amp;quot; and pay twice as much?</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive....and yes it works!  But it runs about $40.  I thought I&#x27;d give Klear Action a shot, because it was $20 and was like a generic brand to Proactive. I have to say from my experience.....it works... I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but it keeps my skin clear and SUPER soft. I just bought it for my brother (who has bad acne) to see how it works on him.  Save the 20 bucks, buy the Klear Action!!!!</li>
            <li> Nope, not if you&#x27;re using Klear Action it isn&#x27;t! WOW about sums it up! I&#x27;m thirty yrs old, a new mom, a long time lover of expensive facial washes/creams... who always had 99% clear skin, but that dreaded 1% bothered the heck out of me. Add in that my darling husband isn&#x27;t as blessed as I have been with my skin, and he needed some help! I was considering proactiv but with most of our income going to diapers price was a big consideration so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Thank goodness I did, my face is perfect now, my husband&#x27;s looks infinately better and its so easy to use with only 3 quick little steps (although I&#x27;d add a good moisturizer with sunblook, especially love Olay 7x). Can&#x27;t go wrong here give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I am 24 years of age, and I have been using proactiv for about 2 years.  I dont have bad Acne, but I did tend to break out 2-3 times a month before I started useing proactiv.  I have always just washed my face with regular store bought acne wash, and it never seemed to help much.  PROACTIV is a great product, when all 3 main items (Face-Wash,Toner,Lotion) are used daily it is very effective in controlling break outs and the size of pimples.  I take showers at night, so I would keep the Face-Wash in the shower, after I shampoo I would wash my face...and it worked perfectly in the shower.  I would then apply some toner with a cotton ball after getting out of the shower.  Right before I go to bed, I would apply the Lotion (the Medication) which would take 30-45 sec. to dry.      I have been useing Proactiv for almost 2 years and my acne is almost always under control.  Even tho these 2 kits seem like alot of work, after you start seeing the big differnces in your skin after using them you wouldn&#x27;t think twice about applying it every single night.  MY skin took about 2-3 weeks of getting use to the product before I started to see huge results and trust me I was happy with them.....very happy.      Proactiv Solution:  - Great Product, when used correctly and daily.  - I could see huge results after 2-3 weeks of use.  - Great for oily skin, not to harsh for my med type of skin.  - Expensive, 3 piece kit would cost about $45.00 and it would last about 4 months.          Klear Action Acne Treatment:  - Also a Great Product, same exact medications as Proactiv.  - Medications are the same, but Klear Action&#x27;s Face wash has no micro scrubbers.  The toner is a differnt color and the Medication lotion is more watery.    - Bottles are not as nice as Proactiv, they tend to get \\&quot;Krusty Tops\\&quot;  - I switched to this product for about a month already, and I have noticed no change in my complextion, and my acne is still under control!!!  GREAT PRODUCT!!  - At $20.00 shipped what better deal is out there.  Give it a try.  For new users I would give it about 2-3 weeks to see a differnce in your skin.</li>
            <li> I have had mild/moderate acne from age 11 to now in my mid-twenties.  I thought I would have grown out of it, but I have not.  I began using Klear Action 10 months ago and saw results w/in the first week.  It has not cleared my acne completely, but has improved it greatly minimizing breakouts, and making my skin soft and less embarrassing.  This product has been great for me and makes me feel better about my skin.  &lt;br /&gt;My sibling suffers from worse acne and uses Proactiv with about the same results.  Klear Action is half the price and allows you to buy it one kit at a time, instead of \\&quot;joining a club\\&quot; and sending kits to you constantly.  In winter months my skin gets very dry so I only use Klear Action once a day with a good rich oil-free moisturizer w/ SPF.  In the summer months I use it twice a day with a light oil-free moisturizer w/ SPF.  A kit lasts me about 2-3 months.  Also, I use a sugar scrub once every other day before the cleanser to help remove dead skin.  Whether this helps the Klear Action work, I am not sure, but it makes my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints about this product are that the Toner bottle, if tipped, LEAKS (so put it in another container or Ziploc if traveling), and that the products in the kit are not sold (to my knowledge) separately.  You have to buy a whole new kit.</li>
            <li> Hormonal fluctations thru out the month cause my skin to breakout constantly. I wanted to try ProActiv, but I simply couldn&#x27;t bring myself to make the commitment or spend the money. After reading reviews I decided to give Klear Action a try, and I am glad I did. I didn&#x27;t have to order it and wait for it in the mail. Stores like Target and Walgreens sell it for $19.99. You get the cleanser, toner, and repair lotion in one kit, so I think the cost is reasonable.   I started out using it once a day, since I normally dry out with most cleansers. The first thing I notice was that my coloring and texture were evening out. My skin felt smooth and I was not so blotchy red. Over a few weeks my skin felt softer and the breakouts are minimal. BREAKOUTS STILL HAPPEN, BUT MUCH LESS AND CLEAR UP VERY QUICKLY. After a few months of use, I can honestly say this is a great product. I have had such progress with once a day that I have raised it to twice and am still liking the results. I am now including Oil of Olay&#x27;s Total Effects Moisturizer in my regimen to decrease those fine lines and wrinkles. They work well together. My skin feels better and looks better, dare I say...younger even.  For twenty dollars it is definately worth giving a try!</li>
            <li> My husband originally wanted to order proactiv, but we do not like to purchase these types of products on an \\&quot;auto -ship\\&quot; deal, especially if we decide we don&#x27;t like it. This product is excellent, has cleared up his skin and he still has plenty left. The price is much better than \\&quot;Proactiv\\&quot; and the best part is that we can order as he needs it, not on \\&quot;auto ship\\&quot;! Would recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I switched from using Oxy Pads to this after the Oxy Pads simply weren&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  When I use Klear regularly (cleanser + toner twice a day) I get no break outs whatsoever.  My only complaint about this system is that the acne repair lotion (the small bottle) absolutely destroys clothes and towels.  I keep ending up with bright orange and red spots on shirts and towels because of it.  Even after thoroughly washing my hands its destructive power remains.  Overall though the benefit of being acne free outweighs the cost of a couple towels and a few shirts.    One piece of advice you buy this, don&#x27;t put any acne repair lotion on your neck or underneath your chin.  Your skin will come in contact with your shirt at some point and your collar will be stained and ruined.</li>
            <li> I am 34 and have never had acne before.  Now at this stage in life it is a problem.  I ordered Klear Action with hope of a cure.  However, I have been on it now for 5 weeks and the only thing I can say that is positive about it is that it has evened out my skin color and made my skin glow without make up. with that being said though my acne has NOT improved even a little bit!  I think it is actually worse.  I am glad it worked for others I was just not one of them!</li>
            <li> I tried the treatment after having used Proactiv a couple of years ago.  Somewhat effective at preventing break-outs but doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as P-activ.  For half the price it works as expected.  If you are looking for immediate and noticable treatment go with P-activ.  Otherwise this product works as expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since 4th grade.  Despite being told I&#x27;d \\&quot;grow out of it\\&quot;, I still have it at age 23.  I&#x27;ve tried what feels like every over-the-counter product available.  I was doing moderately well using Neutrogena products when I decided to try Klear Action.  After 3 weeks most of the blotchyness was gone.  After 2 months I had about 2-5 pimples a month that came and WENT QUICKLY. At the 4 month mark I tried to be cheap and use AcneFree.  Big Mistake.  All my progress went bye-bye.  I went back to Klear Action and am VERY pleased with the results.  I can finally wear red or burgundy with out it bringing out redness in my face!  I use it twice daily religiously and will not bother trying any other product.  This truely works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems since college with acne on the sides of my face.  Seems like I could never be totally clear of it.  I found Klear Action since last summer and have been using it almost on a daily basis.  After a few weeks I could start seeing the results and after a month or so all my acne was gone and hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> for anyone who thinks proactiv is too strong.  &lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review for anything, but wanted people to know how well this product worked for me. I used to use proactiv and stopped twice for long periods because it kept drying out my skin. I tried this product because it was half priced and available at the drug store, but to my surprise, I have never had better skin! I highly recommend this product for the people who did not get the promised results from proactiv, give this a try. If proactiv works, stick with it, the price is worth the better skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Klear Action for at least a couple years now and am having a hard time finding it in stores.  I had been buying it at Walgreens but can&#x27;t even find it on their shelves anymore.  I should add, the ProActive Acne System works, I&#x27;ve used it.  Klear Action works just as well, and costs less than 1/2 of what ProActive costs.  I have been a dedicated user of the Klear Action system but also continue to purchase the Proactive mask which is expensive but lasts a really long time and is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This product is almost identical to the Proactiv solution advertised in magazines, yet it is less then half the price. All the ingredients are the same, infact you get more product in the toner. If you have problems with acne and oil, this is a product you should try.</li>
            <li> This has been the best product for clear skin I&#x27;ve ever found.  I&#x27;ve used Clinique 3 step, Proactiv Treatment system, and even Alpha Hydroxy and prefer Klear Action,  because it&#x27;s not too expensive and it keeps my skin clear around the clock.  I noticed a big difference after only the second week using this, but note that it will take about 5 - 6 weeks of continuous use to stay completely clear.  When I first started using Klear Action, I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it. Comparing it to Proactiv (my favorite till I found this), I noticed the deep pore cleanser was a more diluted product and seemed to have less graininess for that bit of facial scrub consistency.  I also noticed a very small amount of graininess in the treatment lotion.  This ended up being no problem at all because, to me, Klear Action cleared my skin better than the proactiv.  The only drawback I would have in using this product is that it will discolor turtlenecks and other colored clothing that it comes in contact with (even after the lotion is dry on your skin), due to the peroxide in it (Proactiv does the same).  If I want to wear turtlenecks, I only wear white or off-white.  I actually have learned to stay away from mock-necks and turtlenecks almost altogether. :) It will also lighten hair it comes in contact with.  I still give this product 5 stars because completely clear skin makes the clothing issue and lighter hair such a trivial matter.</li>
            <li> Right after the birth of my daughter, my skin seemed to be miraculously clear for the first time in my life, but as the hormones re-balanced themselves, I started to break out on my cheeks and chin.  My blemishes were under control, to a point, but my skin was constantly dry.  I wanted to try Proactiv, but the price and the commitment to their \\&quot;club\\&quot; was not really up my alley.  I decided to buy Klear Action instead.  I have been using this product for less than a week and my skin looks great, and not at all dry (even with the benzoyl peroxide in the repairing lotion).  I have to say that I truly love this product.  It has given me the skin I&#x27;ve always wanted.  I would highly recommend this to anyone considering Proactiv.  The price is great, and the results - FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I have been using clear action now for about 2 months. I noticed an improvement almost immediately, and now I RARELY have a pimple, and if I do get one, it is short-lived, not painful, etc. I do still have some black heads on my nose, but black heads in other areas are much diminished! I have never tried any other \\&quot;acne system\\&quot; so I can&#x27;t really compare, but this did it for me. It was pretty drying to my skin, but only for the first week or two. Now I have no irritation whatsoever. My only warning to users is: this will bleach your clothes/pillow case, towel, etc. Make sure you aren&#x27;t wearing something nice when you wash your face! I have ruined several shirts this way! Now I am much more careful!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for whoever is interested in ProActiv. This is the almost the same type of system. If you are interested give it a try. Im sure many have tried so many methods. My only problem is that it says it can cause sunburn easily so make sure you wear sunblock! stick to it reguarly and you will most likely be happy with it. Remember, patience is the key! Don&#x27;t give it one, two, or three weeks to change your life. Give it a month or so.. or more.. these things take time.. as frustrating as it is, but it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 1 month now and I have not noticed a difference.  I do not have severe acne but once a week or so I will get a noticeable blemish or two and was hoping that by using this product regularly I could prevent breakouts.   In the month I have been using this package I will use the wash, astringent and moisturizer once in the morning and once again before I go to bed. My acne has not improved, or has it gotten worse.     The only change over the month I have been using Klear Action is a noticeable drying of my skin which I have had to use a separate moisturizer to combat. I live in a very dry, very cold climate with extreme wind almost constantly so the drying was a bad side effect but might be more sought for other users in more humid climates.     I gave this product 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t really help, and it didn&#x27;t really hurt. I was tempted by the price tag of this product which was much less than that of other acne packages, but maybe if I had paid more money I would have gotten more noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv. For me it did absolutly nothing. I then tried Klear Action. Within a week, completely clear and I was in bad shape. And I didn&#x27;t get a credit charge each month. Now Klear Action is discontinued because \\&quot;it is a health hazard\\&quot;. And Proactiv is not? Get real. Proactiv just used lower grade but same ingredients. Start Klear Action once a day or longer with sensitive skin. I could finally use it twice a day. After a week it cleared up. A couple of weeks later I did it again. It got to be longer and longer between treatments. I could easily go a month or two before using another shorter treatment before it was discontinued. Why? Negative reviews. Always take negative or positive reviews with a grain of salt. Their are firms and individuals that can post thousands of reviews everywhere on the net. In fact lets say a large corporation like Proactiv could hire such a firm or their own employees to put a smaller but better company and competition out of business. The American way. Who suffers? The consumer. Watch the reviews and do your homework.</li>
            <li> I wish they would bring this product back on the market, it worked great and made dark spot fade faithfully.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well for me as Proactiv.  The cleanser does not do a great job of exfoliating, and the toner was a bit harsh.  It also dried my skin out pretty badly.  I will not purchase this system again.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it seemed to work for the first week, but after that my acne was back as normal.  I continued on trying it for over a month.  As with many acne products I find - they seem to go ineffective for me after a short time.</li>
            <li> Always loved this stuff!! It&#x27;s like a generic of Pro Active but for me this worked much better than the name brand stuff!! Def recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I love it great product A + + + + +  + + + + + + + ++ +</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.  It&#x27;s the best acne system out there, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s cheaper than ProActiv but works just as well.  It&#x27;s a shame that Walgreens has discontinued it.</li>
