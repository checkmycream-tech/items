            <li>Love the brush on this mascara!!  </li>
            <li>The ball aplicator is a great feature :) works great!</li>
            <li>, I abuse my eyes all day (and wear contacts) and this stuff is really good.</li>
            <li>I loved this mascara, but it&#x27;s going away</li>
            <li>A good product.  </li>
            <li>not found in any stores in my area any more.very happy to find it on amozon..will order more sometime soon..</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>Then to top it off I had a severe allergic reaction to it!</li>
            <li>Now that its not I buy 4-5 just to make sure I always have one!</li>
            <li>I loved the ball on the end of the wand and wanted to buy more; however, no stores carry it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never understand how, when a product isn&#x27;t available when you&#x27;re looking for it, the interpretation is that it isn&#x27;t successful.  </li>
            <li>My own fault for not reading how many items were included.</li>
            <li>I love the ball-shaped brush -it is definitively an improvement to avoid clumps after applying the product on your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Would buy it again when I&#x27;m done with this one :)</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, but, as manufacturer&#x27;s tend to do, just when you discover something, they stop making it.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I am pleased and hey, you should give it a try too.</li>
            <li>So glad you have it.</li>
            <li>I love the non-waterproof version of this mascara</li>
            <li>Pretty durable water and smudge wise</li>
            <li>This comes off  more easily.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>However, I am happy to have the round brush, because they no longer make this mascara, and I am hoping I can use the brush with another kind on mascara.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t buy it often if it isn&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li>I got this on sale, and I wouldn&#x27;t ever pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>shipment and price was the only good part about the purchase.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those with fine lashes as it covers and seperates every lash even the tiny ones in the inner and outer corners with no mess.</li>
            <li>AND it is so much cheaper buying this product on line than in drugstore, &amp; it ia always available on line.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize till it came I that I had paid twice the amount it was worth.</li>
            <li>To the point, I was a big skeptic and was drawn in by the statement \\&quot;smudge free, flake free, clump free\\</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and everything was as described.</li>
            <li>This wand is by far the best at obtaining long (long) fanned out lashes.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t opened all the way just the top till where the blue ends.</li>
            <li>at first i think it is a good present to my friend , then i feel embarrassed to give it to her , so i have to use this ,the plastic cover is plug out of cotton back immediately on first touch ,  </li>
            <li>Good for getting the small lashes</li>
            <li>My lashes look sexy, makes my eyes look mysterious and glamourus, I highly recommend if your a mascara chic like me</li>
            <li>It is absolutely waterproof and doesn&#x27;t run when my eyes tear.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li>I bought this when it was still available at all local stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because, the brush seems to work really well</li>
            <li>but the product itself needs much improvement.</li>
            <li>Got to me fast must admit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent mascara, I think, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>It applied really well and made my eyelashes look amazingly long and full.</li>
            <li>I could tell the product was still new.</li>
            <li>It works so well and it leaves your lashes looking longer and natural!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara &amp; the wand makes it SO esy to get lashes covered that are hard to reach.</li>
            <li>All in all, what I like about it is that it leaves my lashes looking natural</li>
            <li>You just might be surprised.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve EVER seen in my many years!!!&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, not sure if the product was good or not because as small as the haha, brush was, would have taken at least 20 minutes for just ONE eye</li>
            <li>It thickens only the slightest bit which is why I said it makes your lashes look longer and natural.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was due to my contacts, but then I wore it without and got the same sensation.</li>
            <li>It goes on very clumpy and I agree with other posters about the flecks of mascara that crumble off as the day wears on.</li>
            <li>HOW EASILY IT WAS RUBBED OFF IRRITATING TO EYES</li>

            <li> if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin this product is not good - it&#x27;s a dry clumpy mess that will flake off before the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THE OTHER IT</li>
            <li> The brush sucks and mascara barely comes out of the tube.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have nearly the time for that!!!&lt;br /&gt;Bummer, waste of my hard earned money</li>
            <li> By the end of the day my eye lids were itchy, puffy, red &amp; irritated:o( Even after removing the mascara, which was no easy feat to get off my eyes - it took a few days to recover from the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It get all the little lashes, even in the corners and bottom.</li>
            <li> This mascara had the smallest little ball shape on the end of it</li>
            <li> The product had never been opened, but it had dried out a lot</li>
            <li> However, after a couple of a hours my eyes started to burn and my eyelashes felt sort of heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to apply because of this clumping/brush problem.</li>
            <li> Amazon came through as usual.  </li>
            <li> the brush is too small</li>
            <li> After I had placed my order I saw a whole bunch of negative reviews and thought \\&quot;Oh crap, I just wasted 7 bucks on this stuff.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really difficult to get any mascara out of it.</li>
            <li> I was proved wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sold in stores or very difficult to find now.</li>
            <li> I had horrible clumps,and the formula was dry and had a very bad odor.</li>
            <li> WAS SHOCKED</li>
            <li> this is the bad decide of buying , never buy !</li>

            <li> I got this on sale, and I wouldn&#x27;t ever pay full price for it. I think the brush is the problem, but this product clumps lashes together. It&#x27;s not easy to apply because of this clumping/brush problem. It&#x27;s decent mascara, I think, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I loved the ball on the end of the wand and wanted to buy more; however, no stores carry it.  Amazon came through as usual.  This is the perfect mascara.  Some stay on too well and pull your eyelashes out when you pick at it.  This comes off  more easily.  I have been using RapidLash and my eyelashes are longer and thicker.  I like the way this wand gets to all the small new eyelashes.  I&#x27;m a ball end convert.</li>
            <li> It works well. It&#x27;s not sold in stores or very difficult to find now. The package was opened when I received it</li>
            <li> This looked like great mascara till I received it, as soon as I used it I did not like it.  the brush is too small</li>
            <li> I love the ball-shaped brush -it is definitively an improvement to avoid clumps after applying the product on your eyelashes. It stays all day long and it&#x27;s easy to remove. Would buy it again when I&#x27;m done with this one :)</li>

            <li> I love this mascara, but, as manufacturer&#x27;s tend to do, just when you discover something, they stop making it.  I&#x27;ll never understand how, when a product isn&#x27;t available when you&#x27;re looking for it, the interpretation is that it isn&#x27;t successful.  There&#x27;s a disconnect between what makes it to the shelves and how the consumer likes the product.  I can&#x27;t buy it often if it isn&#x27;t available.  I loved this mascara, but it&#x27;s going away and that&#x27;s the reason I bought all I could on Amazon.  Oh well!</li>
            <li> ONE WAS OPENED  I TRIED THE OTHER IT FLAKES OFF GETS INTO EYES FOR WATERPROOF  WAS SHOCKED HOW EASILY IT WAS RUBBED OFF IRRITATING TO EYES AS THE FLAKING CAUSES IT TO GET IN EYES</li>
            <li> A good product.  I don&#x27;t care for the applicator.  I like a brush type.  Gave this product a try but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> The product had never been opened, but it had dried out a lot and it&#x27;s really difficult to get any mascara out of it. However, I am happy to have the round brush, because they no longer make this mascara, and I am hoping I can use the brush with another kind on mascara.</li>
            <li> To the point, I was a big skeptic and was drawn in by the statement \\&quot;smudge free, flake free, clump free\\&quot; so I decided to give it a try. After I had placed my order I saw a whole bunch of negative reviews and thought \\&quot;Oh crap, I just wasted 7 bucks on this stuff.\\&quot; I was proved wrong. It works so well and it leaves your lashes looking longer and natural! It truly doesn&#x27;t clump or flake or smudge so it definetely keeps its promises. A couple of things though, it is NOT for on-the-go-rush-people or for thickening. It thickens only the slightest bit which is why I said it makes your lashes look longer and natural. And if you&#x27;re on the go, you&#x27;re probably going to get it all over your face. This is a mascara to take your time on to get the effect you want. All in all, what I like about it is that it leaves my lashes looking natural and I don&#x27;t even have to curl them on a daily basis! All I have to do is apply this and bam, out the door. Either way, I am pleased and hey, you should give it a try too. You just might be surprised.</li>
            <li> The brush sucks and mascara barely comes out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered with the plastic overlay pulled away from the cardboard backing which could allow anyone to tamper with&lt;br /&gt; the product.  It might also indicate that the prod was a return from another customer.  If this was the case with one unit then it might be a fluke, however I ordered 3 and all of them were in the same condition.  Afraid to order more.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great. I have ordered others but I always go back to this one. The ball aplicator is a great feature :) works great!</li>
            <li> Love the brush on this mascara!!  Perfect for those with fine lashes as it covers and seperates every lash even the tiny ones in the inner and outer corners with no mess.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The applicator is round and much easier to use.  It is absolutely waterproof and doesn&#x27;t run when my eyes tear.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  So glad you have it. Now you are even cheaper than buying it elsewhere.  Will order again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame Loreal discontinued this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used and the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this as it is not in stores any longer. The packaging was taped together but I didn&#x27;t really mind that. I could tell the product was still new.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst mascara I have ever used.Such a disappointment.I had horrible clumps,and the formula was dry and had a very bad odor. shipment and price was the only good part about the purchase.My lesson is learned</li>
            <li> Los ángulos pequeño del ojo lo cubre perfectamente, dura todo el día sin necesidad de retoque, realmente funciona 100 x 100% recomendado.</li>
            <li> I love the non-waterproof version of this mascara so I decided to try the waterproof. NOT GOOD AT ALL!! It goes on very clumpy and I agree with other posters about the flecks of mascara that crumble off as the day wears on. Then to top it off I had a severe allergic reaction to it! By the end of the day my eye lids were itchy, puffy, red &amp; irritated:o( Even after removing the mascara, which was no easy feat to get off my eyes - it took a few days to recover from the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin do NOT use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin this product is not good - it&#x27;s a dry clumpy mess that will flake off before the end of the day.</li>

            <li> Good for getting the small lashes</li>
            <li> This was a great price on this mascara and it&#x27;s really good mascara as well!</li>
            <li> Great product!!  not found in any stores in my area any more.very happy to find it on amozon..will order more sometime soon..</li>
            <li> may be I never buy this mascara again , at first i think it is a good present to my friend , then i feel embarrassed to give it to her , so i have to use this ,the plastic cover is plug out of cotton back immediately on first touch ,  this is the bad decide of buying , never buy !</li>
            <li> very good will buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara at my local drugstore. It applied really well and made my eyelashes look amazingly long and full. However, after a couple of a hours my eyes started to burn and my eyelashes felt sort of heavy like there was always one in my eye. At first I thought it was due to my contacts, but then I wore it without and got the same sensation. It&#x27;s also pretty hard to get off. I&#x27;m never buying this product again. It&#x27;s a shame because, the brush seems to work really well but the product itself needs much improvement.</li>
            <li> This mascara had the smallest little ball shape on the end of it I&#x27;ve EVER seen in my many years!!!&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, not sure if the product was good or not because as small as the haha, brush was, would have taken at least 20 minutes for just ONE eye, I don&#x27;t have nearly the time for that!!!&lt;br /&gt;Bummer, waste of my hard earned money</li>
            <li> Ordered this product last week. Got to me fast must admit. But the brush area was peeled off which pissed me off. It wasn&#x27;t opened all the way just the top till where the blue ends. I&#x27;m hoping no one tampered with it.</li>
