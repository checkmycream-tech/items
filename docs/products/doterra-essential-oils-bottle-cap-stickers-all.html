            <li>What I wanted, but later found I could&#x27;ve gotten them straight from doTerra for one tenth the price.</li>
            <li>Wish they had a few more blank ones.</li>
            <li>I could only use some of the labels since they are really for a specific brand...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> you can get a page of these stickers on the doterra website for 50 cents this was 5.02 but they were the correct stickers that I needed</li>
            <li> Came so fast and love the colors to get my oils organized since they are all over the counter.</li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier to know what you have in dark bottles.  Takes the guess work out.  Plus, the stickers stay on !!</li>
            <li> These labels are so handy!</li>
            <li> Love them!! Thank u ....will order in future</li>
            <li> Framed frosting is right!! Only $0.50 on doterras website. Seller should be ashamed.</li>
            <li> Nice to have stickers that fit bottle tops. Some items could use more stickers. It would also be nice to have more blanks. Overall, no complaints! Stickers are easy to read and stick well.</li>
            <li> I love DoTerra, but why in the world would you pay this? Go to the doterra website and get them for 50 cents.  Look under accessories. http://www.mydoterra.com/tarheelmom/</li>
            <li> They are nice and very useful.  I just feel that there needs to be more stickers for some of the oils, the mostly used.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, great stickers</li>
            <li> I love the stickers I just wish it had all the oils on them! But I would buy them again</li>
            <li> I could only use some of the labels since they are really for a specific brand...</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what get. I could only use a few. More than half are not oils , but names of what- evers? Your better off getting blanks and writing in what you want.</li>
            <li> What I wanted, but later found I could&#x27;ve gotten them straight from doTerra for one tenth the price. Nothing wrong with product itself, just expensive.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for what you get</li>
            <li> These labels are very helpful when I makes own mixtures of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Names for all the lids of my doTerra Oils.  Makes it much easier to find the right oil in my storage box.</li>
            <li> Great stickers, way cheaper than ordering through Doterra!</li>
            <li> Great variety of names.</li>
            <li> So much easier to find the right bottle</li>
            <li> Great, except wish there were more blank ones for my own concoctions!</li>
            <li> Just as advertised!  Came quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use doTerra oils exclusively, however, like the fact I have preprinted labels for my oils that don&#x27;t have cap contents identified. Easier to find the oil I need.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
            <li> These labels fit well on the top of the lids of the bottles so the content of the bottle can be ready easily.</li>
            <li> I love the stickers for my smaller bottles I make to share with friends.  Perfect size and just the labels I need!</li>
            <li> These stickers are great. I don&#x27;t usually by do Terra, but they fit on other bottles as well. There are a few missing that I would like to see, but otherwise I really like these.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and as expected.</li>
            <li> Love the oils! My preschool age son has asthma. So every time he gets a cold he ends up on oxygen and sometimes the hospital. We put On Guard on his feet when any family member start to get sick, and when he goes to school. He hasn&#x27;t been sick all season.</li>
            <li> liked these-very useful...wish there were more blank  ones for combos that I make</li>
            <li> I use these for my non-doterra oils.  It covers most of the basic oils.</li>
            <li> Just got them stuck on my bottles and so far they are actually staying. Previously I order 3/4&amp;#34; labels that were supposed to be printable to make my own labels but they were a joke.  These shipped super quickly and arrived perfectly.  I like that there are numerous (like 5) labels for common oils like lavender and peppermint and that they are color coded.</li>
            <li> We do not buy doTerra essential oils because they are 2 - 7 times as expensive as Eden&#x27;s Garden and we believe that the quality is the same or at least not much different, especially when you figure the great difference in price.  However, with all of our generic bought bottles it was hard to label them.  We put them in a custom made box with the lids facing up.  These labels stick to the top and we can simply open the lid of the box and grab what we need.  Easy to use and sticks well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a greater variety of labels. I was able to use some and wrote over others to make it work. Price was good but by the time shipping was added, I spent way too much for it.</li>
            <li> Received as described</li>
            <li> I have the box organizer from doterra for my oils so a label on top is a must! Many choices</li>
            <li> I love having the pre-printed stickers and I&#x27;m so happy I found them on the site.  It&#x27;s tough writing so small!  lol  I will definately order again when I run out!  Perfect for sharing!</li>
            <li> You can but the stickers at Doterra.com for .50</li>
            <li> These work great for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; service!</li>
            <li> Great little stickers, but was disappointed to find them much cheaper elsewhere . . . .</li>
            <li> Absolutely love having these stickers to use so I can see what oils I have in my box.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> cheaper bought thru company site</li>
            <li> Way too many labels for DoTerra&#x27;s formulations. I don&#x27;t need 5 Serenity&#x27;s and no tea tree oil. ?? That makes no sense. Even if you did drink the DoTerra Kool-Aid, who needs multiples of the formulations? Wouldn&#x27;t order again. If anyone knows of a really good well thought out group of labels, let me know.</li>
            <li> Stickers are perfect to keep oils organized!  Love not having to paw through the whole box to find what I need!</li>
            <li> Perfect for labeling all my oils and oil blends.</li>
            <li> They were as expected.</li>
            <li> these were very helpful to me!!!</li>
            <li> If you have essential oil bottles. These fit perfectly on top of the bottles. You won&#x27;t have any problems at all recognizing what is in white bottles.</li>
            <li> Afforable and work great!</li>
            <li> So glad I no longer have to pick up each bottle in my bag to see what it is!</li>
            <li> Now we don&#x27;t have to pull out each bottle to see what it is. The sheet comes with multiples of each oil in case you have multiple bottles and also several blank ones.</li>
            <li> Very Helpful for Organizing. Great Price</li>
            <li> Love these oils and the labels</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful to classify for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> These are the standard essential oil cap stickers sold by doTERRA for 0.50 cents a sheet FYI to anyone considering purchasing.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to make my bottles easier to find.</li>
            <li> Just as shown.Loving the purchase! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love em! I use them on oher brands and they work just as well</li>
            <li> Knocked off three stars because shipping should NOT be outrageous to send a sheet of paper stickers that cost the buyer .50 cents or so. I&#x27;ll buy my own from Doterra from here on out. G R E E D. The product is fine by the way, sticks well, it is what it is for!</li>
            <li> great stickers, hard to use though  shipping a little longer than expected.</li>
            <li> use one on original tops so I can see content in partitioned box;&lt;br /&gt;use duplicate label on mister bottle with diluted oil version.&lt;br /&gt;Too much shipping.  Should be one shipping charge for multiple sheets</li>
            <li> Great for marking sample bottles!</li>
            <li> Love that I can open my do terra box and see what I have with these stickers!</li>
            <li> Nice quality for stickers and I like the fact that there&#x27;s multiple labels for the oil types. Now I can put these stickers on my oils and I don&#x27;t have to look at all the labels to get the oil I want to use! Time saver for me!</li>
            <li> Disappointed not enough variety</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have most of the oil names that I needed.. Money was wasted!</li>
            <li> Would like to see more blanks for blends.</li>
            <li> I love being able to see what I have in my case without having to pull out each bottle. They stay on great. When I run out, I plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li> These stickers are the exact same that came in my doTERRA kit. I&#x27;m not sure price wise what the difference is when ordering from doTERRA.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Get a better price from doterra rep. Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was</li>
            <li> You can get these stickers from a Doterra consultant for .50  This is a total rip off!  Find a rep close to you and go from there!</li>
            <li> not all the names that are needed are there</li>
            <li> I bought an oil carrying case and these labels are perfect for it.  When in a carrying case you are looking down at the oils and the names are not shown so I just added labels to the top of the cap - and I no longer have to pull out and guess which oils I need.  I have also alphabetized them so it makes it even easier to use.  Came quick as well!</li>
            <li> Would like to have more blanks.</li>
            <li> You can get these for .50 a sheet from DoTerra.</li>
            <li> great way to see what&#x27;s what when there in the Wood Box</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to search thru each bottle to find what you want...</li>
            <li> Way to expensive after researching</li>
            <li> So nice to see from the top all of light wells. I feel very organized!</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast shipping, highly recommend; thank you!</li>
            <li> I was missing DDR Prime.</li>
            <li> To expensive, nice labels.</li>
            <li> I store my oils in wooden boxes - similar to the one shown in the photo. Even though I alphabetized my oils to make them easier to find, using these stickers saves a whole lot of time and effort for quick and easy identification. I&#x27;m going to have to get more of these since I didn&#x27;t have enough of certain ones. It has made all the difference in how I use my oils since I&#x27;m not digging through 10 bottles trying to find the one I want.</li>
            <li> The entire doTerra line has become a daily must-have in my homeopathy / beauty arsenal.  I have been using the oils for over a year now for everything from bags under the eyes to antiseptic scar tissue cleansing (&amp; reducing!), arthritic pain relief &amp; allergy relief.  The doTerra bottles are being used at a rate I can&#x27;t track, so the Full Sheet of these stickers, with every blend plus blanks for your own &amp;#34;mixes of recipes&amp;#34; for your ailments is perfect for any bottle system you choose.  Keep your magical essential oils in perfect order &amp; attractive setups.  Stickers fit &amp; remove easily from all bottle tops, making identification of your oils in a display immediately practical as well as pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li> These stickers are great for using with my little sample bottles and for other oils without top stickers. Wish they had a few more blank ones.</li>
            <li> these will sure make it easier for me to reach for the correct bottle of oil!</li>
            <li> Not as many oil choices as I&#x27;d hoped, but definitely helpful to identify my oils in my new carrier case</li>
            <li> These are great bottle cap stickers....they came undamaged and when they were supposed to.  Would order them again love my oils.</li>
            <li> I really like these labels.</li>
            <li> Works great for labeling the tops for easy, visable usage of the different types of oils. Makes mixing different oils less time consuming.</li>
            <li> This product makes accessing my oils so much easier!</li>
            <li> Great. It&#x27;s a shame postage is more than product</li>
            <li> Fit perfect on all my bottles!!!</li>
            <li> Love the stickers for all my doTerra bottles.</li>
            <li> What is there to say about stickers.  I bought these but they are cheaper from the doTerra site.&lt;br /&gt;They are as they said so can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> These cap sticker labels look great.  I ordered them via two day shipping, but they were delayed for some reason.  That&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me, sometimes items are delayed by a day or so.  With these being labels and not actual oils that I needed right away, I was okay with the slight delay.  When I returned home from vacation, the labels had arrived in an envelope in the mail, and looked just fine.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> Big help for labeling essential oils!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found the do Terra products.  They relieved the pain for me better than some of the things that the Dr. Prescribed.  However, I am not stating stop your medication, that is something you have to talk over with your Dr.  These cap stickers are a must  if you have a collection of these bottles and the case to keep them in.  Makes it so much easier to find the right bottle at a glance.</li>
            <li> Some problems. Glue would not release from some stickers. Not enough blank stickers?</li>
            <li> perfect! just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to identify the oils in the case. Quick shipping! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Love these. Have more than 1 bottle of some oils , so these are great.</li>
            <li> They make locating your essential oils a breeze!!</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my Granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Found out these are alot cheaper through doTerra I paid alot more.</li>
