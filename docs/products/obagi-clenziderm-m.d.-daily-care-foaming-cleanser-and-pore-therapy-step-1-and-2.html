            <li>I have bought from this seller many time without issues</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This duo keeps skin clean and clear - its the best!</li>
            <li>It is nice and foamy and makes my face feel refreshed and clean every time.</li>
            <li>Great at keeping face clear.</li>
            <li>The pore therapy is very drying so have a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and was delivered in good shape.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is so easy to use (I keep it in the shower)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li>it s too strong.</li>
            <li>Love how cool my skin feels after I use them too.</li>
            <li>On T zine works good, on dry/ normal zone</li>
            <li>is the best products that have ever really worked for keeping your skin clean, and clear.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described:):)</li>
            <li>I love this product it cleared up my acne quickly when used once a day</li>
            <li>but I may like to use it in the very Hot TEXAS summer when it&#x27;s 105 degrees &amp; when I tend to be more oily.  </li>
            <li>Obagi Clenziderm in conjunction with Obaji Nuderm SPF 35 Lotion is the only way to keep my face happy and acne free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks like the product is still getting great reviews even since Dr. Obagi left the company...</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my teen age son including chemical peels for his acne and this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I always wanted but never achieved even with Perricone or Yonka, and My skin feels so smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The Daily Care Foaming Cleanser and Pore Therapy are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Obagi is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This probably works great for those with regular acne and is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pure hell and most of the time</li>
            <li>Works amazingly, if you get any pimples at all they clear up in a day or two.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never found a face wash system that would actually make my skim look and feel good.</li>
            <li>They feel good but the pores don&#x27;t get smaller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve trued MANY products for my oily skin and visible pores and the face wash, by far, has exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>he is consistant with his prescribed use of his products, he rarely has a&lt;br /&gt;problem</li>
            <li>As far as the product, I didn&#x27;t see top notch results</li>
            <li>Gives you a fresh and tingly almost minty feeling when you wash your skin.  </li>
            <li>With sunscreen of course ;;) I highly recommend Both of these products if you suffer from face and body acne!!!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, seems to be the real stuff .  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel fresh and clean and has not dried out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product, I don&#x27;t to wear makeup to cover up my acne!</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I went to an esthetician first and this is the skin system she uses on my face.</li>
            <li>It was also delivered in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>use this regimen during summer season and/or hot weather as my skin gets oilier during this time.</li>
            <li>But this product really cleared out my acne!</li>
            <li>I would get rid of one (but would leave a scar) only for two more to pop up.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many different products over the years and nothing compares to Obagi Clenziderm.</li>
            <li>so far I haven&#x27;t seen fantastic results</li>
            <li>husband can&#x27;t stop giving me compliments on how much better my overall skin is.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle cleanser from the dry/normal, especially in the Winter months.</li>
            <li>both use Obaji Products and really like the way it clears your skin and&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i use the gentle products</li>
            <li>I wish I would of had this in high school!</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>I guess it really works</li>
            <li>I now just go to my esthetician every two or three months for a facial peel to keep my skin looking silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep my acne under control.  </li>
            <li>I doubt if this is real.</li>
            <li>A real 2 for 1 deal .</li>
            <li>The obagi clenziderm dual pack when used on a regular basis morning and night will work fabulously for stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to go back to wearing very little make up :)</li>
            <li>It works better than any other product that I have tried.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to like this cleanser and toner more than any other acne product I have used.</li>
            <li>I compare it to my original bottle label and it&#x27;s different.</li>
            <li>thanks for such quick and fast delivery, items came just as pictured and Obagi in my opinion</li>
            <li>Leaves you with a fresher, clean, younger looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without these two!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to more consistent clear skin and few to none hormone breakouts.</li>
            <li>really does clear blemishes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has adult acne!</li>
            <li>The existing breakout started drying up, and with in a week I wasn&#x27;t getting any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>Every other day or even once a week is fine based on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>my face is so clear!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and I tend to break out more than usual.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the product and noticed a difference within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>I did.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple day of using the product her face started to clear up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on bactrim antibiotic, mineocycline, been given antibiotic face cream, and tried every over the counter acne wash and nothing seems to completely clear it up.</li>
            <li>you know that you will do and try ANYTHING to try to clear it up.</li>
            <li>When I get an occasional blemish, these products do the trick to make them go away fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is incredibly sensitive.</li>
            <li>All in all, my skin cleared up in 3.5 days, I developed that glow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through them all it seems and haven&#x27;t found that potion yet that works completely.</li>
            <li>but nothing that a few dabs of light lotion can&#x27;t help alleviate.  </li>
            <li>Controls acne on face of 40 plus adult</li>
            <li>And i decided only use it every other day and only once a day, which is much better.</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than expected and the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>this wins hands down.</li>
            <li>i really like this set, the only draw back</li>
            <li>It cleared my deep inflamed acne clear away!</li>
            <li>this seemed to be the only thing to clear my face!</li>
            <li>I was suffering from adult acne with cystic bumps and this is the only  combination that cleared it within 3-4 days!</li>
            <li>I was so tired of hiding my skin and not being able to wear tank tops.</li>
            <li>You should alternate it with something that is mild for everyday like Clinique acne soap.</li>
            <li>You may have to reduce how often you use the pore therapy due to the very drying nature of this product.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s due to the type of acne and not so much the product.</li>
            <li>The days when I was less lazy and took better care of my skin...</li>

            <li> I always wanted but never achieved even with Perricone or Yonka, and My skin feels so smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The Daily Care Foaming Cleanser and Pore Therapy are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Obagi is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This probably works great for those with regular acne and is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pure hell and most of the time</li>
            <li> Works amazingly, if you get any pimples at all they clear up in a day or two.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never found a face wash system that would actually make my skim look and feel good.</li>
            <li> They feel good but the pores don&#x27;t get smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trued MANY products for my oily skin and visible pores and the face wash, by far, has exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> he is consistant with his prescribed use of his products, he rarely has a&lt;br /&gt;problem</li>
            <li> As far as the product, I didn&#x27;t see top notch results</li>
            <li> Gives you a fresh and tingly almost minty feeling when you wash your skin.  </li>
            <li> With sunscreen of course ;;) I highly recommend Both of these products if you suffer from face and body acne!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, seems to be the real stuff .  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel fresh and clean and has not dried out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product, I don&#x27;t to wear makeup to cover up my acne!</li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I went to an esthetician first and this is the skin system she uses on my face.</li>
            <li> It was also delivered in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> use this regimen during summer season and/or hot weather as my skin gets oilier during this time.</li>
            <li> But this product really cleared out my acne!</li>
            <li> I would get rid of one (but would leave a scar) only for two more to pop up.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many different products over the years and nothing compares to Obagi Clenziderm.</li>
            <li> so far I haven&#x27;t seen fantastic results</li>
            <li> husband can&#x27;t stop giving me compliments on how much better my overall skin is.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle cleanser from the dry/normal, especially in the Winter months.</li>
            <li> both use Obaji Products and really like the way it clears your skin and&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i use the gentle products</li>
            <li> I wish I would of had this in high school!</li>
            <li> thanks again</li>
            <li> I guess it really works</li>
            <li> I now just go to my esthetician every two or three months for a facial peel to keep my skin looking silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep my acne under control.  </li>
            <li> I doubt if this is real.</li>
            <li> A real 2 for 1 deal .</li>
            <li> The obagi clenziderm dual pack when used on a regular basis morning and night will work fabulously for stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> and I have been able to go back to wearing very little make up :)</li>
            <li> It works better than any other product that I have tried.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to like this cleanser and toner more than any other acne product I have used.</li>
            <li> I compare it to my original bottle label and it&#x27;s different.</li>
            <li> thanks for such quick and fast delivery, items came just as pictured and Obagi in my opinion</li>
            <li> Leaves you with a fresher, clean, younger looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these two!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to more consistent clear skin and few to none hormone breakouts.</li>
            <li> really does clear blemishes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has adult acne!</li>
            <li> The existing breakout started drying up, and with in a week I wasn&#x27;t getting any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Every other day or even once a week is fine based on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> my face is so clear!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and I tend to break out more than usual.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the product and noticed a difference within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> I did.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple day of using the product her face started to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on bactrim antibiotic, mineocycline, been given antibiotic face cream, and tried every over the counter acne wash and nothing seems to completely clear it up.</li>
            <li> you know that you will do and try ANYTHING to try to clear it up.</li>
            <li> When I get an occasional blemish, these products do the trick to make them go away fast.</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly sensitive.</li>
            <li> All in all, my skin cleared up in 3.5 days, I developed that glow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through them all it seems and haven&#x27;t found that potion yet that works completely.</li>
            <li> but nothing that a few dabs of light lotion can&#x27;t help alleviate.  </li>
            <li> Controls acne on face of 40 plus adult</li>
            <li> And i decided only use it every other day and only once a day, which is much better.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected and the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> this wins hands down.</li>
            <li> i really like this set, the only draw back</li>
            <li> It cleared my deep inflamed acne clear away!</li>
            <li> this seemed to be the only thing to clear my face!</li>
            <li> I was suffering from adult acne with cystic bumps and this is the only  combination that cleared it within 3-4 days!</li>
            <li> I was so tired of hiding my skin and not being able to wear tank tops.</li>
            <li> You should alternate it with something that is mild for everyday like Clinique acne soap.</li>
            <li> You may have to reduce how often you use the pore therapy due to the very drying nature of this product.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s due to the type of acne and not so much the product.</li>
            <li> The days when I was less lazy and took better care of my skin...</li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I am using OBAGI&#x27;S for five years and recently ,I bought clenziderm &amp;#34;foaming cleanser and pore therapy , the outside packaging of this products seems different from the  list of CLENZIDERMS  from obagi, the numbers which was  shown in my previous orders were not there, like foaming cleanser was numbered as # 1 and pore therapy was #2 for treatment.</li>
            <li> I only pour about a quarter of the product in the other bottle then add a little cold water just 3 good drops or so shake to mix well.</li>
            <li> The thing that helped me clear out break out just a little</li>
            <li> The therapeutic moisturizer  from dry/normal is also such a treat for dry winter skin!!  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I use for my extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> it might be an imitation only from obagi.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since middle school which got worse in high school.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said it will dry the skin</li>
            <li> The seller mailed the items in a timely manner and they were as expected.</li>
            <li> In six months I&#x27;ve spent $1200 going to the spa and having facials, extractions, chemical peels, laser treatments, microdermabrasion and the combination of all of those donâ€™t compare to the combination of 1.</li>
            <li> A little bit of soap goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The pore therapy, however, has a little bit of a pungent smell - but as long as it does the job - I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I had tried proactive and other over the counter acne medication with nothing working for any length of time.</li>
            <li> But I had to stop and mix it up with other skincare once in awhile because Obagi Clenziderm is so drying!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to get it cleared completely.</li>
            <li> And i have used id for  couple weeks everyday and my skin very dry after.</li>
            <li> it a try and stick with it for at least 1 month of daily use before your skin can get used to it.</li>
            <li> The down side is the cost</li>
            <li> I have to use another bottle and cut the product in half with water.</li>
            <li> then in the winter, i switch to something less stronger.</li>
            <li> Its half the cost</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist except its half the price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, i opened the products and used one time before i noticed that the packaging was different, my order received has no numbers in the outside label like showing in the ads.</li>
            <li> The cleanser in the oily/normal leaves my skin tight</li>
            <li> My daughters face was breaking out in little bumps</li>
            <li> I still get a few here and there.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend using the astringent everyday.</li>
            <li> Not to mention how painful those hard deep cystic knots that kept popping up on my back</li>
            <li> I am allergic to benzyl peroxide so the usual blemish products do not work for me.</li>
            <li> I started getting acne on my cheek the past year</li>
            <li> You will get past the dryness, just keep using it.</li>
            <li> if it goes away it usually leaves a scar.</li>
            <li> I hardly break out now</li>
            <li> I got in a terrible rut with my skin a few months back...</li>
            <li> So tired of the acne</li>
            <li> I was a bit iffy on using it because when it came in the seal on the pore therapy one was broken.</li>
            <li> It broke me out worse than I have ever been in my life.</li>
            <li> Label looks fake.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive reg retail</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Obagi.</li>
            <li> is eliminating all the artificial sweeteners, splenda, diet cola, and etc.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing bad.</li>
            <li> SO FRUSTRATING!!!</li>
            <li> I have a very bad acne since i was a 15 years</li>
            <li> After using x-out for about two weeks my acne just got worst.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It cleared my deep inflamed acne clear away! Thanks to this product, I don&#x27;t to wear makeup to cover up my acne! And lightened my scars as well!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, seems to be the real stuff .  I use obagi every Day  for 2 years now. My skin is always turning over and looking well.</li>
            <li> I have used OBAGI products for years and I love these. When I get an occasional blemish, these products do the trick to make them go away fast. I am allergic to benzyl peroxide so the usual blemish products do not work for me. This has 2% salicylic acid as the acne treatment. It is nice and foamy and makes my face feel refreshed and clean every time.</li>
            <li> Love this set!! It cleans your pores and feels so refreshing with the cooling sensation. My skin was getting infrequent breakouts and have stopped since I used it!</li>
            <li> This duo keeps skin clean and clear - its the best!</li>
            <li> My husband uses Obaji Clenziderm cleanser and pore therapy to manage&lt;br /&gt;his oily skin. When he skips his Obaji, he has a flare up with his breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;If he is consistant with his prescribed use of his products, he rarely has a&lt;br /&gt;problem with his skin.&lt;br /&gt;We both use Obaji Products and really like the way it clears your skin and&lt;br /&gt;gives a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;We both like clenziderm but i use the gentle products the majority of the&lt;br /&gt;time but for occasional pimples, I use his clenziderm and my skin clears up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccommend Obaji Products because they work.&lt;br /&gt;Magic</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve never found anything that works as well. I wish I would of had this in high school!</li>
            <li> Always a good buy. Expiration dates are always 2 years away from expiring. This is the only product I use for my extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these products for many years. it&#x27;s the best product over the counter that helped me to control my acne.</li>
            <li> i really like this set, the only draw back ive noticed is the cleanser doesnt seem to fully remove all my make up. after cleansing i use the pore therapy with a cotton square and each time have noticed alot of makeup still on the&lt;br /&gt;cotton square after applying.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi Clenziderm products.  Works amazingly, if you get any pimples at all they clear up in a day or two.  Great products</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have had acne for all of my life and this is the best wash and toner out there!</li>
            <li> thanks for such quick and fast delivery, items came just as pictured and Obagi in my opinion is the best products that have ever really worked for keeping your skin clean, and clear. Love them ! thanks again</li>
            <li> Been using this cleanser for a couple of years. Great at keeping face clear. A little bit of soap goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product, cleared up my sons acne within 7days.</li>
            <li> Power Duo...it really works!</li>
            <li> Great product , seen improvement.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 13 and I am now 30. So tired of the acne I thought I thought I would grow out of it. My face has cleared up! This stuff really works! It wont stop all the pimples from coming up I still get a few here and there.  But they don&#x27;t last long and they go away.  Makes me feel fresh and clean and has not dried out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for a couple of years and love them.  They really do a great job clearing acne.</li>
            <li> The product is actually for my wife. .she lives by this stuff..I guess it really works cause her skin looks great</li>
            <li> the best product ever! I can&#x27;t live without these two! Your face will shine! Pore Therapy might have a stinging sensation but your face will glow.</li>
            <li> this is a very strong product. I do not know anyone else&#x27;s acne dilemmas, but this product interrupts my menstrual cycle it&#x27;s that strong. I have to use another bottle and cut the product in half with water. I only pour about a quarter of the product in the other bottle then add a little cold water just 3 good drops or so shake to mix well. This also makes the product last for months. When I get a pimple that is stubborn and will not respond to the weaken product I use some on a q-tip  of the unaltered bottle. I get some big knot type of pimples sometime and this medicine whipped my acne into shape. Now I just use it for spot treatments then twice a week or so cover my entire face with the unaltered portion. You should alternate it with something that is mild for everyday like Clinique acne soap.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from adult acne with cystic bumps and this is the only  combination that cleared it within 3-4 days! I had tried proactive and other over the counter acne medication with nothing working for any length of time. The pore therapy is very drying so have a good moisturizer.  You may have to reduce how often you use the pore therapy due to the very drying nature of this product. Obagi is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This cleanser works for me. I have the entire system. I went to an esthetician first and this is the skin system she uses on my face. My skin looks awesome. You do have to use the system twice a day and keep your hands off your face. I now just go to my esthetician every two or three months for a facial peel to keep my skin looking silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Great seller and fast shipping. As far as the product, I didn&#x27;t see top notch results but I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used it before and my skin may be used to it.</li>
            <li> The Daily Care Foaming Cleanser and Pore Therapy are AMAZING! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has adult acne!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, have been using for 3 months and still have blemished skin</li>
            <li> My daughters face was breaking out in little bumps and she asked me if I could get this product for her, so I did.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple day of using the product her face started to clear up.  She told me that this is the only product&lt;br /&gt;that works for her.  It was also delivered in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> The toner is wonderful, the cleanser is just right for me.  I will buy this again.  Recommended by my mom&#x27;s dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly sensitive. Obagi Clenziderm in conjunction with Obaji Nuderm SPF 35 Lotion is the only way to keep my face happy and acne free.</li>
            <li> daughter loves, works</li>
            <li> Use this consistently and your skin firmness and minimized lines will give you an amazing confidence! I recommend you use the blender as well</li>
            <li> use this regimen during summer season and/or hot weather as my skin gets oilier during this time. then in the winter, i switch to something less stronger. obagi is a great skin product!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. works great. would buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent I love this product it cleared up my acne quickly when used once a day The down side is the cost</li>
            <li> We are repeat buyers. Excellent for face.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other product that I have tried. I will buy it again if I find a good price.</li>
            <li> These are great products.  They actually work!  I started with the Obagi line and was purchasing it from a local spa.  I price almost made me stop using it.  I came across it on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe it!  Its half the cost and I get the same Obagi quality. The cleaner is so easy to use (I keep it in the shower) and I also have a bottle in my gym bag.  It cleans but doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin.  The toner is just as easy and it great for cleaning my facing between showering.</li>
            <li> This product was overpriced at my dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> great product.  really does clear blemishes.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to like this cleanser and toner more than any other acne product I have used. Love how cool my skin feels after I use them too.</li>
            <li> Very good for very oily skin. I have combinational skin type. On T zine works good, on dry/ normal zone it s too strong. And i have used id for  couple weeks everyday and my skin very dry after. And i decided only use it every other day and only once a day, which is much better.</li>
            <li> I have already seen an improvement overnight. Forgot about this product until a friend brought it up to me. LOVE the clenziderm for acne. Best product on the market!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> These products are the best in my opinion, I have ordered them for years and i will continue to do so. The seller mailed the items in a timely manner and they were as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described:):)</li>
            <li> works better than any acne product used before, need to use consistantly x 1 month or longer for best results</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is amazing! I was a bit iffy on using it because when it came in the seal on the pore therapy one was broken. Which ended up in it spilling some on the rapper it came with. I started getting acne on my cheek the past year and I have tried a LOT of over the counter acne washes but none worked. After using x-out for about two weeks my acne just got worst. But this product really cleared out my acne! I get a couple once in a while but it&#x27;s nothing bad. Sadly, my red acne scars still show though.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered  for acne.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected and the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist except its half the price on Amazon.  Gives you a fresh and tingly almost minty feeling when you wash your skin.  Leaves you with a fresher, clean, younger looking skin.  I use it at night before I go to sleep.  Really helps keep my acne under control.  The only thing I use since coming off accutane.</li>
            <li> Not only was I having breakouts on my face but on my back also. I was so tired of hiding my skin and not being able to wear tank tops. Not to mention how painful those hard deep cystic knots that kept popping up on my back I would get rid of one (but would leave a scar) only for two more to pop up. SO FRUSTRATING!!! So I started us ing the Obagi Clendiderm M.D. On my back along with the Obagi Pore Therapy, with in 2 days I started seeing a difference. The existing breakout started drying up, and with in a week I wasn&#x27;t getting any new breakouts. How awesome it that. Can you say tank tops and bikinis this summer...OH YEAh!!! Can&#x27;t wait to show off my beautiful skin. With sunscreen of course ;;) I highly recommend Both of these products if you suffer from face and body acne!!!</li>
            <li> Anything Obagi is great. This is the only product that works on my teenage age daughters face. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I doubt if this is real. Label looks fake. I compare it to my original bottle label and it&#x27;s different.</li>
            <li> Awe.. The days when I was less lazy and took better care of my skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use this set as recommended by my facialist (a top-notch NYC chick), and the longer I used it, the clearer my skin got.  But I had to stop and mix it up with other skincare once in awhile because Obagi Clenziderm is so drying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like the product is still getting great reviews even since Dr. Obagi left the company...</li>
            <li> I got in a terrible rut with my skin a few months back...this seemed to be the only thing to clear my face! You will get past the dryness, just keep using it. I cannot imagine using anything else now and I have been able to go back to wearing very little make up :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product and transaction.&lt;br /&gt;Will be visiting again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price ... A real 2 for 1 deal . Way too expensive reg retail</li>
            <li> The obagi clenziderm dual pack when used on a regular basis morning and night will work fabulously for stubborn acne. I have tried everything for my teen age son including chemical peels for his acne and this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and I absolutely love it. I use step 1 in the morning and night. Then, I use step 2 at night as well. I have tried sooooo many different products over the years and nothing compares to Obagi Clenziderm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and began getting hormonal breakouts along my jawline a couple years ago.  Unsuccessfully, I tried monthly microdermabrasion, proactive, Perricone and all-natural Yonka with good but inconsistent results.  At Bikram yoga, an aesthetician recommended Obagi.  I have combo skin/dehydrated skin, so I bought both oily/normal and dry/normal systems.  I love the gentle cleanser from the dry/normal, especially in the Winter months. It&#x27;s very gentle and smooth. The therapeutic moisturizer  from dry/normal is also such a treat for dry winter skin!!  What a glow!  The cleanser in the oily/normal leaves my skin tight but I may like to use it in the very Hot TEXAS summer when it&#x27;s 105 degrees &amp; when I tend to be more oily.  The pore toner in the oily/normal is such a treat- I like to use it winter or summer.  The therapeutic treatment that comes with both systems I only used on my acne along the jawline.  All in all, my skin cleared up in 3.5 days, I developed that glow I always wanted but never achieved even with Perricone or Yonka, and My skin feels so smooth and hydrated I don&#x27;t even wear make-up to work.  I&#x27;m looking forward to more consistent clear skin and few to none hormone breakouts.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  My pores were clogging until I started using this</li>
            <li> Never had acne a day in my life until I hit 40. The dermatologist diagnosed me with cystic acne. I don&#x27;t get many but when I do have an outbreak it&#x27;s pure hell and most of the time if it goes away it usually leaves a scar. I&#x27;ve been on bactrim antibiotic, mineocycline, been given antibiotic face cream, and tried every over the counter acne wash and nothing seems to completely clear it up. Reading the reviews I decided to try another. If you ever had cystic acne you know that you will do and try ANYTHING to try to clear it up. When I used the face wash w/the astringent it did help in drying it, but again if you&#x27;ve had cystic acne you know how deep that pimple goes and it&#x27;s very hard to get it cleared completely. Like other reviewers said it will dry the skin so I don&#x27;t recommend using the astringent everyday. Every other day or even once a week is fine based on how sensitive your skin is. I only gave it a 3 since so far I haven&#x27;t seen fantastic results but I think it&#x27;s due to the type of acne and not so much the product. This probably works great for those with regular acne and is worth a shot. If someone comes up with a cure all for cystic acne they will be sure to have millions. I&#x27;ve been through them all it seems and haven&#x27;t found that potion yet that works completely. If anyone reading these reviews has found a cure all for cystic acne please share...</li>
            <li> Couldnâ€™t ask for anything better! - I have had problems with breakouts and blackheads since my teen years. I&#x27;m 26 now. In six months I&#x27;ve spent $1200 going to the spa and having facials, extractions, chemical peels, laser treatments, microdermabrasion and the combination of all of those donâ€™t compare to the combination of 1. Daily Care Foaming Cleanser Salicylic Acid 2. Pore Therapy 3. Therapeutic Lotion by Obagi CLENZiderm M.D. - I&#x27;ve also tried ProActive but it irritated my skin and it seemed as if it stopped working after a while. Also, the 3rd step of Obagi contains  5% benzoyl peroxide (BPO)  vs ProActive 3rd step  2.5%. â€“ Iâ€™ll let you be the judge. -&lt;br /&gt;My husband can&#x27;t stop giving me compliments on how much better my overall skin is. I&#x27;ve been also getting compliments from my close friends and they&#x27;ve asked me what is it that I&#x27;m using b/c my face is so clear! I do use all three steps at night. Morning I use 1&amp;2 plus Obagi AM 50SPF moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and stick with it for at least 1 month of daily use before your skin can get used to it. You might experience some burning feeling but it will go away and after continual use.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and I tend to break out more than usual. A dermatologist recommended this so I tried it. Just what I needed, cleared my skin up within 48 hours !</li>
            <li> Feels.. good.  I hardly break out now</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected! Best product line for anyone with acne. I have bought from this seller many time without issues</li>
            <li> Where has this stuff been all my life. I have suffered from acne since middle school which got worse in high school. Finally got on accutane which helped but I&#x27;ve never found a face wash system that would actually make my skim look and feel good. I  have uses SO many products to help maintain my skin but nothing has worked as good as this. I love the tingly feeling it leaves on my skin. I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff!! I will for sure be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I use both regularly.  I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of dryness along the edge of the bridge of the nose but nothing that a few dabs of light lotion can&#x27;t help alleviate.  Overall, I like the product and noticed a difference within the first week of use.  I use the cleanser in the AM and use the Pore Therapy at night, with ocassional use in the AM. Seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> It broke me out worse than I have ever been in my life. I will stick to my proactive from now on.</li>
            <li> I tried everything- this wins hands down. And no terrible skin freak out aftermath if you stop using like there is with proactive. Love it.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else!  Controls acne on face of 40 plus adult leaving skin looking great.  Sun screen is a must!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Obagi. Reasonably priced and was delivered in good shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trued MANY products for my oily skin and visible pores and the face wash, by far, has exceeded my expectations! The pore therapy however feels amazing but I have not seen immediate results. The face wash though I have used for 4 months and I just started using the pore therapy toner so I can&#x27;t give an affirmative review. But since the face wash is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used I give this product 5 STARS!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this Obagi Clenziderm step 1,2,and 3. I have a very bad acne since i was a 15 years old,&lt;br /&gt;and tried everything, even antibiotics from the doctor. Then, my OBGYN recommended Obagi products, bought it on Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;used it for about 2 month, no results what so ever. The step 2 toner, dried my skin out that I was very embarrassed even to go shopping, couldn&#x27;t hide it even with the foundation, or concealer. The thing that helped me clear out break out just a little is eliminating all the artificial sweeteners, splenda, diet cola, and etc. Would not recommend this product, only maybe if you don&#x27;t have breakouts. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am using OBAGI&#x27;S for five years and recently ,I bought clenziderm &amp;#34;foaming cleanser and pore therapy , the outside packaging of this products seems different from the  list of CLENZIDERMS  from obagi, the numbers which was  shown in my previous orders were not there, like foaming cleanser was numbered as # 1 and pore therapy was #2 for treatment. I was paranoid with the authenticity of my orders?? I am scared it gonna damage my skin coz it might be an imitation only from obagi.Sadly, i opened the products and used one time before i noticed that the packaging was different, my order received has no numbers in the outside label like showing in the ads.</li>
            <li> Used one day and face has already cleared up - love this stuff!  The pore therapy, however, has a little bit of a pungent smell - but as long as it does the job - I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi clenziderm cleanser and toner!  Can&#x27;t be without it.  Helps acne.  Heals blemishes.  Been using for about 7 years and it&#x27;s my favorite.  Makes your skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> very good product for my acne</li>
            <li> I love this product, It work excellent for my skin ,</li>
            <li> I am still using this product.  It&#x27;s o.k.</li>
            <li> They feel good but the pores don&#x27;t get smaller. And the face is as oily as ever</li>
