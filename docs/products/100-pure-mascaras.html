            <li>Goes nice and no clumping.</li>
            <li>The brush gives nice separation, and there is no clumping.</li>
            <li>Wanted an organic mascara and this does the job, nice lash coverage and yummy smell..</li>
            <li>gives a nice boost without the crunchiness.</li>
            <li>and this is just as good, plus cheaper, plus much better for you and the environment.</li>
            <li>I was MAKING my own mascara using bentonite clay and charcoal.</li>

            <li>Love, love, love this product!!</li>

            <li>This mascara smudges very easily, flakes, and no length whatsoever</li>
            <li>Very good lengthening, and one coat is really all you need.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mascara.</li>
            <li>I also love the choc scent it remind me of out of the over home made warm  budgie brownies ...</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and light eyes</li>
            <li>/&gt; - Goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>It not only looks great but smells amazing too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waterproof, and I prefer it that way, because it&#x27;s easy to remove with coconut oil and a warm wash rag.</li>
            <li>This  Pure mascara does have a lot of great qualities to it...</li>
            <li>; because I have yet to find one I LOVE...</li>
            <li>I LOVE the facts it is natural-pure,</li>
            <li>LOVE the way it smells, LOVE the container</li>
            <li>This DOES seem to be better than Organic Wear and Ecco Bella which I have also tried....  </li>
            <li>This is close &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have literally never been able to wear mascara because it ends up under my eyes and not on my lashes.</li>
            <li>Okay, I think I&#x27;m in mascara heaven.</li>
            <li>Love everything by this company.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t count how many people ask me what mascara I use.  </li>
            <li>&amp; theres a bit more maintenance in terms of under eye dust after a bit.  </li>

            <li>Chocolate :)&lt;</li>
            <li>sometimes use primer underneath to both pump up the effect and make it stick on better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I like this mascara better than I thought.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this mascara makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li>One application and my eyes burned until I was able to remove the product.</li>
            <li>I have been using for about 3 weeks and my eyelashes look better already -</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use this again-</li>
            <li>If I could give 10 stars I would!! :-)</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go back to store brand mascara - this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>I love the chocolate smell.</li>
            <li>okay when I wash it off.</li>
            <li>smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love how it goes on and stays on without any clumping or smearing.  </li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
            <li>The chocolate smell is extremely overwhelming.</li>
            <li>my dog sniffs my lashes :-)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that would work just as well.  </li>
            <li>Most mascaras cause my eyes to get itchy.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and had given it a 5 star until my November order.  </li>
            <li>Even if I magically got over my allergy, I would still stick with this.</li>
            <li>It is not water proof,  but that is OK with me.  </li>
            <li>I tried to get more, but they don&#x27;t make this anymore.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can smell chocolate when I blink.  </li>
            <li>Because I have read some concerns of spoiling, I am keeping my lovely chocolate mascara in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>The product does smell like cocoa powder, but I love that.</li>
            <li>i have finally found the perfect mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d eat it if I didn&#x27;t know better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better to be patient then</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love??</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I adore this company and this is my favorite product by them.</li>
            <li>But the more I used it, the better it got.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love that the product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li>If the smell could be eliminated, this would get a better review from me.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Most mascara makes my eyes burn</li>
            <li>and this color looks most flattering on blondes.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the mascara, would love the brush to be a bit fuller, but overall - great product.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I hoped and smelled good too. :)</li>
            <li>make sure you curl your lashes well first, i think since its softer in finish it makes the curl fall a little--nothing a good pre-application curling cant remedy.</li>
            <li>I think it smells pretty good</li>
            <li>What could be better owe ya it all natural and great for my lashes and lengthening  too ...</li>
            <li>best mascara, gives your lashes amazing length and what&#x27;s very important for me, keeps them soft not stiff.</li>
            <li>But for the better ingredients, I&#x27;m fine with the trade off.  </li>
            <li>and this fit the bill most for me</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that so far, I like it.  </li>
            <li>It gives a natural looking thickness and color to your lashes and it does indeed smell great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look nearly as good, and the smell really turns my stomach.</li>
            <li>This smells almost as good as it works, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and very effective.</li>
            <li>I get a whiff of sweet cocoa butter!</li>
            <li>My lashes even look full!</li>
            <li>The wand is cool too!</li>
            <li>So for $21 a year, not bad at all!</li>
            <li>Washes off just as easy.  </li>
            <li>This mascara goes on easy and does not smudge.  </li>
            <li>Smudges too easily and burns my eyes.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and comes off easily just with water.</li>
            <li>This however does not come of easily and requires an eye makeup remover in addition to soap and water to get the racoon look off your eyes that this leaves after washing.  </li>
            <li>BTW, it&#x27;s easy to remove with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>(i haven&#x27;t tried it in the pool, though), goes on and cleans off easily.  </li>
            <li>It comes off easily with any make up remover.  </li>
            <li>It spreads evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run, but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The wand, for me, makes applying the product easy.</li>
            <li>Smudges easily.</li>
            <li>However, when it does, it&#x27;s easy to wipe away</li>
            <li>it stays on all day without smudging, easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I smell a strong chocolate scent every time I put it on.</li>
            <li>Okay if you poured a bowl full of fingernail polish into a bowl and stuck a hershey kiss in it, thats what you smell.</li>
            <li>Best mascara hands down.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Perfect brown color - not too light and not too dark.  </li>
            <li>The first lash I tried it on was perfect, but the second lash went clumpy.</li>
            <li>The Brown is so perfect for me (auburn colored hair), I don&#x27;t even want to try black.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I know better....</li>
            <li>Smells like delicious brownies, but is a little sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my lashes, doesn&#x27;t flake and easy to remove!  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of cheap Avon chapstick.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t clump up.  </li>
            <li>I want everyone to enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has excellent lengthening power, and you can build it up with a few coats.</li>
            <li>as it has dried out a bit, i must say this is the perfect mascara for me-</li>
            <li>goes on smooth, smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li>At age 40, that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous mascara from the packaging and ingredients to the smell and longevity of the application.  </li>
            <li>i dont like to wear heavy makeup, so the light application is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>This is the one mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye lids, doesn&#x27;t make my lashes feel stiff or brittle, no tiny flakes that fly into my eyes and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have written, it smells incredible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for the first time today, they look great,feel ok as well.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase of this all natural mascara.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and now own two different colors.</li>
            <li>For the emotionally stable, this is a wonderful, natural product.</li>
            <li>This mascara is worth every penny - it doesn&#x27;t clump, lasts all day, and removes fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this amazing truly natural mascara!</li>
            <li>Consistency is great, doesn&#x27;t clump, easy to layer, I buy the brown Dark Chocolate color</li>
            <li>In regards to the smell, when you first apply it you can surely smell chocolate and it lingers for a bit but is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>the mascara tube itself just has a special look.  </li>
            <li>I have used this brand of mascara before &amp; absolutely love 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara so much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even thinking of buying some for my mom for mother&#x27;s day because I love it so much</li>
            <li>I love to eat chocolate, but this smell is a bit much for eyelashes, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Well this product was a true lifesaver.</li>
            <li>Each time I get a fresh tube, I can smell the fabulous smell every time I blink my eyes.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite mascara of all time.</li>
            <li>I really wated to love these product but it did not do it for me.</li>
            <li>Smells of dark chocolate, the color is a nice deep brown, consistency is good and packaging is really nice.</li>
            <li>look- this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>i think the soft finish is nice, but</li>
            <li>It smells like sweet chocolate,  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li>I have purchased black before and it smells good (like berries I think) and is more noticeable.</li>
            <li>This effect goes away quickly after washing my face.</li>
            <li>These mild mascaras never irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>:)  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used many mascaras both natural and not that end up under your eyes!!  </li>
            <li>Better than they ever looked with all those fancy and toxic normal mascara&#x27;s &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li>I tried 100 Percent Pure Dark Chocolate and was immediately pleased with the pleasant- chocolate-smelling scent.</li>
            <li>I love this new mascara.</li>
            <li>I just purchased my second one because I just love the results!  </li>
            <li>I wear it to work 5 days a week, and still using my first purchase, which I bought a year ago!</li>
            <li>I love all the natural ingredients (I can pronounce all of them!)</li>
            <li>Love this all natural mascara!</li>
            <li>It is not chunky, or clumpy, or flaky, it&#x27;s smooth, stays smooth, and gives a very natural look.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this mascara, based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>not an evening look but great for the everyday natural look I love.</li>
            <li>This goes on smooth and covers very well.</li>
            <li>So far this is has been one of the top two mascaras that I have tried BUT still in search of a #1.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural product and</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>and I think it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>and it completely dries, then you can&#x27;t apply another coat over the top.  </li>
            <li>this one is both natural and stays on better than anything i have used</li>
            <li>And I love that it is all natural made with fruit pigments.</li>
            <li>I love knowing that I am putting something natural on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
            <li>As someone who&#x27;s trying to switch all my makeup products to more natural options, this mascara is a must buy.</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can even smell that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It even smells of fresh chocolate which in my opinion is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t irritate your eyes with store bought mascara, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I had completely given up on any mascara when I decided to give it one more try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, has a good look (not outrageous- natural), and has very little smudging.</li>
            <li>It is as good as the other mascaras out on the market.</li>
            <li>Everything I want in a mascara is right here, without the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly - no major clumping - and it has a nice glossiness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like somebody amped up my eyes naturally, which I love, because when I want a natural look, this makes it supremely easy.</li>
            <li>It is fun to put on as the aroma of it really smells of chocolate!  </li>
            <li>got Dark Chocolate which actually smells like chocolate cocoa butter which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge, like I read in another review, and it leaves my lashes nice and long.</li>
            <li>but there are a lot more natural mascaras out there that are more expensive, and this brand to me is a brilliant compromise to have a truly natural mascara that performs this well!</li>
            <li>The color is nice, and the smell is definitely a pick-me-up when I&#x27;m getting ready for work in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two months, and every time I apply it it&#x27;s just as creamy and easy to apply as the first day.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality product, though!</li>
            <li>I have very light, short lashes and this</li>
            <li>I know the products are pure, so I was not afraid to try this mascara.</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used an organic mascara</li>
            <li>When I first ordered it, I thought that the chocolate just referred to the color.  </li>
            <li>This is my second order, absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;bonus: edible smell and pretty container.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use make-up for months,and when I occasionally forget that I&#x27;m wearing it and rub my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li>I unwrapped that, and inside was a pretty cardboard tube that was sort of a peachy-pink color and creme.</li>
            <li>I opened that and found the pretty silver tube of mascara that was wrapped in a perforated shrink-wrap plastic.</li>
            <li>when i first  opened the mascara and used it, i felt it a bit &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, but it never clunked or gunked up once.</li>
            <li>i truly love it and will definitely be re-ordering it once the time comes.</li>
            <li>I will tell you when I first started using it</li>
            <li>It gets three stars for having excellent non-toxic ingredients but sadly, I will be going back to a toxin-filled brand that works much better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually pretty \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and stays this way for months.</li>
            <li>I was somewhat skeptical about a natural mascara, but I loved the idea of it and the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved the color and did not mind the slight scent of chocolate!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve experienced flakes with a black one, when it gets to be 6 months old.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural mascara, this one is worth trying!  </li>
            <li>The black has a little more bleeding than I&#x27;ve experienced with the brown.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of mascaras over the years, from drug store brands to prestige cosmetics, and the only one I&#x27;ve ever loved was an urban decay brand that they&#x27;ve stopped making.</li>
            <li>mascara and I&#x27;m not sure this is quite that, but it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>this is a really nice mascara, especially given that it is natural.</li>
            <li>As far as being natural - that&#x27;s why I love it.</li>
            <li>It is very light and natural for an everyday look-- when I want a more &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; look I do turn to something else.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice natural look that I enjoy for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I love smelling chocolate all day long.</li>
            <li>This does not add much volume, which I need, and is pretty watery</li>
            <li>it is buildable mascara, in that, when you put on the first application its very fine/light.</li>
            <li>By the time I woke up the next morning, my eyelids were incredibly swollen (picture someone who&#x27;s been crying for 24 hours straight</li>
            <li>nice dark brown color.</li>
            <li>I loved it, but I do like the black better than the dark chocolate, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>They always work great the first time, and then the next day they clump and make a mess.</li>
            <li>and it has a very true brown hue which I like because it is a little more natural looking.</li>
            <li>Washes off easy and I am not worried about sleeping with some left on.</li>
            <li>but application is still easy enough.</li>
            <li>Again, I was pleased that not only I received the fullness in my lashes that I wanted, the mascara does not run until you take it off, so no dark rings!!!  </li>
            <li>But, it is pure fruit mascara...</li>
            <li>Pure .</li>
            <li>I wish 100% pure had an eyelash primer so that I could stick to the all-natural goodness of the products they offer.  </li>
            <li>100% pure continues to impress me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mascara because it was so pure in its ingredients and that is what I seek in a mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have been a fan of 100% Pure for years now, and this item is a staple in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>Pure mascara</li>
            <li>Other brands of natural mascaras don&#x27;t perform any better, so I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply a light layer for a natural look, which is usually the look I&#x27;m going for.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell too much and the bottle is a bit shiny.</li>
            <li>Much Preferred over physicians formula for improving eyelash health and growth.</li>
            <li>I regret spending so much on something that doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>It gives my eyelashes more of a wet look</li>
            <li>you really should try this.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Thanks to one day of their products, I&#x27;m now having issues with my skin being oversensitive.  </li>
            <li>Best mascara so far, does not run, builds up thin lashes with a natural look.  </li>
            <li>But oh my gosh does it smell like straight up chocolate.</li>
            <li>And, 3) reasonably non-smudge.  </li>
            <li>Just wouldn&#x27;t buy it for the smell haha</li>
            <li>This product is so incredibly gentle on my eyes.</li>
            <li>It goes on without much clumping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Oh well, back to the drawing board in finding a mascara I can wear comfortably, all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************************************&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it isn&#x27;t very stable on lashes, and in fact doesn&#x27;t make anything to them.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit overpowering and does not seem to diminish much throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Fresh and natural.</li>
            <li>in that it is gentle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t have to say anything else</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>I tried making my own with activated charcoal, but gave up after numerous experiments that left me with raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am a fair redhead, with pale eyelashes and sensitive, allergy-prone eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara along with other 100% pure products for years and just love the results, ingredients, colors and quality of the products.</li>
            <li>Now, don&#x27;t get all excited and think that your lashes are going to look thick and dark and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It smells like chocolate, stays on long, &amp; washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara and love that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals of other brands.  </li>
            <li>and then the other then repeat this two more times for both eyes.  </li>
            <li>so chocolate color is perfect for me, just a little hint but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, the best natural mascara I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a few.  </li>
            <li>i think next time i will buy the black for a more dramatic look, but the brown is great for a softer, more natural look.</li>
            <li>I have insanely sensitive eyes, and I had pretty much given up on finding a mascara that could suit my requirements:  </li>
            <li>This dark brown will effectively emphasize light/blonde lashes for a natural look; it&#x27;s probably not for you if you&#x27;re going for eye drama on a runway or at a photo shoot.</li>
            <li>I would know - good quality dark chocolate is part of my daily diet!</li>
            <li>Just when I thought I could only use it on special occasions with allergy drops I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>This mascara is just the right shade for me since I have dark brown hair with some light brown highlights.  </li>
            <li>Not as dark as many &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why more people aren&#x27;t loving the dark chocolate.</li>
            <li>Excited that it was natural- a little too light and burns</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t pin where this smell was coming from &amp; then remembered the new mascara!</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to brand for mascara!  </li>
            <li>so I also love the Black berry</li>
            <li>it does do a decent job at separating the lashes, and seems to lengthen them (unless my lashes are growing-</li>
            <li>Some of the make-up I bought was even older.  </li>
            <li>I like this much better than Physicians Formula Organic mascara which causes my eyes to instantly become irritated, red, and puffy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very sensitive to water, so it will smear and isn&#x27;t that much nicer to your eyes if it gets inside the lid...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s great -- not thick and clumpy, very natural looking and plenty dark for my dark lashes.</li>
            <li>This is a great product although I find that the applicator brush is difficult to get the lower lashes coated.</li>
            <li>It is very close to the color of my natural lashes, but fuller and deeper and richer.  </li>
            <li>It gives amazing length and fullness without it looking too thick.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, for a natural mascara, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>First of all, there is barely any in this mascara so no worries about lumping.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a dark brown mascara because I feel like it is more natural looking on me.</li>
            <li>i rarely wear any makeup, especially eye makeup</li>
            <li>There is no going back to the store brands, this is worth the price if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Both go on thick and easily and stay on pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li>thinking I was buying the black one with fruit pigments, but this chocolate one (dark brown) is also amazing!</li>
            <li>It probably wouldn&#x27;t bother many people, but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive &amp; that particular &#x27;flavor&#x27; did irritate my eyes just a little, not bad, but if you are sensitive to things, I&#x27;d recommend trying one of the other &#x27;flavors&#x27;.</li>
            <li>In the last year I have become very familar with 100% Pure products.  </li>
            <li>but I hope they develop an improved &amp; new edition.</li>
            <li>Found my new mascara brand.</li>
            <li>I went over a year without finding anything (tried a new one every month</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks and this product is okay so far.</li>
            <li>My eyes were getting really dry for some reason and when I switched to this more natural one it helped immensely.</li>
            <li>it smells divine, like warm chocolate brownies (seriously) and it has kept that scent for the month or so that i have been using it.  </li>
            <li>Very natural look.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li>it does avoid clumping and gives me a very natural look.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very sensitive to eye makeup, beware..</li>
            <li>it stays on well without fading or smudging,  the color is very natural looking,  and I also use it on my  eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Which some might love, but I happen to be allergic to it and highly sensitive to the smell in a bad headache kind of way.</li>
            <li>mascara definitely exceeds my first two expectations.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear brown mascara as I am a natural strawberry blond with blond eyelashes/eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why this mascara doesn&#x27;t have more reviews unless maybe not many people who shop Amazon have tried</li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Replaced my usual Maybelline mascara with this and love it so far!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with little effort and stays on.  </li>
            <li>but i found that it smeared a little to easy.  </li>
            <li>I also think that because this has a natural pigment that it has naturally tinted my eyelashes a little dark when I don&#x27;t have it on, which is really nice!</li>
            <li>My eyes and skin are super sensitive and I have diagnosed allergies to several common ingredients in most natural products as well.  </li>
            <li>I like how gentle it went on and the natural look, until the eyes started itching and when rubbed, major smudging....raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made out of natural ingredients - I will definitely be checking out other products from this line.</li>
            <li>I was able to get from the lash line, all the way to the end of my lashes, and smooth out any areas where too much product may have been left behind during the initial application.</li>
            <li>One coat provides a subtle natural look, but I like to really coat it on to get a sexy look.</li>
            <li>but I think my favorite is going to be the dark choc because I wear black/brown on a daily basis</li>
            <li>Found this by accident on Amazon - I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but so far I really like it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several mascaras in the past few years, some at double the price, and this one is the best for me.</li>
            <li>The consistency is just right, not too runny, not too dry.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and looks nice but just smudges too quick or really bad if it gets wet.  </li>
            <li>It does not give the defined and dark finish as the other unnatural products but is good enough.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken as much as say, Urban Decay, but I wanted to switch to something all natural.  </li>
            <li>I developed styes.  </li>
            <li>I used this mascara again and developed another stye.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying direct from 100%</li>
            <li>I use a natural lavender oil to remove it before I cleanse my face at night.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have ocular rosacea, so my eyes are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I wrote to the company for the complete ingredient list or material safety data sheet/label and received no response.  </li>
            <li>Lot numbers on this make-up indicated it was over two years old.  </li>
            <li>Beware of resellers selling old make-up.</li>
            <li>However I will say, as it&#x27;s natural-</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products and zero chemicals.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally oily so that may be the cause, or not.  </li>
            <li>I have gone almost 2 years without wearing mascara unless I absolutely have to for an occasion: When I do my eyes become really red, itchy and watery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking on Amazon for sensitive eyes mascara</li>
            <li>My lashes still feel soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>does not make your eyes itch, natural ingredients/</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought natural before</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s natural and cruelty</li>
            <li>My lashes look natural.</li>
            <li>i like a natural look</li>
            <li>to like the &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; of it for a natural look and healthier product</li>
            <li>So for all that, I gave it five stars, because what else can a natural gal expect of her mascara?</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well this mascara held up.</li>
            <li>it nearly drove me to gouge out my eyeballs.</li>
            <li>and yes i tried natural health store brands as well)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m into all natural things</li>
            <li>I think they got an old or expired tube.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Dark Chocolate mascara and found the smell to be too sweet, which turned me off from continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a true brown, also- just like dark chocolate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to be negative, but I thought it&#x27;d be fair to share that this mascara is certainly not for everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product... and just placed my second order of it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m planning to when I get low), and would highly recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>Always free shipping no matter how small the order.</li>
            <li>I wore it all day long and no flaking or smudging, no irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li>it smells like chocolate, no joke, and neither the smell or general formulation irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>You may need a couple of coats to get a look that you would normally get with regular mascara</li>
            <li>Additionally, the wand is great - very even coverage, no smearing on the base of the lids and no caking/clumping together of eyelids.</li>
            <li>and it is still not as thick as the earlier ones but much better than the November tube.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of money to throw these pure products in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>A little pricey (why the 4 stars) but worth the splurge now and then.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised because I expected it to smell like sweet berries like the black formula.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect it to work like regular old toxic mascara.  </li>
            <li>so far the only mascara I can wear without a  fume smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and won&#x27;t go back to the old stuff</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if it is even  possible to have a 100% natural product that does not smudge.  </li>
            <li>&gt; - Knowing the natural ingredients is obviously a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>1) as natural of ingredients as possible.  </li>
            <li>and this is not only all natural, but it also stays on quite well without flaking or smudging.  </li>
            <li>Love this non irritating mascara.  </li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s other cosmetics</li>
            <li>I actually like this product better than the black mascara I previously purchased.</li>
            <li>It has extreme staying power (comparable to drugstore, chemical laden mascaras) and doesn&#x27;t smudge (much) if I accidentally rub my eyes.</li>
            <li>I will only wear natural make-up products, and wanted to branch out to a different mascara brand from what I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little weird at first to move your head and get whiffs of chocolate, but you get used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I had spent years finding the perfect one to give me thick, long lashes that were dramatic but not spidery</li>
            <li>this mascara can also be reapplied after an initial application for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this particular color, but am wearing their other new mascara all day today and absolutely no problems.  </li>
            <li>I have already purchased the Black tea and Black berry which I love both the black tea is not a harsh black which I really like</li>
            <li>On a tight budget the price was a bit much for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using 100% pure mascaras for a few years.</li>

            <li> /&gt; - Goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> It not only looks great but smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof, and I prefer it that way, because it&#x27;s easy to remove with coconut oil and a warm wash rag.</li>
            <li> This  Pure mascara does have a lot of great qualities to it...</li>
            <li> ; because I have yet to find one I LOVE...</li>
            <li> I LOVE the facts it is natural-pure,</li>
            <li> LOVE the way it smells, LOVE the container</li>
            <li> This DOES seem to be better than Organic Wear and Ecco Bella which I have also tried....  </li>
            <li> This is close &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have literally never been able to wear mascara because it ends up under my eyes and not on my lashes.</li>

            <li> Love everything by this company.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count how many people ask me what mascara I use.  </li>

            <li> sometimes use primer underneath to both pump up the effect and make it stick on better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I like this mascara better than I thought.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this mascara makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li> One application and my eyes burned until I was able to remove the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 3 weeks and my eyelashes look better already -</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use this again-</li>
            <li> If I could give 10 stars I would!! :-)</li>

            <li> ENJOY!</li>
            <li> The chocolate smell is extremely overwhelming.</li>
            <li> my dog sniffs my lashes :-)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that would work just as well.  </li>
            <li> Most mascaras cause my eyes to get itchy.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and had given it a 5 star until my November order.  </li>
            <li> Even if I magically got over my allergy, I would still stick with this.</li>
            <li> It is not water proof,  but that is OK with me.  </li>
            <li> I tried to get more, but they don&#x27;t make this anymore.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can smell chocolate when I blink.  </li>
            <li> Because I have read some concerns of spoiling, I am keeping my lovely chocolate mascara in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> The product does smell like cocoa powder, but I love that.</li>
            <li> i have finally found the perfect mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d eat it if I didn&#x27;t know better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better to be patient then</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to love??</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I adore this company and this is my favorite product by them.</li>
            <li> But the more I used it, the better it got.  </li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love that the product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li> If the smell could be eliminated, this would get a better review from me.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Most mascara makes my eyes burn</li>
            <li> and this color looks most flattering on blondes.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the mascara, would love the brush to be a bit fuller, but overall - great product.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I hoped and smelled good too. :)</li>
            <li> make sure you curl your lashes well first, i think since its softer in finish it makes the curl fall a little--nothing a good pre-application curling cant remedy.</li>
            <li> I think it smells pretty good</li>
            <li> What could be better owe ya it all natural and great for my lashes and lengthening  too ...</li>
            <li> best mascara, gives your lashes amazing length and what&#x27;s very important for me, keeps them soft not stiff.</li>
            <li> But for the better ingredients, I&#x27;m fine with the trade off.  </li>
            <li> and this fit the bill most for me</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that so far, I like it.  </li>
            <li> It gives a natural looking thickness and color to your lashes and it does indeed smell great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look nearly as good, and the smell really turns my stomach.</li>
            <li> This smells almost as good as it works, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and very effective.</li>
            <li> I get a whiff of sweet cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> My lashes even look full!</li>
            <li> The wand is cool too!</li>
            <li> So for $21 a year, not bad at all!</li>
            <li> Washes off just as easy.  </li>
            <li> This mascara goes on easy and does not smudge.  </li>
            <li> Smudges too easily and burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and comes off easily just with water.</li>
            <li> This however does not come of easily and requires an eye makeup remover in addition to soap and water to get the racoon look off your eyes that this leaves after washing.  </li>
            <li> BTW, it&#x27;s easy to remove with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> (i haven&#x27;t tried it in the pool, though), goes on and cleans off easily.  </li>
            <li> It comes off easily with any make up remover.  </li>
            <li> It spreads evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run, but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The wand, for me, makes applying the product easy.</li>
            <li> Smudges easily.</li>
            <li> However, when it does, it&#x27;s easy to wipe away</li>
            <li> it stays on all day without smudging, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I smell a strong chocolate scent every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> Okay if you poured a bowl full of fingernail polish into a bowl and stuck a hershey kiss in it, thats what you smell.</li>
            <li> Best mascara hands down.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Perfect brown color - not too light and not too dark.  </li>
            <li> The first lash I tried it on was perfect, but the second lash went clumpy.</li>
            <li> The Brown is so perfect for me (auburn colored hair), I don&#x27;t even want to try black.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I know better....</li>
            <li> Smells like delicious brownies, but is a little sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on my lashes, doesn&#x27;t flake and easy to remove!  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of cheap Avon chapstick.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t clump up.  </li>
            <li> I want everyone to enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has excellent lengthening power, and you can build it up with a few coats.</li>
            <li> as it has dried out a bit, i must say this is the perfect mascara for me-</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li> At age 40, that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous mascara from the packaging and ingredients to the smell and longevity of the application.  </li>
            <li> i dont like to wear heavy makeup, so the light application is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is the one mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye lids, doesn&#x27;t make my lashes feel stiff or brittle, no tiny flakes that fly into my eyes and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have written, it smells incredible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for the first time today, they look great,feel ok as well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase of this all natural mascara.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and now own two different colors.</li>
            <li> For the emotionally stable, this is a wonderful, natural product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is worth every penny - it doesn&#x27;t clump, lasts all day, and removes fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this amazing truly natural mascara!</li>
            <li> Consistency is great, doesn&#x27;t clump, easy to layer, I buy the brown Dark Chocolate color</li>
            <li> In regards to the smell, when you first apply it you can surely smell chocolate and it lingers for a bit but is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> the mascara tube itself just has a special look.  </li>
            <li> I have used this brand of mascara before &amp; absolutely love 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even thinking of buying some for my mom for mother&#x27;s day because I love it so much</li>
            <li> I love to eat chocolate, but this smell is a bit much for eyelashes, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Well this product was a true lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Each time I get a fresh tube, I can smell the fabulous smell every time I blink my eyes.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite mascara of all time.</li>
            <li> I really wated to love these product but it did not do it for me.</li>
            <li> Smells of dark chocolate, the color is a nice deep brown, consistency is good and packaging is really nice.</li>
            <li> look- this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> i think the soft finish is nice, but</li>
            <li> It smells like sweet chocolate,  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li> I have purchased black before and it smells good (like berries I think) and is more noticeable.</li>
            <li> This effect goes away quickly after washing my face.</li>
            <li> These mild mascaras never irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> :)  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used many mascaras both natural and not that end up under your eyes!!  </li>
            <li> Better than they ever looked with all those fancy and toxic normal mascara&#x27;s &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> I tried 100 Percent Pure Dark Chocolate and was immediately pleased with the pleasant- chocolate-smelling scent.</li>
            <li> I love this new mascara.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second one because I just love the results!  </li>
            <li> I wear it to work 5 days a week, and still using my first purchase, which I bought a year ago!</li>
            <li> I love all the natural ingredients (I can pronounce all of them!)</li>
            <li> Love this all natural mascara!</li>
            <li> It is not chunky, or clumpy, or flaky, it&#x27;s smooth, stays smooth, and gives a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this mascara, based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> not an evening look but great for the everyday natural look I love.</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth and covers very well.</li>
            <li> So far this is has been one of the top two mascaras that I have tried BUT still in search of a #1.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural product and</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> and I think it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> and it completely dries, then you can&#x27;t apply another coat over the top.  </li>
            <li> this one is both natural and stays on better than anything i have used</li>
            <li> And I love that it is all natural made with fruit pigments.</li>
            <li> I love knowing that I am putting something natural on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
            <li> As someone who&#x27;s trying to switch all my makeup products to more natural options, this mascara is a must buy.</li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can even smell that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It even smells of fresh chocolate which in my opinion is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t irritate your eyes with store bought mascara, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had completely given up on any mascara when I decided to give it one more try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, has a good look (not outrageous- natural), and has very little smudging.</li>
            <li> It is as good as the other mascaras out on the market.</li>
            <li> Everything I want in a mascara is right here, without the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly - no major clumping - and it has a nice glossiness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like somebody amped up my eyes naturally, which I love, because when I want a natural look, this makes it supremely easy.</li>
            <li> It is fun to put on as the aroma of it really smells of chocolate!  </li>
            <li> got Dark Chocolate which actually smells like chocolate cocoa butter which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge, like I read in another review, and it leaves my lashes nice and long.</li>
            <li> but there are a lot more natural mascaras out there that are more expensive, and this brand to me is a brilliant compromise to have a truly natural mascara that performs this well!</li>
            <li> The color is nice, and the smell is definitely a pick-me-up when I&#x27;m getting ready for work in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two months, and every time I apply it it&#x27;s just as creamy and easy to apply as the first day.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality product, though!</li>
            <li> I have very light, short lashes and this</li>
            <li> I know the products are pure, so I was not afraid to try this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used an organic mascara</li>
            <li> When I first ordered it, I thought that the chocolate just referred to the color.  </li>
            <li> This is my second order, absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;bonus: edible smell and pretty container.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use make-up for months,and when I occasionally forget that I&#x27;m wearing it and rub my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li> I unwrapped that, and inside was a pretty cardboard tube that was sort of a peachy-pink color and creme.</li>
            <li> I opened that and found the pretty silver tube of mascara that was wrapped in a perforated shrink-wrap plastic.</li>
            <li> when i first  opened the mascara and used it, i felt it a bit &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, but it never clunked or gunked up once.</li>
            <li> i truly love it and will definitely be re-ordering it once the time comes.</li>
            <li> I will tell you when I first started using it</li>
            <li> It gets three stars for having excellent non-toxic ingredients but sadly, I will be going back to a toxin-filled brand that works much better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually pretty \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and stays this way for months.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about a natural mascara, but I loved the idea of it and the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved the color and did not mind the slight scent of chocolate!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve experienced flakes with a black one, when it gets to be 6 months old.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural mascara, this one is worth trying!  </li>
            <li> The black has a little more bleeding than I&#x27;ve experienced with the brown.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of mascaras over the years, from drug store brands to prestige cosmetics, and the only one I&#x27;ve ever loved was an urban decay brand that they&#x27;ve stopped making.</li>
            <li> mascara and I&#x27;m not sure this is quite that, but it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> this is a really nice mascara, especially given that it is natural.</li>
            <li> As far as being natural - that&#x27;s why I love it.</li>
            <li> It is very light and natural for an everyday look-- when I want a more &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; look I do turn to something else.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice natural look that I enjoy for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love smelling chocolate all day long.</li>
            <li> This does not add much volume, which I need, and is pretty watery</li>
            <li> it is buildable mascara, in that, when you put on the first application its very fine/light.</li>
            <li> By the time I woke up the next morning, my eyelids were incredibly swollen (picture someone who&#x27;s been crying for 24 hours straight</li>
            <li> nice dark brown color.</li>
            <li> I loved it, but I do like the black better than the dark chocolate, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> They always work great the first time, and then the next day they clump and make a mess.</li>
            <li> and it has a very true brown hue which I like because it is a little more natural looking.</li>
            <li> Washes off easy and I am not worried about sleeping with some left on.</li>
            <li> but application is still easy enough.</li>
            <li> Again, I was pleased that not only I received the fullness in my lashes that I wanted, the mascara does not run until you take it off, so no dark rings!!!  </li>
            <li> But, it is pure fruit mascara...</li>
            <li> Pure .</li>
            <li> I wish 100% pure had an eyelash primer so that I could stick to the all-natural goodness of the products they offer.  </li>
            <li> 100% pure continues to impress me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because it was so pure in its ingredients and that is what I seek in a mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have been a fan of 100% Pure for years now, and this item is a staple in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> Pure mascara</li>
            <li> Other brands of natural mascaras don&#x27;t perform any better, so I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply a light layer for a natural look, which is usually the look I&#x27;m going for.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell too much and the bottle is a bit shiny.</li>
            <li> Much Preferred over physicians formula for improving eyelash health and growth.</li>
            <li> I regret spending so much on something that doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> It gives my eyelashes more of a wet look</li>
            <li> you really should try this.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Looks very natural.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Thanks to one day of their products, I&#x27;m now having issues with my skin being oversensitive.  </li>
            <li> Best mascara so far, does not run, builds up thin lashes with a natural look.  </li>
            <li> But oh my gosh does it smell like straight up chocolate.</li>
            <li> And, 3) reasonably non-smudge.  </li>
            <li> Just wouldn&#x27;t buy it for the smell haha</li>
            <li> This product is so incredibly gentle on my eyes.</li>
            <li> It goes on without much clumping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Oh well, back to the drawing board in finding a mascara I can wear comfortably, all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************************************&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t very stable on lashes, and in fact doesn&#x27;t make anything to them.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit overpowering and does not seem to diminish much throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Fresh and natural.</li>
            <li> in that it is gentle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t have to say anything else</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> I tried making my own with activated charcoal, but gave up after numerous experiments that left me with raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am a fair redhead, with pale eyelashes and sensitive, allergy-prone eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara along with other 100% pure products for years and just love the results, ingredients, colors and quality of the products.</li>
            <li> Now, don&#x27;t get all excited and think that your lashes are going to look thick and dark and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> It smells like chocolate, stays on long, &amp; washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara and love that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals of other brands.  </li>
            <li> and then the other then repeat this two more times for both eyes.  </li>
            <li> so chocolate color is perfect for me, just a little hint but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, the best natural mascara I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a few.  </li>
            <li> i think next time i will buy the black for a more dramatic look, but the brown is great for a softer, more natural look.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive eyes, and I had pretty much given up on finding a mascara that could suit my requirements:  </li>
            <li> This dark brown will effectively emphasize light/blonde lashes for a natural look; it&#x27;s probably not for you if you&#x27;re going for eye drama on a runway or at a photo shoot.</li>
            <li> I would know - good quality dark chocolate is part of my daily diet!</li>
            <li> Just when I thought I could only use it on special occasions with allergy drops I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is just the right shade for me since I have dark brown hair with some light brown highlights.  </li>
            <li> Not as dark as many &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why more people aren&#x27;t loving the dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> Excited that it was natural- a little too light and burns</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t pin where this smell was coming from &amp; then remembered the new mascara!</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to brand for mascara!  </li>
            <li> so I also love the Black berry</li>
            <li> it does do a decent job at separating the lashes, and seems to lengthen them (unless my lashes are growing-</li>
            <li> Some of the make-up I bought was even older.  </li>
            <li> I like this much better than Physicians Formula Organic mascara which causes my eyes to instantly become irritated, red, and puffy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very sensitive to water, so it will smear and isn&#x27;t that much nicer to your eyes if it gets inside the lid...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s great -- not thick and clumpy, very natural looking and plenty dark for my dark lashes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product although I find that the applicator brush is difficult to get the lower lashes coated.</li>
            <li> It is very close to the color of my natural lashes, but fuller and deeper and richer.  </li>
            <li> It gives amazing length and fullness without it looking too thick.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for a natural mascara, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> First of all, there is barely any in this mascara so no worries about lumping.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a dark brown mascara because I feel like it is more natural looking on me.</li>
            <li> i rarely wear any makeup, especially eye makeup</li>
            <li> There is no going back to the store brands, this is worth the price if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Both go on thick and easily and stay on pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li> thinking I was buying the black one with fruit pigments, but this chocolate one (dark brown) is also amazing!</li>
            <li> It probably wouldn&#x27;t bother many people, but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive &amp; that particular &#x27;flavor&#x27; did irritate my eyes just a little, not bad, but if you are sensitive to things, I&#x27;d recommend trying one of the other &#x27;flavors&#x27;.</li>
            <li> In the last year I have become very familar with 100% Pure products.  </li>
            <li> but I hope they develop an improved &amp; new edition.</li>
            <li> Found my new mascara brand.</li>
            <li> I went over a year without finding anything (tried a new one every month</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and this product is okay so far.</li>
            <li> My eyes were getting really dry for some reason and when I switched to this more natural one it helped immensely.</li>
            <li> it smells divine, like warm chocolate brownies (seriously) and it has kept that scent for the month or so that i have been using it.  </li>
            <li> Very natural look.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li> it does avoid clumping and gives me a very natural look.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very sensitive to eye makeup, beware..</li>
            <li> it stays on well without fading or smudging,  the color is very natural looking,  and I also use it on my  eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Which some might love, but I happen to be allergic to it and highly sensitive to the smell in a bad headache kind of way.</li>
            <li> mascara definitely exceeds my first two expectations.  </li>
            <li> I normally wear brown mascara as I am a natural strawberry blond with blond eyelashes/eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why this mascara doesn&#x27;t have more reviews unless maybe not many people who shop Amazon have tried</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> Replaced my usual Maybelline mascara with this and love it so far!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with little effort and stays on.  </li>
            <li> but i found that it smeared a little to easy.  </li>
            <li> I also think that because this has a natural pigment that it has naturally tinted my eyelashes a little dark when I don&#x27;t have it on, which is really nice!</li>
            <li> My eyes and skin are super sensitive and I have diagnosed allergies to several common ingredients in most natural products as well.  </li>
            <li> I like how gentle it went on and the natural look, until the eyes started itching and when rubbed, major smudging....raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s made out of natural ingredients - I will definitely be checking out other products from this line.</li>
            <li> I was able to get from the lash line, all the way to the end of my lashes, and smooth out any areas where too much product may have been left behind during the initial application.</li>
            <li> One coat provides a subtle natural look, but I like to really coat it on to get a sexy look.</li>
            <li> but I think my favorite is going to be the dark choc because I wear black/brown on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Found this by accident on Amazon - I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but so far I really like it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several mascaras in the past few years, some at double the price, and this one is the best for me.</li>
            <li> The consistency is just right, not too runny, not too dry.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and looks nice but just smudges too quick or really bad if it gets wet.  </li>
            <li> It does not give the defined and dark finish as the other unnatural products but is good enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken as much as say, Urban Decay, but I wanted to switch to something all natural.  </li>
            <li> I developed styes.  </li>
            <li> I used this mascara again and developed another stye.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying direct from 100%</li>
            <li> I use a natural lavender oil to remove it before I cleanse my face at night.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have ocular rosacea, so my eyes are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I wrote to the company for the complete ingredient list or material safety data sheet/label and received no response.  </li>
            <li> Lot numbers on this make-up indicated it was over two years old.  </li>
            <li> Beware of resellers selling old make-up.</li>
            <li> However I will say, as it&#x27;s natural-</li>
            <li> I prefer natural products and zero chemicals.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally oily so that may be the cause, or not.  </li>
            <li> I have gone almost 2 years without wearing mascara unless I absolutely have to for an occasion: When I do my eyes become really red, itchy and watery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking on Amazon for sensitive eyes mascara</li>
            <li> My lashes still feel soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> does not make your eyes itch, natural ingredients/</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought natural before</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s natural and cruelty</li>
            <li> My lashes look natural.</li>
            <li> i like a natural look</li>
            <li> to like the &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; of it for a natural look and healthier product</li>
            <li> So for all that, I gave it five stars, because what else can a natural gal expect of her mascara?</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this mascara held up.</li>
            <li> it nearly drove me to gouge out my eyeballs.</li>
            <li> and yes i tried natural health store brands as well)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m into all natural things</li>
            <li> I think they got an old or expired tube.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dark Chocolate mascara and found the smell to be too sweet, which turned me off from continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a true brown, also- just like dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to be negative, but I thought it&#x27;d be fair to share that this mascara is certainly not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product... and just placed my second order of it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m planning to when I get low), and would highly recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Always free shipping no matter how small the order.</li>
            <li> I wore it all day long and no flaking or smudging, no irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> it smells like chocolate, no joke, and neither the smell or general formulation irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> You may need a couple of coats to get a look that you would normally get with regular mascara</li>
            <li> Additionally, the wand is great - very even coverage, no smearing on the base of the lids and no caking/clumping together of eyelids.</li>
            <li> and it is still not as thick as the earlier ones but much better than the November tube.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money to throw these pure products in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> A little pricey (why the 4 stars) but worth the splurge now and then.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised because I expected it to smell like sweet berries like the black formula.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect it to work like regular old toxic mascara.  </li>
            <li> so far the only mascara I can wear without a  fume smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and won&#x27;t go back to the old stuff</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if it is even  possible to have a 100% natural product that does not smudge.  </li>
            <li> &gt; - Knowing the natural ingredients is obviously a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1) as natural of ingredients as possible.  </li>
            <li> and this is not only all natural, but it also stays on quite well without flaking or smudging.  </li>
            <li> Love this non irritating mascara.  </li>
            <li> Pure&#x27;s other cosmetics</li>
            <li> I actually like this product better than the black mascara I previously purchased.</li>
            <li> It has extreme staying power (comparable to drugstore, chemical laden mascaras) and doesn&#x27;t smudge (much) if I accidentally rub my eyes.</li>
            <li> I will only wear natural make-up products, and wanted to branch out to a different mascara brand from what I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird at first to move your head and get whiffs of chocolate, but you get used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I had spent years finding the perfect one to give me thick, long lashes that were dramatic but not spidery</li>
            <li> this mascara can also be reapplied after an initial application for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this particular color, but am wearing their other new mascara all day today and absolutely no problems.  </li>
            <li> I have already purchased the Black tea and Black berry which I love both the black tea is not a harsh black which I really like</li>
            <li> On a tight budget the price was a bit much for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 100% pure mascaras for a few years.</li>
            <li> I let it dry a few minutes between each layer, and it works really well!</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell yummy, it makes my lashes feel soft, not brittle like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I have several other natural mascaras but in the heat and humidity of a Texas summer that all end up smeared under my eyelashes by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have never used any mascara other than available-at-store brands (l&#x27;oreal, maybelline, etc) but have found that with my skin/eyes being so sensitive now, all those mascaras irritate them to no end.  </li>
            <li> I hate normal mascaras and love the idea of putting something natural so close to my eyes.</li>
            <li> it gave my already long lashes color (theyre blonde) and made all the tiny lashes show up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very pricey - not sure if I would order it again, but I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> The brown is a dark color that looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Because it is not a commercial &amp;#34;industrial strength&amp;#34; formula, it can flake or smudge after a long day of wear.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide if I like that or not, but it&#x27;s strange and the scent lasts for several hours, even when the mascara is</li>
            <li> Yes, at the very end of the day there was just a bit under my eyes but much less than the other mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li> Loreal Voluminous WAS a favorite but avoiding all that chemical laden crap as much as I can.</li>
            <li> If you are lash challenged,and want thick, lush and natural lashes,try this mascara.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine that I would actually like it, but because I am a label reader and try very hard to purchase as pure products as possible, I decided to give it a try--and voila!  </li>
            <li> I should note that I am a little sensitive to the coffee one.</li>
            <li> , i have raccoon eyes--not a bad thing, as i&#x27;m fond of the rocker chick / strung out look--and it&#x27;s sometimes nice to feel sympatica with lindsay</li>
            <li> My eyes have natural dark rings, so adding a dark mascara would only add to the discoloration.</li>
            <li> A strange or foul odor from your tube of mascara is another sign that your tube has expired.</li>
            <li> You can build your lashes long with this mascara as long as you keep applying coats one after another.  </li>
            <li> If you wait too long</li>
            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> I do notice though if I wear it too long</li>
            <li> And it has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> I put on one coat, no clumps, makes my eyelashes look fairly long</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes</li>
            <li> The show is an hour long.</li>
            <li> This mascara is, naturally, not waterproof.</li>
            <li> I quit wearing mascara for a long time because of it.  </li>
            <li> but I now see it lasts twice as long as store bought mascaras</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, if you put just a thin application it looks so natural and feels like you have nothing on.</li>
            <li> And I really know it doesn&#x27;t run, as it stood the ultimate test: I wore it in a dance performance where I am blindfolded in three different sections with a heavy canvas blindfold, dancing hard and sweating.</li>
            <li> As long as they keeping making this, I&#x27;ll keep buying!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even notice the mascara during the day unlike other mascaras that are constantly clumping and scratching around the eye</li>
            <li> It keeps my lashes long and lushes!</li>
            <li> They always have a red tint to them from the ocular rosacea but this mascara does not exacerbate that like the other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> All other mascaras give me burning red eyes.  </li>
            <li> You can smell the scent of chocolate all day long!</li>
            <li> This product never makes my eyes feel dry or irritated.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes or eye allergies</li>
            <li> The product seems a bit too dry.</li>
            <li> I see some people here say that this mascara is dry, flaky etc.</li>
            <li> I wear a single coat at a time, and the amount of mascara in the tube always outlasts the recommended three months of use for any mascara.</li>
            <li> The dark chocolate is my fav, then blueberry next.</li>
            <li> But dark enough to add color.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The dark chocolate one happened to be cheaper the last time I need mascara, so I figured why not.</li>
            <li> I found it only slightly enhances what I&#x27;ve already got.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems a little bit dry, yet conditioning (if that is possible)  ...</li>
            <li> I do have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to phenoxyethanol so I&#x27;m very limited in mascara that I can use.</li>
            <li> and/or looks artificial on my light eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; in dark chocolate isn&#x27;t dark enough.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day; therefore, I am not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Only trouble is that it smudges over the course of the day.  </li>
            <li> and it was empty</li>
            <li> After wearing it for approximately five hours, my eyelids started to feel really itchy.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be smudged around my eyes</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> It flaked off after a few hours and left me with a gray look</li>
            <li> (im guilty of this bc i rarely wear anything and forget) but it doesnt flake or get into your eyes and irritate them.</li>
            <li> &gt; - This is probably just me, but the weight of the applicator is lighter than I&#x27;m used to, so I was messy with applying until I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt; - Not really a con for me, but perhaps for some: the thinner consistency feels different than your average mascara and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof and I am hard on mascara, so I do add Bare Minerals Locked and Coated sealer.</li>
            <li> I thought it was due to some other irritant.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t say if it is tocopheral-a, which is in their other products.</li>
            <li> no chemicals or other irritants.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It elongates my lashes, but doesn&#x27;t make them as plush as some other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Been using this mascara about 2 weeks now, every other day.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like your mascara to be extremely smelly of chocolate and feel like it interferes with your perfume...DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
            <li> It smells like chocolate yet works as well as other mascaras.</li>
            <li> The mascara seemed to be a little dry</li>
            <li> I ordered it just to see how bad a natural, organic mascara really could be.  </li>
            <li> It also tends to smudge after a long day, but a small price to pay for no chemicals in my eyes (I tend not to wash my makeup off at night).  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair and dark eyes.  </li>
            <li> I got the dark chocolate color...</li>
            <li> The color is dark brown.</li>
            <li> In the past, a tube would last a few months.  </li>
            <li> , it was dark.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like chocolate but a fake chocolate impostor.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Dark Chocolate as well as the Blueberry.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s still not the mess that other mascaras are.  </li>
            <li> but have never tried the dark brown one.</li>
            <li> I have thin blondish lashes that come alive into almost falsie thickness and length with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I also like the dark brown color as opposed to black.</li>
            <li> to me it looks black moreso than a dark chocolate (which I figured would be black/brown).  </li>
            <li> As for the color, in the tube it looks like a milk chocolate color but once applied to my lashes it looked dark just like my black mascara.</li>
            <li> I have dark lashes and do not always like the black mascara</li>
            <li> It has a slight chocolate smell to it, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I believe I have less ending up under my eyes by the end of the day than I did with the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I had done the black.</li>
            <li> but it started to have an odd smell after a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this before to any mascara--natural or otherwise, which makes me wonder if there&#x27;s a hidden ingredient in this product that isn&#x27;t being disclosed.</li>
            <li> I also use the black.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use mascara that has black iron oxide because I get a sore on my temple that never seems to heal.  </li>
            <li> I looked around and even brown mascaras contain the black iron oxide.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried blackberry, blueberry, black.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a little smoother!</li>
            <li> for me, it&#x27;s a little too chocolately smelling.  </li>
            <li> it smells like chocolate which take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> my eyes look tiny and tired without mascara.</li>
            <li> if you do end up crying.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this mascara, but this chemically sensitive woman loves  this product.</li>
            <li> I have such thin lashes.</li>
            <li> im terribly sensitive to all things (sadly).  </li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with it at all.  </li>
            <li> The black tea version rocks too!  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve lost LESS eyelashes!</li>
            <li> If you are wanting something extremely dramatic, this may not work for you, especially in brown.</li>
            <li> I am using the brown-black mascara and it uses cocoa for part of the color-fun to smell a little bit of cocoa when I go to apply it!</li>
            <li> I usually buy $6</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t have my usual brand on Amazon, so I splurged on this because of the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use my eyes strenuously at work and usually can&#x27;t wear any eye makeup</li>
            <li> I always hated torturing my eye lashes, so it only made sense to use something so natural.</li>
            <li> but they are very pale.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the smell of chocolate,  just not all day long.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue is that it is hard to take off, it smudges, smears but does not come off.</li>
            <li> I immediately washed the product off, but it was too late.</li>
            <li> I prefer unscented products or at least products with a scent I don&#x27;t mind having on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It lengthens like no ones business and is thick without clumping.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick.  </li>
            <li> After it dries you will hardly smell it anymore unless you are a rapid blinker throughout the day, even then it is only a very faint chocolate smell.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it smells A LOT.  </li>
            <li> I hate the smell of chemicals near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin but stays on just as well as any of the thicker, heavier-feeling mascara out</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate waterproof formulas, but I really hate having raccoon eyes, or constantly having to check the mirror &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I debated whether to spend an unheard of (for me) $18.00 on a mascara that may be just as irritating to my eyes as all the rest have become.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any discomfort or irritation in wearing this mascara.</li>
            <li> but my eyes didn&#x27;t care how expensive the product or how \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t come in brown but does come inblackberry, which I might try</li>
            <li> I have tried every expensive mascara...</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be less cruel of a consumer,  </li>
            <li> I have applied it three days in a row without any complaint from my eyes!!!  </li>
            <li> The chocolate smell is overwhelmingly artificial.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry, I promise!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as a Maybelline product, but you&#x27;re not getting all the nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It causes severe irritation and makes my eyes burn really badly.</li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews and took a chance anyway</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had mascara on :(</li>
            <li> Gotta return. :-(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - this mascara smudges, flakes, and no length whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is that it smudged.</li>
            <li> Worst allergic reaction I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>

            <li> I think this stuff smells A M A Z I N G !!!  I guess I have to get used to &amp;#34;natural mascaras&amp;#34; because I have yet to find one I LOVE... This  Pure mascara does have a lot of great qualities to it... I LOVE the facts it is natural-pure, LOVE the way it smells, LOVE the container its in....it does do a decent job at separating the lashes, and seems to lengthen them (unless my lashes are growing-I hope so! ) I have had it about a month now and know you are supposed to replace &amp;#34;Web MD states-Masacara should be kept no longer than three months after opening. After three months, bacteria can begin to grow inside the tube; this growth of bacteria can lead to an infection. A strange or foul odor from your tube of mascara is another sign that your tube has expired. If you notice that your mascara appears flaky or is caking up, discard of it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems a little bit dry, yet conditioning (if that is possible)  ... I had a sample of Jane Iradale mascara which seemed to do a very good job, in my opinion, my lashes opinion... This DOES seem to be better than Organic Wear and Ecco Bella which I have also tried....  Loreal Voluminous WAS a favorite but avoiding all that chemical laden crap as much as I can. So far this is has been one of the top two mascaras that I have tried BUT still in search of a #1. This is close &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Works well and has is made from quality, healthful ingredients. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I have literally never been able to wear mascara because it ends up under my eyes and not on my lashes. This is the first mascara that doesn&#x27;t do that. And it smells like chocolate. Okay, I think I&#x27;m in mascara heaven.</li>
            <li> I developed styes.  I thought it was due to some other irritant. I used this mascara again and developed another stye.  It&#x27;s not for me</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used an organic mascara and I&#x27;m very happy and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mascara.</li>
            <li> I have already purchased the Black tea and Black berry which I love both the black tea is not a harsh black which I really like and I wear a lot of purple so I also love the Black berry but I think my favorite is going to be the dark choc because I wear black/brown on a daily basis I have hazel brown eyes and blonde hair so a like the softer look and this fit the bill most for me I also love the choc scent it remind me of out of the over home made warm  budgie brownies ...What could be better owe ya it all natural and great for my lashes and lengthening  too ...WIN WIN situation !!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It is as good as the other mascaras out on the market. It lengthens and darkens my lashes. It does not give the defined and dark finish as the other unnatural products but is good enough. The best part is that it comes of very easily and does not irritate my eyes!</li>
            <li> Love everything by this company.</li>
            <li> I loved it, but I do like the black better than the dark chocolate, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell too much and the bottle is a bit shiny. But, it is pure fruit mascara...I smell a strong chocolate scent every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara along with other 100% pure products for years and just love the results, ingredients, colors and quality of the products. I have thin blondish lashes that come alive into almost falsie thickness and length with this mascara. I can&#x27;t count how many people ask me what mascara I use.  The dark chocolate is my fav, then blueberry next.</li>
            <li> THis product is soooooo rad because of its ingredients obviously. But don&#x27;t expect it to work like regular old toxic mascara.  I found it only slightly enhances what I&#x27;ve already got.  &amp; theres a bit more maintenance in terms of under eye dust after a bit.  Good trade off for avoiding cancer but I hope they develop an improved &amp; new edition.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural product and so far the only mascara I can wear without a  fume smell.</li>
            <li> Best mascara on the Planet. I absolutely LOVE it, even smells like chocolate! Looks incredible and does not irritate my eyes with toxic vapors like chemical mascaras do. I have been using this mascara for over a year and the tubes seem to last forever, I just a couple of drops of water to it and Voila! I get another couple of months out of a tube. The black tea version rocks too!  10.14.2016 Update: I have been buying direct from 100% Pure . com website. Always free shipping no matter how small the order. All of their makeup has been wonderful. Highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! It smells like berries and it lasts all day! It does not clump and does not run unless I&#x27;m rubbing my eyes all day!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I love that it&#x27;s all natural. I love the smell. I love the way it goes on, lengthening my lashes without clumping. It is not waterproof and I am hard on mascara, so I do add Bare Minerals Locked and Coated sealer. It stays put all day. I highly recommend this product... and just placed my second order of it.</li>
            <li> 1st time trying this &amp; I&#x27;m hooked! It goes on well, lasts (no smears yet), &amp; once in awhile during the day I get a whiff of sweet cocoa butter! I couldn&#x27;t pin where this smell was coming from &amp; then remembered the new mascara! Sending now to daughter &amp; will share the rave reviews!</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell yummy, it makes my lashes feel soft, not brittle like other mascaras. It is the best mascara I have ever used. I do love it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara. Smells delicious and goes on beautifully. Much Preferred over physicians formula for improving eyelash health and growth.</li>
            <li> My husband said, when leaning in for a kiss, &amp;#34;you smell good...like chocolate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you are lash challenged,and want thick, lush and natural lashes,try this mascara.I&#x27;m using it for the first time today, they look great,feel ok as well. I haven&#x27;t been wearing mascara in years and this is something I believe will make me go back to using it again. I like this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this mascara. However, every time that I&#x27;ve worn it I end up having to take it off. It causes severe irritation and makes my eyes burn really badly. Overall, I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Goes nice and no clumping.</li>
            <li> The chocolate smell is overwhelmingly artificial. It reminds me of cheap Avon chapstick. I usually buy $6 Maybelline but they didn&#x27;t have my usual brand on Amazon, so I splurged on this because of the 5 star reviews. I&#x27;m really disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t look nearly as good, and the smell really turns my stomach. I don&#x27;t like to be negative, but I thought it&#x27;d be fair to share that this mascara is certainly not for everyone. I regret spending so much on something that doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> Beautiful presentation, smells wonderful, does not irritate my eyes, and lasts a long time! i&#x27;ve found my match :)</li>
            <li> I actually like this product better than the black mascara I previously purchased. It smells amazing. It gives my eyelashes more of a wet look and I think it looks more natural. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much.  It is very light and natural for an everyday look-- when I want a more &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; look I do turn to something else.  The best part is that it smells JUST like chocolate.  I was very surprised because I expected it to smell like sweet berries like the black formula.  Nope! Chocolate :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use primer underneath to both pump up the effect and make it stick on better.  Because it is not a commercial &amp;#34;industrial strength&amp;#34; formula, it can flake or smudge after a long day of wear.  I wish 100% pure had an eyelash primer so that I could stick to the all-natural goodness of the products they offer.  100% pure continues to impress me.  I dearly wish I could afford to try all of their products.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and won&#x27;t go back to the old stuff</li>
            <li> I like this mascara and love that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals of other brands.  It has a slight chocolate smell to it, which I like.  When I first ordered it, I thought that the chocolate just referred to the color.  You can build your lashes long with this mascara as long as you keep applying coats one after another.  If you wait too long and it completely dries, then you can&#x27;t apply another coat over the top.  I apply it to one eye and then the other then repeat this two more times for both eyes.  It will wash off with soap or facial cleaners.  I use a natural lavender oil to remove it before I cleanse my face at night.  If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural mascara, this one is worth trying!  I also like the dark brown color as opposed to black.</li>
            <li> Ever heard of a mascara that doesn&#x27;t contai a million chemicals to make you infertile, cause cancer, etc?  This is it!  Go buy it!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras.  They always work great the first time, and then the next day they clump and make a mess. This one is different.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two months, and every time I apply it it&#x27;s just as creamy and easy to apply as the first day.  The color is nice, and the smell is definitely a pick-me-up when I&#x27;m getting ready for work in the morning.  Also, I have ocular rosacea, so my eyes are sensitive.  This product never makes my eyes feel dry or irritated.  This is my new go-to brand for mascara!  As long as they keeping making this, I&#x27;ll keep buying!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn mascara in 30 years without my eyes reacting to it. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds and have paid up to $45 for a tube but my eyes didn&#x27;t care how expensive the product or how \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; it was; they still got red, scratchy, swollen or burning. Just when I thought I could only use it on special occasions with allergy drops I decided to try this product. I have applied it three days in a row without any complaint from my eyes!!!  I even rubbed my eye forgetting I had it on and it was no problem. My lashes didn&#x27;t even stick together. I love this stuff!  I have long lashes so I don&#x27;t care about making them look longer. It&#x27;s not clumpy or flakey and it hasn&#x27;t smudged. Washes off easy and I am not worried about sleeping with some left on. If you have dry eyes or eye allergies you really should try this.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara better than I thought. The color is good. It goes on smoothly. I do notice though if I wear it too long my eyes become a bit itchy. This effect goes away quickly after washing my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great product although I find that the applicator brush is difficult to get the lower lashes coated. The smell is divine just like chocolate!You don&#x27;t even notice the mascara during the day unlike other mascaras that are constantly clumping and scratching around the eye</li>
            <li> The mascara works great.  I believe I have less ending up under my eyes by the end of the day than I did with the others I have tried.  I just wish I had done the black.</li>
            <li> Lovely color, and smells delicious. Very natural look. Only trouble is that it smudges over the course of the day.  Makes me wonder if it is even  possible to have a 100% natural product that does not smudge.  I&#x27;m going to let my daughter use this for play (cha-ching), won&#x27;t buy again for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  It goes on smoothly, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t clump up.  It keeps my lashes long and lushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and I am extremely happy.  It is very gentle on my lashes, doesn&#x27;t flake and easy to remove!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect brown color - not too light and not too dark.  The smell is wonderful - like chocolate!  It doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken as much as say, Urban Decay, but I wanted to switch to something all natural.  It also tends to smudge after a long day, but a small price to pay for no chemicals in my eyes (I tend not to wash my makeup off at night).  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - this mascara smudges, flakes, and no length whatsoever.  I would rather use grocery store mascara than this.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because it was so pure in its ingredients and that is what I seek in a mascara.  I just purchased my second one because I just love the results!  Easy to apply with little effort and stays on.  Washes off just as easy.  Lashes look great with no irritation.  Comes in a great packaging tube and the mascara tube itself just has a special look.  :)  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> In the last year I have become very familar with 100% Pure products.  I have not found one I do not like.  This mascara goes on easy and does not smudge.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is just perfect. My lashes even look full! Better than they ever looked with all those fancy and toxic normal mascara&#x27;s &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; brushes. And I swear they&#x27;re growing and getting longer. Found my new mascara brand.</li>
            <li> I hate normal mascaras and love the idea of putting something natural so close to my eyes. It not only looks great but smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of mascaras over the years, from drug store brands to prestige cosmetics, and the only one I&#x27;ve ever loved was an urban decay brand that they&#x27;ve stopped making. I was somewhat skeptical about a natural mascara, but I loved the idea of it and the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so impressed with this mascara. I hope they never stop making it. As other reviewers have written, it smells incredible. It&#x27;s a little weird at first to move your head and get whiffs of chocolate, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Additionally, the wand is great - very even coverage, no smearing on the base of the lids and no caking/clumping together of eyelids. Plus, it&#x27;s definitely lengthening. I really love the way this mascara makes my lashes look. Plus, it washes off fairly easily so you don&#x27;t even need makeup remover, but it lasts great throughout the day. I&#x27;m even thinking of buying some for my mom for mother&#x27;s day because I love it so much I want everyone to enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again (I&#x27;m planning to when I get low), and would highly recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Very nice and does not clump as well as great for people with allergies.  The colors have depth and overall I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product but i found that it smeared a little to easy.  It smells heavenly of course because it is chocolate!  It goes on smooth and looks nice but just smudges too quick or really bad if it gets wet.  Not sure I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used many mascaras both natural and not that end up under your eyes!!  this one is both natural and stays on better than anything i have used</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years - best mascara on the market in my opinion...</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Goes on very smooth. It&#x27;s thin but stays on just as well as any of the thicker, heavier-feeling mascara out there.&lt;br /&gt; - It has yet to clump on me. Looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt; - The brown color is awesome. Not as dark as many &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; colors I&#x27;ve seen in makeup. But dark enough to add color.&lt;br /&gt; - Knowing the natural ingredients is obviously a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - This is probably just me, but the weight of the applicator is lighter than I&#x27;m used to, so I was messy with applying until I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt; - Not really a con for me, but perhaps for some: the thinner consistency feels different than your average mascara and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This mascara smudges very easily, flakes, and no length whatsoever - do not agree with any of the happy customers.</li>
            <li> This product has tocopheral in it, so I will not even try it.  Tocopheral is Vit E and using it topically, rather than ingesting it can cause dermatitis.  They don&#x27;t say if it is tocopheral-a, which is in their other products. Tocopheral-a is acetic acid or carboxylic acid, which I&#x27;m allergic to.  I purchased another color of their mascara and my eyes were red, burning, itching, watering.  Thanks to one day of their products, I&#x27;m now having issues with my skin being oversensitive.  Their MSDS/ingredients are not listed on the government website.  I wrote to the company for the complete ingredient list or material safety data sheet/label and received no response.  Tocopheral-a prolongs shelf life.  If this product has no preservative in it, then why don&#x27;t they say to refrigerate?  I spent a lot of money to throw these pure products in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Purity Cosmetics replaced all of my make-up.  Lot numbers on this make-up indicated it was over two years old.  Some of the make-up I bought was even older.  They are using tocopheral alpha and not tocopheral acetate, which I am allergic to.  I haven&#x27;t tried this particular color, but am wearing their other new mascara all day today and absolutely no problems.  Beware of resellers selling old make-up.</li>
            <li> One application and my eyes burned until I was able to remove the product. Loved the color and did not mind the slight scent of chocolate!</li>
            <li> Best mascara so far, does not run, builds up thin lashes with a natural look.  Smells wonderful and is a cinch to remove.  Very happy to find it, the search is over.</li>
            <li> Love this non irritating mascara.  Lasts all day with no flakes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and this product is okay so far. It has extreme staying power (comparable to drugstore, chemical laden mascaras) and doesn&#x27;t smudge (much) if I accidentally rub my eyes. This has excellent lengthening power, and you can build it up with a few coats. But oh my gosh does it smell like straight up chocolate. I can&#x27;t decide if I like that or not, but it&#x27;s strange and the scent lasts for several hours, even when the mascara is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out on that smell. Very high quality product, though!</li>
            <li> Smudges too easily and burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive eyes, and I had pretty much given up on finding a mascara that could suit my requirements:  1) as natural of ingredients as possible.  No petroleum on my eyelashes, please.  2) as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking as possible -- no flakes or clumps.  And, 3) reasonably non-smudge.  I can&#x27;t tolerate waterproof formulas, but I really hate having raccoon eyes, or constantly having to check the mirror &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara definitely exceeds my first two expectations.  And, it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy or red.</li>
            <li> Smells like chocolate!  I have been using for about 3 weeks and my eyelashes look better already - I&#x27;ve been told it takes about 2 months for definite improvement.  it&#x27;s very pricey - not sure if I would order it again, but I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras.  It does not clump, washes off easily and smells delicious! I have been a fan of 100% Pure for years now, and this item is a staple in my makeup bag.  I have very sensitive skin and eyes and this mascara has never given me a problem.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; in dark chocolate isn&#x27;t dark enough.  I have dark hair and dark eyes.  I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had mascara on :(</li>
            <li> I got the dark chocolate color... But it reeks like coco... Which some might love, but I happen to be allergic to it and highly sensitive to the smell in a bad headache kind of way. Gotta return. :-(</li>
            <li> I always hated torturing my eye lashes, so it only made sense to use something so natural. However I will say, as it&#x27;s natural- it&#x27;s very sensitive to water, so it will smear and isn&#x27;t that much nicer to your eyes if it gets inside the lid...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t that great- but it&#x27;s not bad either. Just wouldn&#x27;t buy it for the smell haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly- I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use this again- it does avoid clumping and gives me a very natural look.</li>
            <li> Found this by accident on Amazon - I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but so far I really like it!  I&#x27;ve been searching for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; mascara and I&#x27;m not sure this is quite that, but it&#x27;s pretty good.  Goes on very smoothly - no major clumping - and it has a nice glossiness. Very good lengthening, and one coat is really all you need.  Amazing that it smells like chocolate, too!  I love that it&#x27;s made out of natural ingredients - I will definitely be checking out other products from this line.</li>
            <li> This is my second order, absolutely LOVE this mascara. It is not chunky, or clumpy, or flaky, it&#x27;s smooth, stays smooth, and gives a very natural look. It&#x27;s like enhancing my lashes without being obvious. And I love that it is all natural made with fruit pigments. It&#x27;s not waterproof, and I prefer it that way, because it&#x27;s easy to remove with coconut oil and a warm wash rag. I wear it to work 5 days a week, and still using my first purchase, which I bought a year ago! So for $21 a year, not bad at all! I highly recommend this mascara. If I could give 10 stars I would!! :-)</li>
            <li> I love that it smells like chocolate! It stays on all day and comes off easily just with water. Love it!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an all-natural mascara that goes on great and looks wonderful, this is it. I love this mascara and now own two different colors. The brush gives nice separation, and there is no clumping. Everything I want in a mascara is right here, without the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smells just like chocolate.  Looks great and doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes.  A little pricey (why the 4 stars) but worth the splurge now and then.</li>
            <li> smells like chocolate powder. I don&#x27;t use mascara regularly. But when I use it once in a while it works well for me. No sensitivity. The color is dark brown. Some reviewers said it extends the eye lashes, but mine has not grown longer. I don&#x27;t use it daily so that may be one of the reason.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I love knowing that I am putting something natural on my eyelashes. The smell is absolutely amazing. I love smelling chocolate all day long. You may need a couple of coats to get a look that you would normally get with regular mascara but it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
            <li> The product seems a bit too dry. The mascara smell great, like chocolate. The biggest issue is that it is hard to take off, it smudges, smears but does not come off. I expected easier removal from something this natural.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I won&#x27;t go back to store brand mascara - this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> It becomes clumpy after using it couple of times. Takes some time to apply, especially if you want to add volume to the eyelashes. Smells great, ingredients are good. I don&#x27;t use it every day; therefore, I am not sure how long it will last. Overall, for a natural mascara, it&#x27;s not bad. Other brands of natural mascaras don&#x27;t perform any better, so I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> To me this works just as well as any mascara I bought in the store.  And it has lasted a long time.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve bought. It smells like chocolate, stays on long, &amp; washes off easily.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!!! This product is so incredibly gentle on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is working well for me. I love the chocolate smell. It goes on without much clumping. It stays on during the day and comes off okay when I wash it off.</li>
            <li> this is a really nice mascara, especially given that it is natural. smells fantastic! i think next time i will buy the black for a more dramatic look, but the brown is great for a softer, more natural look. very happy with many of the 100% pure products!!</li>
            <li> ...and this mascara is what helped me go back to contacts again. My eyes were getting really dry for some reason and when I switched to this more natural one it helped immensely.</li>
            <li> Loved it but it started to have an odd smell after a couple of months.  I did not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The mascara seemed to be a little dry</li>
            <li> I love how it goes on and stays on without any clumping or smearing.  It also smells amazing!!!!!!  ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years... happy to see it available on Amazon!  Great stuff...no chemicals or other irritants.  I have fair skin and light eyes so chocolate color is perfect for me, just a little hint but not overwhelming.  I prefer natural products and zero chemicals.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The chocolate smell is extremely overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Urbanette Magazine and bought it. It doesn&#x27;t clump and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Good mascara, doesn&#x27;t melt under eyes by end of day. Smells like chocolate. Happy to wear something I believe is not harmful to me or the environment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase of this all natural mascara. As someone who&#x27;s trying to switch all my makeup products to more natural options, this mascara is a must buy. Goes on smooth without clumps and smells great! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought the color was chocolate; no this stuff smells like chocolate.  Doesn&#x27;t clump up like regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Wanted an organic mascara and this does the job, nice lash coverage and yummy smell..my dog sniffs my lashes :-) lasts all day doesnt flake and adds good drama.  This however does not come of easily and requires an eye makeup remover in addition to soap and water to get the racoon look off your eyes that this leaves after washing.  Other than that it&#x27;s solid and beats out more expensive organic mascaras like kjaer weise</li>
            <li> UPDATE 11/25/11: After wearing this all day (read 5+ hours) on several occasions, I have to admit it irritates my eyes, making them red and scratchy feeling (keeping in mind I do not wear makeup every day).  Also, I get smudging/bleeding below lower eyelash line.  My skin is naturally oily so that may be the cause, or not.  Oh well, back to the drawing board in finding a mascara I can wear comfortably, all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ocular rosacea, as well as facial rosacea for the last several years.  I have never used any mascara other than available-at-store brands (l&#x27;oreal, maybelline, etc) but have found that with my skin/eyes being so sensitive now, all those mascaras irritate them to no end.  I have gone almost 2 years without wearing mascara unless I absolutely have to for an occasion: When I do my eyes become really red, itchy and watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking on Amazon for sensitive eyes mascara and this was one of the choices.  It only had one review and I debated whether to spend an unheard of (for me) $18.00 on a mascara that may be just as irritating to my eyes as all the rest have become.  I am happy to say that so far, I like it.  I put on one coat, no clumps, makes my eyelashes look fairly long and they don&#x27;t look spidery or unnatural at all.  Best of all though, it hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes whatsoever.  They always have a red tint to them from the ocular rosacea but this mascara does not exacerbate that like the other mascaras.  BTW, it&#x27;s easy to remove with soap and water.  I don&#x27;t use eye makeup remover but I&#x27;m sure that would work just as well.  One thing about the color:  to me it looks black moreso than a dark chocolate (which I figured would be black/brown).  I don&#x27;t notice any brown tint to it at all.  I normally wear brown mascara as I am a natural strawberry blond with blond eyelashes/eyebrows.  Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t come in brown but does come inblackberry, which I might try next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why this mascara doesn&#x27;t have more reviews unless maybe not many people who shop Amazon have tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post an update in the future if it does start to irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> These mild mascaras never irritate my eyes. This dark brown will effectively emphasize light/blonde lashes for a natural look; it&#x27;s probably not for you if you&#x27;re going for eye drama on a runway or at a photo shoot. It smells scrumptious--whenever I&#x27;m wearing it, my cat comes over and sniffs my eyelashes! I wear a single coat at a time, and the amount of mascara in the tube always outlasts the recommended three months of use for any mascara.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras cause my eyes to get itchy.  This is the only mascara I can wear without any problems. Great product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara. I actually bought it by mistake thinking I was buying the black one with fruit pigments, but this chocolate one (dark brown) is also amazing! It&#x27;s natural and very effective. I have very light, short lashes and this gives a nice boost without the crunchiness. My lashes still feel soft. I have sensitive eyes and this does not bother them at all. I also think that because this has a natural pigment that it has naturally tinted my eyelashes a little dark when I don&#x27;t have it on, which is really nice!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and had given it a 5 star until my November order.  I have ordered numerous times, but the November order didn&#x27;t last a month and it was empty (I apply once a day).  In the past, a tube would last a few months.  I suspect this was a glitch in the filling machine, but couldn&#x27;t find how to contact the vendor and hope that this will alert them.  Have ordered another and it is still not as thick as the earlier ones but much better than the November tube.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this mascara, based on all the positive reviews. I will only wear natural make-up products, and wanted to branch out to a different mascara brand from what I&#x27;d been using. Unfortunately, I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product. After wearing it for approximately five hours, my eyelids started to feel really itchy. I immediately washed the product off, but it was too late. By the time I woke up the next morning, my eyelids were incredibly swollen (picture someone who&#x27;s been crying for 24 hours straight and you&#x27;d get the idea of what I looked like). They remained that way for days. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this before to any mascara--natural or otherwise, which makes me wonder if there&#x27;s a hidden ingredient in this product that isn&#x27;t being disclosed. Either way, I obviously won&#x27;t be wearing this again.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Smells good and looks good.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying, I never used mascara (until now). My eyes have natural dark rings, so adding a dark mascara would only add to the discoloration. I had noticed my eyelashes shrinking so I figured I would now try a mascara to make them look fuller. I tried 100 Percent Pure Dark Chocolate and was immediately pleased with the pleasant- chocolate-smelling scent. I know the products are pure, so I was not afraid to try this mascara. Again, I was pleased that not only I received the fullness in my lashes that I wanted, the mascara does not run until you take it off, so no dark rings!!!  Mascara that does not smear, pleasant scent, great color, does not make your eyes itch, natural ingredients/ no aluminum - what more could you ask for?!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, and smells like chocolate!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect EXCEPT:  for me, it&#x27;s a little too chocolately smelling.  I just don&#x27;t like the smell of chocolate on my face for the entire time I&#x27;m wearing the mascara.  I prefer unscented products or at least products with a scent I don&#x27;t mind having on my skin.  I love to eat chocolate, but this smell is a bit much for eyelashes, in my opinion.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great -- not thick and clumpy, very natural looking and plenty dark for my dark lashes.</li>
            <li> Smells like delicious brownies, but is a little sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great list of ingredients. But it isn&#x27;t very stable on lashes, and in fact doesn&#x27;t make anything to them.</li>
            <li> This mascara is everything I hoped it would be. The texture and the look are just like regular mascara, plus it doesn&#x27;t clump...and it smells like chocolate!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural mascara.  I&#x27;ve never bought natural before but I simply see no reason not to - it works as well and why put junk that close to your eye!!</li>
            <li> I was so upset to find out I was allergic to mascara. I had spent years finding the perfect one to give me thick, long lashes that were dramatic but not spidery (loreal voluminous was the winner). Once I couldn&#x27;t use it I was devastated... my eyes look tiny and tired without mascara. Well this product was a true lifesaver. I love all the natural ingredients (I can pronounce all of them!) And the chocolate smell is delicious. One coat provides a subtle natural look, but I like to really coat it on to get a sexy look. I have tried every expensive mascara... Dior, Chanel, Lancome, etc... and this is just as good, plus cheaper, plus much better for you and the environment. Even if I magically got over my allergy, I would still stick with this. I can&#x27;t wait to try the blueberry version. Amazon needs to start stocking 100% Pure&#x27;s other cosmetics because I don&#x27;t know where else to buy them!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients, it stays on well (i haven&#x27;t tried it in the pool, though), goes on and cleans off easily.  I&#x27;ve tried several mascaras in the past few years, some at double the price, and this one is the best for me.</li>
            <li> This mascara smell like chocolate.  It goes on great.  My eyes don&#x27;t burn at all.  All other mascaras give me burning red eyes.  It lasts all day.  It is not water proof,  but that is OK with me.  It comes off easily with any make up remover.  I use Jojoba or Avocado oil.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara i&#x27;ve ever used and i&#x27;ve tried them all! I have naturally long lashes but they are very pale. This masacara goes on like silk and feels great. Looks beautiful too. And it smells like chocolate! Love it!</li>
            <li> Best mascara hands down. And I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> re. the irritation question: depends on if this question refers to my attitude or actual effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a day&#x27;s wear or after jogging/working out/walking in the rain, i have raccoon eyes--not a bad thing, as i&#x27;m fond of the rocker chick / strung out look--and it&#x27;s sometimes nice to feel sympatica with lindsay lohan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff definitely feels gentler: doesn&#x27;t make me want to scratch/rub my eyes all day like my fave not-good-for-me mascara that stayed put in every weather and situation did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bonus: edible smell and pretty container.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best mascara I have ever used. The consistency is just right, not too runny, not too dry. It spreads evenly and easily. The smell is pleasant, not chemical, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. It doesn&#x27;t run, but is easy to remove. And I really know it doesn&#x27;t run, as it stood the ultimate test: I wore it in a dance performance where I am blindfolded in three different sections with a heavy canvas blindfold, dancing hard and sweating. The show is an hour long. I expected it to be smudged around my eyes but it was all still on my lashes. Needless to say I&#x27;m a fan. Plus it&#x27;s natural and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;- I do have very dry skin so I can&#x27;t say if it would smudge on an oily skin, though.</li>
            <li> I tried to get more, but they don&#x27;t make this anymore.  Changes are not always improvements!</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural.  I love that you can even smell that it&#x27;s all natural.  But I found that I have to put on about 5 layers to get it to look like I actually have mascara on and even then, still don&#x27;t feel like it gives me the volume that I desire.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a little smoother!</li>
            <li> 100%awesome!  My lashes have been craving this.  And it smells like chocolate yumminess!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells divine. Each time I get a fresh tube, I can smell the fabulous smell every time I blink my eyes. I love the natural ingredients. It looks good on. If you are wanting something extremely dramatic, this may not work for you, especially in brown. I have purchased black before and it smells good (like berries I think) and is more noticeable. This mascara is, naturally, not waterproof. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to a funeral. I can tell you it does wash off clothes, pillowcases, etc. if you do end up crying. For the emotionally stable, this is a wonderful, natural product.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  The brown is a dark color that looks natural.  It elongates my lashes, but doesn&#x27;t make them as plush as some other mascaras.  But for the better ingredients, I&#x27;m fine with the trade off.  It is not waterproof, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with it running or transferring to my skin.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this mascara, but this chemically sensitive woman loves  this product. I haven&#x27;t been able to use make-up for months,and when I occasionally forget that I&#x27;m wearing it and rub my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t smudge! I love that I can smell chocolate when I blink.  Because I have read some concerns of spoiling, I am keeping my lovely chocolate mascara in the refrigerator. So far so good!  Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I am using the brown-black mascara and it uses cocoa for part of the color-fun to smell a little bit of cocoa when I go to apply it!</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this new mascara. I saw the bad reviews and took a chance anyway and I am glad I did. When I received this item, it was beautifully packaged. It came in a plastic bag that was well sealed. I unwrapped that, and inside was a pretty cardboard tube that was sort of a peachy-pink color and creme. I opened that and found the pretty silver tube of mascara that was wrapped in a perforated shrink-wrap plastic. The product does smell like cocoa powder, but I love that. My husband loves that too. The wand, for me, makes applying the product easy. I was able to get from the lash line, all the way to the end of my lashes, and smooth out any areas where too much product may have been left behind during the initial application. There is no flaking and no clumping of the lashes. My lashes look natural.</li>
            <li> Been using this mascara about 2 weeks now, every other day. I have really loved it! It goes on smoothly, has a good look (not outrageous- natural), and has very little smudging. Plus, it smells delicious :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dark Chocolate mascara and found the smell to be too sweet, which turned me off from continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> after years of searching for the perfect mascara-- i have tried ALL of them- from maybelline to revlon to dr hauschka to physicians, and well, you get the picture- i have finally found the perfect mascara.  it smells divine, like warm chocolate brownies (seriously) and it has kept that scent for the month or so that i have been using it.  when i first  opened the mascara and used it, i felt it a bit &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, but it never clunked or gunked up once. i was pleasantly surprised!  as it has dried out a bit, i must say this is the perfect mascara for me- i like a natural look, in fact, mascara is all i wear, just to enhance my eyelashes, which are truly almost non-existent without it. this mascara can also be reapplied after an initial application for a more dramatic look. it&#x27;s a true brown, also- just like dark chocolate. it has not irritated my eyes once, and i am prone to eye irritation.  i truly love it and will definitely be re-ordering it once the time comes. it is a bit pricey- but there are a lot more natural mascaras out there that are more expensive, and this brand to me is a brilliant compromise to have a truly natural mascara that performs this well! A+++ product!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite mascara of all time. I will never use anything else. Consistency is great, doesn&#x27;t clump, easy to layer, I buy the brown Dark Chocolate color and it has a very true brown hue which I like because it is a little more natural looking. It even smells of fresh chocolate which in my opinion is a bonus. Don&#x27;t irritate your eyes with store bought mascara, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> First of all, there is barely any in this mascara so no worries about lumping. 2nd of all, chocolate? Okay if you poured a bowl full of fingernail polish into a bowl and stuck a hershey kiss in it, thats what you smell. I hate the smell of chemicals near my eyes. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This smells almost as good as it works, and it works really well.  It is very close to the color of my natural lashes, but fuller and deeper and richer.  It&#x27;s like somebody amped up my eyes naturally, which I love, because when I want a natural look, this makes it supremely easy.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great and because I don&#x27;t use oily lotions under my eyes there is no bleeding/smudging of the mascara. The chocolate smell is a wonderful bonus!</li>
            <li> I like how gentle it went on and the natural look, until the eyes started itching and when rubbed, major smudging....raccoon eyes. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wanted to like the &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; of it for a natural look and healthier product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works well to add length to lashes, lasts well throughout the day, no &#x27;flaking&#x27; whatsoever, and smells delicious</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this. I have been looking for a dark brown mascara because I feel like it is more natural looking on me. The smell is a bit overpowering and does not seem to diminish much throughout the day. But the worst part is that it smudged.</li>
            <li> Absolutely delighted with this &amp;#34;chocolate bar&amp;#34;! The first lash I tried it on was perfect, but the second lash went clumpy. I blamed my eyelash. I stopped using eyeliner now that I have mascara that does the job for both. It fills in the space on my bottom lash - I have such thin lashes. As far as being natural - that&#x27;s why I love it. I was MAKING my own mascara using bentonite clay and charcoal. It flaked off after a few hours and left me with a gray look (I ran out of charcoal!). I think I&#x27;ll be using this for life. The Brown is so perfect for me (auburn colored hair), I don&#x27;t even want to try black. Thank you for this amazing truly natural mascara!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! Great color, great consistency -- GREAT SMELL! I have been very pleased with the mascara, would love the brush to be a bit fuller, but overall - great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s utterly delightful. No smearing, no smudge. Goes on awesome, stays on. Fresh and natural. I have also used the blackberry. Fruity goodness every time you blink. For reals.</li>
            <li> This mascara is worth every penny - it doesn&#x27;t clump, lasts all day, and removes fairly easily. I haven&#x27;t cried yet while wearing it so I can&#x27;t judge on it&#x27;s waterproof abilities but I won&#x27;t buy another chemical mascara again. It gives amazing length and fullness without it looking too thick. You won&#x27;t be sorry, I promise!</li>
            <li> GROSS. Seriously, it smells A LOT.  If you like the waft of chocolate for hours...then buy this product.  It does what it says...in that it is gentle. If you don&#x27;t like your mascara to be extremely smelly of chocolate and feel like it interferes with your perfume...DON&#x27;T BUY and  I could not deal with this make up. Amazon...graciously refunded..</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and keeps ordering it. I think it smells pretty good and I&#x27;d eat it if I didn&#x27;t know better. Luckily, I know better....</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that I really like this product.  I ordered it just to see how bad a natural, organic mascara really could be.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine that I would actually like it, but because I am a label reader and try very hard to purchase as pure products as possible, I decided to give it a try--and voila!  I like it.  Now, don&#x27;t get all excited and think that your lashes are going to look thick and dark and beautiful.  I will just say that it covers the lashes well and makes your lashes show up!  And I have not noticed any flaking, or smearing.  So for all that, I gave it five stars, because what else can a natural gal expect of her mascara?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to phenoxyethanol so I&#x27;m very limited in mascara that I can use. I have several other natural mascaras but in the heat and humidity of a Texas summer that all end up smeared under my eyelashes by the end of the day. I was pleasantly surprised how well this mascara held up. Yes, at the very end of the day there was just a bit under my eyes but much less than the other mascaras I have tried. As for the color, in the tube it looks like a milk chocolate color but once applied to my lashes it looked dark just like my black mascara. In regards to the smell, when you first apply it you can surely smell chocolate and it lingers for a bit but is not unpleasant. After it dries you will hardly smell it anymore unless you are a rapid blinker throughout the day, even then it is only a very faint chocolate smell. I have not experienced any discomfort or irritation in wearing this mascara. It gives a nice natural look that I enjoy for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Really love this! It goes on very nicely, you have to build it up if you want a heavier coverage, but its so smooth and does not clump. It&#x27;s much better to be patient then end up with clumpy lashes. It&#x27;s very soft, if you put just a thin application it looks so natural and feels like you have nothing on. I didn&#x27;t realize it was chocolate brown but I didn&#x27;t mind once I had it on, it was dark. I wore it all day long and no flaking or smudging, no irritating my eyes. I use my eyes strenuously at work and usually can&#x27;t wear any eye makeup but this passed the all day test.</li>
            <li> I must have missed the part where it was described that this mascara SMELLS like chocolate... it nearly drove me to gouge out my eyeballs. Wore once and threw away. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the smell of chocolate,  just not all day long.</li>
            <li> I really wated to love these product but it did not do it for me. From their moisturizing body lotion to their night cream. Anyhoo, this mascara did not work for me. It did not lengthen or give any volume.</li>
            <li> This is the one mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye lids, doesn&#x27;t make my lashes feel stiff or brittle, no tiny flakes that fly into my eyes and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Replaced my usual Maybelline mascara with this and love it so far! It doesn&#x27;t smudge, like I read in another review, and it leaves my lashes nice and long.</li>
            <li> Excited that it was natural- a little too light and burns and it hurts  eyes if it runs! Hope they work on ingredients</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, smells like chocolate. what&#x27;s not to love?? not an evening look but great for the everyday natural look I love.</li>
            <li> Smells of dark chocolate, the color is a nice deep brown, consistency is good and packaging is really nice.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I hoped and smelled good too. :)</li>
            <li> Love it! it smells like chocolate which take a little getting used to. It is a very good mascara. I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a great, natural organic mascara for a while, and I have to say this mascara is awesome!  It&#x27;s super easy to apply a light layer for a natural look, which is usually the look I&#x27;m going for.  Plus, it smells delicious!!</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best natural mascara I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a few.  It smells wonderful, coats nicely, and lasts well.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> excellent doesnt bother my eyes. I went over a year without finding anything (tried a new one every month and yes i tried natural health store brands as well) I dont even know how this doesnt bother me but it didnt the trick! Kinda pricy but there arent any options Im hooked with what my eyes allow</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I have used many mascara over the years, and this is awesome, smells delicious, and I can remove it easily at night! Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> I had completely given up on any mascara when I decided to give it one more try.  Now I am happy and hooked.  My eyes and skin are super sensitive and I have diagnosed allergies to several common ingredients in most natural products as well.  I can wear this mascara all day and yes, I have even slept in it.  It gives a natural looking thickness and color to your lashes and it does indeed smell great.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!! Finally found a mascara that does not leave me with bloodshot eyes. It lengthens like no ones business and is thick without clumping. Best of all, it smells like chocolate for an hour after you put it on. Yummy! I adore this company and this is my favorite product by them.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  I will tell you when I first started using it, it didn&#x27;t look like I was getting anything on my lashes.  But the more I used it, the better it got.  For my lashes, I need to apply 3 coats.  I let it dry a few minutes between each layer, and it works really well!</li>
            <li> I am hooked - finally a great mascara that does not clump and goes on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t have to say anything else - I am so happy I found this stuff!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  I also use the black.  The black has a little more bleeding than I&#x27;ve experienced with the brown.  Smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li> This mascara is just the right shade for me since I have dark brown hair with some light brown highlights.  The texture is good and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  I love that the product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  The wand is cool too!</li>
            <li> If the smell could be eliminated, this would get a better review from me. As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like chocolate but a fake chocolate impostor. I would know - good quality dark chocolate is part of my daily diet! It gets three stars for having excellent non-toxic ingredients but sadly, I will be going back to a toxin-filled brand that works much better. This does not add much volume, which I need, and is pretty watery so I always end up getting a good bit on my lids while applying. Smudges easily.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It goes on thick.  I can&#x27;t use mascara that has black iron oxide because I get a sore on my temple that never seems to heal.  I looked around and even brown mascaras contain the black iron oxide.  I tried making my own with activated charcoal, but gave up after numerous experiments that left me with raccoon eyes.  I quit wearing mascara for a long time because of it.  I was very happy when I found this company.  I have tried the Dark Chocolate as well as the Blueberry.  Both go on thick and easily and stay on pretty much all day.  It&#x27;s not as thick as a Maybelline product, but you&#x27;re not getting all the nasty chemicals.  It&#x27;s pricey, but to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this all natural mascara! Won&#x27;t use anything else from now on!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara that I have ever used. I am a fair redhead, with pale eyelashes and sensitive, allergy-prone eyes. Most mascara makes my eyes burn and/or looks artificial on my light eyelashes. This goes on smooth and covers very well. I can apply several layers neatly, and it never hurts my eyes. Plus, it smells like chocolate! This is now my go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why more people aren&#x27;t loving the dark chocolate. I have dark lashes and do not always like the black mascara look- this one is my absolute favorite. It goes on great, no clumps, gives length and fullness, and lasts all day without smudges or leaking everywhere. I will buy again every time.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s so wonderful to enjoy the smell of berries or chocolate in the morning while applying it as opposed to chemicals!  Yes, the chocolate has a wonderful chocolate smell. I&#x27;ve gotten the berry ones as well and they smell wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m into all natural things and this is not only all natural, but it also stays on quite well without flaking or smudging.  It is not waterproof though so it does &#x27;cry&#x27; off.  However, when it does, it&#x27;s easy to wipe away so it&#x27;s still not the mess that other mascaras are.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- I should note that I am a little sensitive to the coffee one. It probably wouldn&#x27;t bother many people, but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive &amp; that particular &#x27;flavor&#x27; did irritate my eyes just a little, not bad, but if you are sensitive to things, I&#x27;d recommend trying one of the other &#x27;flavors&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 100% pure mascaras for a few years. but have never tried the dark brown one. it&#x27;s just as great as the others or better and this color looks most flattering on blondes. I&#x27;ve tried blackberry, blueberry, black. I see some people here say that this mascara is dry, flaky etc. I think they got an old or expired tube. it&#x27;s actually pretty \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and stays this way for months. i&#x27;ve experienced flakes with a black one, when it gets to be 6 months old. but you should replace it by then anyways. best mascara, gives your lashes amazing length and what&#x27;s very important for me, keeps them soft not stiff. it stays on all day without smudging, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of mascara before &amp; absolutely love 100% pure. The dark chocolate one happened to be cheaper the last time I need mascara, so I figured why not. This is the best 100% pure mascara. You can smell the scent of chocolate all day long!</li>
            <li> i am really impressed with this mascara. i rarely wear any makeup, especially eye makeup bc im terribly sensitive to all things (sadly).  it is buildable mascara, in that, when you put on the first application its very fine/light. i dont like to wear heavy makeup, so the light application is perfect for me. it gave my already long lashes color (theyre blonde) and made all the tiny lashes show up. it smells like chocolate, no joke, and neither the smell or general formulation irritated my sensitive eyes. it left lashes feeling silky vs. crispy. i think the soft finish is nice, but make sure you curl your lashes well first, i think since its softer in finish it makes the curl fall a little--nothing a good pre-application curling cant remedy. it does smear if you rub your eyes (im guilty of this bc i rarely wear anything and forget) but it doesnt flake or get into your eyes and irritate them. nice dark brown color. would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This mascara stays on well, is lengthening and smells like chocolate.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I brag about this product to anyone who will listen lol! It smells like chocolate yet works as well as other mascaras. No clumping and it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes brittle or break! Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve lost LESS eyelashes! At age 40, that&#x27;s important. On a tight budget the price was a bit much for me but I now see it lasts twice as long as store bought mascaras but without all the toxins! Worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous mascara from the packaging and ingredients to the smell and longevity of the application.  It is fun to put on as the aroma of it really smells of chocolate!  The coverage is awesome and it wears so well for all day!  I have not had any trouble with it at all.  There is no going back to the store brands, this is worth the price if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Worst allergic reaction I&#x27;ve ever had. Second day, swollen, red itchy eyes. If you&#x27;re very sensitive to eye makeup, beware..</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara! I stumbled upon this and am very glad I went ahead and purchased it. I like this much better than Physicians Formula Organic mascara which causes my eyes to instantly become irritated, red, and puffy. 100% Pure mascara I have no reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Dark Chocolate which actually smells like chocolate cocoa butter which is pretty awesome. Like others have mentioned the mascara is thick/dry but application is still easy enough.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be less cruel of a consumer,  so I searched to find vegan mascara on Amazon, and one of the products I  am across was this one.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I absolutely love it.  It smells like sweet chocolate,  it stays on well without fading or smudging,  the color is very natural looking,  and I also use it on my  eyebrows.</li>
