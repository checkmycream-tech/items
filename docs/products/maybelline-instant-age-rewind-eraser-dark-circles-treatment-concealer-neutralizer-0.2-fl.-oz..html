            <li>This is the best undereye concealor I have ever found and I have used many over the years.</li>
            <li>We had to get a hammer and hit it perfectly where the top is screwed on</li>
            <li>A bit bright</li>
            <li>Really good good concealer</li>
            <li>It is part of the Good Housekeeping tested and recommended products.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product</li>
            <li>Is really good covering.</li>
            <li>i loved it.</li>
            <li>it acts as a good concealer too...</li>
            <li>good product...</li>
            <li>This is a good, inexpensive product.  </li>
            <li>and I am good to go for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>but It does not help the product be good if you can not access it.</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>This is a Great Quality Highlighter and very easy to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; with.</li>
            <li>Great, easy to use, inexpensive product!</li>
            <li>Again, it does the job wonderfully, illuminating the eyes and making them look fresh and &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Most days though, this works great by itself.</li>
            <li>This is really a  nice product and the color is perfect, very durable cover great</li>
            <li>nice item and good seller nice to work with them</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and the vendor got it to me very fast.</li>
            <li>LOVE It!,</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that this concealer already doubles as an antiaging undereye cream!</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I will continue to buy it for life!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite undereye concealer!</li>
            <li>Bought the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; shade &amp; love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, great coverage.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>nevertheless it is an amazing concealer</li>
            <li>But amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>Me and my sister use it and its just amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked it but couldn&#x27;t remember which shade i had purchased.</li>
            <li>Sponge applicator is not the best, just use a beauty blender to really blend it.</li>
            <li>No need to cake it on since the color is effective at covering, for my needs.</li>
            <li>The applicator is nice but You can make something like it to blend in the stick kind.</li>
            <li>I use this for a highlighter more than a concealer, but it does the job fairly well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter liked it.</li>
            <li>I heard so many good things about this.</li>
            <li>She is fair skinned and the darkness is more prominent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price, although the coverage is a bit light.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best drugstore concealer I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s the best solution I have found.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;eraser&#x27; plus mineral powder is a much more natural look, and the best makeup combination I&#x27;ve found in decades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good for its price , i just think its not that clean as you roll it on your face all the time without being able to wash it .</li>
            <li>The neutral color looks darker in the bottle, but ends up very light.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be for very light complexion people.  </li>
            <li>This concealer was easy to apply and I really liked the lightweight feel.  </li>
            <li>Although it felt ok on the spots and a touch got in my eye with no pain or burning.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t believe you will find anything better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But, once I did, I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>This neutralizer does an okay job</li>
            <li>I would repurchase but it&#x27;s not my favorite drugstore concealer.</li>
            <li>or if it&#x27;s more the color combination works better for my shin tone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many people tell me that it was my EYES that gave away my age, not my skin or body.</li>
            <li>For the most part I&#x27;ve found NYX to be a great line at a reasonable price...</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t need a lot) and makes me feel better about my appearance.</li>
            <li>Now I appreciate it even more.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I try to make the best of anything, so I tried Maybelline for spot correction.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Would buy more.</li>
            <li>I have to say that Maybelline has soooo changed from the stuff I used to buy from them so many years ago.</li>
            <li>love this product for undereye circles.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>love how these blot on under the eye.  </li>
            <li>I generally love Maybelline products</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This does not make them more noticeable, as some concealers do when they settle into the lines, making it even worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying more and more Maybelline products as they seem to be of higher quality than they were years ago and yet still a good price.</li>
            <li>I have a light olive complexion, so if you have light skin this one will probably be perfect for you, but I need to start over with a new order for Medium now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed and feel better about myself &amp; my darn circles than I have in a long time, like they&#x27;re almost not there.  </li>
            <li>Love it goes smoothly on your under eye area and its easy to blend it!</li>
            <li>This is not expensive and looks really good.</li>
            <li>Great coverage despite going on very shear and smooth; with no creping&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
            <li>Of course, I don&#x27;t think there is any concealer that makes them honestly 100% disappear, but my god this stuff gets pretty close!  </li>
            <li>I used a lot of drugstore counselors and i&#x27;ve never used a better concealer that this, easy to apply easy to blend.</li>
            <li>The applicator is a cute puffball that feels comfortable to apply.</li>
            <li>Great concealer but the container needs to be fixed.  </li>
            <li>but too light just looks goofy.</li>
            <li>I checked out the product for the first time and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>the soft cotton tip is great.  </li>
            <li>Very upset, I read a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to be the full size as it&#x27;s just not!</li>
            <li>and it is really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The sponge-tip applicator makes it easy to apply, but I&#x27;ve been storing the bottle upright</li>
            <li>Blends well, application is easy, and</li>
            <li>okay nothing special though.  </li>
            <li>in fact, I&#x27;m ordering some right now! :)</li>
            <li>Very nice product, not heavy on the skin, minimise crow&#x27;s fit.</li>
            <li>AND i finally look awake and have a healthy glow thanks to this awesome product!</li>
            <li>It goes on flawlessly to a blended perfection and its bye bye dark circles.</li>
            <li>I bought these for My wife and she loves this concealer, she say which coverage dark circles perfectly</li>
            <li>It is the best cover up product for dark spots and blemishes that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>, it blends well, but not so creamy it settles in fine lines or causes my eye makeup to migrate throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>no circles, softened fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have my hopes up too much, but I have to say I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Every morning, I enjoy \\&quot;erasing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Unfortunally the neutral color Is too light for my brunette skin tone.</li>
            <li>Just brush it on lightly-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s buildable, a light formula, and blends well.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and creamy and covers well.</li>
            <li>Overall great</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>and then I use the light 20 over it.</li>
            <li>Great for aging skin especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I use both the neutralizer and light color.</li>
            <li>I got the neutralizer shade which was weirdly a good match for my natural skin tone (light beige, warm/yellow undertones)...</li>
            <li>a modest price, this is a good item to experiment with.</li>
            <li>: BE SURE to get the right shade.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the right color for your skin tone....</li>
            <li>concealer I received in the original stock &#x27;light&#x27; shade and is a bit too light for me</li>
            <li>Give it a shot, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>so worth it anyway!</li>
            <li>If you apply the neutralizer first, and then the concealer on top, it does help lessen the appearance.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium skin that tans pretty easily, so I chose the Neutralizer &amp; Medium shades.  </li>
            <li>Most people couldn&#x27;t even see anything unless they were really close to me.</li>
            <li>not the best I&#x27;ve used, didn&#x27;t like the sponge and color lighter than expected but overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but I always like to have different ones and this one is good.</li>
            <li>For supermarket prices, they have created many products that rival the really pricey stuff I&#x27;ve picked up in department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not know if the product is good or not, because I simply can not use it.</li>
            <li>The amount of product is good enough for the size of the bottle and the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad concealer but</li>
            <li>But for the price not bad.</li>
            <li>Now, in truth, the circles under my eyes are not normally terribly bad.</li>
            <li>However, I too am fair skinned and it worked under my eyes, but my eye circles are faint.&lt;br /&gt;For dark circles it doesn&#x27;t do the job it claims, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>and I used it along other parts of my face to brighten/conceal too, works great.  </li>
            <li>I still use it some days and think it might look better if I had more yellow in my skin</li>
            <li>shipped quickly and recieved in time.  </li>
            <li>And i love the applicator puff ball for putting it on because its nice and gentle and doesnt pull the skin (which would cause/increase wrinkles over time) and using regular concealer under my eyes has to be rubbed on which pulls the skin</li>
            <li>its just great for the dark circle.</li>
            <li>If you ever used a concealer stick, you&#x27;ll really love this new product.</li>
            <li>It is the most effective dark circle concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have dark eye circles (always have) and this product is the best so far at concealing them.  </li>
            <li>Applies easily and brightens your whole appearance.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely repurchase!!</li>
            <li>It is not a bad concealer, and it did not do as good of a job at concealing as some of the other brands might.  </li>
            <li>Use gentle dabs and use a light, circular motion to blend.  </li>
            <li>If I were to repurchase I would get the color medium because I don&#x27;t really like too light of an undereye.</li>
            <li>I saw this in the store and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>What it did do was cover the age spots on my hands, so it was worth buying just for that reason.</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>Would give it 5 stars as love that much; but boy does it run out fast.</li>
            <li>Love the sponge for achieving a natural looking finish.  </li>
            <li>useful and affordable.</li>
            <li>I found L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s True Match Crayon to be every bit as good as those and cost much less.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not quite the right color for me.</li>
            <li>It is light but offers a medium to full coverage.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, I like the container and the way the product comes out by twisting the red part.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I am lucky to have great skin in my late 30s with just some spotty redness.</li>
            <li>i usually use a damp sponge and pat it while blending and it works great</li>
            <li>This product is really good hiding dark circles around the eyes, fits well under makeup.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light, but attracts my regular foundation to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 66 years old with lots of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews are right.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands, from cheap to expensive, and this product is the best.  </li>
            <li>just MAYBE I was selling the inexpensive brands short (I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Maybelline&#x27;s 24Hour color lipstick line!)</li>
            <li>but it was pretty close...</li>
            <li>I got this color since it seemed the most neutral one and universal color.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be more yellow than it is.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying much more.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy 2 shades for total coverage. :)</li>
            <li>I had used the Medium with the results I raved about, above, and when I placed this order for more, all I could find was neutral.</li>
            <li>And I would have to throw out the container with most of the make up still left.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several under eye concealers, but most of them crease or look too pasty.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its meant for.</li>
            <li>I really did see an improvement!</li>
            <li>The twisting somehow wears out by the time you reach bottom of the applicator, and there&#x27;s always a portion left in the inside cylinder that you can&#x27;t use, as it discontinues to rise to the top.</li>
            <li>I have to un-twist the entire top off in order to get to the product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost finished with my first tube of this...in Neutralizer...and am ordering another.&lt;br /&gt;Pay</li>
            <li>I let it sit for about 1 minute...go back and pat it again (just to make sure it&#x27;s settled</li>
            <li>It goes on very quickly and is great when you are tired and in a hurry!  </li>
            <li>the bags - it&#x27;s a very noticeable difference right away.</li>
            <li>The sponge seems to apply it better to mask the problem area, rather than most liquid type concealers that tend to kind of settle in to the pimple and actually end up making it look worse.</li>
            <li>Seems to last a long time, doesn&#x27;t cake up, goes on really smooth and blends so nicely to any skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have very light skin and use a combination of the pale, light (concealers) and the highlighter/brightener and corrector.</li>
            <li>Lastly, as a CONTOURING shade, because it&#x27;s a bit lighter than the foundation and makes the areas where I apply it &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; (between the eyebrows towards the forehead, the bridge of the nose)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works just great for me (if it helps, I&#x27;ll mention that I have a medium skin with pink undertones and wear &amp;#34;sandy beige&amp;#34; in foundation.</li>
            <li>so the overall results is elimination of dark circles and age spots and the areas I have used it on blend with the rest of my face beautifully.  </li>
            <li>its just perfect to hide away under eye dark circles,, though i don&#x27;t have any dark circles</li>
            <li>But, my takeaway is that my high priced brand is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this product because of the positive reviews it had.</li>
            <li>This dark circle remover is amazing.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak for really darker circles.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the first things I apply after moisturizing.</li>
            <li>To effectively cover dark circles, you need their color opposites, yellows, peaches and oranges.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also great at covering red or dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I also have a couple of age spots (I&#x27;m in my 60s), one is rather large.</li>
            <li>it does not look cakey or does not settle in the fine lines if you applyit properly</li>
            <li>It also looked white and flakey and settled into my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, even though it has a nice mechanism and it does cover a little..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any woman my age (or less, or more, or whatever!)</li>
            <li>but okay under foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutralizer has a nice shade of yellow to it which (being opposite on the color wheel from my blue-purple dark circles) is quite effective, compared to other concealers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use alot of high end products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>thanks, kids.</li>
            <li>It is a bit yellow, but still a light colored concealer.</li>
            <li>and it still looks like too much.</li>
            <li>and it works really well..</li>
            <li>The brightener with its pink tones help to blend the neutralizer to look more like my skin tone.</li>
            <li>if you battle with circles, I would highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>I find that I use the pink brightener one more often by itself, so if I repurchase, I might just get that one instead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also for reducing the appearance of light wrinkles, so I use it on several areas of my face before applying a mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it would matter so much, but it does.</li>
            <li>It really works as promised.</li>
            <li>and once it dries theres no way to really rub it arround to fade the creases, since that just rubs all the concealer out.</li>
            <li>I used Dove soap to gently wipe it off but</li>
            <li>I appreciated that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>A cheap concealer sticks works the same.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>or I eat foods with too much salt.</li>
            <li>This neutralizer concealer and the foundation i wear go very well and blend together</li>
            <li>really helps control how much you put on.  </li>
            <li>as much as I think it should.  </li>
            <li>thanks 👌</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot more money for products</li>
            <li>It does tend to settle into fine lines later in the day, but not terribly so like other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would cover some of the irritation, but WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I have dark circles every single day of my life and this product is great at covering them.  </li>
            <li>This is the first concealer that I&#x27;ve put on, then looked in the mirror and went \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>I have tried other concealers that do a&lt;br /&gt;much better job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not delicate, and it doesn&#x27;t even really cover anything that much.</li>
            <li>I am a 63 year old woman and have been using this product (or the &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34;) for 4 years.  </li>
            <li>ON TOP of the foundation to cover the dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t live up to it, not too much.</li>
            <li>This covers decently.  </li>
            <li>the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because when I went to go back and purchase more</li>
            <li>all were decent but nothing earthshattering.</li>
            <li>and they are usually very hard to conceal unless I use a good product)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>i recommend it to everyone over high end ones and trust me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but within 10 minutes of applying, sparingly I might add, the skin started to burn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly pigmented however does not cake in the slightest bit.</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser does a pretty good job on my dark circles - which I have had since my teen years.</li>
            <li>This is ok for very dark circles..</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle-worker and doesn&#x27;t completely obliterate those pesky dark circles, but it improves them much more than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soooo many undereye concealers for dark circles, and this is one of the first that actually covers them!  </li>
            <li>Great for lightening up the delicate area near the inner corners of the eye.</li>
            <li>The sponge tip is good and bad; easy to use but the product gets everywhere.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend on its own as a sole concealer, and the neutralizer for light skinned people with moderate dark eye circles.</li>
            <li>To be sure that I wasn&#x27;t exaggerating, I applied a coat of my usual concealer, by Shiseido, under my left eye after applying this to my right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you have lighter dark circles, the Maybelline Eraser is fine alone.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li>I put the neutralizer on first, then put the brightener on the outer sides of my eyes leaving the yellowish color alone in the inner corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently, I stumbled upon the NYX line of concealers - quite unexpectedly - after receiving a mascara sample of all things (I don&#x27;t even remember WHERE I got the sample)!</li>
            <li>Is easy to get a lot of a little.</li>
            <li>Package arrived early, and new.  </li>
            <li>Loved how well it hid under eye baggage, dark circles, and harsh lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more subtle than the heavy sticks, yet a light application that really does the job.</li>
            <li>My skin can be a bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The eraser makes me look a lot better at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it blends very well with my foundation and my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t completely make them go away</li>
            <li>It looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>they arent horribly dark but dark enough that i need a good concealer to hide them.</li>
            <li>I have medium light skin and my dark circles can go from barely there to raccoon eyes depending on how I sleep.</li>
            <li>The four and five stars I see here beginning to wonder if they were paid for their reviews or that they dont have severe issues with true dark circles.</li>
            <li>It does not cover her dark circles, it softens them but the coverage isn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li>I was hoping, especially with all of the positive reviews here, that this would save me major bucks.  </li>
            <li>No one in her right mind could possibly wear this without an entire coat of foundation to blend it into.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer actually did seem to cover the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also have the foundation and really love all the products of Instant Age Rewind - I am in my mid 30&#x27;s very few wrinkles, but too many blemishes and pale skin with darkish under eye circles...</li>
            <li>Without concealer it looks like I have a serious black eye, and at best it looks like I&#x27;m super tired, even when I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li>Be careful with the color because it is a little darker than expected, but overall, a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>Looked similar in the image ( and it is VERY early in the morning, so my brain isn&#x27;t working!)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin, as no other makeup product has ever made me had any reactions.</li>
            <li>So I layer the \\&quot;Neutralizer\\&quot; shade first, which does wonders itself, let it dry for a sec then dab a little of the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; shade on top.  </li>
            <li>This is my secret I use personally and professionally - YELLOW NEUTRALIZER to erase ANYTHING and tone down RED in the skin as to give a flawless finish - albeit natural and not cakey.  </li>
            <li>I ALWAYS have dark circles under my eyes no matter how much sleep i get, so this product was the PERFECT solution ive been desperately searching for!</li>
            <li>The color is not natural, it&#x27;s not anything, really.</li>
            <li>I had a bad reaction to a facial scrub &amp; my whole face lost the top layer of skin!!</li>
            <li>It looked too dull and made blemishes more obvious</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t go on gooey thick like a lot of make up does.</li>
            <li>I liked a lot less over the last few years.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised if it requires several clicks to start off.  </li>
            <li>Shiseido has a yellow hue and it blended seamlessly into my skin and with the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying wide range of make up for us to choose</li>
            <li>I wonder if any of the other reviewers truly have dark/purple circles under their eyes, because this certainly was no miracle.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this on the site - and it was less expensive than in any store.</li>
            <li>Do not believe the positive reviews when it comes to dark circles.</li>
            <li>First, its tone is white to pink, colors that will only amplify the reds, blues and purples in your skin.  </li>
            <li>It certainly brightens under the eyes, but it does not hide the dark pigment well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much darker on one side, but dark on both.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles though.</li>
            <li>I really like Maybelline&#x27;s age rewind dark circle eraser.</li>
            <li>I have really dark circles and nothing really covers them.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to settle into the tiny under-eye circle lines I have as much as any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It really does cover my dark circles without making me look like I have a white eye patch.</li>
            <li>I tend to get really dark circles under my eyes, especially when I don&#x27;t sleep very well the night before.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do much about the mild puffiness but at least it&#x27;s much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything other products don&#x27;t do, and I don&#x27;t see where it covers anything, especially not dark circles.</li>
            <li>Slight complaint about the application roller ball thingy on top.</li>
            <li>Not only does it prime my eyes for eye makeup, but it has actually made my eyelids less wrinkled and much smoother.  </li>

            <li> It is part of the Good Housekeeping tested and recommended products.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product</li>
            <li> Is really good covering.</li>
            <li> i loved it.</li>
            <li> it acts as a good concealer too...</li>
            <li> good product...</li>
            <li> This is a good, inexpensive product.  </li>
            <li> and I am good to go for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> but It does not help the product be good if you can not access it.</li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Quality Highlighter and very easy to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; with.</li>

            <li> LOVE It!,</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that this concealer already doubles as an antiaging undereye cream!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I will continue to buy it for life!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite undereye concealer!</li>
            <li> Bought the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; shade &amp; love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, great coverage.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> nevertheless it is an amazing concealer</li>
            <li> But amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> Me and my sister use it and its just amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked it but couldn&#x27;t remember which shade i had purchased.</li>
            <li> Sponge applicator is not the best, just use a beauty blender to really blend it.</li>
            <li> No need to cake it on since the color is effective at covering, for my needs.</li>
            <li> The applicator is nice but You can make something like it to blend in the stick kind.</li>
            <li> I use this for a highlighter more than a concealer, but it does the job fairly well.  </li>
            <li> My daughter liked it.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good things about this.</li>
            <li> She is fair skinned and the darkness is more prominent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, although the coverage is a bit light.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best drugstore concealer I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s the best solution I have found.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;eraser&#x27; plus mineral powder is a much more natural look, and the best makeup combination I&#x27;ve found in decades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> good for its price , i just think its not that clean as you roll it on your face all the time without being able to wash it .</li>
            <li> The neutral color looks darker in the bottle, but ends up very light.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be for very light complexion people.  </li>
            <li> This concealer was easy to apply and I really liked the lightweight feel.  </li>
            <li> Although it felt ok on the spots and a touch got in my eye with no pain or burning.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t believe you will find anything better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But, once I did, I just love this product.  </li>
            <li> This neutralizer does an okay job</li>
            <li> I would repurchase but it&#x27;s not my favorite drugstore concealer.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s more the color combination works better for my shin tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many people tell me that it was my EYES that gave away my age, not my skin or body.</li>
            <li> For the most part I&#x27;ve found NYX to be a great line at a reasonable price...</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t need a lot) and makes me feel better about my appearance.</li>
            <li> Now I appreciate it even more.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I try to make the best of anything, so I tried Maybelline for spot correction.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Would buy more.</li>
            <li> I have to say that Maybelline has soooo changed from the stuff I used to buy from them so many years ago.</li>
            <li> love this product for undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> love how these blot on under the eye.  </li>
            <li> I generally love Maybelline products</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This does not make them more noticeable, as some concealers do when they settle into the lines, making it even worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying more and more Maybelline products as they seem to be of higher quality than they were years ago and yet still a good price.</li>
            <li> I have a light olive complexion, so if you have light skin this one will probably be perfect for you, but I need to start over with a new order for Medium now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed and feel better about myself &amp; my darn circles than I have in a long time, like they&#x27;re almost not there.  </li>
            <li> Love it goes smoothly on your under eye area and its easy to blend it!</li>
            <li> This is not expensive and looks really good.</li>
            <li> Great coverage despite going on very shear and smooth; with no creping&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
            <li> Of course, I don&#x27;t think there is any concealer that makes them honestly 100% disappear, but my god this stuff gets pretty close!  </li>
            <li> I used a lot of drugstore counselors and i&#x27;ve never used a better concealer that this, easy to apply easy to blend.</li>
            <li> The applicator is a cute puffball that feels comfortable to apply.</li>
            <li> Great concealer but the container needs to be fixed.  </li>
            <li> but too light just looks goofy.</li>
            <li> I checked out the product for the first time and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> the soft cotton tip is great.  </li>
            <li> Very upset, I read a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to be the full size as it&#x27;s just not!</li>
            <li> and it is really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The sponge-tip applicator makes it easy to apply, but I&#x27;ve been storing the bottle upright</li>
            <li> Blends well, application is easy, and</li>
            <li> okay nothing special though.  </li>
            <li> in fact, I&#x27;m ordering some right now! :)</li>
            <li> Very nice product, not heavy on the skin, minimise crow&#x27;s fit.</li>
            <li> AND i finally look awake and have a healthy glow thanks to this awesome product!</li>
            <li> It goes on flawlessly to a blended perfection and its bye bye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I bought these for My wife and she loves this concealer, she say which coverage dark circles perfectly</li>
            <li> It is the best cover up product for dark spots and blemishes that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> , it blends well, but not so creamy it settles in fine lines or causes my eye makeup to migrate throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> no circles, softened fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have my hopes up too much, but I have to say I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Every morning, I enjoy \\&quot;erasing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Unfortunally the neutral color Is too light for my brunette skin tone.</li>
            <li> Just brush it on lightly-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s buildable, a light formula, and blends well.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and creamy and covers well.</li>
            <li> Overall great</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> and then I use the light 20 over it.</li>
            <li> Great for aging skin especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I use both the neutralizer and light color.</li>
            <li> I got the neutralizer shade which was weirdly a good match for my natural skin tone (light beige, warm/yellow undertones)...</li>
            <li> a modest price, this is a good item to experiment with.</li>
            <li> : BE SURE to get the right shade.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the right color for your skin tone....</li>
            <li> concealer I received in the original stock &#x27;light&#x27; shade and is a bit too light for me</li>
            <li> Give it a shot, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so worth it anyway!</li>
            <li> If you apply the neutralizer first, and then the concealer on top, it does help lessen the appearance.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin that tans pretty easily, so I chose the Neutralizer &amp; Medium shades.  </li>
            <li> Most people couldn&#x27;t even see anything unless they were really close to me.</li>
            <li> not the best I&#x27;ve used, didn&#x27;t like the sponge and color lighter than expected but overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> but I always like to have different ones and this one is good.</li>
            <li> For supermarket prices, they have created many products that rival the really pricey stuff I&#x27;ve picked up in department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not know if the product is good or not, because I simply can not use it.</li>
            <li> The amount of product is good enough for the size of the bottle and the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad concealer but</li>
            <li> But for the price not bad.</li>
            <li> Now, in truth, the circles under my eyes are not normally terribly bad.</li>
            <li> However, I too am fair skinned and it worked under my eyes, but my eye circles are faint.&lt;br /&gt;For dark circles it doesn&#x27;t do the job it claims, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> and I used it along other parts of my face to brighten/conceal too, works great.  </li>
            <li> I still use it some days and think it might look better if I had more yellow in my skin</li>
            <li> shipped quickly and recieved in time.  </li>
            <li> And i love the applicator puff ball for putting it on because its nice and gentle and doesnt pull the skin (which would cause/increase wrinkles over time) and using regular concealer under my eyes has to be rubbed on which pulls the skin</li>
            <li> its just great for the dark circle.</li>
            <li> If you ever used a concealer stick, you&#x27;ll really love this new product.</li>
            <li> It is the most effective dark circle concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have dark eye circles (always have) and this product is the best so far at concealing them.  </li>
            <li> Applies easily and brightens your whole appearance.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely repurchase!!</li>
            <li> It is not a bad concealer, and it did not do as good of a job at concealing as some of the other brands might.  </li>
            <li> Use gentle dabs and use a light, circular motion to blend.  </li>
            <li> If I were to repurchase I would get the color medium because I don&#x27;t really like too light of an undereye.</li>
            <li> I saw this in the store and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> What it did do was cover the age spots on my hands, so it was worth buying just for that reason.</li>
            <li> Smile.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars as love that much; but boy does it run out fast.</li>
            <li> Love the sponge for achieving a natural looking finish.  </li>
            <li> useful and affordable.</li>
            <li> I found L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s True Match Crayon to be every bit as good as those and cost much less.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not quite the right color for me.</li>
            <li> It is light but offers a medium to full coverage.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, I like the container and the way the product comes out by twisting the red part.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have great skin in my late 30s with just some spotty redness.</li>
            <li> i usually use a damp sponge and pat it while blending and it works great</li>
            <li> This product is really good hiding dark circles around the eyes, fits well under makeup.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light, but attracts my regular foundation to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 66 years old with lots of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews are right.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands, from cheap to expensive, and this product is the best.  </li>
            <li> just MAYBE I was selling the inexpensive brands short (I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Maybelline&#x27;s 24Hour color lipstick line!)</li>
            <li> but it was pretty close...</li>
            <li> I got this color since it seemed the most neutral one and universal color.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be more yellow than it is.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be buying much more.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy 2 shades for total coverage. :)</li>
            <li> I had used the Medium with the results I raved about, above, and when I placed this order for more, all I could find was neutral.</li>
            <li> And I would have to throw out the container with most of the make up still left.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several under eye concealers, but most of them crease or look too pasty.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its meant for.</li>
            <li> I really did see an improvement!</li>
            <li> The twisting somehow wears out by the time you reach bottom of the applicator, and there&#x27;s always a portion left in the inside cylinder that you can&#x27;t use, as it discontinues to rise to the top.</li>
            <li> I have to un-twist the entire top off in order to get to the product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished with my first tube of this...in Neutralizer...and am ordering another.&lt;br /&gt;Pay</li>
            <li> I let it sit for about 1 minute...go back and pat it again (just to make sure it&#x27;s settled</li>
            <li> It goes on very quickly and is great when you are tired and in a hurry!  </li>
            <li> the bags - it&#x27;s a very noticeable difference right away.</li>
            <li> The sponge seems to apply it better to mask the problem area, rather than most liquid type concealers that tend to kind of settle in to the pimple and actually end up making it look worse.</li>
            <li> Seems to last a long time, doesn&#x27;t cake up, goes on really smooth and blends so nicely to any skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have very light skin and use a combination of the pale, light (concealers) and the highlighter/brightener and corrector.</li>
            <li> Lastly, as a CONTOURING shade, because it&#x27;s a bit lighter than the foundation and makes the areas where I apply it &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; (between the eyebrows towards the forehead, the bridge of the nose)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works just great for me (if it helps, I&#x27;ll mention that I have a medium skin with pink undertones and wear &amp;#34;sandy beige&amp;#34; in foundation.</li>
            <li> so the overall results is elimination of dark circles and age spots and the areas I have used it on blend with the rest of my face beautifully.  </li>
            <li> its just perfect to hide away under eye dark circles,, though i don&#x27;t have any dark circles</li>
            <li> But, my takeaway is that my high priced brand is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this product because of the positive reviews it had.</li>
            <li> This dark circle remover is amazing.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak for really darker circles.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the first things I apply after moisturizing.</li>
            <li> To effectively cover dark circles, you need their color opposites, yellows, peaches and oranges.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also great at covering red or dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I also have a couple of age spots (I&#x27;m in my 60s), one is rather large.</li>
            <li> it does not look cakey or does not settle in the fine lines if you applyit properly</li>
            <li> It also looked white and flakey and settled into my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, even though it has a nice mechanism and it does cover a little..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any woman my age (or less, or more, or whatever!)</li>
            <li> but okay under foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutralizer has a nice shade of yellow to it which (being opposite on the color wheel from my blue-purple dark circles) is quite effective, compared to other concealers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i use alot of high end products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> thanks, kids.</li>
            <li> It is a bit yellow, but still a light colored concealer.</li>
            <li> and it still looks like too much.</li>
            <li> and it works really well..</li>
            <li> The brightener with its pink tones help to blend the neutralizer to look more like my skin tone.</li>
            <li> if you battle with circles, I would highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> I find that I use the pink brightener one more often by itself, so if I repurchase, I might just get that one instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also for reducing the appearance of light wrinkles, so I use it on several areas of my face before applying a mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it would matter so much, but it does.</li>
            <li> It really works as promised.</li>
            <li> and once it dries theres no way to really rub it arround to fade the creases, since that just rubs all the concealer out.</li>
            <li> I used Dove soap to gently wipe it off but</li>
            <li> I appreciated that.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> A cheap concealer sticks works the same.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> or I eat foods with too much salt.</li>
            <li> This neutralizer concealer and the foundation i wear go very well and blend together</li>
            <li> really helps control how much you put on.  </li>
            <li> as much as I think it should.  </li>
            <li> thanks 👌</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot more money for products</li>
            <li> It does tend to settle into fine lines later in the day, but not terribly so like other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would cover some of the irritation, but WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles every single day of my life and this product is great at covering them.  </li>
            <li> This is the first concealer that I&#x27;ve put on, then looked in the mirror and went \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> I have tried other concealers that do a&lt;br /&gt;much better job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not delicate, and it doesn&#x27;t even really cover anything that much.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old woman and have been using this product (or the &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34;) for 4 years.  </li>
            <li> ON TOP of the foundation to cover the dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t live up to it, not too much.</li>
            <li> This covers decently.  </li>
            <li> the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because when I went to go back and purchase more</li>
            <li> all were decent but nothing earthshattering.</li>
            <li> and they are usually very hard to conceal unless I use a good product)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> i recommend it to everyone over high end ones and trust me</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but within 10 minutes of applying, sparingly I might add, the skin started to burn.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s highly pigmented however does not cake in the slightest bit.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser does a pretty good job on my dark circles - which I have had since my teen years.</li>
            <li> This is ok for very dark circles..</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle-worker and doesn&#x27;t completely obliterate those pesky dark circles, but it improves them much more than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooo many undereye concealers for dark circles, and this is one of the first that actually covers them!  </li>
            <li> Great for lightening up the delicate area near the inner corners of the eye.</li>
            <li> The sponge tip is good and bad; easy to use but the product gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend on its own as a sole concealer, and the neutralizer for light skinned people with moderate dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> To be sure that I wasn&#x27;t exaggerating, I applied a coat of my usual concealer, by Shiseido, under my left eye after applying this to my right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you have lighter dark circles, the Maybelline Eraser is fine alone.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li> I put the neutralizer on first, then put the brightener on the outer sides of my eyes leaving the yellowish color alone in the inner corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, I stumbled upon the NYX line of concealers - quite unexpectedly - after receiving a mascara sample of all things (I don&#x27;t even remember WHERE I got the sample)!</li>
            <li> Is easy to get a lot of a little.</li>
            <li> Package arrived early, and new.  </li>
            <li> Loved how well it hid under eye baggage, dark circles, and harsh lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much more subtle than the heavy sticks, yet a light application that really does the job.</li>
            <li> My skin can be a bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The eraser makes me look a lot better at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it blends very well with my foundation and my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t completely make them go away</li>
            <li> It looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> they arent horribly dark but dark enough that i need a good concealer to hide them.</li>
            <li> I have medium light skin and my dark circles can go from barely there to raccoon eyes depending on how I sleep.</li>
            <li> The four and five stars I see here beginning to wonder if they were paid for their reviews or that they dont have severe issues with true dark circles.</li>
            <li> It does not cover her dark circles, it softens them but the coverage isn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li> I was hoping, especially with all of the positive reviews here, that this would save me major bucks.  </li>
            <li> No one in her right mind could possibly wear this without an entire coat of foundation to blend it into.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer actually did seem to cover the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also have the foundation and really love all the products of Instant Age Rewind - I am in my mid 30&#x27;s very few wrinkles, but too many blemishes and pale skin with darkish under eye circles...</li>
            <li> Without concealer it looks like I have a serious black eye, and at best it looks like I&#x27;m super tired, even when I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the color because it is a little darker than expected, but overall, a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li> Looked similar in the image ( and it is VERY early in the morning, so my brain isn&#x27;t working!)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin, as no other makeup product has ever made me had any reactions.</li>
            <li> So I layer the \\&quot;Neutralizer\\&quot; shade first, which does wonders itself, let it dry for a sec then dab a little of the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; shade on top.  </li>
            <li> This is my secret I use personally and professionally - YELLOW NEUTRALIZER to erase ANYTHING and tone down RED in the skin as to give a flawless finish - albeit natural and not cakey.  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS have dark circles under my eyes no matter how much sleep i get, so this product was the PERFECT solution ive been desperately searching for!</li>
            <li> The color is not natural, it&#x27;s not anything, really.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to a facial scrub &amp; my whole face lost the top layer of skin!!</li>
            <li> It looked too dull and made blemishes more obvious</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t go on gooey thick like a lot of make up does.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot less over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised if it requires several clicks to start off.  </li>
            <li> Shiseido has a yellow hue and it blended seamlessly into my skin and with the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying wide range of make up for us to choose</li>
            <li> I wonder if any of the other reviewers truly have dark/purple circles under their eyes, because this certainly was no miracle.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this on the site - and it was less expensive than in any store.</li>
            <li> Do not believe the positive reviews when it comes to dark circles.</li>
            <li> First, its tone is white to pink, colors that will only amplify the reds, blues and purples in your skin.  </li>
            <li> It certainly brightens under the eyes, but it does not hide the dark pigment well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much darker on one side, but dark on both.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles though.</li>
            <li> I really like Maybelline&#x27;s age rewind dark circle eraser.</li>
            <li> I have really dark circles and nothing really covers them.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to settle into the tiny under-eye circle lines I have as much as any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It really does cover my dark circles without making me look like I have a white eye patch.</li>
            <li> I tend to get really dark circles under my eyes, especially when I don&#x27;t sleep very well the night before.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do much about the mild puffiness but at least it&#x27;s much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything other products don&#x27;t do, and I don&#x27;t see where it covers anything, especially not dark circles.</li>
            <li> Slight complaint about the application roller ball thingy on top.</li>
            <li> Not only does it prime my eyes for eye makeup, but it has actually made my eyelids less wrinkled and much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff compared to my old Mary Kay (sorry!) concealer.</li>
            <li> It does not completely eliminate the dark circles, but it does a decent job of minimizing without being too white/bright.</li>
            <li> It was much lighter than expected, but it works to cover my dark under eyes and some reason it has helped for them get lighter...</li>
            <li> This did not completely cover my extreme dark circles, but it came pretty close.</li>
            <li> It works so much like a CC cream, if not better.</li>
            <li> but if i don&#x27;t &amp;#34;build&amp;#34; it up it doesnt completely neutralize my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can consider it a concealer at all; it has a brightening effect, but can&#x27;t cover up very well.</li>
            <li> I have Sicilian heritage, so I have dark hair, brown eyes, and natural darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is applied with a soft sponge applicator a little smaller than a cherry.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely going to be sticking with this cover up for a long time!</li>
            <li> the click-up mechanism does not last very long before failing to work anymore.</li>
            <li> Most brands were too thin and watered down to actually lift the dark circle color.</li>
            <li> This does a great job as a base underneath my other makeup to cover up the darkness and blends well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lightens my dark circles...which are not very dark</li>
            <li> I found that using the brightener alone on my very dark circles didn&#x27;t really hide them it just dulled the dark to a grayish color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the neutralizer was too light for me, but otherwise, It&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the price was low enough its not worth my time to bother with returning it</li>
            <li> I use it when I do my make up, but the difference is minimal, I believe it does the same as makeup...</li>
            <li> it arrived a lot earlier than expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several people have had this complaint, &amp; Maybelline should really look into this problem, as it&#x27;s repetitive &amp; kind of renders the product useless once it breaks.</li>
            <li> dissapointing because its a good product but the container is crap.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for ppl with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Chronic dark circles are definitely a nemesis.  </li>
            <li> Say its an \\&quot;Instant Age Rewind\\&quot; and also labeled \\&quot;Eraser of dark</li>
            <li> I usually go back over it with another product for the under eye dark</li>
            <li> The combo makes the extra dark circles disappear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried that actually covers up my dark circles some.</li>
            <li> no need to rub down hard, or too much product will come out.</li>
            <li> not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad?</li>
            <li> GREEN usually negates &#x27;red&#x27; but in the art of makeup, unless you want to look like you&#x27;re ready for the mortician, DON&#x27;T use a green concealer - under florescent lighting one</li>
            <li> My dark areas are relatively dark, maybe I should try a different color?</li>
            <li> My only complaint, &amp; I read others with the same problem..</li>
            <li> For everyday wear, it&#x27;s a total makeup mistake.  </li>
            <li> So, this was a total waste of $.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had mine about 2 weeks, &amp; do not use them everyday, &amp; the neutralizer does not click up anymore,</li>
            <li> I finally tried it out and after a few seconds of application my skin started burning.</li>
            <li> However, when I&#x27;m exhausted from work, or have been up all night reading, this is the thing that seems to give my eyes a brightened look without adding a clownish white line over the already unattractive coloring that developed</li>
            <li> (I prefer using a combo because the Covergirl concealer can look a little dry and grey under my eyelids if I apply too much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But with this product, I don&#x27;t need any other concealer or brightener.</li>
            <li> When my other concealer was discontinued by the manufacturer I purchased both Department store brands and Ulta brands to try to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try one of the other products in the line.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake up, like other products, and it brightens my face.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is meant to treat dark circles but after about a month of using it daily, I noticed that my dark circles are lightening a bit even when I am not wearing any make up...</li>
            <li> This helps hide the dark circles under eyes</li>
            <li> Maybe you must use all of the Maybelline Dark Circle eraser products in conjunction?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark, purply circles since I turned 20 and now after turning 30 &amp; having a baby</li>
            <li> Maybelline suggests for severe dark circles, use both.  </li>
            <li> Dark circles under eyes, a must.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem was insufficient dark circle coverage.  </li>
            <li> the neutralizer version of the Maybelline Dark Circles product works wonders.  </li>
            <li> This works for me to lighten dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because if you apply this and foundation over it, it might help conceal dark circles and blemishes.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but my bags are dark</li>
            <li> I gave this eraser five stars, but not because it covered my under-eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> (thinking anything designed for covering up tatoos might cover up dark circles!)Bobbi Brown and BeneFit...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry if this is TMI... if you&#x27;ve ever suffered with dark circles then you know we are always searching for the holy grail.</li>
            <li> I have cancer and have dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> It works for me -- for dark age/sun spots and dark under-eye &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; bags and to lighten the&lt;br /&gt;area below my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I have not turned 30 yet and the dark circles under my eyes have decided to move in and stay.</li>
            <li> of course too dark and it defeats the purpose</li>
            <li> doesnt help with dark circles.</li>
            <li> If you apply a bunch of the liquid you might shade the dark circle and get a somewhat refresh look</li>
            <li> Anyone with evidence of severe dark circles this product WILL NOT cover them.</li>
            <li> you ever get dark circles under your eyes, I recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but nothing out there really is yet that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen-age daughter who has dark circles under her eyes.</li>
            <li> but this one is not one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does cover up some of the dark circles, but the color does not cover</li>
            <li> Immediate and visible reduction of dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> somehow it just blends, not too dark, not too light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing that has worked for my very dark circles!!</li>
            <li> It covers my dark circles &amp;#34;okay;&amp;#34; I find that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; when I also use the pink brightener version of this together, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s truly the product&#x27;s fault in coverage</li>
            <li> My lines are significantly less in just a 2-month period.</li>
            <li> but it makes them much less noticeable</li>
            <li> The Neutralizer shade is not for heavy duty dark circles.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the ingredient is that does this, but just be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an obsession with my dark undereye circles for years!</li>
            <li> Does look a little cakey in the daylight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life (and I&#x27;m now at the mid-century checkpoint!)</li>
            <li> If you have chronic dark circles and have tried everything, this product WORKS!  </li>
            <li> I put a little powder to set</li>
            <li> Maybe I am missing something, but after three uses it wouldn&#x27;t apply anymore.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a green concealer then going over it with this concealer.</li>
            <li> Helps the staying power by applying and leaving for a few minutes before blending into the foundation with the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday even if I don&#x27;t put on eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> a concealer UNDER the foundation, covering the red spots and broken capillaries</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than those concealers that come in a greasy or stiff stick.  </li>
            <li> So I would apply small amounts with a make up sponge that seemed to help a little.</li>
            <li> Sorry, my previous review of this  was meant for a different item!!!!</li>
            <li> a least if you don&#x27;t have to dark circles , in  my case</li>
            <li> Sometimes when my dark circles are worse than other days, I use this combined with Nars Creamy Radiant Concealer.</li>
            <li> I am a very patient person when I apply makeup, taking lots of time to blend and feather, and this was impossible to work in.  </li>
            <li> I used the neutralizer  and the brightener and could tell very little difference in the appearance of the darkness in my eye area.</li>
            <li> It was red &amp; blistered and Unfortunately life doesn&#x27;t stop for these things.</li>
            <li> I think it is an inherited thing, but not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the lazy type hen</li>
            <li> Second, the texture is so unnatural that it stands out and looks downright creepy in daylight.  </li>
            <li> Next, sad to say, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient caused this, but the product is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> and I have very pale skin.</li>
            <li> Took me a minute or two to figure out the need to twist the brownish red section on the container to get the product to move into the sponge because the arrows are very small and faint.  </li>
            <li> Pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> While by no means does it completely eliminate them, but since mine are hereditary, that is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> hopefully I just had a bad container but each time the sponge would fall off or the twist action would break!  </li>
            <li> Moreover, the concealer settles into creases and fine lines, looks terrible.  </li>
            <li> Color is always so hard to tell in the plastic containers.  </li>
            <li> not in the mass-market \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; line-up of common brands (CG, MabNY, Revlon, LOreal, etc.)</li>
            <li> Wait until it is fixed before you are frustrated with this one.</li>
            <li> and it containes a very small amount of product!&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was that container itself is a hassle, having to turn it everytime.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.  </li>
            <li> how tired I look.  </li>
            <li> Not a great  product.</li>
            <li> Too thin &amp; watery.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this.  </li>
            <li> This one is a fail though, for me at least...</li>
            <li> This concealer has done very little for my dark circles (and their not event that bad!)</li>
            <li> I use this under the medium concelealer &amp; my ugly dark circles go away.</li>
            <li> I did not have any stinging or weird side affects.  </li>
            <li> im obsessed ive been buying and using this for like 4 years now</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> but not in the expensive &amp; over-priced premium brands either.  </li>
            <li> The difference was startling.  </li>
            <li> Claims on here that it makes lines vanish are completely erroneous.  </li>
            <li> But like under the eyes, its weird tint and texture rendered it useless for even that.  </li>
            <li> Looks like when you put on the wrong color makeup.  </li>
            <li> When you spin, the product does not flow for the sponge so is impossible use it.</li>
            <li> but if you get it to close to your eyes it burns really bad.</li>
            <li> In their face/makeup line they have an assortment of base color \\&quot;tints\\</li>
            <li> Powder base or airbrush or liquid and continue your regime whatever that may be.  </li>
            <li> but I hated to spend the money and not like it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst concealer I ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really good good concealer but if you get it to close to your eyes it burns really bad. So I would apply small amounts with a make up sponge that seemed to help a little.</li>
            <li> I used the neutralizer  and the brightener and could tell very little difference in the appearance of the darkness in my eye area. Although it felt ok on the spots and a touch got in my eye with no pain or burning. My dark areas are relatively dark, maybe I should try a different color?</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get any to come out. Will nor buy again.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product.  It is inexpensive  as a cosmetic product but it works.  It is part of the Good Housekeeping tested and recommended products.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It does work well enough for me, but I only gave it three stars because of the applicator. Maybe I am missing something, but after three uses it wouldn&#x27;t apply anymore. You can&#x27;t squeeze the bottle bc it&#x27;s glass. So I basically wasted a whole bottle because I couldn&#x27;t get it out. Does anyone have a suggestion?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an obsession with my dark undereye circles for years! I&#x27;m almost 40, several kids, don&#x27;t get nearly enough sleep. I have tried everything under the sun (that I can afford anyway) and nothing has worked for my undereye area. I saw this in the store and thought it was worth a try. I didn&#x27;t have my hopes up too much, but I have to say I LOVE it! It isn&#x27;t a miracle-worker and doesn&#x27;t completely obliterate those pesky dark circles, but it improves them much more than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot - flesh-colored and yellow-based liquid and cream concealers, mineral powder concealers in flesh or yellow tones, brighteners and various combinations of all of the above. But with this product, I don&#x27;t need any other concealer or brightener. Every morning, I enjoy \\&quot;erasing\\&quot; the bags - it&#x27;s a very noticeable difference right away. For the price, I don&#x27;t believe you will find anything better. It does tend to settle into fine lines later in the day, but not terribly so like other products I have used. I also run the eraser along between my brows and along the lines that go from the bottom of my nose to the corners of my mouth and it helps hide those as well. I will definitely be sticking with this product - in fact, I&#x27;m ordering some right now! :)</li>
            <li> LOVE It!, it world great for me.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to a facial scrub &amp; my whole face lost the top layer of skin!! It was red &amp; blistered and Unfortunately life doesn&#x27;t stop for these things. I bought this hoping it would cover some of the irritation, but WOW!!! It had THE best coverage of any concealer I&#x27;ve ever tried! Yes, it wasn&#x27;t perfect (my skin&#x27;s fault) but it was pretty close... Most people couldn&#x27;t even see anything unless they were really close to me. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand, ever!!</li>
            <li> This helps hide the dark circles under eyes</li>
            <li> This is a great under-eye concealer!  It goes on very quickly and is great when you are tired and in a hurry!  It definitely helps with puffiness too.  I took away a star because by lunch time, I can definitely use a reapplication,</li>
            <li> This concealer was easy to apply and I really liked the lightweight feel.  I did not have any stinging or weird side affects.  I got this color since it seemed the most neutral one and universal color.  Color is always so hard to tell in the plastic containers.  Obviously, I&#x27;m not expecting this make up to drastically change under eye circles, but it did brighten my eyes and I used it along other parts of my face to brighten/conceal too, works great.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, not heavy on the skin, minimise crow&#x27;s fit. Unfortunally the neutral color Is too light for my brunette skin tone.</li>
            <li> I like the design and it is really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS have dark circles under my eyes no matter how much sleep i get, so this product was the PERFECT solution ive been desperately searching for! And i love the applicator puff ball for putting it on because its nice and gentle and doesnt pull the skin (which would cause/increase wrinkles over time) and using regular concealer under my eyes has to be rubbed on which pulls the skin and i can avoid aging myself now! AND i finally look awake and have a healthy glow thanks to this awesome product!</li>
            <li> does not donwhat it says</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing im obsessed ive been buying and using this for like 4 years now and the neutrilizer definetely brightens up undereyes and gives you an awake look very beautiful it does not look cakey or does not settle in the fine lines if you applyit properly i usually use a damp sponge and pat it while blending and it works great i recommend it to everyone over high end ones and trust me i use alot of high end products!</li>
            <li> I wonder if any of the other reviewers truly have dark/purple circles under their eyes, because this certainly was no miracle. It certainly brightens under the eyes, but it does not hide the dark pigment well. Maybe you must use all of the Maybelline Dark Circle eraser products in conjunction? Not my HG eye concealer; the search persists.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a green concealer then going over it with this concealer. This concealer has done very little for my dark circles (and their not event that bad!)</li>
            <li> this is the best. This is not expensive and looks really good.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim.  My skin can be a bit sensitive.  This burned when I put it on under my eyes.  It also looked white and flakey and settled into my fine lines.  This did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooo many undereye concealers for dark circles, and this is one of the first that actually covers them!  I&#x27;ve had dark, purply circles since I turned 20 and now after turning 30 &amp; having a baby, I get people telling me all the time how tired I look.  I&#x27;m so self-conscious of them &amp; cringe when I hear that.  This is the first concealer that I&#x27;ve put on, then looked in the mirror and went \\&quot;Wow! My circles are almost gone!\\&quot;  Of course, I don&#x27;t think there is any concealer that makes them honestly 100% disappear, but my god this stuff gets pretty close!  And doesn&#x27;t cost a ton!  I have light to medium skin that tans pretty easily, so I chose the Neutralizer &amp; Medium shades.  Maybelline suggests for severe dark circles, use both.  So I layer the \\&quot;Neutralizer\\&quot; shade first, which does wonders itself, let it dry for a sec then dab a little of the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; shade on top.  Seems to last a long time, doesn&#x27;t cake up, goes on really smooth and blends so nicely to any skin tone.  I&#x27;m so impressed and feel better about myself &amp; my darn circles than I have in a long time, like they&#x27;re almost not there.  Give it a shot, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> good for its price , i just think its not that clean as you roll it on your face all the time without being able to wash it .</li>
            <li> Not bad concealer but not what everyone made it seems like, it does crease a bit and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for ppl with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Quality Highlighter and very easy to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; with. this tends to make my mornings go a lot faster.</li>
            <li> This covers decently.  It&#x27;s very convenient to use.  Don&#x27;t be surprised if it requires several clicks to start off.  Use gentle dabs and use a light, circular motion to blend.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to settle into the tiny under-eye circle lines I have as much as any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use it when I do my make up, but the difference is minimal, I believe it does the same as makeup...so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, even though it has a nice mechanism and it does cover a little..</li>
            <li> Dark circles under eyes, a must.</li>
            <li> not a deep coverage concealear.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser does a pretty good job on my dark circles - which I have had since my teen years. I think it is an inherited thing, but not sure. The eraser makes me look a lot better at least in my opinion. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t go on gooey thick like a lot of make up does. It does not irritate or itch in any way. I think it is a good product and I will probably purchase it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> When my other concealer was discontinued by the manufacturer I purchased both Department store brands and Ulta brands to try to replace it.  My biggest problem was insufficient dark circle coverage.  Most brands were too thin and watered down to actually lift the dark circle color. Voila the neutralizer version of the Maybelline Dark Circles product works wonders.  It goes on very light, but attracts my regular foundation to it so the overall results is elimination of dark circles and age spots and the areas I have used it on blend with the rest of my face beautifully.  Took me a minute or two to figure out the need to twist the brownish red section on the container to get the product to move into the sponge because the arrows are very small and faint.  But, once I did, I just love this product.  I keep one in reserve just in case they stop selling it.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of drugstore counselors and i&#x27;ve never used a better concealer that this, easy to apply easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Is really good covering.I will recommend this product to everyone. I really like it. That is why I give this product all the stars.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye concealer I have ever used. The coverage is very good. It really does cover my dark circles without making me look like I have a white eye patch. Simply put, it blends very well with my foundation and my skin tone. It works so much like a CC cream, if not better. Furthermore, the effect is lasting, I think. I am not sure if this is meant to treat dark circles but after about a month of using it daily, I noticed that my dark circles are lightening a bit even when I am not wearing any make up...It&#x27;s either this or I&#x27;m getting enough amount of sleep now. LOL. But I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> nice item and good seller nice to work with them</li>
            <li> A daily necessity now that I have this product. I have been using it for months and it is truly a miracle. I have very light skin and use a combination of the pale, light (concealers) and the highlighter/brightener and corrector. I also have the foundation and really love all the products of Instant Age Rewind - I am in my mid 30&#x27;s very few wrinkles, but too many blemishes and pale skin with darkish under eye circles...thanks, kids.</li>
            <li> I have dark eye circles (always have) and this product is the best so far at concealing them.  I dab a bit on with the sponge applicator and then blend a bit with my foundation.  It does not completely eliminate the dark circles, but it does a decent job of minimizing without being too white/bright.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews are right.  This works for me to lighten dark circles under my eyes.  Helps the staying power by applying and leaving for a few minutes before blending into the foundation with the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, I like the container and the way the product comes out by twisting the red part.&lt;br /&gt;On the downside my face feels a bit sticky after applying.</li>
            <li> I had this concealer in another shade but lost it. I liked it but couldn&#x27;t remember which shade i had purchased. This neutralizer does an okay job but if i don&#x27;t &amp;#34;build&amp;#34; it up it doesnt completely neutralize my dark circles. they arent horribly dark but dark enough that i need a good concealer to hide them. I&#x27;ll continue to use it but will likely try to find something else once its all used up.</li>
            <li> Worked for my girlfriend.  Slight complaint about the application roller ball thingy on top.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more yellow than it is. It is a bit yellow, but still a light colored concealer. I use this as a highlight. If I were to repurchase I would get the color medium because I don&#x27;t really like too light of an undereye. The sponge tip is good and bad; easy to use but the product gets everywhere. I would repurchase but it&#x27;s not my favorite drugstore concealer.</li>
            <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
            <li> Not a great  product. It will diminish spots and some blemishes but has a caked on look if not blended it thoroughly. A bit bright and I have very pale skin. I don&#x27;t use the applicator to blend I use a make-up sponge and it still looks like too much.</li>
            <li> Oh, I don&#x27;t know. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this, but maybe that&#x27;s just me. The color is not natural, it&#x27;s not anything, really. It&#x27;s too cakey. It&#x27;s not delicate, and it doesn&#x27;t even really cover anything that much. I gave it 3 stars because if you apply this and foundation over it, it might help conceal dark circles and blemishes. I&#x27;m just saying, the hype... It doesn&#x27;t live up to it, not too much.</li>
            <li> Loved how well it hid under eye baggage, dark circles, and harsh lines.</li>
            <li> Love it goes smoothly on your under eye area and its easy to blend it!</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using this product, I immediatly started getting compliments on how &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; I looked and &amp;#34;did you do something to your hair&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> I had to &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; it like 50 times before the actuall fluid became visible.  But now it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, although the coverage is a bit light.</li>
            <li> not the best I&#x27;ve used, didn&#x27;t like the sponge and color lighter than expected but overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t do anything other products don&#x27;t do, and I don&#x27;t see where it covers anything, especially not dark circles.</li>
            <li> the product is very good i loved it. but the package and the applictor is baaad. Its writen that you have to turn it severl times to make the prodcut come out.. well i did million of times but it didnt at ALL.. i had to break the cover and it containes a very small amount of product!&lt;br /&gt;its dissapointing because its a good product but the container is crap.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with my purchase. it arrived a lot earlier than expected and it works really well.. the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because when I went to go back and purchase more the price had gone up and I was not too happy. the second reason is because the product was a lot smaller than anticipated. nevertheless it is an amazing concealer and I will definitely be buying much more.</li>
            <li> Sponge applicator is not the best, just use a beauty blender to really blend it. Works amazing as a highlight!</li>
            <li> This is ok for very dark circles.. I bought both the neutralizer and the brightener. The neutralizer has a yellowish tone and the brightener has a pinkish tone. I put the neutralizer on first, then put the brightener on the outer sides of my eyes leaving the yellowish color alone in the inner corners of my eyes. The brightener with its pink tones help to blend the neutralizer to look more like my skin tone. I found that using the brightener alone on my very dark circles didn&#x27;t really hide them it just dulled the dark to a grayish color.</li>
            <li> This stuff totally does what it promises. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is bc it&#x27;s not quite the right color for me. I still use it some days and think it might look better if I had more yellow in my skin (I naturally have a lot of pink.) Still a great product and if you battle with circles, I would highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> Does look a little cakey in the daylight</li>
            <li> its just perfect to hide away under eye dark circles,, though i don&#x27;t have any dark circles so i just use it to hide away any acne mark or redness.. it acts as a good concealer too... good product...</li>
            <li> Great concealer! Excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> its just great for the dark circle.</li>
            <li> Really good concealer not the best but I always like to have different ones and this one is good.</li>
            <li> I got this in neutralizer.  I like the consistency, it blends well, but not so creamy it settles in fine lines or causes my eye makeup to migrate throughout the day.  The sponge-tip applicator makes it easy to apply, but I&#x27;ve been storing the bottle upright so it doesn&#x27;t spill.  It covers my dark circles &amp;#34;okay;&amp;#34; I find that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; when I also use the pink brightener version of this together, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s truly the product&#x27;s fault in coverage or if it&#x27;s more the color combination works better for my shin tone.  I find that I use the pink brightener one more often by itself, so if I repurchase, I might just get that one instead.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but my bags are dark so I had to buy 2 shades for total coverage. :)</li>
            <li> I gave this eraser five stars, but not because it covered my under-eye dark circles. It didn&#x27;t. What it did do was cover the age spots on my hands, so it was worth buying just for that reason.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all. Too thin &amp; watery.  But Maybelline is classified as &#x27;affordable&#x27; makeup, so maybe this is what to expect.  I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life (and I&#x27;m now at the mid-century checkpoint!) I&#x27;ve had so many people tell me that it was my EYES that gave away my age, not my skin or body. Chronic dark circles are definitely a nemesis.  I&#x27;ve used MAC, NARS, MU4Evr, KatVonD (thinking anything designed for covering up tatoos might cover up dark circles!)Bobbi Brown and BeneFit... all were decent but nothing earthshattering. I found L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s True Match Crayon to be every bit as good as those and cost much less. For that reason, when I read reviews on this Maybelline product I thought - just MAYBE I was selling the inexpensive brands short (I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Maybelline&#x27;s 24Hour color lipstick line!) But they need to return to the lab for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I stumbled upon the NYX line of concealers - quite unexpectedly - after receiving a mascara sample of all things (I don&#x27;t even remember WHERE I got the sample)! In their face/makeup line they have an assortment of base color \\&quot;tints\\&quot; that do help counteract the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; before applying concealer.  For the most part I&#x27;ve found NYX to be a great line at a reasonable price... not in the mass-market \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; line-up of common brands (CG, MabNY, Revlon, LOreal, etc.) but not in the expensive &amp; over-priced premium brands either.  Love their mascaras the best of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry if this is TMI... if you&#x27;ve ever suffered with dark circles then you know we are always searching for the holy grail.</li>
            <li> I have cancer and have dark under eye circles. This product works well (don&#x27;t need a lot) and makes me feel better about my appearance. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. I highly recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;m trying more and more Maybelline products as they seem to be of higher quality than they were years ago and yet still a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a good, inexpensive product.  It&#x27;s lighter than those concealers that come in a greasy or stiff stick.  It is applied with a soft sponge applicator a little smaller than a cherry.  It works for me -- for dark age/sun spots and dark under-eye &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; bags and to lighten the&lt;br /&gt;area below my eyebrows.  I basically wear no makeup, but this does a lot to lighten/brighten up my &amp;#34;unmade-up&amp;#34; face.</li>
            <li> Good quality product and excellent value.</li>
            <li> This concealer is great for shadowing your face.</li>
            <li> The Neutralizer shade is not for heavy duty dark circles. Not sure if I can consider it a concealer at all; it has a brightening effect, but can&#x27;t cover up very well. I have medium light skin and my dark circles can go from barely there to raccoon eyes depending on how I sleep. For raccoon days, I lighten up my undereyes with this and use Covergirl Simply Ageless Concealer. (I prefer using a combo because the Covergirl concealer can look a little dry and grey under my eyelids if I apply too much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have lighter dark circles, the Maybelline Eraser is fine alone. The applicator is a cute puffball that feels comfortable to apply. Just brush it on lightly- no need to rub down hard, or too much product will come out. Great for lightening up the delicate area near the inner corners of the eye.</li>
            <li> If you ever used a concealer stick, you&#x27;ll really love this new product. It&#x27;s so much more subtle than the heavy sticks, yet a light application that really does the job. I have hereditary hyperpigmentation around my eyes. It&#x27;s much darker on one side, but dark on both. Without concealer it looks like I have a serious black eye, and at best it looks like I&#x27;m super tired, even when I&#x27;m not. I also have a couple of age spots (I&#x27;m in my 60s), one is rather large. This camouflages everything so well without a made-up pancake look, that I swear I look 10 years younger. It&#x27;s also for reducing the appearance of light wrinkles, so I use it on several areas of my face before applying a mineral powder foundation. I used to use concealer sticks and liquid foundation, but never again. This &#x27;eraser&#x27; plus mineral powder is a much more natural look, and the best makeup combination I&#x27;ve found in decades.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: BE SURE to get the right shade. I had used the Medium with the results I raved about, above, and when I placed this order for more, all I could find was neutral. I went ahead and ordered it, and now I find that it&#x27;s just not working for me. I have a light olive complexion, so if you have light skin this one will probably be perfect for you, but I need to start over with a new order for Medium now. I didn&#x27;t realize it would matter so much, but it does.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this.  The neutral color looks darker in the bottle, but ends up very light.  Moreover, the concealer settles into creases and fine lines, looks terrible.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Some reviews of this product are great and some aren&#x27;t.  It is not a bad concealer, and it did not do as good of a job at concealing as some of the other brands might.  But for the price not bad.</li>
            <li> Very happy with both this line of concealer and neutralizer. Tried the neutralizer (packaging looks identical) based on another reviewer&#x27;s recommendation and quite grateful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer I received in the original stock &#x27;light&#x27; shade and is a bit too light for me but okay under foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutralizer has a nice shade of yellow to it which (being opposite on the color wheel from my blue-purple dark circles) is quite effective, compared to other concealers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s buildable, a light formula, and blends well. No need to cake it on since the color is effective at covering, for my needs. The sponge and the way the product comes out is quite efficient for speedy applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got this one alone on Subscribe and Save. Decided I didn&#x27;t need a concealer with it. I&#x27;m of SE Asian descent, to give an idea of skin tone, and this works well for covering scars, etc as well. Great, easy to use, inexpensive product! Longer lasting than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Smile. Uploaded some photos. Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> Works well. I got the neutralizer shade which was weirdly a good match for my natural skin tone (light beige, warm/yellow undertones)... not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad?</li>
            <li> very wonderful fits my skin color, but i need him corrector</li>
            <li> BUENISIMO CORRIGE ILUMINA</li>
            <li> Great concealer but the container needs to be fixed.  I bought this 3 times hopefully I just had a bad container but each time the sponge would fall off or the twist action would break!  And I would have to throw out the container with most of the make up still left.  Wait until it is fixed before you are frustrated with this one.</li>
            <li> Great product! It really works as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the lazy type hen it comes to nightly body and facial regimens and I love the fact that this concealer already doubles as an antiaging undereye cream! The coverage is divine and the anti aging properties, I think, are working. My lines are significantly less in just a 2-month period. I highly recommend this to any woman my age (or less, or more, or whatever!)</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have great skin in my late 30s with just some spotty redness. I use aveeno daily moisturizer and this as my face routine. I do under eyes and lids, and touch up here and there. Is easy to get a lot of a little. I will continue to use this as my forever daily foundation.</li>
            <li> Package arrived early, and new.  I love this product, and I will continue to buy it for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this until I get another concealer. It doesn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles though. Maybe I&#x27;ll try one of the other products in the line. This one is a fail though, for me at least...</li>
            <li> I like it. The problem is, that it creases. A LOT. and once it dries theres no way to really rub it arround to fade the creases, since that just rubs all the concealer out. Pretty annoying. But amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re dressing up for Halloween, this is perfect. Something about it makes human skin look ghoulish. For everyday wear, it&#x27;s a total makeup mistake.  First, its tone is white to pink, colors that will only amplify the reds, blues and purples in your skin.  To effectively cover dark circles, you need their color opposites, yellows, peaches and oranges.  Second, the texture is so unnatural that it stands out and looks downright creepy in daylight.  No one in her right mind could possibly wear this without an entire coat of foundation to blend it into.  I am a very patient person when I apply makeup, taking lots of time to blend and feather, and this was impossible to work in.  It truly looks like costume makeup.  To be sure that I wasn&#x27;t exaggerating, I applied a coat of my usual concealer, by Shiseido, under my left eye after applying this to my right.  The difference was startling.  Shiseido has a yellow hue and it blended seamlessly into my skin and with the rest of my face.  I can wear it without foundation, and it is a great spot corrector.  The Maybelline side of my face looked like a freak show.  Claims on here that it makes lines vanish are completely erroneous.  Next, sad to say, you get what you pay for.  I was hoping, especially with all of the positive reviews here, that this would save me major bucks.  But, my takeaway is that my high priced brand is worth every penny.  Now I appreciate it even more.  Finally, I try to make the best of anything, so I tried Maybelline for spot correction.  But like under the eyes, its weird tint and texture rendered it useless for even that.  So, this was a total waste of $.</li>
            <li> in this product one color does not suit all.. it did not do the trick&lt;br /&gt;the price was low enough its not worth my time to bother with returning it other wise I would</li>
            <li> shipped quickly and recieved in time.  I have not yet tried it so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars as love that much; but boy does it run out fast. This is perfect size for the purse so worth it anyway! Don&#x27;t expect it to be the full size as it&#x27;s just not! Great coverage despite going on very shear and smooth; with no creping&lt;br /&gt;as some products do!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but within 10 minutes of applying, sparingly I might add, the skin started to burn.  I used Dove soap to gently wipe it off but even today my undereyes remain purplish red.  Will NEVER use again.  Not sure what ingredient caused this, but the product is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this on the site - and it was less expensive than in any store. I so wanted to try it but I hated to spend the money and not like it. But I do like it. This is the best undereye concealor I have ever found and I have used many over the years. This product is excellent and the vendor got it to me very fast. I appreciated that.</li>
            <li> I have not turned 30 yet and the dark circles under my eyes have decided to move in and stay. This dark circle remover is amazing. I love it! Make sure you get the right color for your skin tone....of course too dark and it defeats the purpose but too light just looks goofy. Applies easily and brightens your whole appearance. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite undereye concealer! Very light weight and covers perfectly!</li>
            <li> I checked out the product for the first time and I&#x27;m very pleased. This product is really good hiding dark circles around the eyes, fits well under makeup. Now I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles every single day of my life and this product is great at covering them.  Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t completely make them go away but it makes them much less noticeable and it&#x27;s also great at covering red or dark spots.  If you have chronic dark circles and have tried everything, this product WORKS!  I have used it for years!</li>
            <li> I put a little powder to set and I am good to go for the rest of the day. Love it</li>
            <li> I tend to get really dark circles under my eyes, especially when I don&#x27;t sleep very well the night before. I&#x27;ve tried several under eye concealers, but most of them crease or look too pasty. This product gives buildable medium coverage and it doesn&#x27;t crease, even if I don&#x27;t set it with powder. I will definitely repurchase this concealer!</li>
            <li> doesnt help with dark circles. leaves white residue under the eye, could be use for halloween though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff compared to my old Mary Kay (sorry!) concealer. It is smooth and creamy and covers well. Would buy more.</li>
            <li> This is my secret I use personally and professionally - YELLOW NEUTRALIZER to erase ANYTHING and tone down RED in the skin as to give a flawless finish - albeit natural and not cakey.  Buy this stuff it&#x27;s the DEAL people!  YELLOW makes it MELLOW.  Just remember that.  GREEN usually negates &#x27;red&#x27; but in the art of makeup, unless you want to look like you&#x27;re ready for the mortician, DON&#x27;T use a green concealer - under florescent lighting one looks like they&#x27;re at the undertaker already. Not a good look.  SO YELLOW it, blend it well and then apply your foundation, ie:  Powder base or airbrush or liquid and continue your regime whatever that may be.  Hopefully a well balance of eyes, lips and cheeks!</li>
            <li> Sorry, my previous review of this  was meant for a different item!!!! Looked similar in the image ( and it is VERY early in the morning, so my brain isn&#x27;t working!)</li>
            <li> I use this under the medium concelealer &amp; my ugly dark circles go away. It looks completely natural. Can&#x27;t do much about the mild puffiness but at least it&#x27;s much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its meant for. Me and my sister use it and its just amazing.It goes on flawlessly to a blended perfection and its bye bye dark circles. The only bad thing was that container itself is a hassle, having to turn it everytime. I guess from all that turning and winding it just stopped working one day. We had to get a hammer and hit it perfectly where the top is screwed on and it popped off. There was still alot of product left. I think the packaging needs to be changed cause ive read of comments with the same issue with packaging. Overall great</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst concealer I ever tried. Always like Maybelline products from their eyeliner to mascara. They never disappoint with those products. I was shock this concealer didn&#x27;t do what it said. Say its an \\&quot;Instant Age Rewind\\&quot; and also labeled \\&quot;Eraser of dark circles\\&quot; It does NONE of these things. If you apply a bunch of the liquid you might shade the dark circle and get a somewhat refresh look but the circle is still noticable. The four and five stars I see here beginning to wonder if they were paid for their reviews or that they dont have severe issues with true dark circles. I purchase this product because of the positive reviews it had. Anyone with evidence of severe dark circles this product WILL NOT cover them. Do not believe the positive reviews when it comes to dark circles. It doesnt erase them at all.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer actually did seem to cover the dark circles under my eyes. I really did see an improvement! Now, in truth, the circles under my eyes are not normally terribly bad. However, when I&#x27;m exhausted from work, or have been up all night reading, this is the thing that seems to give my eyes a brightened look without adding a clownish white line over the already unattractive coloring that developed overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a modest price, this is a good item to experiment with. I have to say that Maybelline has soooo changed from the stuff I used to buy from them so many years ago. For supermarket prices, they have created many products that rival the really pricey stuff I&#x27;ve picked up in department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever get dark circles under your eyes, I recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Works okay nothing special though.  A cheap concealer sticks works the same.  The applicator is nice but You can make something like it to blend in the stick kind.</li>
            <li> Good product! Thank You!</li>
            <li> I was not over the moon about this product.  It seems to be for very light complexion people.  Looks like when you put on the wrong color makeup.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cake.  Love the sponge for achieving a natural looking finish.  Only problem is the mechanism needs some tweeking.  The twisting somehow wears out by the time you reach bottom of the applicator, and there&#x27;s always a portion left in the inside cylinder that you can&#x27;t use, as it discontinues to rise to the top.</li>
            <li> I use this for a highlighter more than a concealer, but it does the job fairly well.  I usually go back over it with another product for the under eye dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a highlighter, its great. It doesn&#x27;t cake up, like other products, and it brightens my face. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  As someone else said, you have to turn it a lot to get any product out, and it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The applicator makes this product. Great value!</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old woman and have been using this product (or the &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34;) for 4 years.  My face makeup covers any under-eye problems that I have, so I use the product in an entirely different way.  I use it as an eyelid primer.  I have tried many other brands, from cheap to expensive, and this product is the best.  Not only does it prime my eyes for eye makeup, but it has actually made my eyelids less wrinkled and much smoother.  I use it everyday even if I don&#x27;t put on eye makeup.  I have very sensitive skin and eyes and this has never given me any problems.  To me, this is a miracle product!!!  Thank you Maybelline.</li>
            <li> I have Sicilian heritage, so I have dark hair, brown eyes, and natural darkness under my eyes. This does a great job as a base underneath my other makeup to cover up the darkness and blends well. It&#x27;s not perfect, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but nothing out there really is yet that I&#x27;ve found. It also works well to cover up pimples. The sponge seems to apply it better to mask the problem area, rather than most liquid type concealers that tend to kind of settle in to the pimple and actually end up making it look worse.</li>
            <li> It looked too dull and made blemishes more obvious</li>
            <li> I think this is the best drugstore concealer I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s highly pigmented however does not cake in the slightest bit. Unfortunately the neutralizer was too light for me, but otherwise, It&#x27;s alright. This did not completely cover my extreme dark circles, but it came pretty close. I would probably get this again, just in a darker shade, or to use AFTER the neutralizer, or simply just to use as a spot concealer. Definitely recommend on its own as a sole concealer, and the neutralizer for light skinned people with moderate dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> I bought these for My wife and she loves this concealer, she say which coverage dark circles perfectly</li>
            <li> I wholeheartedly give this one five stars because of the versatility of it, and because it totally delivers as promised. Here&#x27;s how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;1.As a concealer UNDER the foundation, covering the red spots and broken capillaries (I have a lot of them, on my cheeks and sides of my nose and they are usually very hard to conceal unless I use a good product)&lt;br /&gt;2. ON TOP of the foundation to cover the dark circles and puffiness. I also have a big puffiness issue, especially on those days when I don&#x27;t have enough sleep or I eat foods with too much salt. Again, it does the job wonderfully, illuminating the eyes and making them look fresh and &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;3. Lastly, as a CONTOURING shade, because it&#x27;s a bit lighter than the foundation and makes the areas where I apply it &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; (between the eyebrows towards the forehead, the bridge of the nose)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works just great for me (if it helps, I&#x27;ll mention that I have a medium skin with pink undertones and wear &amp;#34;sandy beige&amp;#34; in foundation. This neutralizer concealer and the foundation i wear go very well and blend together wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a staple on my make-up counter.</li>
            <li> Bought the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; shade &amp; love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Neutralizer and Medium coverage for my dark(purplish) under eye circles. If you apply the neutralizer first, and then the concealer on top, it does help lessen the appearance. While by no means does it completely eliminate them, but since mine are hereditary, that is almost impossible. So far, it&#x27;s the best solution I have found. My only complaint, &amp; I read others with the same problem..the click-up mechanism does not last very long before failing to work anymore. I&#x27;ve only had mine about 2 weeks, &amp; do not use them everyday, &amp; the neutralizer does not click up anymore, so I can no longer use the sponge applicator. I have to un-twist the entire top off in order to get to the product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several people have had this complaint, &amp; Maybelline should really look into this problem, as it&#x27;s repetitive &amp; kind of renders the product useless once it breaks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen-age daughter who has dark circles under her eyes. She is fair skinned and the darkness is more prominent.  It does not cover her dark circles, it softens them but the coverage isn&#x27;t full. She doesn&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup, so this was not the product for her.  However, I too am fair skinned and it worked under my eyes, but my eye circles are faint.&lt;br /&gt;For dark circles it doesn&#x27;t do the job it claims, there are better products out there. It doesn&#x27;t do what it claims, even for a teenager.</li>
            <li> love this product for undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I use this and then I use the light 20 over it. Only thing that has worked for my very dark circles!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I received it today and I&#x27;ve tried millions of times extract the product from the container but it did not work. I do not know if the product is good or not, because I simply can not use it. When you spin, the product does not flow for the sponge so is impossible use it. Very upset, I read a lot of good reviews but It does not help the product be good if you can not access it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the best concealer that won&#x27;t break the bank. I&#x27;ve found it. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> It was much lighter than expected, but it works to cover my dark under eyes and some reason it has helped for them get lighter...dont know what there is in this product. But it works. I recommend it just blend it in with your powder or foundation and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great coverage.</li>
            <li> One of my holy grail products! Great for aging skin especially around the eyes. Covers well... Sometimes when my dark circles are worse than other days, I use this combined with Nars Creamy Radiant Concealer. The combo makes the extra dark circles disappear. Most days though, this works great by itself. Blends well, application is easy, and great price! Will absolutely repurchase!!</li>
            <li> useful and affordable. Thanks Amazon for carrying wide range of make up for us to choose</li>
            <li> My daughter liked it. I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> love how these blot on under the eye.  the soft cotton tip is great.  really helps control how much you put on.  I use both the neutralizer and light color.</li>
            <li> I really like Maybelline&#x27;s age rewind dark circle eraser. It&#x27;s the only cover up I&#x27;ve tried that actually covers up my dark circles some. I have really dark circles and nothing really covers them. I am definitely going to be sticking with this cover up for a long time!</li>
            <li> I generally love Maybelline products but this one is not one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does cover up some of the dark circles, but the color does not cover&lt;br /&gt;up as much as I think it should.  I have tried other concealers that do a&lt;br /&gt;much better job.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Best product ever</li>
            <li> Did not work on the roller</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is light but offers a medium to full coverage.  I will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
            <li> I bought both the neutral and the brightener. They are great. It is the most effective dark circle concealer I have ever used. No irritation. I will buy again,</li>
            <li> I heard so many good things about this. I finally tried it out and after a few seconds of application my skin started burning. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin, as no other makeup product has ever made me had any reactions. Not sure what the ingredient is that does this, but just be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the color because it is a little darker than expected, but overall, a GREAT product.  It is the best cover up product for dark spots and blemishes that I have ever used.  I have spent a lot more money for products I liked a lot less over the last few years.  I have and will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> This is really a  nice product and the color is perfect, very durable cover great a least if you don&#x27;t have to dark circles , in  my case I don&#x27;t so for me works very good.</li>
            <li> Immediate and visible reduction of dark circles and wrinkles. Works well alone or under my concealer! The amount of product is good enough for the size of the bottle and the price. Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished with my first tube of this...in Neutralizer...and am ordering another.&lt;br /&gt;Pay no attention to the color of it in the tube...somehow it just blends, not too dark, not too light.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 66 years old with lots of fine lines around my eyes. This does not make them more noticeable, as some concealers do when they settle into the lines, making it even worse.&lt;br /&gt;It lightens my dark circles...which are not very dark so I can&#x27;t speak for really darker circles.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the first things I apply after moisturizing. I let it sit for about 1 minute...go back and pat it again (just to make sure it&#x27;s settled properly)...and voila! no circles, softened fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
