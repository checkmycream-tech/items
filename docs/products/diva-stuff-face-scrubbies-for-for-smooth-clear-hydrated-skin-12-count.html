            <li>Ok, this stuff is legit!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>Love these things!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First they smell amazing nothing like store bought products.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li>is some kind of mold.  </li>
            <li>I love these, they smell great and my skin feels smoother and more toned after I use them.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, they smell nice.</li>
            <li>Like after I shower, my armpits still feel waxy, and it kind of bothers me.</li>
            <li>Then I went hunting on my own.  </li>
            <li>and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>there is no redness, just a warm, tingling sensation (but not to the point of a burning sensation).</li>
            <li>I own a skincare spa.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ll probably end up throwing the jar into my camping gear and use it as a handy face cleanser in the woods.</li>
            <li>smells great, seems to clean skin..but has done nothing for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I have skin that dries out very easily</li>
            <li>Very good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love with when product lather up nicely -</li>
            <li>This product is good it lightly dissolves the blackheads on my face.</li>
            <li>I do think the charcoal version of this product is more effective for pimples and cystic acne.</li>
            <li>as that will probably make this product more effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just seriously impressed by it all so far.</li>
            <li>Great little face cloth pieces with wonderful ingredients on them.</li>
            <li>The scrubbies smell wonderful, fell amazing on the skin and actually work.</li>
            <li>I first tried products that my dermatologist recommended, and they weren&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>The bonus is that it smells great and my skin all around feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub, it smells great, and it cleans out your pores very well!</li>
            <li>Great for my large pores</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe for me to use, even on my ultra-sensitive</li>
            <li>I absolutely love their face creams and face scrubbies that are designed for ultra-sensitive skin, like mine.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>I also purchased the charcoal and bamboo scrubbies and like them more.  </li>
            <li>I want to use product that are healthy for my skin and get results</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I also love the acne cream sample they sent along with this and will be buying that as well.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy :)</li>
            <li>So if you have those issues on top of blackheads, stick with charcoal.</li>
            <li>It tingles, a wonderful tingle, and you can just feel it cleaning your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Third it actually works.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t see as many.</li>
            <li>She has been pleased with their products and recommended that I place an order.</li>
            <li>I have always had blackheads on the sides of my nose and have tried many products to dissolve them but never found anything that worked.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It worked ok, maybe I just need to purchase some more</li>
            <li>I love how my face feels after using these...</li>
            <li>I also bought the sea salf face wash which I love too.</li>
            <li>I had sooo many blackheads</li>
            <li>And their customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more from Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li>I simply love these scrubbies.</li>
            <li>After, my pores felt more supple?</li>
            <li>I put them in a baggie in the fridge just to be safe.</li>
            <li>my skin has never felt softer an more supple.  </li>
            <li>I have relied on an esthetician to monthly remove my blackheads and make my skin look better.  </li>
            <li>I believe if I continue to use this product, I will be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>the cost per use is much more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try these out! :)</li>
            <li>I love doing business with a company that believes  in its products.  </li>
            <li>I get nervous every time they send a sample because I know that I am going to love that, too.  </li>
            <li>They have all been phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you have oily skin</li>
            <li>like most products do.  </li>
            <li>but the effects were even more noticeable the day after...</li>
            <li>I am buying more of Divastuff products to start using.</li>
            <li>more supple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was still able to use each piece twice.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t order more though.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more for everyone in the family to use.</li>
            <li>these probably work much better.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love the cinnamon and clove smell.</li>
            <li>Umm love...</li>
            <li>I will buy more soon.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>omg, this stuff really works and it&#x27;s so pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>makes my skin clear and pores shrink, also makes me feel clean and calm, and centered, my favorite product to purchase from diva stuff &lt;3</li>
            <li>if these help clear up his troublesome oily, acne-prone skin, that&#x27;s a win in my book.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s such a good experience to use - love it!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product multiple times, and love it because: it has all natural ingredients, smells wonderfully and does an effective job of cleaning out and visibly shrinking my blackheads</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to use -</li>
            <li>It easily washes off with water no soap needed.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels CLEAN and healthy.</li>
            <li>Also, they smell just like authentic German gingerbread cookies (a really pleasant surprise) :-)</li>
            <li>AND it could easily clog pipes...</li>
            <li>My skin is lot more clear and radiant, it a good feeling for me.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon lemon combination is really strong.</li>
            <li>It was too strong for me</li>
            <li>They are perfect to him to use after a game or a good workout.  </li>
            <li>We noticed a difference after one use, which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Even more importantly this product is worth my money!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s where I get my less than perfect skin from and</li>
            <li>After just two uses, I can see a tremendous difference!</li>
            <li>Really works, so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>I recommend all the wonderful little things she has available for sale.</li>
            <li>but i notice a huge difference in my pores shrinking</li>
            <li>I enjoy the cinnamon smell</li>
            <li>It adds moisture, plus acts as a light mask.</li>
            <li>India&#x27;s Secret Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies are a wonderful addition to my beauty routine, I especially use them for my nose which was covered in blackheads until I started using these wonderful Face</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am sooo happy I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li>My nose is so smooth like a baby I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth after I use this product.</li>
            <li>They work great and one lasts for several uses.</li>
            <li>im buying 4 more like right now.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, when you open the jar the smell is fantastic - it&#x27;s warm and spicy, like built in aromatherapy!  </li>
            <li>The smell is really strong, but i personally think it smells really good.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>I like to leave it on my skin for a minute while I am putting on body lotion, and then it rinses off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>There have been so many products out there with harmful chemicals, and so many mainstream brands that label themselves \\&quot;natural\\&quot; because they have 1 natural ingredient but</li>
            <li>Clean some blackhead but skin will breakout sometimes after use.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These little scrubbies are incredible.</li>
            <li>instead they have a lovely aroma that you want to spend the whole day in.</li>
            <li>Could this be true?</li>
            <li>Nice, natural ingredients as well.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy some more very soon.</li>
            <li>when i got it i first tryed it and my face felt clean and smooth..</li>
            <li>These dissolve away blackheads like magic and leave my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>I will continue use since I love how soft &amp; smooth it makes my face</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product but not the right one for me.</li>
            <li>This it&#x27;s the first product that has helped get them out!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these multiple times, that&#x27;s how much I love them!</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous when I first tried it out that it was going to stain my face and hands, but rest assured it won&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>I did a big switch to a bunch of Kyms Diva Stuff products and I love all of it!</li>
            <li>Then I usually just use it one more time bc most of the goodness is gone by then :)</li>
            <li>I used these scrubbers and saw a difference after my first time using them!</li>
            <li>think if you have large pores - you have large pores... and having oily skin is actually good for old age.</li>
            <li>After wetting the little square scrubbie and lightly scrubbing my nose I let it sit for about a minute for good measure.</li>
            <li>Second it feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to calm my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth your money.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days most of my blackheads were almost gone and within 3 weeks they were completely gone.</li>
            <li>Extremely useful.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that they&#x27;re made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Recently, I decided to try to get rid of the blackheads on my own.  </li>
            <li>i like the smell and use it on my face and body as i can have breakouts in lots of fun areas.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural as well.</li>
            <li>I use these every other day and my skin is looking better and better.  </li>
            <li>But I wash my whole face with them and they make it feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>These face scrubbies are the right solution for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything is contained right on the scrubbie -</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my skin right away.  </li>
            <li>I noticed some of my blackheads diminishing right away</li>
            <li>so, if you&#x27;re a sensitive skin type i&#x27;m not sure these would be the best option for you.</li>
            <li>It really gives my face clean and crisp feeling.</li>
            <li>I was so excited at first, saw quick results, then all of a sudden had a huge breakout</li>
            <li>My pores have become less visible, they give my skin a nice glow, and they are fun to use!  </li>
            <li>So my pores are still large but cleaned ou!</li>
            <li>I have recently found and started using Diva Stuff&#x27;s products, &amp; so far I have loved everything I have ordered and the samples as well.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but they helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel so clean and smooth and definitely help with reducing an acne flare up.</li>
            <li>looks cleaner and pores more smaller.</li>
            <li>Whenever I look in the mirror the first thing I see are my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I love it for the simple fact</li>
            <li>The product it put in a rag type deal that you get wet with warm water.</li>
            <li>Unless those worms are moving around its most likely just the rag.</li>
            <li>I cut the strips into fours, and it still lathers up pretty well.</li>
            <li>just wet it with warm water and massage your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs before, but this one keeps your face a more hydrating feeling.  </li>
            <li>And trust me, I don&#x27;t say that lightly because my face is sensitive.</li>
            <li>After using this the first time, there was a visable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>This scrubbie really helps!</li>
            <li>It actually makes them stick out more visibly on my skin</li>
            <li>Thanks DIVA STUFF!</li>
            <li>When I received my first order, they included a sample of this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been beyond my expectations of a beauty line that FINALLY does what it should and more.......</li>
            <li>it says you can actually use them more than once.</li>
            <li>This will be my second purchase and using it more often, will update this after.</li>
            <li>these really work!</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive but after the first use I can enthusiastically recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This really does get rid of blackheads!  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>:) I was concerned at first because you only receive 12 +/-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend any items from Diva Stuff. :)</li>
            <li>I am able to cut these in half as I use them primarily on my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Slough your whole face, leave on for a minute (it&#x27;ll dry) and rinse off with warm water and sturdy, scrubby wash cloth.</li>
            <li>They are a lot bigger than I expected, smell great</li>
            <li>The pads smell like cinnamon, have a rough and a smooth side, and dispense mixture smoothly when water is added.</li>
            <li>my face felt extremely clean and soft after i used it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If having super clean porres/skin wasn&#x27;t enough-</li>
            <li>I bought these because I have a very oily t-zone and pretty enlarged pores that I was hoping these would help shrink.</li>
            <li>I always had trouble with blackheads on my nose, most people do right?!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and doesnt make my face seem overly dry.</li>
            <li>They make your skin super soft as well.</li>
            <li>and they even came with free samples- a pretty big sized lip balm and a packet of neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage firming cream.</li>
            <li>I just set it on top of the jar after use and let it dry out.</li>
            <li>Certainly smells of cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>the little terry cloth can make for a good scrubber and get most of your pores cleaner but will not get rid of the black head</li>
            <li>I ordered Indias Secret Blackhead Dissolving scrubbies and loved them the very first day I tried them.  </li>
            <li>This scrubbie has become a regular in my skin care routine,  I love that it&#x27;s all natural , and you see results!  </li>
            <li>My only complaint about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>This product has cleared up my complexion so much</li>
            <li>eh...kind of makes my skin itchy and doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads for me.</li>
            <li>I now use them on my whole face once a week</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>Amazed by what the combination of ingredients are doing for my skin on a whole.</li>
            <li>I know that a very &amp;#34; general&amp;#34; statement.</li>
            <li>Biore strips do literally nothing, and no Rx or over the counter acne product has really solved this problem.</li>
            <li>I rarely say &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; after using a skin care product after one use...but both my 19 yr old daughter</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li>but I use very sparingly.</li>
            <li>These Blackhead Dissolving Srubbies have really worked for me and my son .I</li>
            <li>I had/ still have really oily</li>
            <li>my sister and mother all tried it for ONE pimple and ended up with a breakout on the whole area as well.</li>
            <li>then stumbled upon this product just as i was ready to give up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really depends on your skin, whether this will work or not.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the smell of it, but i didn&#x27;t notice it making any sort of difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>blackheads&#x27;...you really need this product.</li>
            <li>So I got these as a sample and WOW!!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very easy to use, no mess, they don&#x27;t dry your skin at all</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, in fact I think it breaks out even more due to this.</li>
            <li>The company is also lovely and sent me a couple different samples of their other products which I am excited to try.</li>
            <li>Although this didn&#x27;t remove my blackheads after using it for several weeks, it does make my face feel and look clean after each use.</li>
            <li>Left face clean</li>
            <li>Gives a deep clean and no blackheads for me.</li>
            <li>I now use many of their products, and never once have I been let down.  </li>
            <li>This stuff definitely made a difference although I agree with what another reviewer said, that you should follow this up with a biore nose strip (or any other kind of nose blackhead strip really)</li>
            <li>the main reason i got this product was beacuse</li>
            <li>But, I really like this product, after a few days you do see your skin looking better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Diva Stuff -</li>
            <li>Then there are a whole bunch of natural products which are ineffective.  </li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and the blackheads are really dissolving.  </li>
            <li>But, so far it really works.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like with a few more uses.</li>
            <li>a whole jar of them actually will take you pretty far.</li>
            <li>Knew I needed to try something new to get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li>It smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin how ever it DOES NOT dissolve black heads no matter how long you leave it on or how hot you get your face</li>
            <li>/&gt;it arrived yesterday (very fast shipping) and i used one pad last night and then put it in a baggie to use today.  </li>
            <li>love this company because they are extremely committed to finding natural solutions for a variety of skin problems such as: cellulite, acne, cystic acne, eczema, blackheads, red skin, dry skin, oily skin and more.  </li>
            <li>my cheeks can be slightly sensitive at times, and i do feel a little warm sensation for a short period after using them.</li>
            <li>Pampering, all natural products at affordable price points!</li>
            <li>This stuff really surprised me!</li>
            <li>As far as actually clearing my blackheads I don&#x27;t really see much improvement though.</li>
            <li>I also use them more than once (not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to)</li>
            <li>Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!.</li>
            <li>Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products are safe</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt this clean after using any other product.</li>
            <li>no mess!  </li>
            <li>the revew were saying how it would clean your nose and get rid of black heads, well i didnt do that to me</li>
            <li>Just like the rest of the products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>just wow.</li>
            <li>I am frequent customer on amazon, but I never leave any reviews.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend this enough to blackhead sufferers!</li>
            <li>I really like these as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have used this Diva product once, last night, and today, my skin looks much clearer.  </li>
            <li>I do like this product but only rated 3 stars because it REALLY dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>My skin is a bit sensitive though so using them twice a day did cause a bit of dryness.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years to clear up my skin .... from the strongest products with harsh chemicals that left my skin dried out to trying to make my own \\&quot;natural\\&quot; concoctions which were just far too messy and time consuming for me.  </li>
            <li>For me I think these irratate my other normal breakouts a bit too much to use often, but I think if you just have blackheads and clogged pores</li>
            <li>The Secret Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies actually worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies are amazing.</li>
            <li>morning i checked on the progress and just ran my nail lightly over the problem area and there were long black streaks.  </li>
            <li>I found the same issues as another reviewer, these seem to really soften up the black heads, but they don&#x27;t really get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>I really like the concept behind this product, each little square is a piece of terry cloth (like wash cloth material) that has a coating of some cinnamon scented product (it smells AMAZING).</li>
            <li>You wet the little washcloth square that&#x27;s covered in the magic potion and give yourself a cinnamon scented facial.</li>
            <li>Her goal is clearly to provide products &amp; service that actually helps the consumer.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve barely budged at all.</li>
            <li>I used only 3x so far and my blackheads are all gone</li>
            <li>There are 12 little square wash rags which I was able to cut in half.</li>
            <li>I do use this all over my face &amp; neck area but try to be very gentle around my nose &amp; double up on my moisturizer afterword and only use this product at night so that my skin doesn&#x27;t look too dry during the day.</li>
            <li>Little adorable things Ms. Diva shop sells to wash off the debris of everyday exposure to the elements.  </li>
            <li>The blackheads around my nose have become much less noticeable and my skin looks much brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>which im sad for cuz after getting pregnant my nose was getting filled with black heads,</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful with what I use.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t an issue at all as each one can be used at least twice or even cut in half or thirds and still provide more than enough cleanser to wash your face and neck thoroughly.</li>
            <li>There are still a few blackheads deeply embedded, but my pores don&#x27;t look so obvious and filled with black or white heads.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff is legit!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I love these things!</li>
            <li> Love these things!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> IT IS AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First they smell amazing nothing like store bought products.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li> is some kind of mold.  </li>
            <li> I love these, they smell great and my skin feels smoother and more toned after I use them.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, they smell nice.</li>
            <li> Like after I shower, my armpits still feel waxy, and it kind of bothers me.</li>
            <li> Then I went hunting on my own.  </li>
            <li> and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li> there is no redness, just a warm, tingling sensation (but not to the point of a burning sensation).</li>
            <li> I own a skincare spa.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ll probably end up throwing the jar into my camping gear and use it as a handy face cleanser in the woods.</li>
            <li> smells great, seems to clean skin..but has done nothing for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have skin that dries out very easily</li>
            <li> Very good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love with when product lather up nicely -</li>
            <li> This product is good it lightly dissolves the blackheads on my face.</li>
            <li> I do think the charcoal version of this product is more effective for pimples and cystic acne.</li>
            <li> as that will probably make this product more effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just seriously impressed by it all so far.</li>
            <li> Great little face cloth pieces with wonderful ingredients on them.</li>
            <li> The scrubbies smell wonderful, fell amazing on the skin and actually work.</li>
            <li> I first tried products that my dermatologist recommended, and they weren&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> The bonus is that it smells great and my skin all around feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it smells great, and it cleans out your pores very well!</li>
            <li> Great for my large pores</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe for me to use, even on my ultra-sensitive</li>
            <li> I absolutely love their face creams and face scrubbies that are designed for ultra-sensitive skin, like mine.  </li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I also purchased the charcoal and bamboo scrubbies and like them more.  </li>
            <li> I want to use product that are healthy for my skin and get results</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I also love the acne cream sample they sent along with this and will be buying that as well.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy :)</li>
            <li> So if you have those issues on top of blackheads, stick with charcoal.</li>
            <li> It tingles, a wonderful tingle, and you can just feel it cleaning your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Third it actually works.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t see as many.</li>
            <li> She has been pleased with their products and recommended that I place an order.</li>
            <li> I have always had blackheads on the sides of my nose and have tried many products to dissolve them but never found anything that worked.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, maybe I just need to purchase some more</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after using these...</li>
            <li> I also bought the sea salf face wash which I love too.</li>
            <li> I had sooo many blackheads</li>
            <li> And their customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try more from Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> I simply love these scrubbies.</li>
            <li> After, my pores felt more supple?</li>
            <li> I put them in a baggie in the fridge just to be safe.</li>
            <li> my skin has never felt softer an more supple.  </li>
            <li> I have relied on an esthetician to monthly remove my blackheads and make my skin look better.  </li>
            <li> I believe if I continue to use this product, I will be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> the cost per use is much more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try these out! :)</li>
            <li> I love doing business with a company that believes  in its products.  </li>
            <li> I get nervous every time they send a sample because I know that I am going to love that, too.  </li>
            <li> They have all been phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you have oily skin</li>
            <li> like most products do.  </li>
            <li> but the effects were even more noticeable the day after...</li>
            <li> I am buying more of Divastuff products to start using.</li>
            <li> more supple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was still able to use each piece twice.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t order more though.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more for everyone in the family to use.</li>
            <li> these probably work much better.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love the cinnamon and clove smell.</li>
            <li> Umm love...</li>
            <li> I will buy more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> omg, this stuff really works and it&#x27;s so pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> makes my skin clear and pores shrink, also makes me feel clean and calm, and centered, my favorite product to purchase from diva stuff &lt;3</li>
            <li> if these help clear up his troublesome oily, acne-prone skin, that&#x27;s a win in my book.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s such a good experience to use - love it!  </li>
            <li> I have used this product multiple times, and love it because: it has all natural ingredients, smells wonderfully and does an effective job of cleaning out and visibly shrinking my blackheads</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to use -</li>
            <li> It easily washes off with water no soap needed.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels CLEAN and healthy.</li>
            <li> Also, they smell just like authentic German gingerbread cookies (a really pleasant surprise) :-)</li>
            <li> AND it could easily clog pipes...</li>
            <li> My skin is lot more clear and radiant, it a good feeling for me.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon lemon combination is really strong.</li>
            <li> It was too strong for me</li>
            <li> They are perfect to him to use after a game or a good workout.  </li>
            <li> We noticed a difference after one use, which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Even more importantly this product is worth my money!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s where I get my less than perfect skin from and</li>
            <li> After just two uses, I can see a tremendous difference!</li>
            <li> Really works, so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I recommend all the wonderful little things she has available for sale.</li>
            <li> but i notice a huge difference in my pores shrinking</li>
            <li> I enjoy the cinnamon smell</li>
            <li> It adds moisture, plus acts as a light mask.</li>
            <li> India&#x27;s Secret Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies are a wonderful addition to my beauty routine, I especially use them for my nose which was covered in blackheads until I started using these wonderful Face</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am sooo happy I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> My nose is so smooth like a baby I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth after I use this product.</li>
            <li> They work great and one lasts for several uses.</li>
            <li> im buying 4 more like right now.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, when you open the jar the smell is fantastic - it&#x27;s warm and spicy, like built in aromatherapy!  </li>
            <li> The smell is really strong, but i personally think it smells really good.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> I like to leave it on my skin for a minute while I am putting on body lotion, and then it rinses off cleanly.  </li>
            <li> There have been so many products out there with harmful chemicals, and so many mainstream brands that label themselves \\&quot;natural\\&quot; because they have 1 natural ingredient but</li>
            <li> Clean some blackhead but skin will breakout sometimes after use.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These little scrubbies are incredible.</li>
            <li> instead they have a lovely aroma that you want to spend the whole day in.</li>
            <li> Could this be true?</li>
            <li> Nice, natural ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy some more very soon.</li>
            <li> when i got it i first tryed it and my face felt clean and smooth..</li>
            <li> These dissolve away blackheads like magic and leave my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I will continue use since I love how soft &amp; smooth it makes my face</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product but not the right one for me.</li>
            <li> This it&#x27;s the first product that has helped get them out!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these multiple times, that&#x27;s how much I love them!</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous when I first tried it out that it was going to stain my face and hands, but rest assured it won&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> I did a big switch to a bunch of Kyms Diva Stuff products and I love all of it!</li>
            <li> Then I usually just use it one more time bc most of the goodness is gone by then :)</li>
            <li> I used these scrubbers and saw a difference after my first time using them!</li>
            <li> think if you have large pores - you have large pores... and having oily skin is actually good for old age.</li>
            <li> After wetting the little square scrubbie and lightly scrubbing my nose I let it sit for about a minute for good measure.</li>
            <li> Second it feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to calm my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth your money.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days most of my blackheads were almost gone and within 3 weeks they were completely gone.</li>
            <li> Extremely useful.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that they&#x27;re made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Recently, I decided to try to get rid of the blackheads on my own.  </li>
            <li> i like the smell and use it on my face and body as i can have breakouts in lots of fun areas.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural as well.</li>
            <li> I use these every other day and my skin is looking better and better.  </li>
            <li> But I wash my whole face with them and they make it feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> These face scrubbies are the right solution for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything is contained right on the scrubbie -</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin right away.  </li>
            <li> I noticed some of my blackheads diminishing right away</li>
            <li> so, if you&#x27;re a sensitive skin type i&#x27;m not sure these would be the best option for you.</li>
            <li> It really gives my face clean and crisp feeling.</li>
            <li> I was so excited at first, saw quick results, then all of a sudden had a huge breakout</li>
            <li> My pores have become less visible, they give my skin a nice glow, and they are fun to use!  </li>
            <li> So my pores are still large but cleaned ou!</li>
            <li> I have recently found and started using Diva Stuff&#x27;s products, &amp; so far I have loved everything I have ordered and the samples as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but they helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> They make your skin feel so clean and smooth and definitely help with reducing an acne flare up.</li>
            <li> looks cleaner and pores more smaller.</li>
            <li> Whenever I look in the mirror the first thing I see are my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love it for the simple fact</li>
            <li> The product it put in a rag type deal that you get wet with warm water.</li>
            <li> Unless those worms are moving around its most likely just the rag.</li>
            <li> I cut the strips into fours, and it still lathers up pretty well.</li>
            <li> just wet it with warm water and massage your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs before, but this one keeps your face a more hydrating feeling.  </li>
            <li> And trust me, I don&#x27;t say that lightly because my face is sensitive.</li>
            <li> After using this the first time, there was a visable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This scrubbie really helps!</li>
            <li> It actually makes them stick out more visibly on my skin</li>
            <li> Thanks DIVA STUFF!</li>
            <li> When I received my first order, they included a sample of this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been beyond my expectations of a beauty line that FINALLY does what it should and more.......</li>
            <li> it says you can actually use them more than once.</li>
            <li> This will be my second purchase and using it more often, will update this after.</li>
            <li> these really work!</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive but after the first use I can enthusiastically recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> This really does get rid of blackheads!  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> :) I was concerned at first because you only receive 12 +/-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend any items from Diva Stuff. :)</li>
            <li> I am able to cut these in half as I use them primarily on my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Slough your whole face, leave on for a minute (it&#x27;ll dry) and rinse off with warm water and sturdy, scrubby wash cloth.</li>
            <li> They are a lot bigger than I expected, smell great</li>
            <li> The pads smell like cinnamon, have a rough and a smooth side, and dispense mixture smoothly when water is added.</li>
            <li> my face felt extremely clean and soft after i used it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If having super clean porres/skin wasn&#x27;t enough-</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have a very oily t-zone and pretty enlarged pores that I was hoping these would help shrink.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble with blackheads on my nose, most people do right?!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and doesnt make my face seem overly dry.</li>
            <li> They make your skin super soft as well.</li>
            <li> and they even came with free samples- a pretty big sized lip balm and a packet of neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage firming cream.</li>
            <li> I just set it on top of the jar after use and let it dry out.</li>
            <li> Certainly smells of cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> the little terry cloth can make for a good scrubber and get most of your pores cleaner but will not get rid of the black head</li>
            <li> I ordered Indias Secret Blackhead Dissolving scrubbies and loved them the very first day I tried them.  </li>
            <li> This scrubbie has become a regular in my skin care routine,  I love that it&#x27;s all natural , and you see results!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> This product has cleared up my complexion so much</li>
            <li> eh...kind of makes my skin itchy and doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads for me.</li>
            <li> I now use them on my whole face once a week</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Amazed by what the combination of ingredients are doing for my skin on a whole.</li>
            <li> I know that a very &amp;#34; general&amp;#34; statement.</li>
            <li> Biore strips do literally nothing, and no Rx or over the counter acne product has really solved this problem.</li>
            <li> I rarely say &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; after using a skin care product after one use...but both my 19 yr old daughter</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li> but I use very sparingly.</li>
            <li> These Blackhead Dissolving Srubbies have really worked for me and my son .I</li>
            <li> I had/ still have really oily</li>
            <li> my sister and mother all tried it for ONE pimple and ended up with a breakout on the whole area as well.</li>
            <li> then stumbled upon this product just as i was ready to give up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really depends on your skin, whether this will work or not.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the smell of it, but i didn&#x27;t notice it making any sort of difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> blackheads&#x27;...you really need this product.</li>
            <li> So I got these as a sample and WOW!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very easy to use, no mess, they don&#x27;t dry your skin at all</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, in fact I think it breaks out even more due to this.</li>
            <li> The company is also lovely and sent me a couple different samples of their other products which I am excited to try.</li>
            <li> Although this didn&#x27;t remove my blackheads after using it for several weeks, it does make my face feel and look clean after each use.</li>
            <li> Left face clean</li>
            <li> Gives a deep clean and no blackheads for me.</li>
            <li> I now use many of their products, and never once have I been let down.  </li>
            <li> This stuff definitely made a difference although I agree with what another reviewer said, that you should follow this up with a biore nose strip (or any other kind of nose blackhead strip really)</li>
            <li> the main reason i got this product was beacuse</li>
            <li> But, I really like this product, after a few days you do see your skin looking better.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Diva Stuff -</li>
            <li> Then there are a whole bunch of natural products which are ineffective.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and the blackheads are really dissolving.  </li>
            <li> But, so far it really works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like with a few more uses.</li>
            <li> a whole jar of them actually will take you pretty far.</li>
            <li> Knew I needed to try something new to get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> It smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin how ever it DOES NOT dissolve black heads no matter how long you leave it on or how hot you get your face</li>
            <li> /&gt;it arrived yesterday (very fast shipping) and i used one pad last night and then put it in a baggie to use today.  </li>
            <li> love this company because they are extremely committed to finding natural solutions for a variety of skin problems such as: cellulite, acne, cystic acne, eczema, blackheads, red skin, dry skin, oily skin and more.  </li>
            <li> my cheeks can be slightly sensitive at times, and i do feel a little warm sensation for a short period after using them.</li>
            <li> Pampering, all natural products at affordable price points!</li>
            <li> This stuff really surprised me!</li>
            <li> As far as actually clearing my blackheads I don&#x27;t really see much improvement though.</li>
            <li> I also use them more than once (not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to)</li>
            <li> Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!.</li>
            <li> Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products are safe</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this clean after using any other product.</li>
            <li> no mess!  </li>
            <li> the revew were saying how it would clean your nose and get rid of black heads, well i didnt do that to me</li>
            <li> Just like the rest of the products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> just wow.</li>
            <li> I am frequent customer on amazon, but I never leave any reviews.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t recommend this enough to blackhead sufferers!</li>
            <li> I really like these as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have used this Diva product once, last night, and today, my skin looks much clearer.  </li>
            <li> I do like this product but only rated 3 stars because it REALLY dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit sensitive though so using them twice a day did cause a bit of dryness.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years to clear up my skin .... from the strongest products with harsh chemicals that left my skin dried out to trying to make my own \\&quot;natural\\&quot; concoctions which were just far too messy and time consuming for me.  </li>
            <li> For me I think these irratate my other normal breakouts a bit too much to use often, but I think if you just have blackheads and clogged pores</li>
            <li> The Secret Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies actually worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies are amazing.</li>
            <li> morning i checked on the progress and just ran my nail lightly over the problem area and there were long black streaks.  </li>
            <li> I found the same issues as another reviewer, these seem to really soften up the black heads, but they don&#x27;t really get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> I really like the concept behind this product, each little square is a piece of terry cloth (like wash cloth material) that has a coating of some cinnamon scented product (it smells AMAZING).</li>
            <li> You wet the little washcloth square that&#x27;s covered in the magic potion and give yourself a cinnamon scented facial.</li>
            <li> Her goal is clearly to provide products &amp; service that actually helps the consumer.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ve barely budged at all.</li>
            <li> I used only 3x so far and my blackheads are all gone</li>
            <li> There are 12 little square wash rags which I was able to cut in half.</li>
            <li> I do use this all over my face &amp; neck area but try to be very gentle around my nose &amp; double up on my moisturizer afterword and only use this product at night so that my skin doesn&#x27;t look too dry during the day.</li>
            <li> Little adorable things Ms. Diva shop sells to wash off the debris of everyday exposure to the elements.  </li>
            <li> The blackheads around my nose have become much less noticeable and my skin looks much brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> which im sad for cuz after getting pregnant my nose was getting filled with black heads,</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful with what I use.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an issue at all as each one can be used at least twice or even cut in half or thirds and still provide more than enough cleanser to wash your face and neck thoroughly.</li>
            <li> There are still a few blackheads deeply embedded, but my pores don&#x27;t look so obvious and filled with black or white heads.  </li>
            <li> I wrote to the seller for advice - wanting to get her recommendations for either scaling back use, adding a moisturizer or discontinuing use - &amp; I received prompt, professional &amp; extremely helpful personalized replies.</li>
            <li> India&#x27;s Secret Blackhead Dissolver is a product that&#x27;s worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li> Why couldn&#x27;t these little miracle scrubbies existed when I was in junior high and kids were calling me &amp;#34;shiny</li>
            <li> I cut them in quarters and use one side per night, so they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Because of this I cut each square into 1/4s and make them last well, quadruple as long.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my face isn&#x27;t dry, and my skin is noticeably smoother.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I have combination oily/ dry skin and the occasional breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used them a few times so far</li>
            <li> After using my nose area is so dry that it gets a little flaky even with my normal moisturizer (coconut oil).</li>
            <li> I have used these on a Daily basis for  the first few weeks and finally one is gone and the other is less noticeable .I</li>
            <li> One scrubbie goes a long way too, I can get 3-4 uses out of one.</li>
            <li> It may look strange............</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> They scrub away all the dead skin, making my face really soft.</li>
            <li> I hope this product will be around for a long time!</li>
            <li> Very strange smell.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of tiny &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; all along my hairline on my forehead and India&#x27;s Secret scrubby &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; worked really well.</li>
            <li> I tried to look it up to see if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to look like, but any pictures I found have showed them as a dark brown/burgundy color with no white stuff.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt instantly smoother and my black heads were gone.  </li>
            <li> and if you cut them in half it&#x27;ll make them last longer!</li>
            <li> and I am completely Amazed at how well a small piece of carefully prepared scrub works.</li>
            <li> The Black Head little sponges smells like heavens, and leaves the skin as soft as baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> but the harsh product has left a one-inch patch of chemically scorched dry skin around it?</li>
            <li> I would recommend cutting each strip in half because you don&#x27;t really need a whole one for your nose</li>
            <li> I can actually get a couple uses out of each little scrubbie pad.</li>
            <li> It foams up a little bit once you get enough water into it and massage it into your skin.</li>
            <li> all the other junk in them does things like make your skin dry out and flake up.  </li>
            <li> Cut the pads in half to last longer as suggested in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I use the black head dissolving scrubbies ever other day and alternate using Diva Stuff&#x27;s charcoal and bamboo scrubbies.</li>
            <li> I have huge gaping crazy oily pores (TMI</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they haven&#x27;t helped much in that regard, but they have helped with getting rid of the occasional blackhead or two.</li>
            <li> Left on for a few minutes, my balckheads were cleared out.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> Really not for me.</li>
            <li> Not much to say since a lot of people already said tons.</li>
            <li> Basically you wet the square and massage it onto your face, you leave the suds on for a minute or two and then rinse.</li>
            <li> I have Also  use other products from Diva</li>
            <li> I have already purchased three other products...</li>
            <li> This works and you can use each scrubbie several times and even put a small of amount of cleanser on it.&lt;br /&gt;great shipping.</li>
            <li> but I will try one of the other products.</li>
            <li> After all the money spent in the stores for black head products, I wish I found this sooner.  </li>
            <li> May be a little rough for some people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> not worth the almost $1 per &amp;#34;scrubbie&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but it dries my skin so much that I&#x27;m unable to use it too often.</li>
            <li> Smaller pores, untraceable blackheads.</li>
            <li> I will buy these again and other products too!</li>
            <li> So I think that these actually loosen or start to break down (gross sorry)</li>
            <li> Disappointing because it was kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> Recently because of the extreem cold my skin has not only been dry</li>
            <li> my black heads r still there.</li>
            <li> I would not say it removes black heads</li>
            <li> Black heads on nose have vanished.</li>
            <li> I would consider these to be a 3x a week or less treatment, depending on the sensitivity of your skin.</li>
            <li> These are solidified gauze pads marinated in a turmeric mixture, homegrown as it gets without the mess of DIY science experiments.</li>
            <li> They even included a few samples from their other products!</li>
            <li> I imagine instead of reusing a few times, you could just cut them in half too.</li>
            <li> cut these in half and get a few uses out of each one.</li>
            <li> They seem to be made of little cotton string scrubbies.</li>
            <li> yes it looks a little like worms</li>
            <li> I just used that little Indian Face scrub sample.  </li>
            <li> and I will reorder when I run out (or probably before I run out since it takes a little while to ship to Australia).</li>
            <li> (I dedicated a little soap dish to them).</li>
            <li> The scrubbies are actually little squares of terry cloth that have been coated with this miracle substance.</li>
            <li> If I have a little excess, then I use them on my hands as well.</li>
            <li> Each little terry cloth bit has 2 to 3 uses, so</li>
            <li> NOTHING has been heavy or sticky or greasy or drying......</li>
            <li> You can get a few uses out of them</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> this wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh.</li>
            <li> had a few Blackheads on my nose that never seemed to go away until i used these.</li>
            <li> but then i saw how messy that was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not sure if it works, but it ruined my french manicure by staining my nails yellow. :(</li>
            <li> I still have small blackheads</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think.  </li>
            <li> I never even opened it because like another reviewer there was weird white stuff growing on it that I&#x27;m guessing</li>
            <li> Yahoo, no more breakout</li>
            <li> I usually have to exract them everyother day.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> This came just a few days after I ordered!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to use it every day, but I am.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; your skin --- you know, how usually the acne is still there</li>
            <li> after scrubbing with soap and my usual clinique astringent, i realized i wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere</li>
            <li> I understand there are some negative reviews</li>
            <li> and I must say this has might have to do with really delicate skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are at a confusing transitional time in the skin care world.  </li>
            <li> but I also have this annoying residue under my armpits from antiperspirant deodorant that no body wash or scrub seems to really remover.</li>
            <li> The India&#x27;s Secret face scrubbies don&#x27;t have that chemical smell you usually find in face treatment products</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I really wanted to try it!</li>
            <li> I could have found in a long time, the only thing that I have done these horrible blackheads on my nose come out never more RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li> And diva stuff has shocked me in what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I am tired of products that don&#x27;t work and make my face peel.</li>
            <li> the Indias Secret wash...</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old but get terrible blackheads.</li>
            <li> Probably because I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Difficult to say...</li>
            <li> not as horrifying as it sounds,  just looked like minute black threads</li>
            <li> I think a lot of bad reviews having to do with skin products come from people with very delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use anymore.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> all that crap was coming out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed :&#x27;(</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m actually not sure if it works, but it ruined my french manicure by staining my nails yellow. :( Smells good and scrubs nicely, though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I can actually get a couple uses out of each little scrubbie pad. It exfoliates amazingly and smells like a chai tea! I imagine instead of reusing a few times, you could just cut them in half too. They seem to be made of little cotton string scrubbies.</li>
            <li> Great item. Seems to work. Ive had for couple days only and each time I use it my face looks cleaner and pores more smaller.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOODNESS. after one use, my blackheads are GONE! anyone who has had the stubborn blackheads on their nose NEEDS to purchase this!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin after using this, it does not work....</li>
            <li> Great little face cloth pieces with wonderful ingredients on them. I love the smell and doesnt make my face seem overly dry. Hoping it helps with my acne a bit.</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff is legit! I have had blackheads that make me cringe since I was a teenager. I am now 34. I&#x27;m Italian we have big pores we have blackheads. Whenever I look in the mirror the first thing I see are my blackheads. Since using this kick ass product, I literally have to look for my blackheads. I have to look for them! It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not even my face anymore. I understand there are some negative reviews and I must say this has might have to do with really delicate skin. I think a lot of bad reviews having to do with skin products come from people with very delicate skin. This product does not burn me. iand yes it looks a little like worms but it&#x27;s obviously the cloth that the product is adhered to. This product is worth your money. Even more importantly this product is worth my money! And I will continue using it!</li>
            <li> India&#x27;s Secret Blackhead Dissolver is a product that&#x27;s worth its weight in gold! I have used this product multiple times, and love it because: it has all natural ingredients, smells wonderfully and does an effective job of cleaning out and visibly shrinking my blackheads (my problem area is on my nose.)  It makes my pores look so much smaller and it&#x27;s safe for me to use, even on my ultra-sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this company because they are extremely committed to finding natural solutions for a variety of skin problems such as: cellulite, acne, cystic acne, eczema, blackheads, red skin, dry skin, oily skin and more.  I absolutely love their face creams and face scrubbies that are designed for ultra-sensitive skin, like mine.  Pampering, all natural products at affordable price points! What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I still have small blackheads I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of. The dirt detox by diva did help with that. I love it for the simple fact it makes my face feel clean. I read a review about white worms? The product it put in a rag type deal that you get wet with warm water. Unless those worms are moving around its most likely just the rag. Great product I enjoy the cinnamon smell</li>
            <li> Certainly smells of cinnamon.  I like them and do feel like the blackheads are minimized - wouldn&#x27;t say gone.  I also purchased the charcoal and bamboo scrubbies and like them more.  Can&#x27;t give you a definitive reason - just an overall experience. I will be reordering the charcoal/bamboo version.</li>
            <li> Although this didn&#x27;t remove my blackheads after using it for several weeks, it does make my face feel and look clean after each use. I cut the strips into fours, and it still lathers up pretty well.</li>
            <li> I found the same issues as another reviewer, these seem to really soften up the black heads, but they don&#x27;t really get rid of them.  I am going to try pore strips like she said she did and see how it goes.  I have huge gaping crazy oily pores (TMI but if you&#x27;re looking at this product then you proabbly want to know the skin type of the reviewers for comparison)</li>
            <li> I was so intrigued by the &#x27;face scrubbie&#x27; format that I had to try it - it surpassed my expectations!  I have tried so many products over the years to clear up my skin .... from the strongest products with harsh chemicals that left my skin dried out to trying to make my own \\&quot;natural\\&quot; concoctions which were just far too messy and time consuming for me.  These face scrubbies are the right solution for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, when you open the jar the smell is fantastic - it&#x27;s warm and spicy, like built in aromatherapy!  Everything is contained right on the scrubbie - no mess!  And it&#x27;s easy to use - just wet it with warm water and massage your skin.  I love with when product lather up nicely - it makes me feel so pampered!  I like to leave it on my skin for a minute while I am putting on body lotion, and then it rinses off cleanly.  This product has cleared up my complexion so much and it&#x27;s such a good experience to use - love it!  I highly recommend Diva Stuff - I now use many of their products, and never once have I been let down.  You can tell they perform a lot of testing on their creations before selling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are at a confusing transitional time in the skin care world.  There have been so many products out there with harmful chemicals, and so many mainstream brands that label themselves \\&quot;natural\\&quot; because they have 1 natural ingredient but all the other junk in them does things like make your skin dry out and flake up.  Then there are a whole bunch of natural products which are ineffective.  I want to use product that are healthy for my skin and get results - Diva Stuff actually delivers on it promises!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  My dog has severe blackheads! She is a Chinese crested.  This it&#x27;s the first product that has helped get them out!  Super awesome! Plus, I added blackhead remover by Vi-Tae.  It adds moisture, plus acts as a light mask.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Did not receive any samples like my friends and family did!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think.  I never even opened it because like another reviewer there was weird white stuff growing on it that I&#x27;m guessing is some kind of mold.  It looks like tiny white worms.  I tried to look it up to see if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to look like, but any pictures I found have showed them as a dark brown/burgundy color with no white stuff.  Very disappointed because I really wanted to try it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, in fact I think it breaks out even more due to this. Disappointing because it was kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is good it lightly dissolves the blackheads on my face. My skin is lot more clear and radiant, it a good feeling for me.</li>
            <li> OMG...I just used that little Indian Face scrub sample.  IT IS AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs before, but this one keeps your face a more hydrating feeling.  I LOVE IT.  I am about to blog on my site about it...BTW, after only 2 days on the Eyelash conditioner, my eyelashes are already starting to pop. GREAT PRODUCTS DIVA.  And trust me, I don&#x27;t say that lightly because my face is sensitive.</li>
            <li> After using this the first time, there was a visable difference in my skin. I use one three or four times. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really amazing. I can tell a difference in my skin just after 3 washes, which is what I can get out of 1 scrubbie. I just store the one i am using in a sandwich or ziploc bag. They make your skin super soft as well. Made pores noticeably smaller. I had a lil bit of blackheads on my upper lip line and those seemed to have just vanished. I will definitely repurchase when I run out of these. I also love the acne cream sample they sent along with this and will be buying that as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered Indias Secret Blackhead Dissolving scrubbies and loved them the very first day I tried them.  My skin felt instantly smoother and my black heads were gone.  Recently because of the extreem cold my skin has not only been dry but now I have breakouts.  I tried everything and nothing helped.  I remembered my Diva Stuff blackhead scrubbies , used it and saw instant results!  Yahoo, no more breakout and my skin is softer Thank you Diva Stuff</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it smells great, and it cleans out your pores very well!</li>
            <li> Cut the pads in half to last longer as suggested in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Its like taking soap infested beef jerky and scrubbing your.  Left face clean so it works well at that, but will not remove blackheads.  Not dissolve them.</li>
            <li> makes my skin clear and pores shrink, also makes me feel clean and calm, and centered, my favorite product to purchase from diva stuff &lt;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these multiple times, that&#x27;s how much I love them! They make your skin feel so clean and smooth and definitely help with reducing an acne flare up. Will continue to buy :)</li>
            <li> These work great.  (And smell wonderful!!)  I cut them in quarters and use one side per night, so they last a long time.  I do think the charcoal version of this product is more effective for pimples and cystic acne. So if you have those issues on top of blackheads, stick with charcoal.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! I have recently found and started using Diva Stuff&#x27;s products, &amp; so far I have loved everything I have ordered and the samples as well. This scrubbie is amazing! I saw a difference in my skin right away.  It smells really good too. I was a bit nervous when I first tried it out that it was going to stain my face and hands, but rest assured it won&#x27;t!  It easily washes off with water no soap needed.  This scrubbie has become a regular in my skin care routine,  I love that it&#x27;s all natural , and you see results!  I would recommend this product to anyone who has acne prone skin or clogged pores. This scrubbie really helps!</li>
            <li> eh...kind of makes my skin itchy and doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads for me. It actually makes them stick out more visibly on my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely made a difference although I agree with what another reviewer said, that you should follow this up with a biore nose strip (or any other kind of nose blackhead strip really) as that will probably make this product more effective. I would recommend cutting each strip in half because you don&#x27;t really need a whole one for your nose and if you cut them in half it&#x27;ll make them last longer! My only complaint about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but that&#x27;s just me. The product itself is very good and I will reorder when I run out (or probably before I run out since it takes a little while to ship to Australia).</li>
            <li> India&#x27;s Secret Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies are a wonderful addition to my beauty routine, I especially use them for my nose which was covered in blackheads until I started using these wonderful Face Scrubbies.&lt;br /&gt;First they smell amazing nothing like store bought products. The India&#x27;s Secret face scrubbies don&#x27;t have that chemical smell you usually find in face treatment products instead they have a lovely aroma that you want to spend the whole day in. Second it feels amazing on my skin. After wetting the little square scrubbie and lightly scrubbing my nose I let it sit for about a minute for good measure. It tingles, a wonderful tingle, and you can just feel it cleaning your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Third it actually works. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes after rinsing the product off my face, those darn blackheads seem to be smaller and I couldn&#x27;t see as many. Could this be true? YES! The Secret Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies actually worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Blackhead Dissolving Face Scrubbies are amazing. The scrubbies smell wonderful, fell amazing on the skin and actually work. Is there anything else you could ask for? I now use them on my whole face once a week and I am amazed at the different they have made. Thanks DIVA STUFF!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter told me about Diva Stuff.  She has been pleased with their products and recommended that I place an order. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful with what I use.  When I received my first order, they included a sample of this product.  I was amazed at how fast it worked.  I have always had blackheads on the sides of my nose and have tried many products to dissolve them but never found anything that worked.  After using this sample just one time I could see a difference.  My skin was so soft and the blackheads are really dissolving.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to place an order today!  I hope this product will be around for a long time!</li>
            <li> Incredible! This product is fantastic. Within 3 days most of my blackheads were almost gone and within 3 weeks they were completely gone. Wish I would have found this product sooner!</li>
            <li> I have skin that dries out very easily and I am tired of products that don&#x27;t work and make my face peel. Diva stuff is amazing! I use the black head dissolving scrubbies ever other day and alternate using Diva Stuff&#x27;s charcoal and bamboo scrubbies. My pores are smaller, my face isn&#x27;t dry, and my skin is noticeably smoother. I will buy these again and other products too!</li>
            <li> Extremely useful. Works well and I would recommend to others!!</li>
            <li> Great for my large pores and I love the smell. Leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean. Blackheads aren&#x27;t a big problem but the cleansing helps exfoliate. Recommend to all!</li>
            <li> Smells just like big red gum but i notice a huge difference in my pores shrinking</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.....don&#x27;t even know where to start lol.. I leave it on for a minute or two it tightens like a mask. Washes off like silk. Makes my skin feel so fresh and soft. Just like the rest of the products I&#x27;ve tried so far. I&#x27;m hooked on this line. Amazed by what the combination of ingredients are doing for my skin on a whole. NOTHING has been heavy or sticky or greasy or drying...... I&#x27;m just seriously impressed by it all so far. I know that a very &amp;#34; general&amp;#34; statement. Probably because I was skeptical. And diva stuff has shocked me in what I expected. It&#x27;s been beyond my expectations of a beauty line that FINALLY does what it should and more.......just wow.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, maybe I just need to purchase some more</li>
            <li> Really works, so glad I bought it! Read some reviews that mentioned white &amp;#34;wormy&amp;#34; stuff - not to worry, the product is soaked onto squares of terry cloth. The fibers look &amp;#34;wormy&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s just towel. I will be buying this product again and again.</li>
            <li> So I got these as a sample and WOW!!! I love these things! I can honestly say every product I&#x27;ve tried from Diva Stuff has been great! I love how my face feels after using these... am ordering some now! I also bought the sea salf face wash which I love too. You just can&#x27;t beat their prices and quality!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I had sooo many blackheads and I tried everything under the sun like blackhead remover tools, biore strips, clay, etc... I even went to the dermatologist and nothing he prescribed worked! Finally, I came across this by luck and read the reviews; I decided to give it a shot. I am sooo happy I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Please, please try this. My nose is so smooth like a baby I can&#x27;t believe it. 10/5 stars :&#x27;)</li>
            <li> I love these, they smell great and my skin feels smoother and more toned after I use them. You can get a few uses out of them (I dedicated a little soap dish to them). I have only used them a few times so far but I&#x27;m smitten with these and will reorder when I run out! I did a big switch to a bunch of Kyms Diva Stuff products and I love all of it! And their customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li> These dissolve away blackheads like magic and leave my skin smooth and clear. I can use each scrubbie 2 times.</li>
            <li> I am frequent customer on amazon, but I never leave any reviews. but this stuff is gold, i cant believe it actually works, you just have to keep use it for 2 to 3 days, im buying 4 more like right now.</li>
            <li> This stuff really surprised me! It feels great on my skin, and I can tell a difference in the pores on my nose ... I can&#x27;t wait to try more from Diva Stuff. Very good product, fast shipping. Do yourself a favor and try it!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when i bought this stuff.. when i got it i first tryed it and my face felt clean and smooth.. the main reason i got this product was beacuse the revew were saying how it would clean your nose and get rid of black heads, well i didnt do that to me which im sad for cuz after getting pregnant my nose was getting filled with black heads, so anyway i see no diffrence in my face my black heads r still there. ive been using this product for like a week or two and all its done is brake me out&#x3D;(  ps. The smell is great not gonna lie</li>
            <li> I use these for the troublesome area, my nose. Because of this I cut each square into 1/4s and make them last well, quadruple as long. They seem to be working well enough. I think the bigger issue is me not using them regularly. If nothing else, they smell nice.</li>
            <li> I simply love these scrubbies. They&#x27;re very easy to use, no mess, they don&#x27;t dry your skin at all and I love the fact that they&#x27;re made with natural ingredients. You can see results after 2/3 uses. I&#x27;ll definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had incredibly stubborn clogged/ enlarged pores/ blackheads on my nose for years. Biore strips do literally nothing, and no Rx or over the counter acne product has really solved this problem. Otherwise, I have combination oily/ dry skin and the occasional breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little scrubbies are incredible. You wet the little washcloth square that&#x27;s covered in the magic potion and give yourself a cinnamon scented facial. I do this every morning and let the bubbles sit on my face and tingle for a minute. After, my pores felt more supple? As an experiment, I did a Biore strip on my nose, and IT REMOVED TONS AND TONS OF BLACKHEADS/ clogged pores or whatever! FINALLY! So I think that these actually loosen or start to break down (gross sorry) your blackheads, but don&#x27;t actually remove them from your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been saving the scrubby from the morning and using it again in the shower when I wash my face in the evening. There&#x27;s enough potion on each scrubby for two uses. Totally unrelated, but I also have this annoying residue under my armpits from antiperspirant deodorant that no body wash or scrub seems to really remover. Like after I shower, my armpits still feel waxy, and it kind of bothers me. As an experiment, I rubbed the remainder of the scrubby (now having been used 2X on my face) under each armpit and scrubbed away. DEODORANT RESIDUE gone!!!! No idea why or how this worked, but I could not be happier!!!</li>
            <li> Knew I needed to try something new to get rid of my blackheads. This is definitely it! After using it once, about 50% of my blackheads are gone. The scrubbies are actually little squares of terry cloth that have been coated with this miracle substance. It foams up a little bit once you get enough water into it and massage it into your skin. The smell is really strong, but i personally think it smells really good. I really can&#x27;t recommend this enough to blackhead sufferers! BUY BUY BUY~!&lt;br /&gt;PS...it says you can actually use them more than once. I put them in a baggie in the fridge just to be safe. Then I usually just use it one more time bc most of the goodness is gone by then :)</li>
            <li> Received this as a freebie, lifesavor. I am 40 years old but get terrible blackheads. I usually have to exract them everyother day.&lt;br /&gt;With the Indias Secret wash... Left on for a few minutes, my balckheads were cleared out.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, nothing up to date can diminish a pore size, just the appearance. So my pores are still large but cleaned ou!</li>
            <li> smells great, seems to clean skin..but has done nothing for my complexion. not worth the almost $1 per &amp;#34;scrubbie&amp;#34; IMO..probably would not buy again based on how it is advertised.</li>
            <li> My daughter has cystic acne and blackheads and we have tried All the products advertised on TV. I have been using this for over a month and it is great. I have Also  use other products from Diva and I have not been disappointed. Nice, natural ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> I really like these as a facial cleanser. As far as actually clearing my blackheads I don&#x27;t really see much improvement though. But I wash my whole face with them and they make it feel fresh and clean. I also use them more than once (not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to) but they last for several washes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I am mid-40&#x27;s with acne prone skin, and this product has been wonderful. There is no break out reaction.  It seems to calm my skin.  (probably the anti-inflammatory properties of the turmeric!)  If having super clean porres/skin wasn&#x27;t enough- my skin has never felt softer an more supple.  It does the job 2 or 3 products, and does them well. I plan to buy some more very soon.I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 63 year old male who is still troubled by facial skin filled with blackheads.  I have relied on an esthetician to monthly remove my blackheads and make my skin look better.  Recently, I decided to try to get rid of the blackheads on my own.  I first tried products that my dermatologist recommended, and they weren&#x27;t great.  Then I went hunting on my own.  I have used this Diva product once, last night, and today, my skin looks much clearer.  There are still a few blackheads deeply embedded, but my pores don&#x27;t look so obvious and filled with black or white heads.  I believe if I continue to use this product, I will be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Really not for me. Something is growing in the jar. Looks like white worms! I&#x27;m afraid to use anymore. I think it&#x27;s too harsh for my skin. I do have rosacia, but still, what are those white things?</li>
            <li> I rarely say &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; after using a skin care product after one use...but both my 19 yr old daughter and I did with this one!  I was amazed that the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in my pores on my nose/cheeks/chin were gone.  Don&#x27;t be concerned that the yellow coloring will stain your skin...it doesn&#x27;t and it smells nice.  I think I will probably get 2-3 uses out of each pad, so the cost per use is much more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Diva Stuff for this product!</li>
            <li> i like the smell and use it on my face and body as i can have breakouts in lots of fun areas. you get multiple uses from one scrubbie and it seems to work well. my cheeks can be slightly sensitive at times, and i do feel a little warm sensation for a short period after using them. there is no redness, just a warm, tingling sensation (but not to the point of a burning sensation). so, if you&#x27;re a sensitive skin type i&#x27;m not sure these would be the best option for you.</li>
            <li> This came just a few days after I ordered! They are a lot bigger than I expected, smell great and they even came with free samples- a pretty big sized lip balm and a packet of neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage firming cream. I definitely recommend buying from them! I can&#x27;t wait to try these out! :)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I always had trouble with blackheads on my nose, most people do right?! I used these scrubbers and saw a difference after my first time using them! Definitely a must have in everyone&#x27;s skin care regimen!</li>
            <li> OMG!  Little adorable things Ms. Diva shop sells to wash off the debris of everyday exposure to the elements.  The Black Head little sponges smells like heavens, and leaves the skin as soft as baby&#x27;s butt.  Once I know the results of the anti cellulite bar soap, I&#x27;ll place an order to comment on my findings.  I recommend all the wonderful little things she has available for sale. Ana</li>
            <li> Works alright, I am a guy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever want to be without these beauties! My skin just loves these. My pores have become less visible, they give my skin a nice glow, and they are fun to use!  I use these every other day and my skin is looking better and better.  If I have a little excess, then I use them on my hands as well. I am able to cut these in half as I use them primarily on my nose and cheeks.  In addition to this being a truly &amp;#34;one of a kind&amp;#34; product, the customer service is unparalleled.  I love doing business with a company that believes  in its products.  I get nervous every time they send a sample because I know that I am going to love that, too.  I have already purchased three other products...the lip plumper, the even steven, and the lash enhancer.  They have all been phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these! My blackheads were surprisingly reduced after just one use. I love that it&#x27;s all natural as well. The bonus is that it smells great and my skin all around feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really gives my face clean and crisp feeling. My skin is clearing up well and it&#x27;s only been 3 days!</li>
            <li> Cleans and exfoliates. Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I do like this product but only rated 3 stars because it REALLY dries my skin out. I had a lot of tiny &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; all along my hairline on my forehead and India&#x27;s Secret scrubby &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; worked really well. My skin is much softer &amp; smoother. I purchased this to get rid of the oily/blackhead &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; around my nose. It does work but it dries my skin so much that I&#x27;m unable to use it too often. After using my nose area is so dry that it gets a little flaky even with my normal moisturizer (coconut oil). I do use this all over my face &amp; neck area but try to be very gentle around my nose &amp; double up on my moisturizer afterword and only use this product at night so that my skin doesn&#x27;t look too dry during the day. I&#x27;m sure if you have oily skin this wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh. I will continue use since I love how soft &amp; smooth it makes my face but I use very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I would not say it removes black heads but my pores look cleaner after I use it</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The smell is amazing and lingers throughout the day. My skin is so smooth after I use this product. The blackheads around my nose have become much less noticeable and my skin looks much brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> May be a little rough for some people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Not much to say since a lot of people already said tons. But, I really like this product, after a few days you do see your skin looking better. Not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to use it every day, but I am. This will be my second purchase and using it more often, will update this after. But, so far it really works.</li>
            <li> I could have found in a long time, the only thing that I have done these horrible blackheads on my nose come out never more RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li> These Blackhead Dissolving Srubbies have really worked for me and my son .I had a few Blackheads on my nose that never seemed to go away until i used these.I have used these on a Daily basis for  the first few weeks and finally one is gone and the other is less noticeable .I cut these in half and get a few uses out of each one.</li>
            <li> Why couldn&#x27;t these little miracle scrubbies existed when I was in junior high and kids were calling me &amp;#34;shiny face&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt; I had/ still have really oily&lt;br /&gt;and blackhead prone skin and nothing has ever actually helped, except for these. The scrubbies look like beef jerky and smell cinnamazing! One scrubbie goes a long way too, I can get 3-4 uses out of one. My skin feels CLEAN and healthy. My blackheads are disappearing. Will definitely buy again. Thank you Diva Stuff!</li>
            <li> Nicely priced and does a great job on the face leaves skin glowing.love the extra samples</li>
            <li> I own a skincare spa. Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!. I sell it at my spa.  It is the best product out there for SAFELY removing blackheads.  It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; your skin --- you know, how usually the acne is still there but the harsh product has left a one-inch patch of chemically scorched dry skin around it? --- like most products do.  Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products are safe but dang it they just don&#x27;t work.  It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> Clean some blackhead but skin will breakout sometimes after use. Not gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe can use this weekly or biweekly.</li>
            <li> I noticed some of my blackheads diminishing right away but the effects were even more noticeable the day after...these really work! Also, they smell just like authentic German gingerbread cookies (a really pleasant surprise) :-)</li>
            <li> I was so excited at first, saw quick results, then all of a sudden had a huge breakout :(( my sister and mother all tried it for ONE pimple and ended up with a breakout on the whole area as well. I&#x27;m so disappointed :&#x27;( It&#x27;s taking me forever to undo the damage..</li>
            <li> Diva Stuff has made some of the best products for oily skin.  This works and you can use each scrubbie several times and even put a small of amount of cleanser on it.&lt;br /&gt;great shipping.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive but after the first use I can enthusiastically recommend this product.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> omg, this stuff really works and it&#x27;s so pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve never had blackheads before but a couple of weeks ago, i noticed them around my nose.  after scrubbing with soap and my usual clinique astringent, i realized i wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere so i got on amazon and started researching.&lt;br /&gt;i almost bought that clay stuff but then i saw how messy that was AND it could easily clog pipes...no thank you to that.&lt;br /&gt;i then stumbled upon this product just as i was ready to give up.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived yesterday (very fast shipping) and i used one pad last night and then put it in a baggie to use today.  my face felt extremely clean and soft after i used it.&lt;br /&gt;this morning i checked on the progress and just ran my nail lightly over the problem area and there were long black streaks.  all that crap was coming out.  not as horrifying as it sounds,  just looked like minute black threads actually but yes, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;i just did it again, using the same pad re-hydrated and the last of the gunk is gone.  it&#x27;s a miracle and i will be telling all my family and friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;what a great gift idea for your bff&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;thank you, thank you, thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps.  smells divine!</li>
            <li> It smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin how ever it DOES NOT dissolve black heads no matter how long you leave it on or how hot you get your face the little terry cloth can make for a good scrubber and get most of your pores cleaner but will not get rid of the black head</li>
            <li> It may look strange............ but this stuff is like MAGIC!!!!</li>
            <li> Works well!  Black heads on nose have vanished.</li>
            <li> Its only my second day using this face scrub and I am completely Amazed at how well a small piece of carefully prepared scrub works. My face feel and looked even better than the expensive facial I have spented on. I am buying more of Divastuff products to start using. I know I will also be happy consumers.</li>
            <li> Difficult to say... I have used this for 4 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;It kinda brings out some acne... but shrinks the pores at the same time... but only temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t rid my blackheads...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have large pores - you have large pores... and having oily skin is actually good for old age. Keeps the skin more supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this DID do, is even out my skin tone over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut each piece into 4 pieces so they lasted longer... and I was still able to use each piece twice. There will be a yellow color (from the turmeric) on your skin/hands. But it washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really depends on your skin, whether this will work or not. I probably won&#x27;t order more though. Hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> It smells great. The cinnamon lemon combination is really strong. It did not dissolve my blackheads, but it did reduce the size of my pores. It was too strong for me but I will try one of the other products. There are 12 little square wash rags which I was able to cut in half. long. Overall this is a good product but not the right one for me.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the smell of it, but i didn&#x27;t notice it making any sort of difference on my skin. I do reuse the pads approx three times before throwing them out. I just set it on top of the jar after use and let it dry out. Honestly, I&#x27;ll probably end up throwing the jar into my camping gear and use it as a handy face cleanser in the woods.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 18-year-old son.  He plays sports and works out a lot in the gym.  They are perfect to him to use after a game or a good workout.  The packaging is a good size to throw in a gym bag.  I plan to buy more for everyone in the family to use.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept behind this product, each little square is a piece of terry cloth (like wash cloth material) that has a coating of some cinnamon scented product (it smells AMAZING). Basically you wet the square and massage it onto your face, you leave the suds on for a minute or two and then rinse. It stings a teeny bit when you apply it, but I like to think thats just the product working and not the cinnamon irratating the HECK out of my skin. Each little terry cloth bit has 2 to 3 uses, so a whole jar of them actually will take you pretty far. I would consider these to be a 3x a week or less treatment, depending on the sensitivity of your skin. For me I think these irratate my other normal breakouts a bit too much to use often, but I think if you just have blackheads and clogged pores these probably work much better. I bought these because I have a very oily t-zone and pretty enlarged pores that I was hoping these would help shrink. Unfortunately they haven&#x27;t helped much in that regard, but they have helped with getting rid of the occasional blackhead or two. I will continue using these on my t-zone to see if they help shrink my pores a bit. The company is also lovely and sent me a couple different samples of their other products which I am excited to try.</li>
            <li> I really like these. I got them specifically for the blackheads I have on and around my nose but they&#x27;ve barely budged at all. However, my face has gotten noticeably smoother and clearer, and as a result have gotten my dad into them. He&#x27;s where I get my less than perfect skin from and if these help clear up his troublesome oily, acne-prone skin, that&#x27;s a win in my book. I also found that I can use each &amp;#34;scrubbie&amp;#34; 2-3 times before they&#x27;re used up, so they last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a yay for smaller pores and clearer, smoother skin, but a nay for the supposed blackhead erasing properties.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! After just two uses, I can see a tremendous difference! I love the cinnamon and clove smell. Each scrubbies can be used 2-3 times. I used it on my chest and back as well as my face and it made my skin super smooth.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like with a few more uses.</li>
            <li> This really does get rid of blackheads!  After all the money spent in the stores for black head products, I wish I found this sooner.  Awesome customer service.  They even included a few samples from their other products!</li>
            <li> Umm love... I used only 3x so far and my blackheads are all gone</li>
            <li> This works.  I will buy more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Gives a deep clean and no blackheads for me. Have been giving them out to some of my clients at work. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love these things! They work great and one lasts for several uses.</li>
            <li> Great for a good scrub I am seeing the difference.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my blackhead. Very strange smell.</li>
            <li> I received these as a sample and I absolutely love them! They scrub away all the dead skin, making my face really soft. I use it in the morning then apply moisturizer. Keeps my face smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; seller! :) I was concerned at first because you only receive 12 +/- scrubbies per jar. This isn&#x27;t an issue at all as each one can be used at least twice or even cut in half or thirds and still provide more than enough cleanser to wash your face and neck thoroughly. The cleaning power is amazing! My skin has never felt this clean after using any other product. My skin also felt firmer after just one use. My skin is a bit sensitive though so using them twice a day did cause a bit of dryness. I wrote to the seller for advice - wanting to get her recommendations for either scaling back use, adding a moisturizer or discontinuing use - &amp; I received prompt, professional &amp; extremely helpful personalized replies. Her goal is clearly to provide products &amp; service that actually helps the consumer. I&#x27;d definitely recommend any items from Diva Stuff. :)</li>
            <li> These are great! The smell is strong, but they helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s face so I wouldn&#x27;t come after her anymore with the extractor tool. We noticed a difference after one use, which is pretty amazing. She said they stink, but she&#x27;ll keep using them since they work so well!</li>
            <li> If you have ever Googled anything like &#x27;make big pores smaller&#x27; or &#x27;dissolve blackheads&#x27;...you really need this product. These are solidified gauze pads marinated in a turmeric mixture, homegrown as it gets without the mess of DIY science experiments. The pads smell like cinnamon, have a rough and a smooth side, and dispense mixture smoothly when water is added. Slough your whole face, leave on for a minute (it&#x27;ll dry) and rinse off with warm water and sturdy, scrubby wash cloth. VOILA! Smaller pores, untraceable blackheads. Not kidding. Best thing for oily caucasian skin ever.</li>
