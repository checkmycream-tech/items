            <li>Product is exactly as described.  </li>

            <li> They totally compliment each other.</li>
            <li> I use the lighter color on the eyelid and the black on the upper lash line, winging it out at the corner, and along the lower lash rim.</li>
            <li> , i wet my brush to make liner</li>
            <li> I use this instead of my eye marker now, It stays on much longer and doesnt smudge like my expensive liquid liner marker does.</li>
            <li> and I use the black for liner</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeshadow because I was looking for a pigmented black color.</li>
            <li> The pink one I use everyday!</li>
            <li> it totally reminds me of Dolce &amp; Gabanna&#x27;s eye shadow duo, Stromboli, but a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> Packaging SUCKS though.  </li>
            <li> and I was thoroughly disgusted with the whole thing.  </li>

            <li> As claimed, nice duo, would purchase again, love the pod it comes in and I use the black for liner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved these duos. This black/pinky combo is a great all in one option for night or day depending on how you much of each color you go for.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use the pink side, but the black eyeshadow is exactly what I was looking for! It is my most-used eye shadow and I use it somewhat as an eyeliner. I loved it so much that I got a second as a back up!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Very pretty and came on time. I love the brand HIP, it never fails. Buy it now</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeshadow. I purchased it because I didn&#x27;t want one that was too shimmery and this was a great choice. The black comes out very dark and the pink goes on very light. They totally compliment each other. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> love colors - I would buy again and in my price range</li>
            <li> The pink didnt show up the greatest but the black is amazing. Really love this product. Will buy more definitely</li>
            <li> I love the matt black. Deep rich color</li>
            <li> I was looking for matte colors and this ones are really matte! The dark grey one is very pigmented so you better be careful while applying it. The pink one I use everyday! It gives me a fresh and healthy look every morning. And the size is perfect for taking with you in your purse. It&#x27;s totally worth buying it!</li>
            <li> When I received this matte eye shadow it had stickers all over it from CVS and had been reduced in price 3 or 4 times.  When I opened it, it spilled all over me because it had all cracked into pieces.  I immediately threw it in the trash.  I can&#x27;t imagine how old it might have been and I was thoroughly disgusted with the whole thing.  It should have been thrown in the trash instead of being sent to a customer.  Won&#x27;t do that again!!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product! I use it with a damp liner brush for liquid liner and prefer it so much more than any liquid liner on the market!</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeshadow because I was looking for a pigmented black color. I own an eyeshadow just like this one with different colors and liked it so I bought this one. The black does its job without making a mess with fallout but on my skin tone I can&#x27;t see the light color. I am fair skinned. So all in all I like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described.  Packaging SUCKS though.  Teeny tiny applicator, container opens both bottom and top and is really difficult to open.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eye shadow palette for the smoky eye look. I use the lighter color on the eyelid and the black on the upper lash line, winging it out at the corner, and along the lower lash rim. I then add liquid eye liner on top to really make it pop! it totally reminds me of Dolce &amp; Gabanna&#x27;s eye shadow duo, Stromboli, but a lot less expensive. I love it!</li>
            <li> Average at best. The black is nice, the &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; goes on like a pink color, not nude. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again but not a loss.</li>
            <li> When the product came in the colors were not the ones I specifically was looking for.  I originally bought my shadow at a local drugstore so when I could no longer find it I knew exactly what I wanted (had the color number, etc).  Even the picture shows exactly what I was attempting to purchase.  When the order came in the color was not AT ALL what was in the picture or in my make up case.  It was too much of a hassle to return and attempt to purchase again but I won&#x27;t be purchasing make up from here again.</li>
            <li> The black matte side is wonderful! The light pink ehhh not so much!</li>
            <li> Great color pay off, last a really long time, i use the black one tu fill in my brows:) great eyeshadows overall</li>
            <li> The pigments in the black shadow is amazing! great for smokey eyes, however the pink is so pale and light you will barley see it but it blends in nice. bottom line its a great product for the awesome price.</li>
