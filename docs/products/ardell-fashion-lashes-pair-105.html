            <li>They always ship quickly and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s a package deal. :)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find more than a 2 or 3 pack in stores of these particular lashes so this is perfect!</li>
            <li>They are, however, very comfortable to wear and durable too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love wit</li>
            <li>I also prefer strip lashes vs individual lashes.&lt;br /&gt;These are the best to add volume and length without overdoing it!</li>
            <li>great lashes that go on nicely and feel natural</li>
            <li>I was so psyched to have found them for so cheap!</li>
            <li>And the quality is very similar.no doubt this is a good nice value product, for a lashes user like me</li>
            <li>And at such a great price too!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product</li>
            <li>and you can use them many times if you take care of them...</li>
            <li>style 105 is my favorite, but</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>This Eyelashes are the best the are human hair</li>
            <li>These are made with real human hair and the placement is excellent.</li>
            <li>Ardell lashes are just undoubtably fabulous!</li>
            <li>I defintely think its a better deal to order the four pack.</li>
            <li>The pack of 4 is a much better deal then getting them at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>:) I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li>If you want more drama and effect go for these, the 105s.</li>
            <li>Prom, ball, dinner, they&#x27;ll work their magic</li>
            <li>i love ardell.  </li>
            <li>A full lash that looks amazing and fab for night life or parties.</li>
            <li>Quick processing, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great deal ...</li>
            <li>In fact, a stranger stopped me to comment that she saw me earlier in the day and thought I had the most beautiful eyelashes she&#x27;d ever seen.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply &amp; have a great natural look.</li>
            <li>But other then that, great price for a pack of 4!</li>
            <li>Easy application and,</li>
            <li>I get compliments on these all the time they&#x27;re really easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>i ONLY wear ardell lashes, easy to apply, great variety of sizes and styles, not \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot; or \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;</li>
            <li>enjoy</li>
            <li>Lashes are cheap....</li>
            <li>Ardell lashes 105 black are the most absolute best lashes!</li>
            <li>I can wear mine many, many times before I have to get new ones.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>These are my every day lashes, so I was so excited to find them in a 4 pack</li>
            <li>I would buy again, they&#x27;re worth it every penny!</li>
            <li>They looked very realistic and were very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy compared too buying them in single sets in the store.</li>
            <li>Great lashes but very long and full.  </li>
            <li>I get asked often if they&#x27;re my real lashes, which I love bc</li>
            <li>In fact, I wore the ones in my photo for a full 48 hours because I couldn&#x27;t bear to remove them.</li>
            <li>What I mean by that, is I peel the strip off the package, then, using my forefinger and thumb, rub the lashes, until they no longer look factory perfect.</li>
            <li>These make your eyelashes transform into beautiful long, full lashes ready to take on the world.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite classic looking eyelashes.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t for super drastic eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>What girl does not want to look beautiful everyday of her life if she can help it?</li>
            <li>All thought these beautiful lashes are long, If put on correctly they look very natural!</li>
            <li>Love these lashes, very natural look.</li>
            <li>These are very natural looking and most people cannot tell they are falsies, or they think they are the hair by hair semipermanent eyelash extensions you can have done at a salon.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>it was not disappointing.</li>
            <li>I love how they look so natural and saves you all the time of putting on mascara on...</li>
            <li>I really like these lashes because they are nice, natural looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Ardell lashes are the most natural looking.  </li>
            <li>and they were just as nice the second time around.</li>
            <li>Get the Ardell waterproof glue to hold these suckers in place and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>Wife loves them and the price us right.</li>
            <li>For my dancing daughters, these were the right thing</li>
            <li>Look almost natural with full makeup!  </li>
            <li>Very affordable and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>so the are really easy to put and the are no heavy at all</li>
            <li>These are long a more natural looking than most.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t believe how pretty they look</li>
            <li>first time eyelash user and</li>
            <li>Came on time and we&#x27;re exactly as ordeeed</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>Exact lashes I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Was introduced to Ardelle last may in a beauty convention in Baltimore and fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyelash to wear whether everyday or for special events!   </li>
            <li>Looks super natural on big brown eyes. :)</li>
            <li>I wanted fake eyelashes for my wedding and originally purchased the 110s but found them to be very nice</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I would order them again when I need some.</li>
            <li>Get them here on Amazon while its cheaper and there is no sales tax and the shipping is free if you order above $25.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re great, the best &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; fake eyelashes there are, really durable and blends well for something that is fake, I use the Duo glue</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real ardell lashes.</li>
            <li>I would so recommend this to my friends and anyone else who wants to order lashes.</li>
            <li>They stay on really well</li>
            <li>and they look real</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for any woman&#x27;s event!</li>
            <li>They are typically $5.00 in the store for a single pack, so this is a great deal for a pack of four...</li>
            <li>IT really becomes an addiction we cannot live without!</li>
            <li>These are my favorite lashes &amp; are actually the only ones I wear!</li>
            <li>Now, Personally, although this one is my favorite, I have gone to a cheaper alternative to the Red Cherry #100, and #87, #76 which is about $2.00 depending on where you get it.</li>
            <li>like drama&lt;br /&gt;but not ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife and she told me they are of high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this style.</li>
            <li>Having naturally long lashes, the 105s are the perfect lashes to make my lashes look thicker (without it looking like I am wearing fake lashes).</li>
            <li>I have found a few brands to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this lashes and I usually buy them at the store for full price but this was such a steal!</li>
            <li>Pretty much the price of only one set in stores.</li>
            <li>As they arrive in the package they are BIG fun.</li>
            <li>When I finally pulled them off they still looked day-one fresh.</li>
            <li>go on nice , do not have to be cut down and really do last</li>
            <li>Very large, very obvious.</li>
            <li>so I always have a new pair at hand.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the 105s as they look much more realistic then some of the other styles.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for very natural looking eyelashes go for the 110.</li>
            <li>They look hot but natural, and I get several uses out of each pair.</li>
            <li>I like mine to be an enhancement of my own long but pale lashes</li>
            <li>Ardell&#x27;s cost half of what the big make up lines do, and look better.</li>
            <li>Evening would be fine, but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li>pull off the glue to get them ready for the next days wear.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going for the natural look choose the 110&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Every time you take your eyelashes off, take the glue off of them gently and place them back in their packaging to retain the shape</li>
            <li>One set was a complete flop.</li>
            <li>They are nice but are super long which makes them look fake.</li>
            <li>I can wear a single pair of lashes for over a month before I have to change them, and most of the time, people want to know how I got such long lashes.</li>
            <li>My wedding photos turned out gorgeous with the extra effect of the dramatic eyelashes.</li>
            <li>These are fun, but they are also much more obvious that you are wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; the lashes attach to is nice and thin and not too obvious.</li>
            <li>you like lashes but not too flashy i highly recommend :))</li>
            <li>I use fake lashes pretty regularly and have tried many kinds, different brands etc.</li>
            <li>THEY DONT TWIST AND ARE NOT FLIMSY LIKE MANY OF THE FALSE LASHES ON THE MARKET TODAY.</li>
            <li>, I wanted to try something a little different and fun.</li>
            <li>The 105 lashes are more dramatic which is the look I tend to go for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, from cheap, to expensive, to how much did you say that costs?</li>
            <li>trick is to mess up the lashes, when I first open the container.</li>
            <li>THESE LASHES LOOK NATURAL AND SEEM TO HOLD UP A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>so I scissor trim the tips just a little bit for variable length and it makes them look daytime glam, very wearable any time, any place.</li>
            <li>I have naturally long thick lashes anyway, and these blend right into my own and give me extra length and definition without looking obviously fake.</li>

            <li> I defintely think its a better deal to order the four pack.</li>
            <li> The pack of 4 is a much better deal then getting them at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> :) I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> If you want more drama and effect go for these, the 105s.</li>
            <li> Prom, ball, dinner, they&#x27;ll work their magic</li>
            <li> i love ardell.  </li>
            <li> A full lash that looks amazing and fab for night life or parties.</li>
            <li> Quick processing, nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a great deal ...</li>
            <li> In fact, a stranger stopped me to comment that she saw me earlier in the day and thought I had the most beautiful eyelashes she&#x27;d ever seen.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply &amp; have a great natural look.</li>
            <li> But other then that, great price for a pack of 4!</li>
            <li> Easy application and,</li>
            <li> I get compliments on these all the time they&#x27;re really easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> i ONLY wear ardell lashes, easy to apply, great variety of sizes and styles, not \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot; or \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;</li>
            <li> enjoy</li>
            <li> Lashes are cheap....</li>
            <li> Ardell lashes 105 black are the most absolute best lashes!</li>
            <li> I can wear mine many, many times before I have to get new ones.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> These are my every day lashes, so I was so excited to find them in a 4 pack</li>
            <li> I would buy again, they&#x27;re worth it every penny!</li>
            <li> They looked very realistic and were very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy compared too buying them in single sets in the store.</li>
            <li> Great lashes but very long and full.  </li>
            <li> I get asked often if they&#x27;re my real lashes, which I love bc</li>
            <li> In fact, I wore the ones in my photo for a full 48 hours because I couldn&#x27;t bear to remove them.</li>
            <li> What I mean by that, is I peel the strip off the package, then, using my forefinger and thumb, rub the lashes, until they no longer look factory perfect.</li>
            <li> These make your eyelashes transform into beautiful long, full lashes ready to take on the world.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite classic looking eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t for super drastic eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> What girl does not want to look beautiful everyday of her life if she can help it?</li>
            <li> All thought these beautiful lashes are long, If put on correctly they look very natural!</li>
            <li> Love these lashes, very natural look.</li>
            <li> These are very natural looking and most people cannot tell they are falsies, or they think they are the hair by hair semipermanent eyelash extensions you can have done at a salon.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> it was not disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love how they look so natural and saves you all the time of putting on mascara on...</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes because they are nice, natural looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Ardell lashes are the most natural looking.  </li>
            <li> and they were just as nice the second time around.</li>
            <li> Get the Ardell waterproof glue to hold these suckers in place and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Wife loves them and the price us right.</li>
            <li> For my dancing daughters, these were the right thing</li>
            <li> Look almost natural with full makeup!  </li>
            <li> Very affordable and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> so the are really easy to put and the are no heavy at all</li>
            <li> These are long a more natural looking than most.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe how pretty they look</li>
            <li> first time eyelash user and</li>
            <li> Came on time and we&#x27;re exactly as ordeeed</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Exact lashes I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to Ardelle last may in a beauty convention in Baltimore and fell in love.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyelash to wear whether everyday or for special events!   </li>
            <li> Looks super natural on big brown eyes. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted fake eyelashes for my wedding and originally purchased the 110s but found them to be very nice</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I would order them again when I need some.</li>
            <li> Get them here on Amazon while its cheaper and there is no sales tax and the shipping is free if you order above $25.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re great, the best &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; fake eyelashes there are, really durable and blends well for something that is fake, I use the Duo glue</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real ardell lashes.</li>
            <li> I would so recommend this to my friends and anyone else who wants to order lashes.</li>
            <li> They stay on really well</li>
            <li> and they look real</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for any woman&#x27;s event!</li>
            <li> They are typically $5.00 in the store for a single pack, so this is a great deal for a pack of four...</li>
            <li> IT really becomes an addiction we cannot live without!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite lashes &amp; are actually the only ones I wear!</li>
            <li> Now, Personally, although this one is my favorite, I have gone to a cheaper alternative to the Red Cherry #100, and #87, #76 which is about $2.00 depending on where you get it.</li>
            <li> like drama&lt;br /&gt;but not ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and she told me they are of high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this style.</li>
            <li> Having naturally long lashes, the 105s are the perfect lashes to make my lashes look thicker (without it looking like I am wearing fake lashes).</li>
            <li> I have found a few brands to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this lashes and I usually buy them at the store for full price but this was such a steal!</li>
            <li> Pretty much the price of only one set in stores.</li>
            <li> As they arrive in the package they are BIG fun.</li>
            <li> When I finally pulled them off they still looked day-one fresh.</li>
            <li> go on nice , do not have to be cut down and really do last</li>
            <li> Very large, very obvious.</li>
            <li> so I always have a new pair at hand.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the 105s as they look much more realistic then some of the other styles.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for very natural looking eyelashes go for the 110.</li>
            <li> They look hot but natural, and I get several uses out of each pair.</li>
            <li> I like mine to be an enhancement of my own long but pale lashes</li>
            <li> Ardell&#x27;s cost half of what the big make up lines do, and look better.</li>
            <li> Evening would be fine, but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> pull off the glue to get them ready for the next days wear.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for the natural look choose the 110&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Every time you take your eyelashes off, take the glue off of them gently and place them back in their packaging to retain the shape</li>
            <li> One set was a complete flop.</li>
            <li> They are nice but are super long which makes them look fake.</li>
            <li> I can wear a single pair of lashes for over a month before I have to change them, and most of the time, people want to know how I got such long lashes.</li>
            <li> My wedding photos turned out gorgeous with the extra effect of the dramatic eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These are fun, but they are also much more obvious that you are wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; the lashes attach to is nice and thin and not too obvious.</li>
            <li> you like lashes but not too flashy i highly recommend :))</li>
            <li> I use fake lashes pretty regularly and have tried many kinds, different brands etc.</li>
            <li> THEY DONT TWIST AND ARE NOT FLIMSY LIKE MANY OF THE FALSE LASHES ON THE MARKET TODAY.</li>
            <li> , I wanted to try something a little different and fun.</li>
            <li> The 105 lashes are more dramatic which is the look I tend to go for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, from cheap, to expensive, to how much did you say that costs?</li>
            <li> trick is to mess up the lashes, when I first open the container.</li>
            <li> THESE LASHES LOOK NATURAL AND SEEM TO HOLD UP A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> so I scissor trim the tips just a little bit for variable length and it makes them look daytime glam, very wearable any time, any place.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long thick lashes anyway, and these blend right into my own and give me extra length and definition without looking obviously fake.</li>
            <li> I really like the length of these lashes, they stay on with the right about of glue and don&#x27;t look overtly fake.</li>
            <li> Added bonus: If you carefully wash these off, comb out with a lash brush (or use the edge of a tweezer to separate) and store in your original container you can reuse them at LEAST a second time, if not a third.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m lucky, they didnt destroy my eyes and vision until I was half way through the tube.</li>
            <li> I gave these a four, only because I think they are to long to wear during the day.  </li>
            <li> , I think that&#x27;s how I get such long use from them!</li>
            <li> So much easier than piling on mascara in the morning and then trying to get it all off at night, takes me less than 30 seconds to put my lashes on each eye, and even less to take them off,  </li>
            <li> although a little long, the product is natural looking.</li>
            <li> They are clearly not natural</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely durable can reuse multiple times.</li>
            <li> They are very long, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d wear them during the day.</li>
            <li> I actually had to cut mine down a bit.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> When I need to dress up as a disney princess or a drag queen, I will wear them.</li>
            <li> , if you need to cut the strip for width the way I do, make sure you cut the base of the strip on the outside where the longest lashes are, and leave the inside with the shorter lashes intact.</li>
            <li> Because these are made from sterilized human hair they don&#x27;t have that glossy look synthetic ones usually do, which means if you nail the placement you can pull them off without any other makeup.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try any other and might not need to.</li>
            <li> I laugh when I see how people put on their false lashes on youtube videos, one day I will make one myself and teach you all the fast secret!!  </li>
            <li> Not too thin &amp; not too thick, they&#x27;re just right.</li>
            <li> a few wears if you are careful</li>
            <li> Took me long enough to realize that false eyelashes give me the result I&#x27;ve always wanted with mascara.</li>
            <li> When I tell them they&#x27;re false, they nearly give me a concussion trying to get a closer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get them less than half price at the store.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of fake eyelashes and wear them regularly.  </li>
            <li> Every time I would end up with swollen, red, hot, painful eyes, could hardly see, and I looked like I was zombie zero in the zombie apocalypse.</li>
            <li> A little savings</li>
            <li> With these I just glue them in place and use my finger to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; the lashes a little for blending, and I&#x27;m set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are my everyday lashes.</li>
            <li> , I change them out every few weeks or month depending on what I am doing, if I cook and forget not to look in the oven, they melt and fuzz up</li>
            <li> I do also like 117, Whispies, Demi Whispies, and have a few holloween styles for when I hand out candy.</li>
            <li> 105 is my everyday style for wear to work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want it to look like I have big false lashes.</li>
            <li> and I wear them everyday!</li>
            <li> not sure what changed.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they suk at making themselves up usually unless they are pros, no????&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually can get my girls to use them 2-3 times before having to throw them out.  </li>
            <li> They were extremely hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent false eyelash user and now i&#x27;m addicted!  </li>
            <li> The lashes I received were extremely of poor quality and were extremely stiff.</li>
            <li> (I have had to use mascara with other fake lashes).</li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with individual and I lost almost all of my lashes</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> There is an art form, and practice is needed to do this without rendering the lashes useless, cause you can destroy the strip if you are too aggressive.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing lashes for approximately 8 years now.</li>
            <li> Been using false eyelashes since I was 16, Im now over 50 and still use them, this 105 has always been my fave</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes about 5 out of 7 days a week.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t have the dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look too fake and everyone compliments me on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Weird....</li>
            <li> My kids are in dance competitions and so they go through fake eyelashes quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> The lash line strip is very thin</li>
            <li> Nope, for whatever crazy reason those became difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I have mad, crazy allergies to mascara.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any :(</li>
            <li> somehow the appearance of the lashes disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> gave me a very bad eye infection .I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price for four pair of lashes, these go about 4-7 at CVS/Target. Quick processing, nice packaging. Can&#x27;t wait to wear them!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love wit this product looks like is your own lashes I just can&#x27;t believe how pretty they look I feel happy wit this for getting a great deal, thanks u!</li>
            <li> Love these lashes, very natural look.</li>
            <li> beautiful lashes. first time eyelash user and it was not disappointing.</li>
            <li> These are my everyday lashes. I get asked often if they&#x27;re my real lashes, which I love bc I don&#x27;t want it to look like I have big false lashes. I also prefer strip lashes vs individual lashes.&lt;br /&gt;These are the best to add volume and length without overdoing it! I can wear mine many, many times before I have to get new ones. I do not use mascara (I don&#x27;t need to with these), I think that&#x27;s how I get such long use from them! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Having naturally long lashes, the 105s are the perfect lashes to make my lashes look thicker (without it looking like I am wearing fake lashes). These are my every day lashes, so I was so excited to find them in a 4 pack (the savings was almost like buy 3 get one free!!)</li>
            <li> great lashes that go on nicely and feel natural</li>
            <li> Wife loves them and the price us right. She&#x27;s been buying them for years.</li>
            <li> Easy application and, although a little long, the product is natural looking.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy compared too buying them in single sets in the store. Shipping was fast and I would order them again when I need some.</li>
            <li> Been using false eyelashes since I was 16, Im now over 50 and still use them, this 105 has always been my fave I buy them by the case, I change them out every few weeks or month depending on what I am doing, if I cook and forget not to look in the oven, they melt and fuzz up LOL.. change them! THEY are perfect no clipping off the sides to make them fit. So much easier than piling on mascara in the morning and then trying to get it all off at night, takes me less than 30 seconds to put my lashes on each eye, and even less to take them off,  pull off the glue to get them ready for the next days wear. I laugh when I see how people put on their false lashes on youtube videos, one day I will make one myself and teach you all the fast secret!!  I taught myself the best way 25 years ago and thats why it takes no time at all.. Does the word pro come to mind? LOL.. yeah this are great, and a great number too.. enjoy</li>
            <li> I wear this brand &amp; style of lashes all the time. They are easy to apply &amp; have a great natural look. They are typically $5.00 in the store for a single pack, so this is a great deal for a pack of four...I plan to make another purchase when needed...</li>
            <li> All thought these beautiful lashes are long, If put on correctly they look very natural! These are my favorite lashes &amp; are actually the only ones I wear!</li>
            <li> Great buy and speedy delivery! These are my favorite classic looking eyelashes. I was so psyched to have found them for so cheap!</li>
            <li> This product is great...in price, looks and wearability. I save like $15, instead feom buying in store. And the quality is very similar.no doubt this is a good nice value product, for a lashes user like me</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  Very natural looking eyelashes.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing lashes for approximately 8 years now. I have found a few brands to be my favorite. I love Ardell and this number #105 is actually my favorite! This is great for everyday wear. NO, if you are an experienced eyelash person and put this on right, it looks amazing! I get compliments all the time from other women about my all so natural eyelashes! This is my favorite eyelash to wear whether everyday or for special events!   IT really becomes an addiction we cannot live without! What girl does not want to look beautiful everyday of her life if she can help it? I know I do! Anywho, I say, get it! Amazon offers a great deal ... this costs between $4 (Walmart/ Target) and $5 nowadays in beauty supply stores like Sally&#x27;s. Get them here on Amazon while its cheaper and there is no sales tax and the shipping is free if you order above $25. Now, Personally, although this one is my favorite, I have gone to a cheaper alternative to the Red Cherry #100, and #87, #76 which is about $2.00 depending on where you get it. A little savings but adds up to be a lot of savings when you wear eyelashes just about 365/year! lol Hope this helps. I do a lot of research to get the best lashes at the best prices.</li>
            <li> For my dancing daughters, these were the right thing and I&#x27;d buy them again. Durable on stage - no issues.</li>
            <li> After wearing the [[ASIN:B003ZS4WJY Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 110 Demi Lashes (Pack of 4)]], I wanted to try something a little different and fun. These are fun, but they are also much more obvious that you are wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes are awesome. Not too thin &amp; not too thick, they&#x27;re just right. The lash line strip is very thin so they&#x27;re easy to apply, these are by far the best Ardell lashes &amp; the price is awesome.</li>
            <li> I order these lashes all the time and they are the perfect length to create a natural look. They always ship quickly and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s a package deal. :)</li>
            <li> These eyelashes broke off at the tips  and fell in my eye .They gave me a very bad eye infection .I do not think these are safe to wear !</li>
            <li> Love!! And at such a great price too!!</li>
            <li> These were perfect for me considering I always use falsies and you save money buying these packs from Amazon.</li>
            <li> great looking lashes , have them on auto ship . go on nice , do not have to be cut down and really do last a few wears if you are careful</li>
            <li> I love this lashes and I usually buy them at the store for full price but this was such a steal!</li>
            <li> It was easier than going to the store and they were availible. Sometime when I go to several stores and I cannot get them because thier stock is out.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the porduct</li>
            <li> Came on time and we&#x27;re exactly as ordeeed</li>
            <li> I like these because they give you drama.  If you&#x27;re going for the natural look choose the 110&#x27;s.  If you&#x27;re going for a night on the town these are great!</li>
            <li> I really like the length of these lashes, they stay on with the right about of glue and don&#x27;t look overtly fake.</li>
            <li> I have the autoship going on so I always have a new pair at hand.  Ardell lashes are good stuff for a department store brand.  This style is my every day wear.  I get them less than half price at the store.  Keep &#x27;em coming Amazon!</li>
            <li> Night or day wear!  I get compliments on these all the time they&#x27;re really easy to put on and take off.  They&#x27;re extremely durable can reuse multiple times.</li>
            <li> THESE LASHES LOOK NATURAL AND SEEM TO HOLD UP A LONG TIME. THEY DONT TWIST AND ARE NOT FLIMSY LIKE MANY OF THE FALSE LASHES ON THE MARKET TODAY.</li>
            <li> gives a good glam look for a night out. They are very long, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d wear them during the day.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re great, the best &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; fake eyelashes there are, really durable and blends well for something that is fake, I use the Duo glue</li>
            <li> I love how they look so natural and saves you all the time of putting on mascara on...&lt;br /&gt;If you like lashes but not too flashy i highly recommend :))</li>
            <li> great lashes cheaper than the MAC but with the MAC eyelashes you can trim to match various eye dimensions would buy again</li>
            <li> i ONLY wear ardell lashes, easy to apply, great variety of sizes and styles, not \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot; or \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;, i am a make up artist and i would reccoment these a million times over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;3</li>
            <li> They are nice but are super long which makes them look fake. I actually had to cut mine down a bit. But other then that, great price for a pack of 4!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes I received were in the Ardell packaging but they were not actual Ardell lashes. The lashes I received were extremely of poor quality and were extremely stiff. They were extremely hard to apply. Do not waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Looks like picture. I&#x27;m pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I loves these eyelashes. They don&#x27;t look too fake and everyone compliments me on my eyelashes. I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Took me long enough to realize that false eyelashes give me the result I&#x27;ve always wanted with mascara. Takes no time at all. And the Ardell line is perfect! The &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; the lashes attach to is nice and thin and not too obvious. With proper care each set can last weeks (and who wouldn&#x27;t want to take proper care, sanitary and otherwise, of an investment of time and money?). The value offered through Amazon is terrific; these same lashes are close to $5 a pair, even at beauty supply stores. Definitely, definitely using Amazon to supply my needs!</li>
            <li> Exact lashes I was looking for. Very affordable and delivery was quick. This is the second time I have purchased these from this vendor and won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes because they are nice, natural looking and you can use them many times if you take care of them...I have them in my cart where they are automatically delivered to me every month!!!!</li>
            <li> Ardell lashes 105 black are the most absolute best lashes! I had a bad experience with individual and I lost almost all of my lashes so my girlfriend who works at. A salon the makeup artist uses them on her clients and so I tried the banned cause I didn&#x27;t have any :( Ps they work great easy to put on and I wear them everyday!</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes about 5 out of 7 days a week. These are very natural looking and most people cannot tell they are falsies, or they think they are the hair by hair semipermanent eyelash extensions you can have done at a salon. This is a great price for these eyelashes. I use a pair for two weeks. Every time you take your eyelashes off, take the glue off of them gently and place them back in their packaging to retain the shape and then you can reuse them.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Las pesta&amp;ntilde;as las puedes usar 2 o mas veces.. Son increibles! Son de muy buena calidadby no tienes necesidad de pintarlas por que parecen naturales.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Ardell lashes for years. I have mad, crazy allergies to mascara. I&#x27;ve tried them all, from cheap, to expensive, to how much did you say that costs? If I&#x27;m lucky, they didnt destroy my eyes and vision until I was half way through the tube. Every time I would end up with swollen, red, hot, painful eyes, could hardly see, and I looked like I was zombie zero in the zombie apocalypse. Not good. My good friend, who has a Rosie Riveter style, wore them all the time, and could put them on in the car. She taught me, and now its second nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ardell style 105 is my favorite, but I do also like 117, Whispies, Demi Whispies, and have a few holloween styles for when I hand out candy. Ardell&#x27;s cost half of what the big make up lines do, and look better. I can wear a single pair of lashes for over a month before I have to change them, and most of the time, people want to know how I got such long lashes. When I tell them they&#x27;re false, they nearly give me a concussion trying to get a closer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My trick is to mess up the lashes, when I first open the container. What I mean by that, is I peel the strip off the package, then, using my forefinger and thumb, rub the lashes, until they no longer look factory perfect. There is an art form, and practice is needed to do this without rendering the lashes useless, cause you can destroy the strip if you are too aggressive. The idea is to \\&quot;tease\\&quot; them, so it looks as if you are wearing no mascara at all, and since I am so allergic to mascara, I cant wear it. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great lashes but very long and full.  They are clearly not natural but I don&#x27;t care.  I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I gave these a four, only because I think they are to long to wear during the day.  Evening would be fine, but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I get for buying lashes online. When I need to dress up as a disney princess or a drag queen, I will wear them. Very large, very obvious.</li>
            <li> quick deliver great price and quality</li>
            <li> This Eyelashes are the best the are human hair so the are really easy to put and the are no heavy at all</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and she told me they are of high quality.</li>
            <li> Delivery is always on time and great quality</li>
            <li> I thought I found it with corner only lashes. Nope, for whatever crazy reason those became difficult to apply. Weird.... not sure what changed.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I like drama&lt;br /&gt;but not ridiculous.  These are that: glam but not like you know, tranny looking.  ahhhh,  Seriously... they suk at making themselves up usually unless they are pros, no????&lt;br /&gt;Buy these</li>
            <li> Needed for a dance competition. Excellent</li>
            <li> I use fake lashes pretty regularly and have tried many kinds, different brands etc. I like these best. They look hot but natural, and I get several uses out of each pair. These are made with real human hair and the placement is excellent. I have naturally long thick lashes anyway, and these blend right into my own and give me extra length and definition without looking obviously fake. I don&#x27;t even need mascara to make these blend with my lashes (I have had to use mascara with other fake lashes). With these I just glue them in place and use my finger to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; the lashes a little for blending, and I&#x27;m set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, if you need to cut the strip for width the way I do, make sure you cut the base of the strip on the outside where the longest lashes are, and leave the inside with the shorter lashes intact.</li>
            <li> LOVE it, came on time and they&#x27;re beautiful! I would buy again, they&#x27;re worth it every penny! Looks super natural on big brown eyes. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 5 years and I know for a fact that they switched the lashes! It&#x27;s not the real ardell lashes.</li>
            <li> I fell in Love with 105&#x27;s from the start! Ardell lashes are just undoubtably fabulous! They are like feather weight... so if applied correctly.. you won&#x27;t feel them at all. I just recently tried the 117&#x27;s (actually I&#x27;m wearing them now)  and they are really nice as well..  I use to wear 105&#x27;s every day until I tried 117&#x27;s.. They&#x27;re similar..105 are just a touch longer and are definitely my go to lashes!</li>
            <li> I love Ardell lashes!  These can be worn daily or a night out of town!  They aren&#x27;t for super drastic eyelashes.  Definitely will be buying these again!</li>
            <li> Lashes are cheap.... I can&#x27;t get them stay on. They will hold no longer then 1hr. Bought the glue as well and these items both suck.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a bit longer than i was used to</li>
            <li> Love these lashes!  Look almost natural with full makeup!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Applying lashes defintely takes alot of patience and practice. So I been ordering the four pack because with Ardell lashes these are resuseable. The 105 lashes are more dramatic which is the look I tend to go for. I defintely think its a better deal to order the four pack. I would so recommend this to my friends and anyone else who wants to order lashes.</li>
            <li> My kids are in dance competitions and so they go through fake eyelashes quite a bit.  The pack of 4 is a much better deal then getting them at the drug store.  Ardell lashes are very easy to apply.  I especially like the 105s as they look much more realistic then some of the other styles.  My kids are very fair skin and the thicker, darker lashes do not look as good.  I feel 105s are easier to apply than the 101s as they are easier to shape to the eyelid. I usually can get my girls to use them 2-3 times before having to throw them out.  I highly recommend this style.</li>
            <li> i love Ardell Lashes! These are long a more natural looking than most.</li>
            <li> Best Lashes ever!  They stay on really well and they look real:) I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I wanted fake eyelashes for my wedding and originally purchased the 110s but found them to be very nice but they didn&#x27;t have the dramatic effect. A friend recommended these and they were PERFECT for my wedding. They looked very realistic and were very comfortable. My wedding photos turned out gorgeous with the extra effect of the dramatic eyelashes. If you are looking for very natural looking eyelashes go for the 110. If you want more drama and effect go for these, the 105s.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dance competition</li>
            <li> This was a great price! Pretty much the price of only one set in stores. These make your eyelashes transform into beautiful long, full lashes ready to take on the world. I highly recommend for any woman&#x27;s event! Prom, ball, dinner, they&#x27;ll work their magic</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of fake eyelashes and wear them regularly.  I&#x27;ve found that Ardell lashes are the most natural looking.  I have them in different lengths and thicknesses.  Get the Ardell waterproof glue to hold these suckers in place and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality on this product, but somehow the appearance of the lashes disappointed me.  They are, however, very comfortable to wear and durable too.</li>
            <li> The majority of them came alright. One set was a complete flop.</li>
            <li> As they arrive in the package they are BIG fun. A full lash that looks amazing and fab for night life or parties. I like mine to be an enhancement of my own long but pale lashes so I scissor trim the tips just a little bit for variable length and it makes them look daytime glam, very wearable any time, any place. Because these are made from sterilized human hair they don&#x27;t have that glossy look synthetic ones usually do, which means if you nail the placement you can pull them off without any other makeup. Added bonus: If you carefully wash these off, comb out with a lash brush (or use the edge of a tweezer to separate) and store in your original container you can reuse them at LEAST a second time, if not a third. I made the mistake of not combing them out after a wash and they were too clumpy to wear a second time. The next set I treated them properly and they were just as nice the second time around. In fact, a stranger stopped me to comment that she saw me earlier in the day and thought I had the most beautiful eyelashes she&#x27;d ever seen. She had no idea they weren&#x27;t real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with Darkness adhesive - excellent stuff - these lashes don&#x27;t budge a bit. In fact, I wore the ones in my photo for a full 48 hours because I couldn&#x27;t bear to remove them. When I finally pulled them off they still looked day-one fresh.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for High school show choirs.  A definite must have!&lt;br /&gt;Buy for teams of 20 girls and save.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to Ardelle last may in a beauty convention in Baltimore and fell in love. The look the quality and the price are AMAZING. I have yet to try any other and might not need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent false eyelash user and now i&#x27;m addicted!  i love ardell.  105 is my everyday style for wear to work.</li>
            <li> Great price in a 4 pack which is well needed for all the dance competitions, dress rehearsal and recital season!  I haven&#x27;t been able to find more than a 2 or 3 pack in stores of these particular lashes so this is perfect!</li>
