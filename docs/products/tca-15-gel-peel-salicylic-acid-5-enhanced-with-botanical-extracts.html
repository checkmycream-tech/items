    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I purchased this peel after trying out Perfect Image&#x27;s 50% Lactic Acid Peel because I wanted to try something stronger.</li>
            <li>the bottle for best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome peel.</li>
            <li>One of the best i&#x27;ve ever used, takes about 4-5 days for peeling to start, stay inside while it happens</li>
            <li>Within about a week my face had fully shedded &amp; man was I impressed!</li>
            <li>But the best advice was apply, rinse with water, then reapply.  </li>
            <li>I use a fan brush to apply it and it  goes on perfectly evenly.  </li>
            <li>Excellent .i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>This peel is great!  </li>
            <li>It turn out to be perfect concentration for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m overly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>so I decided accutane was my best solution.</li>
            <li>How awesome to pay a fraction of the price I was paying at the skin clinic!  </li>
            <li>seem to be working perfectly.</li>
            <li>The product is great!</li>
            <li>15% TCA is a perfect balance between effectiveness and tolerance, no downtime, once per week regimen.</li>
            <li>They have I think 3-5% lactic acid and work great!</li>
            <li>These three issues work together to create a perfect environment for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the directions perfectly and got no</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the instructions and product.</li>
            <li>It works great!  </li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t seem to be the best at delivering an even gel layer across the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Before I purchased the TCA product from Perfect Image</li>

            <li>The cleanser is awesome too.</li>
            <li>No matter the Perfect Image peel you purchase, you will notice a visible difference.</li>
            <li>It does a great job doing that!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to do what I did, I have no idea about the best use of this product, so please don&#x27;t consider me as a guide at all.</li>
            <li>Perfect for beginners (like me).</li>

            <li>The best thing about this product, is you can use it all over your face or as more of a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Thank you Perfect Image :)</li>
            <li>I was very impressed to see how many 5 stars and good things were said about it.</li>
            <li>I then decided to stick on the peels from \\&quot;Perfect Image LCC\\&quot; as I believe this manufactory provides the best quality peels with incorporating natural plant extracts or organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>the palm of my hands, surprisingly, started to peel after three days which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>It tightens your skin and gives it a good finish.</li>
            <li>I noticed fairly immediate results with this product.</li>
            <li>My face is on its good days.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the effects after continued use will be as good as I had hoped when I bought this.</li>
            <li>This product is good for maintaining acne</li>
            <li>This is a good quality product.</li>
            <li>It has minimized my pores and exfoliated my skin giving me a flawless smooth look.</li>
            <li>and i think it is alsmost as good as the professioinal peeling product i get at a spa, however, i have noticed changes in consistency of the product after 1 year..</li>
            <li>There is a lot in the bottle (about 20 peels) and it is a good value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be a good once-a-week peel.</li>
            <li>Peeling lasts 2-3 days and can be minimized with a good moisture cream.</li>
            <li>Short-pants and skirt look good on me</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;ve really good result.</li>
            <li>Loved the feel after using the product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to start with if you use peel products.  </li>
            <li>I have done the PTR peel pads and loved them, but felt like I needed to move it up a notch to get my skin where I want it to be.  </li>
            <li>I had used a TCA peel of 25%, and although it did not sting, I was too skittish to leave it on my face longer than 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>but none are as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li>So, background: 18, fair, oily &amp; sensitive-skinned, severe cystic acne since eleven.</li>
            <li>try this and get a good discount as well</li>
            <li>This product is effective and works great on hyperpigmentation as described.</li>
            <li>That helped a lot for my face, and I had a good peeling</li>
            <li>I felt good.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see any good affect for peeling, just redness.</li>
            <li>Here the gel affected good because I applied with that brush, and it delivered the gel everywhere with good amount.</li>
            <li>is that using good applicator, we can still get good results with this strength too.</li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>If you do follow the directions closely it is a good peel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Very effective, much better than Skin Labratory products.  </li>
            <li>i will repurchase this one again for sure!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>be sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li>you have patience and realize that this is a process, not a one time fix all, then you will love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin beautiful and smooth</li>
            <li>I am very experienced with glycolic peels and this is my first experience with this peel.  </li>
            <li>I wish Perfect Image would offer a higher TCA peel like 20%.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the TCA for the first time, and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Skin never looked better!</li>
            <li>i love this product!</li>
            <li>First of all, the consistency of the peel solution is perfect.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very mild product, this will be great for you.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product and I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>It also works great with mild acne scars but be patient!  </li>
            <li>This certainly makes the TCA Gel Peel the perfect choice for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to ordering more of perfect Image products in the future, and very good prices.</li>
            <li>It is a great light peel that can also be used for spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions, and in 4-6 weeks your skin will look amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing result.</li>
            <li>I think these are great results for a light TCA peel.</li>
            <li>This product works amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it did nothing.  </li>
            <li>It had all the instructional steps laid out nicely on the insert card.  </li>
            <li>plan to continue to use this product, and would recommend it to anyone who like me, really wants to experience excellent results, without the added expense of a salon visit.</li>
            <li>I have to try this over time to know how effective it will be.</li>
            <li>any kind of peel.</li>
            <li>I tried the 100% salicylic by Perfert Image and really liked it</li>
            <li>I honestly would recommend this product even though it did not solve my problem.</li>
            <li>My face felt nice and tighter, I wore make up and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that was alos veru nice</li>
            <li>It works just as effective and it costs 3 times less!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice level 2 peel.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try my own, having seen the process and knowing what to expect.</li>
            <li>i ordered this for my mother in law for christmas because she liked the 20% salicylic acid peel that i had.  </li>
            <li>I also bought a brush with it which is really nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>excellent product and highly recommend for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>Results were good and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about my experience with The Perfect Image&#x27;s peels.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying this product again, I love it! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It just keeps getting better and better!</li>
            <li>you do it correctly, the result can be very good, and much cheaper than going to the spa.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product line, and keep up the good work :-)</li>
            <li>but I can tell my skin is much more refined now and has a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li>I had perfect skin in my teens, but when I turned 27 I had frequent breakouts (almost like blisters at times) and areas of dryness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use for a beginner and does the job!  </li>
            <li>did a lot of research on at home peels before I purchased this product, and this is the perfect peel if you&#x27;re looking for RESULTS with NO DOWN</li>
            <li>Great advice from poster who indicated that she applys alchol first to degrease as intructions state.  </li>
            <li>The first three times I used this, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous trying a TCA 12% peel for the first time, but this product was great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great peel for beginners and is working really well on my acne scars!</li>
            <li>It felt good, it was cool and it comforted my skin.</li>
            <li>Just very light peel for me&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the first time, I feel confident and proud of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying this product doesn&#x27;t work, and would suggest that beginners start here for sure.</li>
            <li>I just want to give a heads up to people who may be stepping up from lower level peels and want more visible results.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent facial peel!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this peel.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>I have to say upfront that I did ViPeel 3 weeks ago, and have been taking care of my skin with a lot of love and care.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li>This peel is quite intense but works great on my acne prone oily skin.</li>
            <li>One reviewer mentioned using the product for 10 minutes, washing it off, then repeating the process two more times.  </li>
            <li>so I add more layer</li>
            <li>Beta hydroxy acid is better used on oily skin with blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li>I have used all the peels in the perfect image line, and after trying all different companies, I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had TCA peels at dermatologists&#x27; offices for many years, so knew what to expect.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite peel.</li>
            <li>For more help with using TCA read reviews at RealSelf.com.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Ive been able to do the peel on a Saturday and go to university without having to worry about my skin flaking off during the day.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>See results the more you use (once a week).  </li>
            <li>I believe it will work better.</li>
            <li>I washed my face and got most the peeling skin from my nose</li>
            <li>maybe it will work better for her. :)</li>
            <li>I love this peel</li>
            <li>, i guess it is time to reorder : )</li>
            <li>Used with caution, this is a much better result than any over-the-counter product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a lighter option from Perfect Image for future use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Might just be the best personal product I have ever purchased, that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li>I simply love this product.</li>
            <li>It did burn a bit, mostly when I was washing it off.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t stop feeling it!! :)</li>
            <li>I had to order one that was more percentage</li>
            <li>The most troublesome aspect is blackheads....</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow directions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m fair skinned, I rarely have any problems with skin creams, cleansers, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the co. is worried about a lawsuit.</li>
            <li>According to statistics, most love the product.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope you print my review.</li>
            <li>According to statistics, most love the product.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope you print my review.</li>
            <li>i am very happy with this product and looking forward to using the next stronger peel.</li>
            <li>That said, I did read and re-read directions, as well as, many reviews on Amazon before taking the plunge.  </li>
            <li>I know there will be more peeling.</li>
            <li>I will probably use this strength once more and then move to a stronger peel.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite peel.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>But most of the flakes will be gone in time for work on Monday.</li>
            <li>Most of them are gone.</li>
            <li>I love that it worked because paying $225 to $19</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to do these on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li>and I love how my hands look and feel.</li>
            <li>Love showing off my hands now.</li>
            <li>Those are more like scrubbing and make skin</li>
            <li>Most sun spots are gone and the lest is lighter.  </li>
            <li>See more on this 12% TCA Peel</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to go out of your house for 7 to 10 days while your skin peels like a cracking leather belt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to use it more to find out if it lightens my face.</li>
            <li>It feels tighter, cleaner, my complexion became lighter and more even.</li>
            <li>, I love the ease of using the dropper to put drops on cotton ball ..</li>
            <li>I bought this one with the intention of purchasing more if it went well</li>
            <li>Their peels seem to be safer than others I have tried because of the gel like nature instead of the more watery products out there.</li>
            <li>A for sure must get.</li>
            <li>and my skin already looked better and the acnes were GONE.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>And now I tried these products, and I feel much better with my face.</li>
            <li>By the way I also bought one more thing, \\&quot;MD</li>
            <li>During the shower I also try to massage my face, kind of exfoliating too, so lightly without hurting it.</li>
            <li>I found this product while searching and completely enjoyed the quality and effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to wear makeup every day except on day 4 when the peeling was noticeable (like whenyou peel after a sunburn) - my foundation and cover up just made the peeling stand out more.</li>
            <li>Does what it says!! :)</li>
            <li>Skin is soo smooth!</li>
            <li>Love this peel.</li>
            <li>I mostly used it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>If anyone has recommendations I would love to hear them.ook for something stronger.</li>
            <li>If anyone has recommendations I would love to hear them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have been better off to stay with retinol purchased in the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>It has been two weeks since I administered my third peel, and I am very happy with my results.</li>
            <li>My acne scars also seem to have improved, and the skin tone is much more even.</li>
            <li>I love how the product works.</li>
            <li>sunspots are almost gone, and I&#x27;ve tryed many Brands with no Result</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t thank Perfect Image enough for their customer service and qualify products.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have some lines on my face, and they are getting better as well.  </li>
            <li>for the heck of it i am going to do 1 more treatment in about 10 days</li>
            <li>, i am SO GLAD i did not listen.</li>
            <li>After 4 months of using this product my face has never looked better and I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>The acne scars are 70% improved and most of the marks have gone.  </li>
            <li>I have some sun spots on my back and will try Lactic Acid by Perfect Image.</li>
            <li>It seems to target the more pigmented areas</li>
            <li>but this one worked a lot better.</li>
            <li>I realize that each person&#x27;s skin might respond differently to these solutions, so go with what you feel is best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll be going back for more Perfect Image products vs a couple of others.</li>
            <li>the Glycolic seemed to do a much better job of that for me when I used that.</li>
            <li>The Glycolic I also purchased from Perfect image last year</li>
            <li>After having tried some of the other peels from Perfect Image (I liked them all) - this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>You can repeat the process every week or so as it is not very harsh and it is good because it has the salicylic acid which is good for acne.</li>
            <li>It is gentle but very effective.</li>
            <li>I smiled at me in the mirror, my smile makes wrinkles all over my face!  </li>
            <li>Very detailed instructions included and product was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I normally get my peels done at a Doctors office and they work great.</li>
            <li>so you will be able to use the product and get the most benefit out of it, its a professional grade product with great results.</li>
            <li>My skin is becoming more even toned and the freckles are fading.  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as described, good price, no complaints.</li>
            <li>more like a strong astringent then a peel.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quick and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced an actual peel or any peeling yet, but my pores and skin tone looked nice when I woke up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>product really needs to include an \\&quot;applicator\\&quot; for applying the gel evenly across the skin (instead of leaving users to themselves to try to figure out what to use as an \\&quot;applicator\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems like a good product to prepare your skin for a 20% TCA peel, if you&#x27;re not in a hurry for the immediate results of a 20% TCA peel which I would think would cause a good sun tan like peeling on the first try.</li>
            <li>It keeps the pores more refined, tightens things up a bit and helps with the fine lines.</li>
            <li>My Dermatologist had recommended this product to me and so far I am very pleased with it!  </li>
            <li>and I haveto use it more to get rid of them, but I am still happy; because first time I actually felt I got some kind of result from a product; this really made me happy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this worked great for me.</li>
            <li>So far its been a great product.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks and feels smooth and more even textured.  </li>
            <li>This helps the skin stay supple and protected from cracks or tears in the peeling layer until its good and ready to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely read the directions and test first, but it&#x27;s a great product and the company has good shipping and packaging</li>
            <li>Their products are top quality, customer service is great, products are relatively inexpensive...</li>
            <li>Was easy to apply no severe sensation or anything.</li>
            <li>This is very mild.</li>
            <li>However, my battle with acne was not so easily won.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for an overall, healthy glow and to freshen up your skin.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you clean your face and use astringent before peel.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to manage and control.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects on my skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is really strong, and ive been using some really strong stuff on my face.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but it is strong--you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>since it was 20% Salicylic peel; it was strong for under eyes.</li>
            <li>irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have discovered chemical peels that I can do at home and then to see so quickly that the Perfect Image TCA peel actually works.  </li>
            <li>So if you are dark skinned this 15% is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The second time, I did the alcohol cleanse, removing all traces of oil on the skin and the results were beautifully even...</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any down time, which I have generally experienced with higher strength peels.  </li>
            <li>I used the Glycolic previously but this TCA is the best!  </li>
            <li>Follow the package directions, and watch the fine lines and brown spots disappear over time.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied, I used perfect image&#x27;s \\&quot;Salicylic Gel Peel + Salicylic Deep Gel Cleanser\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I heard that 12% TCA would be fine for the eyes.</li>
            <li>Additionally, my skin seems clearer, softer with reduced fine lines.  </li>
            <li>This product is formulated specifically to help reduce wrinkles, fine lines, acne, scars, and reverse the visible signs of aging on YOUR FACE.  </li>
            <li>where strong enough to get a great \\&quot;Light\\&quot; skin peel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol now I just add a little to my face mask, because it did make my skin look nice even though it didnt peel.</li>
            <li>It turned to be a huge purple patch after one hour.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in how my skin looked and felt.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see huge improvements yet</li>
            <li>I used this as maintenance for acne and some light wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Had no problems, only great results.  </li>
            <li>If you are doing the peel specifically for acne, I have had better success with Salicylic peels.</li>
            <li>You do peel lightly</li>
            <li>but the result is even tone smooth</li>
            <li>few weeks ago I started a peel regimen with Perfect Image TCA 12% Gel Peel and after just two weeks, I was already seeing improvements.</li>
            <li>I just use it to lightly shed the outer layer of my skin.</li>
            <li>Great price, especially when compared to salon treatments.</li>
            <li>Gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the TCA peel from Perfect Image for a few months now</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, very well made and priced.</li>
            <li>However; with regular use, it could be a great maintenance program.</li>
            <li>Use a light moisturizer after peel&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took accutane about a year ago and still have some light scarring on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>bought this product after reading the reviews to help fade my acne scars (which are smooth and discolored, not pitted or raised).</li>
            <li>do I get some light tingling/burning.  </li>
            <li>I am on my 2nd Peel and the results have been great.  </li>
            <li>I like to apply fresh aloe vera from my backyard as a mask to better my results.  </li>
            <li>While doing so, I realized that smooth and even toned skin is what contributes youthful look.</li>
            <li>I was comfortable to keep layering and extended time to 30 min.  </li>
            <li>15% TCA is definitely what I would call a great \\&quot;Light\\</li>
            <li>It produced a light peel which I never got wth the stronger Skin Labs product.  </li>
            <li>After the peeling was done, skin was smooth but the acne scars remain.</li>
            <li>And this has worked great for the last 2 months.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this is my error, but at any rate, this product did not deliver the results it promises, no matter how open-minded</li>
            <li>And with Amazon Prime I got this product in two days with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is important for the skin to have time to heal in between each peel.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.  </li>
            <li>Peel worked well to help smooth lines and tighten skin.</li>
            <li>I tried light laser peels, retinol creams and did acne facials</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll try more layers next time, because I don&#x27;t want to throw out a perfectly good bottle of product.</li>
            <li>directions are very clear and the price is very fair and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I find this to be far superior.</li>
            <li>I am 33 years old, with fair skin.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to make sure I was doing right.</li>
            <li>Read the other reviews for great pointers on how to use for the most benefit.</li>
            <li>boyfriend also tried it (he has never done a peel before) and said his skin felt very fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this particular product is the VERY thorough instructions that came with the solution.  </li>
            <li>Although it left a new brown spot,I am very happy.  </li>
            <li>i will say i like this tca peel better than the first brand i purchased.</li>
            <li>is my experience with TCA 12% at home: I DID not do a patch test, for I am familiar with the peel.</li>
            <li>This product allows me to do lighter (but still very beneficial) more frequent peels than just a once-a-year deeper peel with a good 7-10 days of downtime.  </li>
            <li>I felt more of a burn and decided to not do anymore layers because this is my first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth 5 CENTS!</li>
            <li>I do recommend following the directions that come with the bottle to make sure you are getting the best level of peel possible with out damaging your skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a great review about this product and have been thinking about doing the peel myself for a long time.</li>
            <li>There was significant burning this time.</li>
            <li>Having said that, you don&#x27;t have to keep this on long to see great results.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I followed the directions to the T and even my oblivious husband noticed how smooth my skin was!</li>
            <li>You will need to use this peel about 2-3 times, a month apart, to notice significant difference</li>
            <li>I first must say this company is outstanding in may ways.</li>
            <li>Top of the line product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I am excited to use this product, and am planning to do a peel every one to two months.</li>
            <li>I did have some mild flaking and my face looked brighter afterwards, but my hyperpigmentation and fine lines have not improved at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m moving up to the higher percentage and am hoping to see more results.</li>
            <li>But after 4-5 days I can feel the peel and my skin is super smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I had gone to skin clique and had a professional done it on my face with a strong amount, it might have been much better, but I am ok with that strength right now, because it hurts me so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gentler or milder tca peel since with previous experience, have found that higher percentages are not always best in improving my skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>Recommended to anyone who wants to have clean skin free of sebum!</li>
            <li>I really want to get my beautiful skin back to the look before it got suffered from sun damage and</li>
            <li>BUT OMG WHAT A DIFFERENCE to my face, acne pretty much cleared up and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>I would not suggest anyone putting this on or around their eye unless they are experienced and extremely careful.  </li>
            <li>I had really great results with skin smoothness and pore size reduction from this product and minimal skin</li>
            <li>I decided I needed something a bit more intensive to help with my acne scarring, because while I like those, they weren&#x27;t helping much with the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Then after 3 minutes I spread the peel all over my face with a synthetic fan brush, and let it sit for another 2-3 min before rinsing thoroughly with cool water.  </li>
            <li>I wait 30  minutes, wash it off and do the whole thing two more times.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t believe the value is here in a product that we are supposed to use liberally if the bottle isn&#x27;t even full.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with acne and sensitive skin for years and now age is catching up to me.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s fair to add my personal opinion to the product review.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s fair to add my personal opinion to the product review.</li>
            <li>that don&#x27;t fall off naturally on their own.</li>
            <li>it is a good starting point for do it at home peels.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>More gentle than the non-gel TCA peels.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to leave it on longer over time so you can get the full effect.</li>
            <li>Use lots of cool water to get it all off.</li>
            <li>The price is also not bad.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good mild peel that does result in skin improvement after a month or two of weekly use.</li>
            <li>, I strongly suggest you start with lower strength peels if its your first time.</li>
            <li>I decided to try an at home chemical peel after having experienced a increase in hyperpigmentation due to acne.  </li>
            <li>The first night I did a patch test; my skin tolerated it just fine.</li>
            <li>Well, I first started with the Glycolic peel at 30% and did fine for a month or two, but wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted.  </li>
            <li>planed to start from mild peel</li>
            <li>After the peeling process, I noticed my skin was actually more clear and smooth than before I had started.  </li>
            <li>This product has helped my skin tremendously</li>
            <li>use mild cleanser.</li>
            <li>For me, even w/ a deeper peel, the best effects rally last only a month or so, so finding this product has saved me LOTS of money and helped me keep up my aging skin.</li>
            <li>THat made a tremendous difference for me.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Wash face with a mild cleanser, I use Clinque or Neutrogena in the bar</li>
            <li>This would be excellent use on African American skin like myself.</li>
            <li>After three uses, I definitely see hyperpigmentation fading and expect it to get better after more uses.</li>
            <li>I had mild burning at my forehead line.</li>
            <li>Mild Peeling began in about four days and my freckles were some lighter.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne with congrsted pores and sebacious filaments.</li>
            <li>Follow with good moisturizer (I also recommend 100% hyaluronic acid, also available from Amazon) and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING.</li>
            <li>I have had mild peels in the dermatologist&#x27;s office, so I know what to expect from them.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this over the more pricey brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is the very first time for me to use chemical peel.  </li>
            <li>For someone like me that has spent so much money on spa treatments and has never seen any results from them, it does sound almost too good to be true that I could spend $30 on this product and have several treatments showing significant results, but it is true!nd has never seen any results from them, it does sound almost too good to be true that I could spend $30 on this product and have several treatments showing significant results, but it is true!</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I took precaution with this new product.</li>
            <li>the new layers were firmer, tighter, clearer and so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced slight peel, and it has completed.</li>
            <li>The results ended up showing as some flaking and slight peeling which I wasnt too happy with.</li>
            <li>Day 7 - clean skin, but most importantly MY 2 BROWN SPOTS on my left side are 90% GONE!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please DON&#x27;T rush with higher percentage of TCA peel, be sure your skin is ready for this.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a good first try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m being very cautious with it, though, as it is extremely strong.</li>
            <li>I see here that others have suggested their own variations on the directions, but thus far I have followed them exactly.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it only took about 5 mins within application but the results were good both times.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly as promised, with a gentle formula, a great smell and a low price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I started with 12% because any higher and I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to use it as regularly as I have been.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be a cowboy; read the directions and be cautious if it&#x27;s your first peel!  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I have gotten my face under control and use the acid peels to keep my fresh looking fresh and get rid of any lingering scars.</li>
            <li>, I applied Step 2 neutrizer of MD Skin Care Alpha Bata Peel, then DMAE-Alpha Lipoic C-Ester Creme that I ordered with this peel, Strivectin, Neurtogena Pure &amp; Free Liquid Sunblack SPF 50 at the end.  </li>
            <li>Works amazingly and is not as strong as my other peel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It really didnt make any noticiable difference with my face, BUT it did make my skin smooth</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; just some really light flaking here and there--mostly around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Success.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a more gentle peel.</li>
            <li>After reading various product reviews, I decided to try the TCA 12% Gel Peel, because I liked what people had to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smile lines were</li>
            <li>and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>After almost three weeks of using the product the scar has faded quite a bit, and I expect the scar to be almost completely gone after a couple of more weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li>This Glycolic Acid Peel has really helped to clear up my face and give it a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the most potent benzoyl cream as well as tea tree oil, the combination worked amazingly well for a long time, not sure if it was exactly healthy on my skin but got rid of all breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is really powerful, it will make you peel.</li>
            <li>The results are far better than my glycolic and salicylic acid treatments combined.</li>
            <li>I got this for a nice facial peel.</li>
            <li>This peel is worth trying out.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve done two Lactic Acid peels and its been ok.</li>
            <li>It is actually gentler and more comfortable than the peels I&#x27;ve had my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>however it is worth it if you have the time.</li>
            <li>Torturing myself with face burn was not my idea of fun.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>For my own use I leave one layer on for 5-7 minutes and then add a second.</li>
            <li>Finally have time to order the TCA peel, at first wasn&#x27;t sure how strong I should go with</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say that this is the best peel I have ever used since my entire face ended up peeling whereas other peels have only managed to make parts of my face peel.  </li>
            <li>This product,although much less percentage than you can get with an office visit does a remarkable job with age spots caused from sun damage.</li>
            <li>I chose this 12% TCA peel after doing some research, because I was scared to go right for the 25% and take the risk of my face falling off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try another brand, because this item right here didn&#x27;t do what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it off and noticed right away my skin felt tighter, and it was alot smoother.</li>
            <li>Probably, it is just not the right concentration for me.</li>
            <li>The skin peeling is still pretty light, and the skin flaking/peeling thickness is about the thickness of a see through piece of paper (very thin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I have had many professional peels and microderms completed at spas</li>
            <li>For the first couple of days after the peel my skin is pretty pinkish/red and tight, and a great moisturizer is a must.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far but saw a nice difference in the reduction of the redness in old acne scars and it tightened up my face nicely.</li>
            <li>have very large pores in my &amp;#34;T-Zone&amp;#34; that continuously get clogged.  </li>
            <li>When I finally decided to try TCA 12%, it was after trying mild Glycolic and Lactic products that provided &#x27;ok&#x27; results.  </li>
            <li>Unlike my glycolic and salicylic peels which only caused light shedding, the TCA peel caused my whole face to peel within days and was more affective towards removing scars and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Just follow the very complete directions included and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>The dropper was also ballooned out and full of air, looking like it was suffering from some strange pressure situations or that it wasn&#x27;t in top form.  </li>
            <li>my skin was just fresher looking, the tone much more even, and it seemed to respond to my nightly cleanse and products so much more with the dead skin cells removed.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for treatment of mild breakouts or those just looking for a fresher &amp; smoother look.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind these treatments work but be sure to follow directions word for word , they are a little more potent than your standard otc products.</li>
            <li>TCA does not make my face turn red the way lactic acid does, and peels evenly revealing a very smooth surface underneath.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and did not sting.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sting or burn my face but still left it feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>It left my skin very smooth and hydrated after 6 days.</li>
            <li>but mine is somewhat sensitive and does fine with it.</li>
            <li>Rinse face thoroughly with cool water (pay particular attention to the hairline.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to wait to do whole face till fall as where I live I am under strong sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said she wanted this exact product, and I assume she has used this, and likes it.</li>
            <li>I am going to bump up to a higher concentration level.</li>
            <li>Just remember to follow directions exactly, and try a test patch first.</li>
            <li>absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li>The skin was flaking a couple days after the first use</li>
            <li>all, I am really satisfied with this product and will keep using this strength in the future.</li>
            <li>I will purchase again but wil probaly use a higher acid level.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to use a higher percentage acid.</li>
            <li>This was my first time</li>
            <li>First I thought it was a dud seeing as tho</li>
            <li>Wish I could use as a daily treatment, but to be safe</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it has only a rubber dropper on top which you can see in the pic.</li>
            <li>the price of this whole bottle!</li>
            <li>I also cleanse first with tea tree oil, and sylistic acid pads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not the first time and my results were a bit spotty.  </li>
            <li>I used it the first night it came in the mail.</li>
            <li>I read and followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Just because everyone seems to file a lawsuit over anything (person who sued McDonalds because her coffee was too hot or they made some kids fat comes to mind.)</li>
            <li>Just because everyone seems to file a lawsuit over anything (person who sued McDonalds because her coffee was too hot or they made some kids fat comes to mind.)</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>The results were non evident.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that I was not uncomfortable at all during this peel process</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be as hot as it was</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this again :)</li>
            <li>I have since been able to afford health insurance and my dermatologist prescribed topical tretinoin.</li>
            <li>I do love doing peels regularly.</li>
            <li>I chose 12% because it is the first time for me to use chemical peel and having no time to hiding at home for a week.  </li>
            <li>day: I have done it twice more while using md skincare daily peel to remove skin faster every day.</li>
            <li>This is better than say starting with your forehead (because then your forehead has the longest contact time).</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first peel</li>
            <li>It works better, and faster than a lightening cream I purchased just recently as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but you will see changes after the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed not to suffer of a big acne problem like most people I see</li>
            <li>My face looks so much better after only one application!</li>
            <li>For reference, I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s with light skin and considerable sun damage from my youth.</li>
            <li>I have used home peels before, and have gotten much better results with the HQ peel (instant tightening, some peeling, fewer blackheads).</li>
            <li>Well this was my first time</li>
            <li>And it just turned out red and nothing more; then I decided to wash my face to get over the burning feeling, which was unbearable.</li>
            <li>After that I decided to apply one more layer and keep the same.</li>
            <li>My skin turned into red and then most of the areas turned into brown in a day or so.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known about this product first</li>
            <li>The problem areas where I left it on longer started to look more leathery and wrinkled.</li>
            <li>For real nothing happened!</li>
            <li>I would say the healing time you would mostly have is 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomed this to everyone who has acne and/or acne scars especially people who acne on their face.</li>
            <li>I just put on my first applications today</li>
            <li>Having had a VI Peel that cost me $350, I wanted to find a more affordable option with similar results.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that this product was more affordable.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product it did burn a bit.</li>
            <li>I have always followed the instructions exactly (i.e. alcohol swab before application of gel) and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The first time, nothing happened (no peeling either).</li>
            <li>and it has done exactly that.  </li>
            <li>The acne scars and the two toned complexion was still evident.  </li>
            <li>It actually gave me a more even all-over peel than the one I paid $125 for.</li>
            <li>After Anesthetic Cream, I cleaned my face good; and applied Vaseline on the areas that I wouldn&#x27;t want this gel run and caused trouble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the same product but lower % TCA peel also very good just peeled less.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first use, I experienced very little peeling, and none of it was in the areas of my face that it was most needed, so I went back and reread the product reviews, and one in particular caught my eye.  </li>
            <li>I liked this new addition to my facial regime.</li>
            <li>We can wait a little longer (not so long of course, just a minute or two more since there is already good amount of product on the skin).</li>
            <li>Cost a little bit more but makes huge differences.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some light peeling and my pores look a little better.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll still be able to put moisturizer on and go out and about for the duration of most of the peel (at least for the first 4 or 5 days)</li>
            <li>About ten minutes later my cheeks were bright</li>
            <li>started with a 30% Glycolic Peel and then a 12% TCA peel (each for about $25), but they both were definitely a waste of time and money as far as getting a great \\&quot;Light\\</li>
            <li>I also liked the anti-inflammatory properties described in the product details because I have sensitive skin that can sometimes turn really red and</li>
            <li>smooth it on my freshly washed face, neck, upper chest, and hands, then I wait about 5-10 minutes, rinse it off, and then do it again, wait about 2 minutes and rinse.  </li>
            <li>I am an acne sufferer and after years of research, on my own, I know that acne is a three-pronged malady; it requires three conditions to form:  bacteria, skin that doesn&#x27;t completely slough off, and extra sebum.</li>
            <li>less noticeable sun spots drastically faded, my face is so smooth &amp; glowy!!</li>
            <li>I then rinsed with cool water for a minute, patted dry, and put on a light layer of coconut oil before going to bed.</li>
            <li>This new bottle seemed much more potent than the last one I bought awhile back.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle was 12% and this one was 15%--not much difference, I thought, but my skin thought otherwise.  </li>
            <li>The site was *very* helpful when I did my first 15% TCA application at home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to order from Perfect Image next time.. may be a stronger peel, but I recommend starting off with a weak peel and moving to a stronger one eventually .</li>
            <li>my skin is pretty much used to them.</li>
            <li>i believe that tca does help scarring in the long term but it can make it appear more severe immediately after the application.  </li>
            <li>I also use the other peels by these people, I feel like all of them do the same great job</li>
            <li>and I will continue using it since the product is so gentle, inexpensive, and it really works!</li>
            <li>My peeling is pretty much all done and</li>
            <li>My skin is super smooth afterward and it does not overly dry it out.</li>
            <li>At this point, I think I am pretty satisfied with this new addition to my facial regime.</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem less noticeable too, but I should&#x27;ve taken photo before to compare accurately.</li>
            <li>After words my face felt dry, but mostly my T-zone.</li>
            <li>I am not used to having peels and my skin is super sensitive; so why didn&#x27;t i feel anything when i put this on my face????</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong enough</li>
            <li>I bought this peel after trying a lactic acid peel and found it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just strong enough to turn over my skin</li>
            <li>Followed by Aloe Vera and my pure hyaluronic serum with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I tend to just breakout in certain areas and don&#x27;t need to use it like a mask</li>
            <li>I will wait to use any exfoliation products until I am certain that the majority of skin finished flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have acne scars &amp; large pores thinking it would reduce there appearance.</li>
            <li>I certainly will continue with this product.</li>
            <li>This product produces only very mild peeling that isn&#x27;t very noticeable  </li>
            <li>morning, my face was nice and tight.  </li>
            <li>I take a 2 week break between peels to let my skin recover; the melasma and fine lines are definitely going away.  </li>
            <li>Am using for fine lines and hyperpigmentation left over from pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It works best if you do little by little.  </li>
            <li>Tone is clearer, fine lines are diminished, and skin looks younger.</li>
            <li>Although I was only able to repeat the process once due to the burning sensations intensity magnifying upon the second attempt, I was very pleased to find that after three days, my face did peel.  </li>
            <li>I really like the consistency and the gentleness of there products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used peels often and really like this one.</li>
            <li>This saves so much money I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>long term conclusions as I just did my first one last week, but if you want a light peel for overall facial rejuvenation this one is great.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I woke up with my face intact the next morning.</li>
            <li>Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I used it this time, I did not notice as much peeling, so I think my skin has gotten use to this strength.</li>
            <li>I think I need a stronger % since my face sought peril that much.</li>
            <li>It does absolutely zip.</li>
            <li>results are very noticeable with this technique.</li>
            <li>you have any real skin problems, this is a must try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It brighten up whole face.</li>
            <li>but I felt my face wasn&#x27;t peeling as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>So I did my whole face;</li>
            <li>But my age spots, acne scars, and wrinkles are much reduced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much visible redness after the peel (maybe because my skin is used to sunburn here in Florida.</li>
            <li>, I was very moved.</li>
            <li>i really like this peel.  </li>
            <li>peel my skin light because of the low dose.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>My doctor said anything I put on my skin doesn&#x27;t really affect the baby</li>
            <li>I cannot impress upon readers enough how important this is.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change except maybe some brightening and tightening.</li>
            <li>I was very cautious in my use of it.</li>
            <li>I like to speed up the after-peel by doing a gentle exfoliating wash twice a day (after 2 days).  </li>
            <li>It really does reduce the look of these spots.  </li>
            <li>and my face will get really flaky.</li>
            <li>Does what it says, gives my skin that boost and really makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel it invigorating my skin as it tingles.  </li>
            <li>The product works very well for the price point.  </li>
            <li>ot really.</li>
            <li>20% TCA Peel will produce a really Deeper and Thicker Skin Peel.</li>
            <li>Then the lactic acid peel was too much for me</li>
            <li>I decided to try it to see how much of a differance the peel would make on my skin.</li>
            <li>Just now used this product in December and it really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>So it started healing and then peeling very soon soon.</li>
            <li>read the directions carefully, made sure the cleanse my face with isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li>I know you&#x27;re not supposed to exfoliate or pick at the peeling or anything (you don&#x27;t want to cause scarring, which you will do if the peeling isn&#x27;t done, so be careful), but truthfully I knew my peel was done on day 5</li>
            <li>This product is really helpfull for acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li>but I had to leave it on much longer than recommended.</li>
            <li>I washed my face with a gentle cleanser and then cleansed it with alcohol 2x.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like how I had to keep reapplying this stuff every 10 mins, just to try and get the peeling to work.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the TCA and salicylic blend.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much since I used this peel.</li>
            <li>I bought this about two months ago and use it twice a week, but I don&#x27;t see much change with my skin.</li>
            <li>Absolutely moisturise + lots of SPF, but no washing, scrubbing or soaking.</li>
            <li>I do have some melasma on my face that it really did not seem to even touch or fade much.........</li>
            <li>Remember, lots of sunscreen if you plan to be outdoors after the peel (and always of course) and a good moisturizer at least 2x a day.  </li>
            <li>I would say that if you can&#x27;t afford health insurance or a dermatologist visit; this peel is &#x27;Almost&#x27; as effective as prescriptiontretinoin in helping to remove dead skin build-up.</li>
            <li>(I have since purchased a glycolic peel with better results for that issue), but my pores appear smaller and this product keeps my skin clear 99% of the year when applied every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>far I have only completed the peel twice, and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Definitely do your research, read the directions and be careful and good luck.</li>
            <li>It does a good job at fading them, though it&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li>If you are new to peels I would recommend a lighter peel like a gylcolic or salcylic peel first.</li>
            <li>prepping, I spot treated areas that I felt needed more work, scars, dark spots, and large pores.  </li>
            <li>In addition, although I didn&#x27;t do so the first time, the second and subsequent times I used the product, I made sure to clense my face with rubbing alcohol, as the product instructions specify.  </li>
            <li>I have used peels in the past from Sephora; specifically, Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Daily pads (which were awesome by the way, just pricey), and Dr. Brandt Laser A-peel creme (which burned like a</li>
            <li>Fortunately, due to my background, I recognized the urgency to seek more care.</li>
            <li>I tried many other TCA</li>
            <li>I have eliminated most of my age spots and reduced some sharp lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>I was really apprehensive at first because my skin is normally so sensitive that it can&#x27;t even take 5% retinol products.</li>
            <li>In my experience it&#x27;s best to leave it on no more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I have conbination skin, so I want a product that addresses both fine lines and lore pores/ minor breakouts.</li>
            <li>I actually got a little skin flaking here and there, like a very light light sun burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had done peels before but this one was strong enough to clear my skin from my acne outbreak.</li>
            <li>I usually schedule the peel so that my face peels in the comfort of my own home, so people won&#x27;t point and stare.</li>
            <li>So far, I like my first results.</li>
            <li>I use a blow dyer on low, cool setting to ease the stinging.</li>
            <li>(They are not bad, so I was hoping this product would be enough for them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My first and second peel was very mild as I ended up leaving the product on my skin for only 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>it got looser in consistency and less potent</li>
            <li>My cheek is still sagging but nasolabial folds are less prominent.  </li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ve only used it once since I just got it recently.</li>
            <li>I am 44 now, and my skin has taken on that rougher texture (I hesitate to call it &amp;#34;ruddy&amp;#34; yet) of an older complexion.  </li>
            <li>However, when I did use it on a weekly basis my skin looked vibrant.  </li>
            <li>My main concern has been sagging, and I wanted to find ways to  tighten skin since then.</li>
            <li>A plus for such quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>positives: can be rinsed off with water; only mild tingling even at 4 minutes; did not damage or burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I see ZERO effect with this product.</li>
            <li>and so I did exfoliate GENTLY to remove dead skin and my skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>I did a total of 3 treatments but the first one was 15 minutes (apply on cheeks first</li>
            <li>(thickest area of my face plus most pigmentation), the next 20 minutes and the next 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>FYI, being that I am African American, I was at greater risk for hyperpigmentation, so</li>
            <li>but I quickly built up a resistance for it the 2nd time I used it</li>
            <li>However it is a very nice &amp;#34;lunch time peel&amp;#34; skin is left nice and pink with not much discomfort and little to no peeling if applied as the directions Recommend.  </li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, dark spots are fading and overall skin texture is great.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and seller.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product line</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I got a great peel with only one pass left on less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The third attempt was much more successful as I specifically targeted my cheeks and used two thick layers of the product, applied seven minutes apart, and being left on the skin for a total of 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>ok so im on day five and still a little peeling no redness.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to finish my old peel from this brand that I really like .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this three times now, and it really does clear your skin.</li>
            <li>The first time i used this i put too much on my cheeks turned white in seconds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth it as I do not want to take any risk of trying those cheaper products which may cause potential health</li>
            <li>This product effectively helped fade acne scarring on my cheeks: I used a tiny brush to apply on pigmented spots (only) and left it on for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Like the scar or dark spot might not be completely gone,but it lightens it for sure.</li>
            <li>First time in my life, I started using Microcurrent, LED light and Derma roller and spending time to look at my face in mirror everyday.</li>
            <li>Besides, it was fun to look at those brown sun spots being peeled in mirror while giving facial myself.</li>
            <li>After applying the second layer the burning does get pretty intense</li>
            <li>I tried it again a few more times and continued to feel like I was applying nothing but a syrupy water to my skin.</li>
            <li>I am not very sensitive to smells at all, but this was so strong,  that I could barely breathe when it was applied.</li>
            <li>Really effective, deep peel without the down time</li>
            <li>However, the last couple of times I used this it just doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough anymore.  </li>
            <li>Although my acne has subsided in most part due to an accutane cycle I was on about 2 years ago, I was left with very stubborn acne marks and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>My new skin is super soft and feel and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>So far, I have done one treatment on both my face and hands, which has resulted in a good deal of flaking and skin sloughing, not to the point that I am raw or red (which is what I hoped for).</li>
            <li>The last time I used this, I left it on for 8 minutes (twice as long as the recommended maximum) just to try to get some kind of effect from it.</li>
            <li>After the new skin growing up, I will use \\&quot;Glycolic Acid 30% Gel</li>
            <li>Once your skin peels though the new skin is lighter and softer.</li>
            <li>As of right now it has only been 3 days since my first use of the product, but I cannot wait to see my next results in weeks to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After following the directions, I was pleased with the results, minimal peeling.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a middle deep (or even light) peel, you may want to look for a stronger percentage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective without irritating or drying skin too much.</li>
            <li>So your while you may take a minute to cover your whole face, your \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone gets 2 minutes contact time per pass plus the extra 1 minutes it took to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>Reading products description and their customer reviews is very important to make sure I will not put a wrong chemical on my face!</li>
            <li>The directions come in the box and are very clear.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for anyone suffering from adult acne.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this peel for people who want to maintain clear skin and tighten the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li>Between having first teenage acne, then lovely early-twenties hormonal acne, I have the hyperpigmentation to show for it, as well as unpredictable cystic acne, blackheads, and general pustules.&lt;br</li>
            <li>can easily control the amount or depth of peel you see by starting with only a one pass peel of 1 to 3 minutes to see the minor effects of the 15% TCA peel first.</li>
            <li>My skin has not been this clear since I cant remember!</li>
            <li>I left it on for the recommended amount of time, but I suppose since my skin is accustomed to the other peels, it&#x27;s more resistant.</li>
            <li>, first class international stated it takes 8-11 days</li>
            <li>Please note, if you choose to use the product in the same manner I did, make sure you only use the rubbing alcohol before starting the application process.  </li>
            <li>I only do the alcohol wash before the first application.  </li>
            <li>I am almost done with this bottle and will definitely purchase another one, maybe even a higher concentration.  </li>
            <li>The first peel, I left on for the minimum time of two minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional chemical peels before, and this peel does the job!</li>
            <li>IS SO SOFT NOW!</li>
            <li>Although I am a first timer, I have been using daily peel products.  </li>
            <li>time, instead of washing, I applied more acid after small frosting spots appeared.</li>
            <li>I only applied the peel one time since it&#x27;s my first time using the TCA peel</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I could only keep it on for a couple of minutes or so as it burned, but my skin has built up a tolerance</li>
            <li>It is actually the first time I&#x27;ve tried this at home myself.</li>
            <li>The first time I left it on for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The next 3 days I just looked alittle crisp, like I had gotten a tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months and four treatments later, from my first purchase (August  2012)</li>
            <li>my  8\\&quot; scar is barely visible,  and I&#x27;m almost ready to wear sleeveless clothes again.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly and used it several times over a month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>first time for 45 seconds (because i was scared) and second time for 1 min 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Every time Ihave had great results, immediately smooth skin, a little peeling a few days after and less oily, less breakouts and overall better complexion.</li>
            <li>but then I got a glimpse of the new skin being revealed and I was completely amazed.</li>
            <li>A couple of days later after my first use, I had some peeling around the sensitive area around my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional TCA peels before, and this product works exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have ever found that has not only shrunk the pores, but is beginning to completely erase them.  </li>
            <li>I used cotton balls to apply the peel and Q-tips to apply the peel directly to scars (do the later first).</li>
            <li>The following week I left it on for the full 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked better than this product to remove dark spots on my back from acne.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see how long I leave it on next week since I have this initial peel done.</li>
            <li>But no redness, no peeling, just a smooth, tight, albeit itchy face.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>and I still feel my face tight and smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good results with very little skin irritation compared to some other peels I have used.</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft and my pores have really gotten smaller.  </li>
            <li>A minute later I applied Pure Hyaluronic Serum and my moisturizing</li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping it would diminish a large acne scar on my back.</li>
            <li>Large pores on T-zone looks smaller.  </li>
            <li>top of this, I&#x27;ve used various chemical peelers and still no significant effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I was expecting the 12% TCA to be significantly stronger than glycolic, but obviously less so than the 20% TCA solution.</li>
            <li>I have clear skin, but large pores, I now have clear skin and smaller pores.</li>
            <li>I find that it is strong enough to help with my skin where the other products were not.  </li>
            <li>When I did the first peel I didn&#x27;t see any results, but after the 2nd and 3rd peel I did notice a huge difference in the appearance of my dark spots and my skin over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I had given up hope, this product has helped me realize that I shouldn&#x27;t give up on my goal of having clear skin.</li>
            <li>With those two miracle products,  I wake up with plump, clear, and radiant skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this peel on my shaved scalp to help clear buildup to help prevent hair loss.  </li>
            <li>After hitting 51, I was shocked to find my nasolabial folds got more prominent</li>
            <li>While the lactic acid peel left my skin feeling refreshed, the TCA peel really made me shed.</li>
            <li>The old layers of skin began peeling off of my face.</li>
            <li>As a professional, Timeless is my trusted supplier of peels and serums.</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The white heads are disappearing and my face is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so surprised that this product has shown any sort of results.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used it twice over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>ANother step is I have my fan near by</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m simply amazed at how much clearer my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I have tried twice so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin--or so I thought.</li>
            <li>By the 7th day, I am ready for my next application.</li>
            <li>skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>Overall, my skin is fresher and clearer and the tone is much improved.  </li>
            <li>I ave never delt with acne until my adult life</li>
            <li>my skin had developed an immunity to the combination and it didn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from acne during my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>At first my face was red but it went back to normal after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Even after 7 months of Retin-A treatment this product has done nearly its equivalent overnight.</li>
            <li>Near the end of time limit, I noticed \\&quot;icing\\&quot; or \\&quot;frosting\\&quot; in one area.</li>
            <li>Skin has natural bacteria living on it.</li>
            <li>So far.</li>
            <li>So far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, with an oily T-zone.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this peel about two months ago and have used it five times so far.  </li>
            <li>The fourth one I increased the time to four minutes and had burning over much of my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin too.  </li>
            <li>If you keep using it no doubt the scar will go away completely.</li>
            <li>and now all the scars are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look old and wrinkled anymore.</li>
            <li>Not too harsh and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Next morning I woke up with much tighter, brighter and smoother skin, and I wondered why.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Skin Peel (although these two products were higher quality for the minor results they were suppose to accomplish - just no</li>
            <li>only CON is that it seems as though the peel is not even on areas because the application is not even (I&#x27;ve tried gauze pads but they absorb too much of the TCA gel; so I use cotton balls as the applicator</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, started on my neck and worked up.</li>
            <li>The real benefits were weeks later.  </li>
            <li>but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with hormonal acne for about 11 years now, and while much of that has subsided I am still left with pigmentation and</li>
            <li>About three days after my skin started some minor peeling, and I am pretty amazed by how the peel seems to target my problem areas because those are the only areas that really seem to peel on my face.</li>
            <li>the strength is low and sometimes do two whole rounds on the same day to really penetrate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, oily/combo skin, olive skin tone,</li>
            <li>The TCA instantly attacks the bacteria, allowing for the pimple to disappear/heal much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the scarring, but I only did one application.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t completely acne-free, but it looks a LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then applied a SPF 15, oil-free, sensitive moisturizer (Olay).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li>but it so far is working for me.</li>
            <li>I did not do the 1-2 week prep work of deep cleansing, retinols so this may be why I had to leave it on so much longer.</li>
            <li>it made me look old for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Even worked for my sensitive type of skin.</li>
            <li>and then i am stopping because i literally dont need anymore make up on my face anymore this product has completely done its job.</li>
            <li>After about 2 days my face was completely peeled.</li>
            <li>It is something that I can use frequently.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this and see how much my acne scars disappear.</li>
            <li>but I got better results on the trouble \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone area without having to do extra passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I washed it off with water, I did spray on my skin Aloe Vera to cool it down.</li>
            <li>areas\\&quot; like the \\&quot;T-Zone\\&quot; first so they have slightly longer \\&quot;contact\\&quot; times and will \\&quot;Peel\\&quot; slightly more, getting ride of the \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/2/2012</li>
            <li>About two days in the heavy peeling occurs, leaving a very fresh layer of skin.</li>
            <li>first to dry out my skin and prepare it</li>
            <li>Just like the massive pimples that left big dark scars are still kind of visible, but</li>
            <li>I have done maybe 2 skin peels in my life and in general have good skin for my age, per a dermatologist less wrinkles than average but more uneven skin tone than  average for my age.</li>
            <li>I could see improvement in the overall texture of my skin, particularly on my forehead and on my chin, where I had enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li>However, I admit buying into the myth women needing to look 21 when they&#x27;re 80 and had so much work, they barely resemble a human.  </li>
            <li>However, I admit buying into the myth women needing to look 21 when they&#x27;re 80 and had so much work, they barely resemble a human.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my neck and chest, and my chest in particular looks much younger with the perpetual redness now gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that the bottle of Perfect Image 12% TCA that I was sold is either fake, defective or past</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times over the past couple months and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good peel.</li>
            <li>more than 20% TCA is recommended for dark skin because of the very high chance of resulting in even worse scaring and hyperpigmentation that you&#x27;re trying to fix in the first place.  </li>
            <li>and I had such high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>*(#* if you left it on too long, and the results weren&#x27;t as good).&lt;br /&gt;The price and the reviews seemed right, so I went ahead and got this.</li>
            <li>I have noticed slight changes in the appearance of the pigmentation on my face and the depth of scaring, and I can only imagine that sticking with this would show fantastic results in the coming</li>
            <li>This is a great product, not only improves acne condition but helps to reduce pore sizes and scars, i recommend it, tough read the instructions carefully</li>
            <li>But this stuff will last me a long time and is really strong, I only use a tiny bit at a time.</li>
            <li>Being a woman of colour, I was very skeptical about using the TCA peel, but I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li>My skin is very tolerant - it&#x27;s not sensitive to any products, I&#x27;m not prone to break-outs, and I don&#x27;t have sun damage, wrinkles or discolorations.</li>
            <li>I continued my normal skin care routine for the next 3 days, then repeated my 3-minute \\&quot;peel.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft after the first use and it did not burn or hurt my skin like other peels out there.</li>
            <li>I feel that if used regularly, it can help with fine lines and uneven skin color.</li>
            <li>no tightness,no peeling, i was certain i did something wrong and read some reviews and read that most people didnt get results unless they washed it off in between layers.</li>
            <li>My skin flakes a little at day 2 after the peel, and my skin is left smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I will use the new strength, level 3, the next time.</li>
            <li>With help of my brand new facial steamer, the lizard skin patch peeled after 5 days.</li>
            <li>I have to deal with dry skin now, but that&#x27;s much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>After I got out of the shower, I dry my face gently and apply my MD forte cream.</li>
            <li>My first time applying it left my skin sensitive and hot, causing me submerge my face in a sink filled with cold water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m running low and ready to try the 30% next.....</li>
            <li>Nothing that would be noticed if you went out in public, only if you looked really close in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will give it a few more tries and try not to rush the process.  </li>
            <li>(It was gentle enough for me to apply it a second time that day.).</li>
            <li>I left it on for 3 minutes and then put a layer over my whole face which I left on for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this peel being as effective as the one I had done at the medi-spa, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This peel is perfect.not too strong or weak.skin felt less dry using this.ill be reordering and telling my friends about this peel</li>
            <li>and they were easy enough, I didnt do a patch test I just went for it, so I washed and dried my face and wiped it down with witch hazel until it was dry and clean.</li>
            <li>And I have some major hormonal cystic acne issues sometimes.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to present day, I am still using Retin-A cream 7 months later and the scars have barely diminished.</li>
            <li>The major peeling for me started on the 8th day so</li>
            <li>This product definitely gives professional results!</li>
            <li>I do not really have any redness either just a little around sensitive areas such as the mouth, nose corners and top of cheek bone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some nice professional peels in the past, but it often took a few repeats to get the deeper peel I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The peel is deep and even if using a brush, however one needs to carefully prep (dilute and test 5%, then 10%, until you know what strength is right for you).</li>
            <li>and I would definitely not recommend anyone do this alone for their first peel attempt -- instead go with the 15% TCA Peel and do it for a minute or two as a single pass to see how it works</li>
            <li>No peeling at all, slight pinkish color right after, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>David Petrillo, (who I now believe is a reputable customer service representative) explained how their products are not like other peels, in that they arent harsh, but over time help to lighten scars.</li>
            <li>This really helps to brighten a dull complexion.i found it to be very gentle but effective.great to use at home.</li>
            <li>the pores on my cheeks and nose are more shallow and smaller.  </li>
            <li>Never having had peels, I started very slow and waited more time than suggested between peels.</li>
            <li>New and old acne scars are much smoother and less obvious with every treatment.</li>
            <li>highly highly recommend SUNSCREEN daily for a solid week after you use this if you are going to be out in the sun at all.</li>
            <li>But I am not sure this really did much.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was a lower acid concentration, but this peel was not nearly as harsh as any that I&#x27;ve tried at the spa, and I even did two layers when my esthetician only ever does one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really gave me the result I expected.</li>
            <li>You DO need to follow instructions carefully, not exfoliate beforehand, and NOT leave it on for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>After this, I resorted back to my old regimen of using Retin-A cream for my scarring.</li>
            <li>7 - 10 days later, my skin was so inflamed, we had to leave  our vacation to Hilton Head early.</li>
            <li>My face was so swollen, I could not shut my left eye completely.</li>
            <li>Mine completely surrounded my left eye.</li>
            <li>Apparently, this product is supposed to work on the 1st layer of skin (epidermis.)</li>
            <li>this $30 product has cost me thousands (for wrinkles barely visible) in med. bills, CAT scan and 5 rounds of antibiotics, including IV antibiotics in the hospital.</li>
            <li>this $30 product has cost me thousands (for wrinkles barely visible) in med. bills, CAT scan and 5 rounds of antibiotics, including IV antibiotics in the hospital.</li>
            <li>It barely stings.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to people starting out using peels or to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now, it does not bother me at all to go out with just my bare face.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is sensitive, I did patch test on my inner elbow and under chin.</li>
            <li>I only left it on for 2 minutes total as it began to really burn.  </li>
            <li>When I think how much money I have spent, $40-$70 a pop on those procedures, without ever seeing results I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t tried this sooner.</li>
            <li>It could be very drying so use it carefully until you know how you might react</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars and can do the exact same thing at home for the cost of what I used to tip my esthetician!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>draw.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived earlier than expected, prettily packaged with thorough directions, stressing safety.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This 12% is terrific for overall rejuvenation that leaves me looking normal.  </li>
            <li>I hate to write this review as I&#x27;m sure most likely the exception, unless you were a company to screen reviews.</li>
            <li>I hate to write this review as I&#x27;m sure most likely the exception, unless you were a company to screen reviews.</li>
            <li>my scars are not really that bad, so I figured as a first time chemical peel 15% would be decent, I watched and read review and for some this had amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li>one of frosted spots must have stayed too long, I got new brown spot because of this. :</li>
            <li>I use sunblock regularly but usually do not reapply often enough.</li>
            <li>As a professional I want to underscore that my recommendations are for professionals only and I don&#x27;t advocate the general public use of these products.  </li>
            <li>It does not burn like other peels, and the dropper really makes application of the product easier.</li>
            <li>My forehead, chest, and neck are less sensitive to the peel than the rest of my face, so I apply it to those areas first, then wait a few minutes before applying it to my whole face.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the good reviews I had high expectations for this product, but after using it I must say i am disappointed.</li>
            <li>What to expect in the results reduced lines, dark spots, fine wrinkles, and a big reduction (almost elimination) of blackheads and other acne nastys.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very clearly sealed in the hard plastic with perforated dots around the neck of the bottle where you tear it away, yet the viscus liquid was never filled to the top.  </li>
            <li>I love using this peel to keep my skin fresh and resilient to all the bad things that are out in the world.</li>
            <li>you couldnt see that my skin was peeling but 3 days after i wiped my face with a black cloth and sure enough dead skin was on there.  </li>
            <li>I have spent loads of money of on treatments that don&#x27;t work this well and fast and for only $24.95, this productis</li>
            <li>At first, I was a little hesitant about the strength of the peel.</li>
            <li>It makes wherever you put it darker and a little crinkley too at first.</li>
            <li>The first time I saw little change although I did peel.  </li>
            <li>there was a slight more burn only felt like a light sunburn if someone touchs it.. washing it off with the cold water</li>
            <li>I tried this peel to try and lesson those dark spots and it really does work.</li>
            <li>It worked okay, but left behind several stubborn brown spots on my forehead and cheeks (that I have from the sun and birth control)</li>
            <li>3 days after the 2nd application, I am getting some \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; that basically is like dry skin, but I haven&#x27;t had any new acne</li>
            <li>I am on day 4 now and my face is a little flakey but no real bad pealing.</li>
            <li>, i did a double layer, i am not new to using chemical peels, so if you are new to chemical peels, follow the directions well</li>
            <li>next time I will time it such that the major peeling falls on a weekend.  </li>
            <li>If you can tolerate a little pain for 10 minutes, you will love the long term effect of this product (I purchased 4% lidocaine lotion online, which helps a little).</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it two stars is that I did usually notice some very very very light peeling a few days after each use.  </li>
            <li>, I can control the peel, repeating every so often rather than one extreme peel at a high price.  </li>
            <li>I am using this to clear up my adult acne as well as treat the dark spots on my hands.</li>
            <li>(at least that&#x27;s where I get the mild peeling) without feeling like some sort of punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not new to peels I have used them for over 8 yrs at home and professionally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle but thick and highly moisturizing cream with  hyaluronic acid which brings plenty of moisture that is crucial for healing.  </li>
            <li>weeks later I repeated the process, and noticed that the hyperpigmentation was reduced by as much as 75 - 80% and the texture of my skin continued to improve, with a lessoning of the small acne bumps I had on the side of my face disappearing, and a marked reduction in the one or two cyst like acne bumps I had on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I read other reviews on TCA &amp; saw that it was normal.</li>
            <li>I proceeded with applying it to my face a few days later and strictly followed the directions, leaving it on for only 1 minute the first time.</li>
            <li>Since I used only alpha hydroxy in the past I did some reading and learned that alpha hydroxy acids are water soluble only, while beta hydroxy acid is oil soluble and is able to penetrate into the pore, which contains sebum, and exfoliate the dead skin cells that clog the pore.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this was no where near strong enough to do anything to my skin.</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait to see how my skin will look after a few more weeks.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this peel after trying out Perfect Image&#x27;s 50% Lactic Acid Peel because I wanted to try something stronger.</li>
            <li> the bottle for best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome peel.</li>
            <li> One of the best i&#x27;ve ever used, takes about 4-5 days for peeling to start, stay inside while it happens</li>
            <li> Within about a week my face had fully shedded &amp; man was I impressed!</li>
            <li> But the best advice was apply, rinse with water, then reapply.  </li>
            <li> I use a fan brush to apply it and it  goes on perfectly evenly.  </li>
            <li> Excellent .i&#x27;ve</li>

            <li> seem to be working perfectly.</li>
            <li> The product is great!</li>
            <li> 15% TCA is a perfect balance between effectiveness and tolerance, no downtime, once per week regimen.</li>
            <li> They have I think 3-5% lactic acid and work great!</li>
            <li> These three issues work together to create a perfect environment for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the directions perfectly and got no</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the instructions and product.</li>
            <li> It works great!  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem to be the best at delivering an even gel layer across the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased the TCA product from Perfect Image</li>

            <li> It does a great job doing that!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to do what I did, I have no idea about the best use of this product, so please don&#x27;t consider me as a guide at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for beginners (like me).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this just as a spot treatment for when i start to see something coming up, or in areas where I tend to break out, and it works great.</li>
            <li> if this is not an issue for you, then i think this is a great peel from a reliable company</li>
            <li> In fact I am so happy with this product that it is a planned stocking stuffer for all the females who don&#x27;t want to look their age on my Christmas shopping list...including myself.  </li>
            <li> but it is great for the skin.</li>

            <li> The best thing about this product, is you can use it all over your face or as more of a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Thank you Perfect Image :)</li>
            <li> I was very impressed to see how many 5 stars and good things were said about it.</li>
            <li> I then decided to stick on the peels from \\&quot;Perfect Image LCC\\&quot; as I believe this manufactory provides the best quality peels with incorporating natural plant extracts or organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> the palm of my hands, surprisingly, started to peel after three days which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> It tightens your skin and gives it a good finish.</li>
            <li> I noticed fairly immediate results with this product.</li>
            <li> My face is on its good days.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the effects after continued use will be as good as I had hoped when I bought this.</li>
            <li> This product is good for maintaining acne</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product.</li>
            <li> It has minimized my pores and exfoliated my skin giving me a flawless smooth look.</li>
            <li> and i think it is alsmost as good as the professioinal peeling product i get at a spa, however, i have noticed changes in consistency of the product after 1 year..</li>
            <li> There is a lot in the bottle (about 20 peels) and it is a good value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be a good once-a-week peel.</li>
            <li> Peeling lasts 2-3 days and can be minimized with a good moisture cream.</li>
            <li> Short-pants and skirt look good on me</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;ve really good result.</li>
            <li> Loved the feel after using the product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to start with if you use peel products.  </li>
            <li> I have done the PTR peel pads and loved them, but felt like I needed to move it up a notch to get my skin where I want it to be.  </li>
            <li> I had used a TCA peel of 25%, and although it did not sting, I was too skittish to leave it on my face longer than 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> but none are as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> So, background: 18, fair, oily &amp; sensitive-skinned, severe cystic acne since eleven.</li>
            <li> try this and get a good discount as well</li>
            <li> This product is effective and works great on hyperpigmentation as described.</li>
            <li> That helped a lot for my face, and I had a good peeling</li>
            <li> I felt good.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see any good affect for peeling, just redness.</li>
            <li> Here the gel affected good because I applied with that brush, and it delivered the gel everywhere with good amount.</li>
            <li> is that using good applicator, we can still get good results with this strength too.</li>
            <li> The product is good.</li>
            <li> If you do follow the directions closely it is a good peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very effective, much better than Skin Labratory products.  </li>
            <li> i will repurchase this one again for sure!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> be sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li> you have patience and realize that this is a process, not a one time fix all, then you will love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin beautiful and smooth</li>
            <li> I am very experienced with glycolic peels and this is my first experience with this peel.  </li>
            <li> I wish Perfect Image would offer a higher TCA peel like 20%.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the TCA for the first time, and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Skin never looked better!</li>
            <li> i love this product!</li>
            <li> First of all, the consistency of the peel solution is perfect.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a very mild product, this will be great for you.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product and I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> It also works great with mild acne scars but be patient!  </li>
            <li> This certainly makes the TCA Gel Peel the perfect choice for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to ordering more of perfect Image products in the future, and very good prices.</li>

            <li> any kind of peel.</li>
            <li> I tried the 100% salicylic by Perfert Image and really liked it</li>
            <li> I honestly would recommend this product even though it did not solve my problem.</li>
            <li> My face felt nice and tighter, I wore make up and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> i ordered this for my mother in law for christmas because she liked the 20% salicylic acid peel that i had.  </li>
            <li> I also bought a brush with it which is really nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> excellent product and highly recommend for all skin types.  </li>

            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about my experience with The Perfect Image&#x27;s peels.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying this product again, I love it! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It just keeps getting better and better!</li>
            <li> you do it correctly, the result can be very good, and much cheaper than going to the spa.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product line, and keep up the good work :-)</li>
            <li> but I can tell my skin is much more refined now and has a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li> I had perfect skin in my teens, but when I turned 27 I had frequent breakouts (almost like blisters at times) and areas of dryness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use for a beginner and does the job!  </li>
            <li> did a lot of research on at home peels before I purchased this product, and this is the perfect peel if you&#x27;re looking for RESULTS with NO DOWN</li>
            <li> Great advice from poster who indicated that she applys alchol first to degrease as intructions state.  </li>
            <li> The first three times I used this, it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous trying a TCA 12% peel for the first time, but this product was great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great peel for beginners and is working really well on my acne scars!</li>
            <li> It felt good, it was cool and it comforted my skin.</li>
            <li> Just very light peel for me&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the first time, I feel confident and proud of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this product doesn&#x27;t work, and would suggest that beginners start here for sure.</li>
            <li> I just want to give a heads up to people who may be stepping up from lower level peels and want more visible results.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent facial peel!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this peel.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I have to say upfront that I did ViPeel 3 weeks ago, and have been taking care of my skin with a lot of love and care.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> This peel is quite intense but works great on my acne prone oily skin.</li>
            <li> One reviewer mentioned using the product for 10 minutes, washing it off, then repeating the process two more times.  </li>
            <li> so I add more layer</li>
            <li> Beta hydroxy acid is better used on oily skin with blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I have used all the peels in the perfect image line, and after trying all different companies, I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had TCA peels at dermatologists&#x27; offices for many years, so knew what to expect.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite peel.</li>
            <li> For more help with using TCA read reviews at RealSelf.com.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Ive been able to do the peel on a Saturday and go to university without having to worry about my skin flaking off during the day.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> See results the more you use (once a week).  </li>
            <li> I believe it will work better.</li>
            <li> I washed my face and got most the peeling skin from my nose</li>
            <li> maybe it will work better for her. :)</li>
            <li> I love this peel</li>
            <li> , i guess it is time to reorder : )</li>
            <li> Used with caution, this is a much better result than any over-the-counter product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a lighter option from Perfect Image for future use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Might just be the best personal product I have ever purchased, that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product.</li>
            <li> It did burn a bit, mostly when I was washing it off.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t stop feeling it!! :)</li>
            <li> I had to order one that was more percentage</li>
            <li> The most troublesome aspect is blackheads....</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow directions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m fair skinned, I rarely have any problems with skin creams, cleansers, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the co. is worried about a lawsuit.</li>
            <li> According to statistics, most love the product.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope you print my review.</li>
            <li> According to statistics, most love the product.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope you print my review.</li>
            <li> i am very happy with this product and looking forward to using the next stronger peel.</li>
            <li> That said, I did read and re-read directions, as well as, many reviews on Amazon before taking the plunge.  </li>
            <li> I know there will be more peeling.</li>
            <li> I will probably use this strength once more and then move to a stronger peel.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite peel.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> But most of the flakes will be gone in time for work on Monday.</li>
            <li> Most of them are gone.</li>
            <li> I love that it worked because paying $225 to $19</li>
            <li> I hope to be able to do these on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> and I love how my hands look and feel.</li>
            <li> Love showing off my hands now.</li>
            <li> Those are more like scrubbing and make skin</li>
            <li> Most sun spots are gone and the lest is lighter.  </li>
            <li> See more on this 12% TCA Peel</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to go out of your house for 7 to 10 days while your skin peels like a cracking leather belt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to use it more to find out if it lightens my face.</li>
            <li> It feels tighter, cleaner, my complexion became lighter and more even.</li>
            <li> , I love the ease of using the dropper to put drops on cotton ball ..</li>
            <li> I bought this one with the intention of purchasing more if it went well</li>
            <li> Their peels seem to be safer than others I have tried because of the gel like nature instead of the more watery products out there.</li>
            <li> A for sure must get.</li>
            <li> and my skin already looked better and the acnes were GONE.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> And now I tried these products, and I feel much better with my face.</li>
            <li> By the way I also bought one more thing, \\&quot;MD</li>
            <li> During the shower I also try to massage my face, kind of exfoliating too, so lightly without hurting it.</li>
            <li> I found this product while searching and completely enjoyed the quality and effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to wear makeup every day except on day 4 when the peeling was noticeable (like whenyou peel after a sunburn) - my foundation and cover up just made the peeling stand out more.</li>
            <li> Does what it says!! :)</li>
            <li> Skin is soo smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this peel.</li>
            <li> I mostly used it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> If anyone has recommendations I would love to hear them.ook for something stronger.</li>
            <li> If anyone has recommendations I would love to hear them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have been better off to stay with retinol purchased in the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> It has been two weeks since I administered my third peel, and I am very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> My acne scars also seem to have improved, and the skin tone is much more even.</li>
            <li> I love how the product works.</li>
            <li> sunspots are almost gone, and I&#x27;ve tryed many Brands with no Result</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t thank Perfect Image enough for their customer service and qualify products.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have some lines on my face, and they are getting better as well.  </li>
            <li> for the heck of it i am going to do 1 more treatment in about 10 days</li>
            <li> , i am SO GLAD i did not listen.</li>
            <li> After 4 months of using this product my face has never looked better and I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> The acne scars are 70% improved and most of the marks have gone.  </li>
            <li> I have some sun spots on my back and will try Lactic Acid by Perfect Image.</li>
            <li> It seems to target the more pigmented areas</li>
            <li> but this one worked a lot better.</li>
            <li> I realize that each person&#x27;s skin might respond differently to these solutions, so go with what you feel is best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll be going back for more Perfect Image products vs a couple of others.</li>
            <li> the Glycolic seemed to do a much better job of that for me when I used that.</li>
            <li> The Glycolic I also purchased from Perfect image last year</li>
            <li> After having tried some of the other peels from Perfect Image (I liked them all) - this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> You can repeat the process every week or so as it is not very harsh and it is good because it has the salicylic acid which is good for acne.</li>
            <li> It is gentle but very effective.</li>
            <li> I smiled at me in the mirror, my smile makes wrinkles all over my face!  </li>
            <li> Very detailed instructions included and product was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I normally get my peels done at a Doctors office and they work great.</li>
            <li> so you will be able to use the product and get the most benefit out of it, its a professional grade product with great results.</li>
            <li> My skin is becoming more even toned and the freckles are fading.  </li>
            <li> Product exactly as described, good price, no complaints.</li>
            <li> more like a strong astringent then a peel.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quick and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced an actual peel or any peeling yet, but my pores and skin tone looked nice when I woke up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> product really needs to include an \\&quot;applicator\\&quot; for applying the gel evenly across the skin (instead of leaving users to themselves to try to figure out what to use as an \\&quot;applicator\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems like a good product to prepare your skin for a 20% TCA peel, if you&#x27;re not in a hurry for the immediate results of a 20% TCA peel which I would think would cause a good sun tan like peeling on the first try.</li>
            <li> It keeps the pores more refined, tightens things up a bit and helps with the fine lines.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist had recommended this product to me and so far I am very pleased with it!  </li>
            <li> and I haveto use it more to get rid of them, but I am still happy; because first time I actually felt I got some kind of result from a product; this really made me happy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this worked great for me.</li>
            <li> So far its been a great product.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks and feels smooth and more even textured.  </li>
            <li> This helps the skin stay supple and protected from cracks or tears in the peeling layer until its good and ready to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely read the directions and test first, but it&#x27;s a great product and the company has good shipping and packaging</li>
            <li> Their products are top quality, customer service is great, products are relatively inexpensive...</li>
            <li> Was easy to apply no severe sensation or anything.</li>
            <li> This is very mild.</li>
            <li> However, my battle with acne was not so easily won.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for an overall, healthy glow and to freshen up your skin.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you clean your face and use astringent before peel.  </li>
            <li> it is easy to manage and control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects on my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is really strong, and ive been using some really strong stuff on my face.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, but it is strong--you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> since it was 20% Salicylic peel; it was strong for under eyes.</li>
            <li> irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have discovered chemical peels that I can do at home and then to see so quickly that the Perfect Image TCA peel actually works.  </li>
            <li> So if you are dark skinned this 15% is perfect.  </li>
            <li> The second time, I did the alcohol cleanse, removing all traces of oil on the skin and the results were beautifully even...</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t experienced any down time, which I have generally experienced with higher strength peels.  </li>
            <li> I used the Glycolic previously but this TCA is the best!  </li>
            <li> Follow the package directions, and watch the fine lines and brown spots disappear over time.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied, I used perfect image&#x27;s \\&quot;Salicylic Gel Peel + Salicylic Deep Gel Cleanser\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I heard that 12% TCA would be fine for the eyes.</li>
            <li> Additionally, my skin seems clearer, softer with reduced fine lines.  </li>
            <li> This product is formulated specifically to help reduce wrinkles, fine lines, acne, scars, and reverse the visible signs of aging on YOUR FACE.  </li>
            <li> where strong enough to get a great \\&quot;Light\\&quot; skin peel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lol now I just add a little to my face mask, because it did make my skin look nice even though it didnt peel.</li>
            <li> It turned to be a huge purple patch after one hour.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in how my skin looked and felt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see huge improvements yet</li>
            <li> I used this as maintenance for acne and some light wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Had no problems, only great results.  </li>
            <li> If you are doing the peel specifically for acne, I have had better success with Salicylic peels.</li>
            <li> You do peel lightly</li>
            <li> but the result is even tone smooth</li>
            <li> few weeks ago I started a peel regimen with Perfect Image TCA 12% Gel Peel and after just two weeks, I was already seeing improvements.</li>
            <li> I just use it to lightly shed the outer layer of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great price, especially when compared to salon treatments.</li>
            <li> Gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the TCA peel from Perfect Image for a few months now</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, very well made and priced.</li>
            <li> However; with regular use, it could be a great maintenance program.</li>
            <li> Use a light moisturizer after peel&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took accutane about a year ago and still have some light scarring on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> bought this product after reading the reviews to help fade my acne scars (which are smooth and discolored, not pitted or raised).</li>
            <li> do I get some light tingling/burning.  </li>
            <li> I am on my 2nd Peel and the results have been great.  </li>
            <li> I like to apply fresh aloe vera from my backyard as a mask to better my results.  </li>
            <li> While doing so, I realized that smooth and even toned skin is what contributes youthful look.</li>
            <li> I was comfortable to keep layering and extended time to 30 min.  </li>
            <li> 15% TCA is definitely what I would call a great \\&quot;Light\\</li>
            <li> It produced a light peel which I never got wth the stronger Skin Labs product.  </li>
            <li> After the peeling was done, skin was smooth but the acne scars remain.</li>
            <li> And this has worked great for the last 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this is my error, but at any rate, this product did not deliver the results it promises, no matter how open-minded</li>
            <li> And with Amazon Prime I got this product in two days with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is important for the skin to have time to heal in between each peel.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.  </li>
            <li> Peel worked well to help smooth lines and tighten skin.</li>
            <li> I tried light laser peels, retinol creams and did acne facials</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try more layers next time, because I don&#x27;t want to throw out a perfectly good bottle of product.</li>
            <li> directions are very clear and the price is very fair and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I find this to be far superior.</li>
            <li> I am 33 years old, with fair skin.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to make sure I was doing right.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews for great pointers on how to use for the most benefit.</li>
            <li> boyfriend also tried it (he has never done a peel before) and said his skin felt very fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about this particular product is the VERY thorough instructions that came with the solution.  </li>
            <li> Although it left a new brown spot,I am very happy.  </li>
            <li> i will say i like this tca peel better than the first brand i purchased.</li>
            <li> is my experience with TCA 12% at home: I DID not do a patch test, for I am familiar with the peel.</li>
            <li> This product allows me to do lighter (but still very beneficial) more frequent peels than just a once-a-year deeper peel with a good 7-10 days of downtime.  </li>
            <li> I felt more of a burn and decided to not do anymore layers because this is my first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth 5 CENTS!</li>
            <li> I do recommend following the directions that come with the bottle to make sure you are getting the best level of peel possible with out damaging your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a great review about this product and have been thinking about doing the peel myself for a long time.</li>
            <li> There was significant burning this time.</li>
            <li> Having said that, you don&#x27;t have to keep this on long to see great results.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I followed the directions to the T and even my oblivious husband noticed how smooth my skin was!</li>
            <li> You will need to use this peel about 2-3 times, a month apart, to notice significant difference</li>
            <li> I first must say this company is outstanding in may ways.</li>
            <li> Top of the line product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I am excited to use this product, and am planning to do a peel every one to two months.</li>
            <li> I did have some mild flaking and my face looked brighter afterwards, but my hyperpigmentation and fine lines have not improved at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m moving up to the higher percentage and am hoping to see more results.</li>
            <li> But after 4-5 days I can feel the peel and my skin is super smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I had gone to skin clique and had a professional done it on my face with a strong amount, it might have been much better, but I am ok with that strength right now, because it hurts me so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentler or milder tca peel since with previous experience, have found that higher percentages are not always best in improving my skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> Recommended to anyone who wants to have clean skin free of sebum!</li>
            <li> I really want to get my beautiful skin back to the look before it got suffered from sun damage and</li>
            <li> BUT OMG WHAT A DIFFERENCE to my face, acne pretty much cleared up and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest anyone putting this on or around their eye unless they are experienced and extremely careful.  </li>
            <li> I had really great results with skin smoothness and pore size reduction from this product and minimal skin</li>
            <li> I decided I needed something a bit more intensive to help with my acne scarring, because while I like those, they weren&#x27;t helping much with the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Then after 3 minutes I spread the peel all over my face with a synthetic fan brush, and let it sit for another 2-3 min before rinsing thoroughly with cool water.  </li>
            <li> I wait 30  minutes, wash it off and do the whole thing two more times.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t believe the value is here in a product that we are supposed to use liberally if the bottle isn&#x27;t even full.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne and sensitive skin for years and now age is catching up to me.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s fair to add my personal opinion to the product review.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s fair to add my personal opinion to the product review.</li>
            <li> that don&#x27;t fall off naturally on their own.</li>
            <li> it is a good starting point for do it at home peels.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> More gentle than the non-gel TCA peels.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to leave it on longer over time so you can get the full effect.</li>
            <li> Use lots of cool water to get it all off.</li>
            <li> The price is also not bad.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good mild peel that does result in skin improvement after a month or two of weekly use.</li>
            <li> , I strongly suggest you start with lower strength peels if its your first time.</li>
            <li> I decided to try an at home chemical peel after having experienced a increase in hyperpigmentation due to acne.  </li>
            <li> The first night I did a patch test; my skin tolerated it just fine.</li>
            <li> Well, I first started with the Glycolic peel at 30% and did fine for a month or two, but wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted.  </li>
            <li> planed to start from mild peel</li>
            <li> After the peeling process, I noticed my skin was actually more clear and smooth than before I had started.  </li>
            <li> This product has helped my skin tremendously</li>
            <li> use mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> For me, even w/ a deeper peel, the best effects rally last only a month or so, so finding this product has saved me LOTS of money and helped me keep up my aging skin.</li>
            <li> THat made a tremendous difference for me.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Wash face with a mild cleanser, I use Clinque or Neutrogena in the bar</li>
            <li> This would be excellent use on African American skin like myself.</li>
            <li> After three uses, I definitely see hyperpigmentation fading and expect it to get better after more uses.</li>
            <li> I had mild burning at my forehead line.</li>
            <li> Mild Peeling began in about four days and my freckles were some lighter.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne with congrsted pores and sebacious filaments.</li>
            <li> Follow with good moisturizer (I also recommend 100% hyaluronic acid, also available from Amazon) and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING.</li>
            <li> I have had mild peels in the dermatologist&#x27;s office, so I know what to expect from them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this over the more pricey brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is the very first time for me to use chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> For someone like me that has spent so much money on spa treatments and has never seen any results from them, it does sound almost too good to be true that I could spend $30 on this product and have several treatments showing significant results, but it is true!nd has never seen any results from them, it does sound almost too good to be true that I could spend $30 on this product and have several treatments showing significant results, but it is true!</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I took precaution with this new product.</li>
            <li> the new layers were firmer, tighter, clearer and so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced slight peel, and it has completed.</li>
            <li> The results ended up showing as some flaking and slight peeling which I wasnt too happy with.</li>
            <li> Day 7 - clean skin, but most importantly MY 2 BROWN SPOTS on my left side are 90% GONE!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please DON&#x27;T rush with higher percentage of TCA peel, be sure your skin is ready for this.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a good first try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m being very cautious with it, though, as it is extremely strong.</li>
            <li> I see here that others have suggested their own variations on the directions, but thus far I have followed them exactly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it only took about 5 mins within application but the results were good both times.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly as promised, with a gentle formula, a great smell and a low price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I started with 12% because any higher and I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to use it as regularly as I have been.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a cowboy; read the directions and be cautious if it&#x27;s your first peel!  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I have gotten my face under control and use the acid peels to keep my fresh looking fresh and get rid of any lingering scars.</li>
            <li> , I applied Step 2 neutrizer of MD Skin Care Alpha Bata Peel, then DMAE-Alpha Lipoic C-Ester Creme that I ordered with this peel, Strivectin, Neurtogena Pure &amp; Free Liquid Sunblack SPF 50 at the end.  </li>
            <li> Works amazingly and is not as strong as my other peel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It really didnt make any noticiable difference with my face, BUT it did make my skin smooth</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; just some really light flaking here and there--mostly around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Success.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a more gentle peel.</li>
            <li> After reading various product reviews, I decided to try the TCA 12% Gel Peel, because I liked what people had to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smile lines were</li>
            <li> and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> After almost three weeks of using the product the scar has faded quite a bit, and I expect the scar to be almost completely gone after a couple of more weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li> This Glycolic Acid Peel has really helped to clear up my face and give it a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the most potent benzoyl cream as well as tea tree oil, the combination worked amazingly well for a long time, not sure if it was exactly healthy on my skin but got rid of all breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is really powerful, it will make you peel.</li>
            <li> The results are far better than my glycolic and salicylic acid treatments combined.</li>
            <li> I got this for a nice facial peel.</li>
            <li> This peel is worth trying out.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve done two Lactic Acid peels and its been ok.</li>
            <li> It is actually gentler and more comfortable than the peels I&#x27;ve had my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> however it is worth it if you have the time.</li>
            <li> Torturing myself with face burn was not my idea of fun.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> For my own use I leave one layer on for 5-7 minutes and then add a second.</li>
            <li> Finally have time to order the TCA peel, at first wasn&#x27;t sure how strong I should go with</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say that this is the best peel I have ever used since my entire face ended up peeling whereas other peels have only managed to make parts of my face peel.  </li>
            <li> This product,although much less percentage than you can get with an office visit does a remarkable job with age spots caused from sun damage.</li>
            <li> I chose this 12% TCA peel after doing some research, because I was scared to go right for the 25% and take the risk of my face falling off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try another brand, because this item right here didn&#x27;t do what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it off and noticed right away my skin felt tighter, and it was alot smoother.</li>
            <li> Probably, it is just not the right concentration for me.</li>
            <li> The skin peeling is still pretty light, and the skin flaking/peeling thickness is about the thickness of a see through piece of paper (very thin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I have had many professional peels and microderms completed at spas</li>
            <li> For the first couple of days after the peel my skin is pretty pinkish/red and tight, and a great moisturizer is a must.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far but saw a nice difference in the reduction of the redness in old acne scars and it tightened up my face nicely.</li>
            <li> have very large pores in my &amp;#34;T-Zone&amp;#34; that continuously get clogged.  </li>
            <li> When I finally decided to try TCA 12%, it was after trying mild Glycolic and Lactic products that provided &#x27;ok&#x27; results.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my glycolic and salicylic peels which only caused light shedding, the TCA peel caused my whole face to peel within days and was more affective towards removing scars and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Just follow the very complete directions included and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The dropper was also ballooned out and full of air, looking like it was suffering from some strange pressure situations or that it wasn&#x27;t in top form.  </li>
            <li> my skin was just fresher looking, the tone much more even, and it seemed to respond to my nightly cleanse and products so much more with the dead skin cells removed.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for treatment of mild breakouts or those just looking for a fresher &amp; smoother look.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind these treatments work but be sure to follow directions word for word , they are a little more potent than your standard otc products.</li>
            <li> TCA does not make my face turn red the way lactic acid does, and peels evenly revealing a very smooth surface underneath.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and did not sting.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sting or burn my face but still left it feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> It left my skin very smooth and hydrated after 6 days.</li>
            <li> but mine is somewhat sensitive and does fine with it.</li>
            <li> Rinse face thoroughly with cool water (pay particular attention to the hairline.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to wait to do whole face till fall as where I live I am under strong sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She said she wanted this exact product, and I assume she has used this, and likes it.</li>
            <li> I am going to bump up to a higher concentration level.</li>
            <li> Just remember to follow directions exactly, and try a test patch first.</li>
            <li> absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li> The skin was flaking a couple days after the first use</li>
            <li> all, I am really satisfied with this product and will keep using this strength in the future.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again but wil probaly use a higher acid level.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to use a higher percentage acid.</li>
            <li> This was my first time</li>
            <li> First I thought it was a dud seeing as tho</li>
            <li> Wish I could use as a daily treatment, but to be safe</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it has only a rubber dropper on top which you can see in the pic.</li>
            <li> the price of this whole bottle!</li>
            <li> I also cleanse first with tea tree oil, and sylistic acid pads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not the first time and my results were a bit spotty.  </li>
            <li> I used it the first night it came in the mail.</li>
            <li> I read and followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> Just because everyone seems to file a lawsuit over anything (person who sued McDonalds because her coffee was too hot or they made some kids fat comes to mind.)</li>
            <li> Just because everyone seems to file a lawsuit over anything (person who sued McDonalds because her coffee was too hot or they made some kids fat comes to mind.)</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> The results were non evident.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that I was not uncomfortable at all during this peel process</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be as hot as it was</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this again :)</li>
            <li> I have since been able to afford health insurance and my dermatologist prescribed topical tretinoin.</li>
            <li> I do love doing peels regularly.</li>
            <li> I chose 12% because it is the first time for me to use chemical peel and having no time to hiding at home for a week.  </li>
            <li> day: I have done it twice more while using md skincare daily peel to remove skin faster every day.</li>
            <li> This is better than say starting with your forehead (because then your forehead has the longest contact time).</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first peel</li>
            <li> It works better, and faster than a lightening cream I purchased just recently as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but you will see changes after the first time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed not to suffer of a big acne problem like most people I see</li>
            <li> My face looks so much better after only one application!</li>
            <li> For reference, I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s with light skin and considerable sun damage from my youth.</li>
            <li> I have used home peels before, and have gotten much better results with the HQ peel (instant tightening, some peeling, fewer blackheads).</li>
            <li> Well this was my first time</li>
            <li> And it just turned out red and nothing more; then I decided to wash my face to get over the burning feeling, which was unbearable.</li>
            <li> After that I decided to apply one more layer and keep the same.</li>
            <li> My skin turned into red and then most of the areas turned into brown in a day or so.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product first</li>
            <li> The problem areas where I left it on longer started to look more leathery and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> For real nothing happened!</li>
            <li> I would say the healing time you would mostly have is 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomed this to everyone who has acne and/or acne scars especially people who acne on their face.</li>
            <li> I just put on my first applications today</li>
            <li> Having had a VI Peel that cost me $350, I wanted to find a more affordable option with similar results.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that this product was more affordable.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it did burn a bit.</li>
            <li> I have always followed the instructions exactly (i.e. alcohol swab before application of gel) and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The first time, nothing happened (no peeling either).</li>
            <li> and it has done exactly that.  </li>
            <li> The acne scars and the two toned complexion was still evident.  </li>
            <li> It actually gave me a more even all-over peel than the one I paid $125 for.</li>
            <li> After Anesthetic Cream, I cleaned my face good; and applied Vaseline on the areas that I wouldn&#x27;t want this gel run and caused trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the same product but lower % TCA peel also very good just peeled less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first use, I experienced very little peeling, and none of it was in the areas of my face that it was most needed, so I went back and reread the product reviews, and one in particular caught my eye.  </li>
            <li> I liked this new addition to my facial regime.</li>
            <li> We can wait a little longer (not so long of course, just a minute or two more since there is already good amount of product on the skin).</li>
            <li> Cost a little bit more but makes huge differences.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some light peeling and my pores look a little better.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still be able to put moisturizer on and go out and about for the duration of most of the peel (at least for the first 4 or 5 days)</li>
            <li> About ten minutes later my cheeks were bright</li>
            <li> started with a 30% Glycolic Peel and then a 12% TCA peel (each for about $25), but they both were definitely a waste of time and money as far as getting a great \\&quot;Light\\</li>
            <li> I also liked the anti-inflammatory properties described in the product details because I have sensitive skin that can sometimes turn really red and</li>
            <li> smooth it on my freshly washed face, neck, upper chest, and hands, then I wait about 5-10 minutes, rinse it off, and then do it again, wait about 2 minutes and rinse.  </li>
            <li> I am an acne sufferer and after years of research, on my own, I know that acne is a three-pronged malady; it requires three conditions to form:  bacteria, skin that doesn&#x27;t completely slough off, and extra sebum.</li>
            <li> less noticeable sun spots drastically faded, my face is so smooth &amp; glowy!!</li>
            <li> I then rinsed with cool water for a minute, patted dry, and put on a light layer of coconut oil before going to bed.</li>
            <li> This new bottle seemed much more potent than the last one I bought awhile back.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle was 12% and this one was 15%--not much difference, I thought, but my skin thought otherwise.  </li>
            <li> The site was *very* helpful when I did my first 15% TCA application at home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to order from Perfect Image next time.. may be a stronger peel, but I recommend starting off with a weak peel and moving to a stronger one eventually .</li>
            <li> my skin is pretty much used to them.</li>
            <li> i believe that tca does help scarring in the long term but it can make it appear more severe immediately after the application.  </li>
            <li> I also use the other peels by these people, I feel like all of them do the same great job</li>
            <li> and I will continue using it since the product is so gentle, inexpensive, and it really works!</li>
            <li> My peeling is pretty much all done and</li>
            <li> My skin is super smooth afterward and it does not overly dry it out.</li>
            <li> At this point, I think I am pretty satisfied with this new addition to my facial regime.</li>
            <li> Fine lines seem less noticeable too, but I should&#x27;ve taken photo before to compare accurately.</li>
            <li> After words my face felt dry, but mostly my T-zone.</li>
            <li> I am not used to having peels and my skin is super sensitive; so why didn&#x27;t i feel anything when i put this on my face????</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong enough</li>
            <li> I bought this peel after trying a lactic acid peel and found it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just strong enough to turn over my skin</li>
            <li> Followed by Aloe Vera and my pure hyaluronic serum with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I tend to just breakout in certain areas and don&#x27;t need to use it like a mask</li>
            <li> I will wait to use any exfoliation products until I am certain that the majority of skin finished flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have acne scars &amp; large pores thinking it would reduce there appearance.</li>
            <li> I certainly will continue with this product.</li>
            <li> This product produces only very mild peeling that isn&#x27;t very noticeable  </li>
            <li> morning, my face was nice and tight.  </li>
            <li> I take a 2 week break between peels to let my skin recover; the melasma and fine lines are definitely going away.  </li>
            <li> Am using for fine lines and hyperpigmentation left over from pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It works best if you do little by little.  </li>
            <li> Tone is clearer, fine lines are diminished, and skin looks younger.</li>
            <li> Although I was only able to repeat the process once due to the burning sensations intensity magnifying upon the second attempt, I was very pleased to find that after three days, my face did peel.  </li>
            <li> I really like the consistency and the gentleness of there products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used peels often and really like this one.</li>
            <li> This saves so much money I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> long term conclusions as I just did my first one last week, but if you want a light peel for overall facial rejuvenation this one is great.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I woke up with my face intact the next morning.</li>
            <li> Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I used it this time, I did not notice as much peeling, so I think my skin has gotten use to this strength.</li>
            <li> I think I need a stronger % since my face sought peril that much.</li>
            <li> It does absolutely zip.</li>
            <li> results are very noticeable with this technique.</li>
            <li> you have any real skin problems, this is a must try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It brighten up whole face.</li>
            <li> but I felt my face wasn&#x27;t peeling as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> So I did my whole face;</li>
            <li> But my age spots, acne scars, and wrinkles are much reduced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not much visible redness after the peel (maybe because my skin is used to sunburn here in Florida.</li>
            <li> , I was very moved.</li>
            <li> i really like this peel.  </li>
            <li> peel my skin light because of the low dose.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> My doctor said anything I put on my skin doesn&#x27;t really affect the baby</li>
            <li> I cannot impress upon readers enough how important this is.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change except maybe some brightening and tightening.</li>
            <li> I was very cautious in my use of it.</li>
            <li> I like to speed up the after-peel by doing a gentle exfoliating wash twice a day (after 2 days).  </li>
            <li> It really does reduce the look of these spots.  </li>
            <li> and my face will get really flaky.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, gives my skin that boost and really makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> I can really feel it invigorating my skin as it tingles.  </li>
            <li> The product works very well for the price point.  </li>
            <li> ot really.</li>
            <li> 20% TCA Peel will produce a really Deeper and Thicker Skin Peel.</li>
            <li> Then the lactic acid peel was too much for me</li>
            <li> I decided to try it to see how much of a differance the peel would make on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just now used this product in December and it really works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> So it started healing and then peeling very soon soon.</li>
            <li> read the directions carefully, made sure the cleanse my face with isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re not supposed to exfoliate or pick at the peeling or anything (you don&#x27;t want to cause scarring, which you will do if the peeling isn&#x27;t done, so be careful), but truthfully I knew my peel was done on day 5</li>
            <li> This product is really helpfull for acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li> but I had to leave it on much longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with a gentle cleanser and then cleansed it with alcohol 2x.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like how I had to keep reapplying this stuff every 10 mins, just to try and get the peeling to work.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the TCA and salicylic blend.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much since I used this peel.</li>
            <li> I bought this about two months ago and use it twice a week, but I don&#x27;t see much change with my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely moisturise + lots of SPF, but no washing, scrubbing or soaking.</li>
            <li> I do have some melasma on my face that it really did not seem to even touch or fade much.........</li>
            <li> Remember, lots of sunscreen if you plan to be outdoors after the peel (and always of course) and a good moisturizer at least 2x a day.  </li>
            <li> I would say that if you can&#x27;t afford health insurance or a dermatologist visit; this peel is &#x27;Almost&#x27; as effective as prescriptiontretinoin in helping to remove dead skin build-up.</li>
            <li> (I have since purchased a glycolic peel with better results for that issue), but my pores appear smaller and this product keeps my skin clear 99% of the year when applied every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> far I have only completed the peel twice, and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Definitely do your research, read the directions and be careful and good luck.</li>
            <li> It does a good job at fading them, though it&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li> If you are new to peels I would recommend a lighter peel like a gylcolic or salcylic peel first.</li>
            <li> prepping, I spot treated areas that I felt needed more work, scars, dark spots, and large pores.  </li>
            <li> In addition, although I didn&#x27;t do so the first time, the second and subsequent times I used the product, I made sure to clense my face with rubbing alcohol, as the product instructions specify.  </li>
            <li> I have used peels in the past from Sephora; specifically, Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Daily pads (which were awesome by the way, just pricey), and Dr. Brandt Laser A-peel creme (which burned like a</li>
            <li> Fortunately, due to my background, I recognized the urgency to seek more care.</li>
            <li> I tried many other TCA</li>
            <li> I have eliminated most of my age spots and reduced some sharp lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> I was really apprehensive at first because my skin is normally so sensitive that it can&#x27;t even take 5% retinol products.</li>
            <li> In my experience it&#x27;s best to leave it on no more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have conbination skin, so I want a product that addresses both fine lines and lore pores/ minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> I actually got a little skin flaking here and there, like a very light light sun burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had done peels before but this one was strong enough to clear my skin from my acne outbreak.</li>
            <li> I usually schedule the peel so that my face peels in the comfort of my own home, so people won&#x27;t point and stare.</li>
            <li> So far, I like my first results.</li>
            <li> I use a blow dyer on low, cool setting to ease the stinging.</li>
            <li> (They are not bad, so I was hoping this product would be enough for them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My first and second peel was very mild as I ended up leaving the product on my skin for only 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> it got looser in consistency and less potent</li>
            <li> My cheek is still sagging but nasolabial folds are less prominent.  </li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve only used it once since I just got it recently.</li>
            <li> I am 44 now, and my skin has taken on that rougher texture (I hesitate to call it &amp;#34;ruddy&amp;#34; yet) of an older complexion.  </li>
            <li> However, when I did use it on a weekly basis my skin looked vibrant.  </li>
            <li> My main concern has been sagging, and I wanted to find ways to  tighten skin since then.</li>
            <li> A plus for such quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> positives: can be rinsed off with water; only mild tingling even at 4 minutes; did not damage or burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I see ZERO effect with this product.</li>
            <li> and so I did exfoliate GENTLY to remove dead skin and my skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> I did a total of 3 treatments but the first one was 15 minutes (apply on cheeks first</li>
            <li> (thickest area of my face plus most pigmentation), the next 20 minutes and the next 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> FYI, being that I am African American, I was at greater risk for hyperpigmentation, so</li>
            <li> but I quickly built up a resistance for it the 2nd time I used it</li>
            <li> However it is a very nice &amp;#34;lunch time peel&amp;#34; skin is left nice and pink with not much discomfort and little to no peeling if applied as the directions Recommend.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, dark spots are fading and overall skin texture is great.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and seller.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product line</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got a great peel with only one pass left on less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The third attempt was much more successful as I specifically targeted my cheeks and used two thick layers of the product, applied seven minutes apart, and being left on the skin for a total of 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> ok so im on day five and still a little peeling no redness.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to finish my old peel from this brand that I really like .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times now, and it really does clear your skin.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this i put too much on my cheeks turned white in seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth it as I do not want to take any risk of trying those cheaper products which may cause potential health</li>
            <li> This product effectively helped fade acne scarring on my cheeks: I used a tiny brush to apply on pigmented spots (only) and left it on for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Like the scar or dark spot might not be completely gone,but it lightens it for sure.</li>
            <li> First time in my life, I started using Microcurrent, LED light and Derma roller and spending time to look at my face in mirror everyday.</li>
            <li> Besides, it was fun to look at those brown sun spots being peeled in mirror while giving facial myself.</li>
            <li> After applying the second layer the burning does get pretty intense</li>
            <li> I tried it again a few more times and continued to feel like I was applying nothing but a syrupy water to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not very sensitive to smells at all, but this was so strong,  that I could barely breathe when it was applied.</li>
            <li> Really effective, deep peel without the down time</li>
            <li> However, the last couple of times I used this it just doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough anymore.  </li>
            <li> Although my acne has subsided in most part due to an accutane cycle I was on about 2 years ago, I was left with very stubborn acne marks and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> My new skin is super soft and feel and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> So far, I have done one treatment on both my face and hands, which has resulted in a good deal of flaking and skin sloughing, not to the point that I am raw or red (which is what I hoped for).</li>
            <li> The last time I used this, I left it on for 8 minutes (twice as long as the recommended maximum) just to try to get some kind of effect from it.</li>
            <li> After the new skin growing up, I will use \\&quot;Glycolic Acid 30% Gel</li>
            <li> Once your skin peels though the new skin is lighter and softer.</li>
            <li> As of right now it has only been 3 days since my first use of the product, but I cannot wait to see my next results in weeks to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After following the directions, I was pleased with the results, minimal peeling.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a middle deep (or even light) peel, you may want to look for a stronger percentage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective without irritating or drying skin too much.</li>
            <li> So your while you may take a minute to cover your whole face, your \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone gets 2 minutes contact time per pass plus the extra 1 minutes it took to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> Reading products description and their customer reviews is very important to make sure I will not put a wrong chemical on my face!</li>
            <li> The directions come in the box and are very clear.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for anyone suffering from adult acne.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this peel for people who want to maintain clear skin and tighten the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> Between having first teenage acne, then lovely early-twenties hormonal acne, I have the hyperpigmentation to show for it, as well as unpredictable cystic acne, blackheads, and general pustules.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can easily control the amount or depth of peel you see by starting with only a one pass peel of 1 to 3 minutes to see the minor effects of the 15% TCA peel first.</li>
            <li> My skin has not been this clear since I cant remember!</li>
            <li> I left it on for the recommended amount of time, but I suppose since my skin is accustomed to the other peels, it&#x27;s more resistant.</li>
            <li> , first class international stated it takes 8-11 days</li>
            <li> Please note, if you choose to use the product in the same manner I did, make sure you only use the rubbing alcohol before starting the application process.  </li>
            <li> I only do the alcohol wash before the first application.  </li>
            <li> I am almost done with this bottle and will definitely purchase another one, maybe even a higher concentration.  </li>
            <li> The first peel, I left on for the minimum time of two minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional chemical peels before, and this peel does the job!</li>
            <li> IS SO SOFT NOW!</li>
            <li> Although I am a first timer, I have been using daily peel products.  </li>
            <li> time, instead of washing, I applied more acid after small frosting spots appeared.</li>
            <li> I only applied the peel one time since it&#x27;s my first time using the TCA peel</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I could only keep it on for a couple of minutes or so as it burned, but my skin has built up a tolerance</li>
            <li> It is actually the first time I&#x27;ve tried this at home myself.</li>
            <li> The first time I left it on for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The next 3 days I just looked alittle crisp, like I had gotten a tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months and four treatments later, from my first purchase (August  2012)</li>
            <li> my  8\\&quot; scar is barely visible,  and I&#x27;m almost ready to wear sleeveless clothes again.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly and used it several times over a month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> first time for 45 seconds (because i was scared) and second time for 1 min 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Every time Ihave had great results, immediately smooth skin, a little peeling a few days after and less oily, less breakouts and overall better complexion.</li>
            <li> but then I got a glimpse of the new skin being revealed and I was completely amazed.</li>
            <li> A couple of days later after my first use, I had some peeling around the sensitive area around my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional TCA peels before, and this product works exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever found that has not only shrunk the pores, but is beginning to completely erase them.  </li>
            <li> I used cotton balls to apply the peel and Q-tips to apply the peel directly to scars (do the later first).</li>
            <li> The following week I left it on for the full 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked better than this product to remove dark spots on my back from acne.</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see how long I leave it on next week since I have this initial peel done.</li>
            <li> But no redness, no peeling, just a smooth, tight, albeit itchy face.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> and I still feel my face tight and smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with very little skin irritation compared to some other peels I have used.</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft and my pores have really gotten smaller.  </li>
            <li> A minute later I applied Pure Hyaluronic Serum and my moisturizing</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would diminish a large acne scar on my back.</li>
            <li> Large pores on T-zone looks smaller.  </li>
            <li> top of this, I&#x27;ve used various chemical peelers and still no significant effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I was expecting the 12% TCA to be significantly stronger than glycolic, but obviously less so than the 20% TCA solution.</li>
            <li> I have clear skin, but large pores, I now have clear skin and smaller pores.</li>
            <li> I find that it is strong enough to help with my skin where the other products were not.  </li>
            <li> When I did the first peel I didn&#x27;t see any results, but after the 2nd and 3rd peel I did notice a huge difference in the appearance of my dark spots and my skin over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I had given up hope, this product has helped me realize that I shouldn&#x27;t give up on my goal of having clear skin.</li>
            <li> With those two miracle products,  I wake up with plump, clear, and radiant skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this peel on my shaved scalp to help clear buildup to help prevent hair loss.  </li>
            <li> After hitting 51, I was shocked to find my nasolabial folds got more prominent</li>
            <li> While the lactic acid peel left my skin feeling refreshed, the TCA peel really made me shed.</li>
            <li> The old layers of skin began peeling off of my face.</li>
            <li> As a professional, Timeless is my trusted supplier of peels and serums.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The white heads are disappearing and my face is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so surprised that this product has shown any sort of results.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used it twice over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> ANother step is I have my fan near by</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simply amazed at how much clearer my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I have tried twice so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin--or so I thought.</li>
            <li> By the 7th day, I am ready for my next application.</li>
            <li> skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin is fresher and clearer and the tone is much improved.  </li>
            <li> I ave never delt with acne until my adult life</li>
            <li> my skin had developed an immunity to the combination and it didn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne during my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> At first my face was red but it went back to normal after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Even after 7 months of Retin-A treatment this product has done nearly its equivalent overnight.</li>
            <li> Near the end of time limit, I noticed \\&quot;icing\\&quot; or \\&quot;frosting\\&quot; in one area.</li>
            <li> Skin has natural bacteria living on it.</li>
            <li> So far.</li>
            <li> So far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, with an oily T-zone.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this peel about two months ago and have used it five times so far.  </li>
            <li> The fourth one I increased the time to four minutes and had burning over much of my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin too.  </li>
            <li> If you keep using it no doubt the scar will go away completely.</li>
            <li> and now all the scars are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look old and wrinkled anymore.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Next morning I woke up with much tighter, brighter and smoother skin, and I wondered why.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Skin Peel (although these two products were higher quality for the minor results they were suppose to accomplish - just no</li>
            <li> only CON is that it seems as though the peel is not even on areas because the application is not even (I&#x27;ve tried gauze pads but they absorb too much of the TCA gel; so I use cotton balls as the applicator</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, started on my neck and worked up.</li>
            <li> The real benefits were weeks later.  </li>
            <li> but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with hormonal acne for about 11 years now, and while much of that has subsided I am still left with pigmentation and</li>
            <li> About three days after my skin started some minor peeling, and I am pretty amazed by how the peel seems to target my problem areas because those are the only areas that really seem to peel on my face.</li>
            <li> the strength is low and sometimes do two whole rounds on the same day to really penetrate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, oily/combo skin, olive skin tone,</li>
            <li> The TCA instantly attacks the bacteria, allowing for the pimple to disappear/heal much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the scarring, but I only did one application.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t completely acne-free, but it looks a LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then applied a SPF 15, oil-free, sensitive moisturizer (Olay).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li> but it so far is working for me.</li>
            <li> I did not do the 1-2 week prep work of deep cleansing, retinols so this may be why I had to leave it on so much longer.</li>
            <li> it made me look old for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Even worked for my sensitive type of skin.</li>
            <li> and then i am stopping because i literally dont need anymore make up on my face anymore this product has completely done its job.</li>
            <li> After about 2 days my face was completely peeled.</li>
            <li> It is something that I can use frequently.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this and see how much my acne scars disappear.</li>
            <li> but I got better results on the trouble \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone area without having to do extra passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I washed it off with water, I did spray on my skin Aloe Vera to cool it down.</li>
            <li> areas\\&quot; like the \\&quot;T-Zone\\&quot; first so they have slightly longer \\&quot;contact\\&quot; times and will \\&quot;Peel\\&quot; slightly more, getting ride of the \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/2/2012</li>
            <li> About two days in the heavy peeling occurs, leaving a very fresh layer of skin.</li>
            <li> first to dry out my skin and prepare it</li>
            <li> Just like the massive pimples that left big dark scars are still kind of visible, but</li>
            <li> I have done maybe 2 skin peels in my life and in general have good skin for my age, per a dermatologist less wrinkles than average but more uneven skin tone than  average for my age.</li>
            <li> I could see improvement in the overall texture of my skin, particularly on my forehead and on my chin, where I had enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li> However, I admit buying into the myth women needing to look 21 when they&#x27;re 80 and had so much work, they barely resemble a human.  </li>
            <li> However, I admit buying into the myth women needing to look 21 when they&#x27;re 80 and had so much work, they barely resemble a human.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my neck and chest, and my chest in particular looks much younger with the perpetual redness now gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that the bottle of Perfect Image 12% TCA that I was sold is either fake, defective or past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times over the past couple months and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good peel.</li>
            <li> more than 20% TCA is recommended for dark skin because of the very high chance of resulting in even worse scaring and hyperpigmentation that you&#x27;re trying to fix in the first place.  </li>
            <li> and I had such high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> *(#* if you left it on too long, and the results weren&#x27;t as good).&lt;br /&gt;The price and the reviews seemed right, so I went ahead and got this.</li>
            <li> I have noticed slight changes in the appearance of the pigmentation on my face and the depth of scaring, and I can only imagine that sticking with this would show fantastic results in the coming</li>
            <li> This is a great product, not only improves acne condition but helps to reduce pore sizes and scars, i recommend it, tough read the instructions carefully</li>
            <li> But this stuff will last me a long time and is really strong, I only use a tiny bit at a time.</li>
            <li> Being a woman of colour, I was very skeptical about using the TCA peel, but I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li> My skin is very tolerant - it&#x27;s not sensitive to any products, I&#x27;m not prone to break-outs, and I don&#x27;t have sun damage, wrinkles or discolorations.</li>
            <li> I continued my normal skin care routine for the next 3 days, then repeated my 3-minute \\&quot;peel.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft after the first use and it did not burn or hurt my skin like other peels out there.</li>
            <li> I feel that if used regularly, it can help with fine lines and uneven skin color.</li>
            <li> no tightness,no peeling, i was certain i did something wrong and read some reviews and read that most people didnt get results unless they washed it off in between layers.</li>
            <li> My skin flakes a little at day 2 after the peel, and my skin is left smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I will use the new strength, level 3, the next time.</li>
            <li> With help of my brand new facial steamer, the lizard skin patch peeled after 5 days.</li>
            <li> I have to deal with dry skin now, but that&#x27;s much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> After I got out of the shower, I dry my face gently and apply my MD forte cream.</li>
            <li> My first time applying it left my skin sensitive and hot, causing me submerge my face in a sink filled with cold water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m running low and ready to try the 30% next.....</li>
            <li> Nothing that would be noticed if you went out in public, only if you looked really close in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will give it a few more tries and try not to rush the process.  </li>
            <li> (It was gentle enough for me to apply it a second time that day.).</li>
            <li> I left it on for 3 minutes and then put a layer over my whole face which I left on for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this peel being as effective as the one I had done at the medi-spa, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This peel is perfect.not too strong or weak.skin felt less dry using this.ill be reordering and telling my friends about this peel</li>
            <li> and they were easy enough, I didnt do a patch test I just went for it, so I washed and dried my face and wiped it down with witch hazel until it was dry and clean.</li>
            <li> And I have some major hormonal cystic acne issues sometimes.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to present day, I am still using Retin-A cream 7 months later and the scars have barely diminished.</li>
            <li> The major peeling for me started on the 8th day so</li>
            <li> This product definitely gives professional results!</li>
            <li> I do not really have any redness either just a little around sensitive areas such as the mouth, nose corners and top of cheek bone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some nice professional peels in the past, but it often took a few repeats to get the deeper peel I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The peel is deep and even if using a brush, however one needs to carefully prep (dilute and test 5%, then 10%, until you know what strength is right for you).</li>
            <li> and I would definitely not recommend anyone do this alone for their first peel attempt -- instead go with the 15% TCA Peel and do it for a minute or two as a single pass to see how it works</li>
            <li> No peeling at all, slight pinkish color right after, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> David Petrillo, (who I now believe is a reputable customer service representative) explained how their products are not like other peels, in that they arent harsh, but over time help to lighten scars.</li>
            <li> This really helps to brighten a dull complexion.i found it to be very gentle but effective.great to use at home.</li>
            <li> the pores on my cheeks and nose are more shallow and smaller.  </li>
            <li> Never having had peels, I started very slow and waited more time than suggested between peels.</li>
            <li> New and old acne scars are much smoother and less obvious with every treatment.</li>
            <li> highly highly recommend SUNSCREEN daily for a solid week after you use this if you are going to be out in the sun at all.</li>
            <li> But I am not sure this really did much.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was a lower acid concentration, but this peel was not nearly as harsh as any that I&#x27;ve tried at the spa, and I even did two layers when my esthetician only ever does one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really gave me the result I expected.</li>
            <li> You DO need to follow instructions carefully, not exfoliate beforehand, and NOT leave it on for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> After this, I resorted back to my old regimen of using Retin-A cream for my scarring.</li>
            <li> 7 - 10 days later, my skin was so inflamed, we had to leave  our vacation to Hilton Head early.</li>
            <li> My face was so swollen, I could not shut my left eye completely.</li>
            <li> Mine completely surrounded my left eye.</li>
            <li> Apparently, this product is supposed to work on the 1st layer of skin (epidermis.)</li>
            <li> this $30 product has cost me thousands (for wrinkles barely visible) in med. bills, CAT scan and 5 rounds of antibiotics, including IV antibiotics in the hospital.</li>
            <li> this $30 product has cost me thousands (for wrinkles barely visible) in med. bills, CAT scan and 5 rounds of antibiotics, including IV antibiotics in the hospital.</li>
            <li> It barely stings.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people starting out using peels or to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now, it does not bother me at all to go out with just my bare face.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is sensitive, I did patch test on my inner elbow and under chin.</li>
            <li> I only left it on for 2 minutes total as it began to really burn.  </li>
            <li> When I think how much money I have spent, $40-$70 a pop on those procedures, without ever seeing results I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t tried this sooner.</li>
            <li> It could be very drying so use it carefully until you know how you might react</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars and can do the exact same thing at home for the cost of what I used to tip my esthetician!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> draw.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived earlier than expected, prettily packaged with thorough directions, stressing safety.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This 12% is terrific for overall rejuvenation that leaves me looking normal.  </li>
            <li> I hate to write this review as I&#x27;m sure most likely the exception, unless you were a company to screen reviews.</li>
            <li> I hate to write this review as I&#x27;m sure most likely the exception, unless you were a company to screen reviews.</li>
            <li> my scars are not really that bad, so I figured as a first time chemical peel 15% would be decent, I watched and read review and for some this had amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> one of frosted spots must have stayed too long, I got new brown spot because of this. :</li>
            <li> I use sunblock regularly but usually do not reapply often enough.</li>
            <li> As a professional I want to underscore that my recommendations are for professionals only and I don&#x27;t advocate the general public use of these products.  </li>
            <li> It does not burn like other peels, and the dropper really makes application of the product easier.</li>
            <li> My forehead, chest, and neck are less sensitive to the peel than the rest of my face, so I apply it to those areas first, then wait a few minutes before applying it to my whole face.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews I had high expectations for this product, but after using it I must say i am disappointed.</li>
            <li> What to expect in the results reduced lines, dark spots, fine wrinkles, and a big reduction (almost elimination) of blackheads and other acne nastys.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very clearly sealed in the hard plastic with perforated dots around the neck of the bottle where you tear it away, yet the viscus liquid was never filled to the top.  </li>
            <li> I love using this peel to keep my skin fresh and resilient to all the bad things that are out in the world.</li>
            <li> you couldnt see that my skin was peeling but 3 days after i wiped my face with a black cloth and sure enough dead skin was on there.  </li>
            <li> I have spent loads of money of on treatments that don&#x27;t work this well and fast and for only $24.95, this productis</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little hesitant about the strength of the peel.</li>
            <li> It makes wherever you put it darker and a little crinkley too at first.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw little change although I did peel.  </li>
            <li> there was a slight more burn only felt like a light sunburn if someone touchs it.. washing it off with the cold water</li>
            <li> I tried this peel to try and lesson those dark spots and it really does work.</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but left behind several stubborn brown spots on my forehead and cheeks (that I have from the sun and birth control)</li>
            <li> 3 days after the 2nd application, I am getting some \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; that basically is like dry skin, but I haven&#x27;t had any new acne</li>
            <li> I am on day 4 now and my face is a little flakey but no real bad pealing.</li>
            <li> , i did a double layer, i am not new to using chemical peels, so if you are new to chemical peels, follow the directions well</li>
            <li> next time I will time it such that the major peeling falls on a weekend.  </li>
            <li> If you can tolerate a little pain for 10 minutes, you will love the long term effect of this product (I purchased 4% lidocaine lotion online, which helps a little).</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it two stars is that I did usually notice some very very very light peeling a few days after each use.  </li>
            <li> , I can control the peel, repeating every so often rather than one extreme peel at a high price.  </li>
            <li> I am using this to clear up my adult acne as well as treat the dark spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> (at least that&#x27;s where I get the mild peeling) without feeling like some sort of punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to peels I have used them for over 8 yrs at home and professionally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle but thick and highly moisturizing cream with  hyaluronic acid which brings plenty of moisture that is crucial for healing.  </li>
            <li> weeks later I repeated the process, and noticed that the hyperpigmentation was reduced by as much as 75 - 80% and the texture of my skin continued to improve, with a lessoning of the small acne bumps I had on the side of my face disappearing, and a marked reduction in the one or two cyst like acne bumps I had on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I read other reviews on TCA &amp; saw that it was normal.</li>
            <li> I proceeded with applying it to my face a few days later and strictly followed the directions, leaving it on for only 1 minute the first time.</li>
            <li> Since I used only alpha hydroxy in the past I did some reading and learned that alpha hydroxy acids are water soluble only, while beta hydroxy acid is oil soluble and is able to penetrate into the pore, which contains sebum, and exfoliate the dead skin cells that clog the pore.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was no where near strong enough to do anything to my skin.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to see how my skin will look after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> For my delicate skin it was just the right percentage.  </li>
            <li> I had a peel done professionally, but due to cost, I was looking for something with similar effectiveness but cheaper.</li>
            <li> days later I got NO results, but I did not panic but was ready to see peeling starts any day, for my skin felt very tight and looked glossy</li>
            <li> Just a suggestion on what facial parts to do first (start with your problem zones and work to your least problem facial zone</li>
            <li> I have had salon peels before, so I was familiar with the process, but did not want to do anything to make matters worse.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning, I noticed a dramatic difference: my skin was already more even-toned and some active cysts and pustules were going away.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used alpha beta peels, but this product is a much gentler way to obtain similar results.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t see any changes other than a slight tightening, the second and third peels about a week apart</li>
            <li> On receiving the TCA peel, I was very careful to first complete the patch test and see if my skin reacted in a negative way.</li>
            <li> It was scary to try out such strong chemical peel but made up my mind because of finding difference after leaving MD Skin Care&#x27;s Step 1 for 15 min.</li>
            <li> I had been using 12% very often past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a 35% Glycolic peel twice per week for the past year, and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any real improvement from that, I can feel it working when I apply it</li>
            <li> After I was done with the bottle my dark spots were completely gone.</li>
            <li> Of course this is not for long, I rinse the product off shortly after the \\&quot;heat\\&quot; begins.</li>
            <li> The minor peelings are the acne that is deep into your skin.</li>
            <li> Depending on how long I leave the product on(about 5 mins in face and 10 on my back and the backs of my hands)</li>
            <li> The pores on my cheeks and nose are obviously smaller and the overall appearance of my skin is completely different with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is not sensitive at all, and I have used the peel pads regularly, I do this peel once a week instead of the recommended 10 days --I</li>
            <li> Only thing is I believe it&#x27;s a little stronger than what was used on me before because for the first time, I actually peeled a little.</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sorry that it seems kind of I am advertising products here</li>
            <li> so if my face feels \\&quot;hot\\&quot; if you place your face near the fan it cools it down.  </li>
            <li> Mild enough to add a drop or two to your moisturizer to keep your poor tight and skin clear.</li>
            <li> After applying 4 days in a row, my skin looks dull and dry like after using strong astringent everyday without moisturizer for years.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s an okay in my book since my skin can be extremely sensitive and react badly.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been using this 12% tca gel peel for about 6 weeks, and have noticed a slight lightening in the melasma spots on my cheeks and lower jaw line.  </li>
            <li> Then the following morning my face was covered in these scaly dry patches.</li>
            <li> Slight peeling occurs about 3 days after use which leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I am an Aesthetician and so I was a bit skeptical about purchasing a peel that was available to the public.</li>
            <li> I use this less frequently than the Retin A</li>
            <li> In fact I never did get that peeling to work, and just left my skin so dry and wrinkley</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother and I had far less breakouts.</li>
            <li> For example, when you see bumps or dots before the yellow things on the center of an acne appear, the peel goes deep into your skin and cleanses it.</li>
            <li> Be aware, the 2 times you use it, your acne might get a little worse, but be patient; you will see the result very soon.</li>
            <li> I will DEFINITELY be re-ordering this product, since a single treatment at the derm is 3x</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the item in the past but this particular one came defected with the cap blown up.</li>
            <li> All I got however were two horribly large burn scars that forced me to eliminate almost all of my clothing choices and of course, a courtesy refund from the company.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little squeamish when it comes to chemical peels, so I was a little hesitant on trying ine outside of a doctor&#x27;s office, yet alone at such a high grade.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peel cleared up all active bumps on my face, ones that would have otherwise taken several weeks (possibly months) to subside, almost overnight.</li>
            <li> It went on nicely and didn&#x27;t burn too badly.</li>
            <li> Vinegar made my skin look better than this whicg is disappointing</li>
            <li> I alternate with retin a and have finally started seeing some dark spots lighten a bit.</li>
            <li> After two days, when wiping with alcohol to prepare for another peel, I finally saw dark spots from sun burn on the one side of my upper cheek</li>
            <li> it was a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Then I stood in front of the mirror deciding how long I should keep it on my face.</li>
            <li> A few things to note, I don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin but to have some sun spotting.</li>
            <li> I spent the entire trip inside.</li>
            <li> I tried a 2 minute pass followed by a second 30 second pass on the trouble \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone (nose and above eyebrows).</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone as long as you follow the directions, and always test your skin before (like the directions state).</li>
            <li> The only visible skin peeling I&#x27;ve seen was just a few small patches on my cheeks and around my mouth when I first started the product.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating Cleanser - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Green Tea Extract (Professional)]].</li>
            <li> If it continues to take this long to see results for my skin type/ damage I will look for something stronger.</li>
            <li> This chemical peel is not too harsh and it makes your face feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I will continue ordering from this company as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I got pink in the cheeks four days after doing a peel while using 30 SPF sunblock and only a couple hours in the sun.</li>
            <li> One bit of advice for layered or deeper TCA peels is to refrain from getting your skin wet/washed for as long as you can stand it after the peel has been applied.</li>
            <li> After decades of outdoor sports, and despite fairly consistent use of sunscreen, my pale skin has lots of freckles (which I don&#x27;t mind) and brown spots - freckles that have joined together to cause trouble (that I do mind).  </li>
            <li> this was not my first rodeo, I was utterly skeptical, extremely nervous, and had ambivalent feelings about putting myself in the same fololish situation that I did before, having not consulted with a professional.  </li>
            <li> i see a slight difference in my skin, i guess ill need to do another one to give a better view.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, the effect was so dramatic that,  compounded with Thanksgiving and Christmas over-indulging, my coworkers thought I was pregnant!!&lt;br /&gt;Saturday and Sunday following a peel I will see my skin begin to slough off</li>
            <li> I was left with extremely stubborn acne marks.</li>
            <li> These marks well were present a year later with little or no fading.</li>
            <li> I figured I would need something stronger than 12% ,but I read other reviews that recommended starting at a lower percentage and working up.</li>
            <li> I did not want to keep doing daily treatments of Retin A or Botox and was looking for other options.</li>
            <li> On the other hand he stated that there were no guarantees based on the depth of scarring that I was already left with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other peels such as glycolic acid</li>
            <li> I do feel the slight burn whenever I use it, and I feel that I break out less often, other than that I don&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> Nothing just dry skin applied spf facelotion</li>
            <li> I do this three times allowing for it to dry in between.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> My skin started looking dry and somewhat wrinkle-ish...</li>
            <li> : I started to peel, it just looked like dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is not a deep peel for me, but enough to take off the dead skin and make my skin look refreshed.</li>
            <li> I left it on only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So, my skin is not new to all those peels and treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little tight, but was of normal color.</li>
            <li> I also have hyperpignmentation and I spot treat by applying peel via qtip to only the dark spot.  </li>
            <li> After removing the peel with cold water, you will notice a significant difference in the texture and overall smoothness of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Me: Caucasian; aged 36; look younger than my age; hormonal melasma spots on forehead/ upper lip; few lines; some clogged pores at jawline.&lt;br /&gt;Looking to: tighten, lighten and unclog complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars, and these treatments left me with very minimal visible results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, except very faint fine crows feet next to my eyes.</li>
            <li> This peel seems to get down in deep.</li>
            <li> I would only suggest that you keep in mind that there is a down time</li>
            <li> I had previously used an 8% product from a different brand, and while this one was a bit less expensive, at a 12% strength, it felt less potent than the 8% product, so if I order again, I will shoot for a stronger peel.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product to help with slight acne scaring and sun damage, i followed the directions 100% and nothing happened, i felt slight tingles during the application and redness for 20 mins after, following 10 days later..</li>
            <li> 3 -4 weeks usage and still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> MD skin Care Alpha Bata Daily Facial Peel 2 steps system for past 10 days</li>
            <li> , Strivectin Over-night Facial Resurfacing Serum several times in past 6 months.</li>
            <li> I was slightly red for about a half hour afterwards, but this went away.</li>
            <li> Initially there was some burning and slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> My goal was to remove a few minor unsightly blemishes on my arm and inner thigh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Addition to my previous comment... I wanted to be clearer in my review for people who may have similar problems.  </li>
            <li> have gone back to using 35% Glyolic from Skin Laboratory, which burns slightly upon application, and leaves my skin feeling taut and scrubbed after washing off, so</li>
            <li> but I was afraid it would be too strong.</li>
            <li> It never fixed my acne scars nor other discolorations</li>
            <li> Followed the directions with no alterations and even layered the peels after I wash the previous peel, I only managed to get MINOR peelings!!!</li>
            <li> I used this with cerave moisturizer and had very limited peeling.</li>
            <li> little background about myself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 23-year-old male who has suffered from acne since I was 16.</li>
            <li> Although the Retin-A cream helps with cellular turnover, it only provided little help to my scars.</li>
            <li> (My basic skin concerns are uneven skin tone due to acne and also some minor rolling acne scars.)</li>
            <li> (I was careful applying with brush, and didn&#x27;t take a lot on one time, just a little by little), and then finally applied around the eyes leaving enough space between the eye area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that lose ugly feeling any more.</li>
            <li> I use stronger TCA for individual spots, but then I end up with brown crust, followed by peeling that lasts for days and finally red patches that at least can be covered by makeup.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have been using TCA peels on a regular basis at my beautician&#x27;s office for a few years.</li>
            <li> The peeling was minimal, nothing that caused anyone to ask what I had done.  </li>
            <li> In addition, there was absolutely no redness after use.</li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes and reapply peel for a total of three applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars in the salon</li>
            <li> I have used it several times a week on my face and hands for a a few months and never felt any sting.</li>
            <li> And a few days later you will see peelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully but ended up leaving the product on longer than stated in the directions.  </li>
            <li> In addition to lots of prescription products, I&#x27;ve spent a ton on facials and chemical peels.</li>
            <li> I repaeted the process a few minutes later seeing it said you could.</li>
            <li> but I was careful and used it when I wasn&#x27;t breastfeeding as often.</li>
            <li> It stopped the burning sensation within 10 sec, and I got relieved.  </li>
            <li> A day after applying the TCA, my face is brighter, the tone is evening out, and is minimally exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Also as I see the end results over the next few days I may give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> and I only peeled slightly a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I bought the salicylic acid wash that is recommended with this product; you use it for a few days prior to the peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and hope it is what I expected it to be like.</li>
            <li> No tingling, no tighteness, certainly no frosting.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, i have noticed that if you have any indented scarring on your face it can make it appear deeper right after you apply the peel.  </li>
            <li> This product is not strong enough to peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still have to use the nuclear stuff for the tough spots, but this is terrific for general use.</li>
            <li> The peeling is quite subtle and gives you a natural finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a young black woman and have lots of dark spots due to past acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want an extreme peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other peels before and none of them gave me a peeling effect like the TCA.  </li>
            <li> I layered and did 10 or so minutes - be careful though!</li>
            <li> Up until now, I lost hope for a cure other than spending thousands of dollars on laser surgery.</li>
            <li> When there was a break in the skin,(can be so small to view with the naked eye) bacteria can enter.</li>
            <li> I bought the product due to every review was 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought the product due to every review was 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Since I have a tolerance to salicylic acid and probably other chemicals, keeping it on longer does nothing</li>
            <li> I did as other reviewers have done and applied the peel for 15 minutes, rinsed and reapplied the peel again for another 15 minutes then rinsed.  </li>
            <li> but I am used to other peels</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week or rotate it with my other exfoliating acids.</li>
            <li> chose TCA because it says it goes deeper than other chemicals.</li>
            <li> As a result I haven&#x27;t had other bumps form either.</li>
            <li> Do consider other options.</li>
            <li> This Gel Peel doesn&#x27;t make you feel like your skin is burning unlike the other chemical peels that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I hope I did not do some damage I am not aware of yet</li>
            <li> than the traditional AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) peels in had used in the past.</li>
            <li> If you have done other peels before, then you will need something stronger than this.  </li>
            <li> This may seem &#x27;silly&#x27; at first, but wait till you order a product that comes to you and there&#x27;s no way to get the liquid out but to pour it.</li>
            <li> I dont how this would affect skin that has never experienced acid peels, but I have never had any down time with the particular strength.</li>
            <li> my peeling is very minimal.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li> After seeing that my skin didnt react badly, I decided to try and do a full face peel a few days later.</li>
            <li> A little background, i&#x27;m 42, olive skin, not sensitive skin, and it has been looking a bit rough lately after a long summer out in the sun.</li>
            <li> A minute of this gave me a very slight peel a few days later which I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have not done much exfoliating or Retinol the last 6 months because I was under the wrong impression that I had been actually making the pigmentation worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product has stopped the extreme oiliness of my skin, which has cut down the acne by a lot.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and nothing</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my cheek that has been hanging out for over a decade.</li>
            <li> I used the peel last year (late 2012).</li>
            <li> It shows no matter how much research is done and followed every instruction, inc. pre-test, it can go wrong.</li>
            <li> It shows no matter how much research is done and followed every instruction, inc. pre-test, it can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I brought this peel to help lighten my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use peel to get rid of dark sun spots and redness on T zone.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing how lighter dark spots would become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen a noticeable improvement in my overall skin quality since using this product for the past few months.</li>
            <li> This bottle was in the $30 range, and is enough for at least 10 peels.</li>
            <li> I used my usual moisturizer throughout the day and after only a few days, the peeling stopped.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, I have a problem with minor (sometimes worse) breakouts, and this is improving that as well.  </li>
            <li> i got it to fade my dark spots from post acne</li>
            <li> few months ago I spent $250 on laser pigmentation removal.</li>
            <li> Not great for highly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It also took a few tries to get the time down correctly for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I also cant wait to try out other products from this company!</li>
            <li> A few days later, it turned to be a little flaky (I left in on for 4 minutes in a thin layer)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black, but I&#x27;m not that dark</li>
            <li> Dark shade on cheek bones from sun damage is gone, acne scars are less visible.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the TCA for some slight dark areas on my face.</li>
            <li> No big deal, a very small sacrifice to make.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience nothing but slight soreness for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> Half of it became like scab and fell off.</li>
            <li> My age spot is now half</li>
            <li> I also have been using Olay Regenerist daily peel a few times in a month and NEUTROGENA WAVE Sonic lately.</li>
            <li> you have slightly longer \\&quot;contact\\&quot; with each pass done, on the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now a month and a half after the application.</li>
            <li> Since in my teens I had a serious problem with acne which led to deep acne scars on my face and of course discolouration.  </li>
            <li> After a few treatments, my dark spots appeared lighter.  </li>
            <li> I usually have rough skin so this was a godsend.</li>
            <li> The spots were lighter and the acne scars a little less visible.  </li>
            <li> little dry and dark spots looks little darker or just lost glow that I had lately.  </li>
            <li> The peel with make your skin feel tight for about 2-3 days, then you will start to peel.</li>
            <li> My face feels tight and</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, my complexion has cleared up and my scars and wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> After a few days I saw that my skin looks a lot clearer, it feels smoother, it&#x27;s even toned and my acne scars, which is my biggest problem, less visible.</li>
            <li> I have been doing at-home peels for probably about a year now - maybe a little longer.</li>
            <li> i was a little scared.</li>
            <li> a little while</li>
            <li> A little redness, but it cleared after about an hour.</li>
            <li> A little &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have had problems with cystic acne in the past and I feel this product helps in conjunction with other treatments.</li>
            <li> then that one it sting just a little</li>
            <li> I did feel a little burn/sting sensation but</li>
            <li> My skin is used to peels -- I had been using a weekly 20% salicylic acid peel, with little effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hello ,&lt;br /&gt;I used \\&quot;Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator\\&quot; with this product and it was so easier than little cotton balls; they take forever.</li>
            <li> Today is the 4th day and almost all gone, just little bit around.</li>
            <li> Felt  little burning and washed out immediately.  </li>
            <li> I had previously done a patch test on my neck with a 20% TCA serum and was shocked by the degree of burn that it caused - the patch test peeled like a snake for 10 days and remained red and tender for nearly a week after.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a big chicken when it comes to faces and possible peeling.</li>
            <li> , please dont waste your money like i did.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll update in a few days, fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I have always had skin that does not exfoliate as it should and have relentless trouble with whiteheads on my chin that seem to be underneath a layer of skin and never go away.  </li>
            <li> so I washed it off dried my face and applied again this time for 11 minutes</li>
            <li> anything to harsh.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months</li>
            <li> Although decreased in appearance, they were still very much present.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 5th round of antibiotics.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this.</li>
            <li> I also keep a bottle of baking soda and water there for neutralization if I get into trouble.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the hope of helping to remove the dead skin on my face.</li>
            <li> bought this product to help remove the dead skin cells on my face</li>
            <li> I use it on my knees and my acne scars and even a few scars I had from cuts or falling</li>
            <li> Dried my face</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely see a thin skin layer peel off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: Always start with the application on your \\&quot;trouble</li>
            <li> I tried a 2 minute pass three times, followed by a 4th and a 5th 2 minute pass on the trouble \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone area.</li>
            <li> Then I washed off it and gently dried and applied repair cream on my face, lots and lots of it.</li>
            <li> My under eyes are stretching, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes after I got rid of the brown and bruised dried skin.</li>
            <li> My pigmentation gets worse every summer esp on left side (car window side).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> My face did peel for a few days, but</li>
            <li> and I do use a few passes after a couple of minutes like it suggest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product was a waste of money and I threw the bottle away half-full.</li>
            <li> found that i preferred the above method over the all-over use, which worked, but I simply found the experience too unpleasant to repeat after two attempts.</li>
            <li> Make a dramatic change after one use but requires constant use.</li>
            <li> used this product every third week and noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It stings, but not that bad at first.</li>
            <li> I have used it 3-4 times in the past few months.</li>
            <li> My face never peeled but it felt very tight.</li>
            <li> and there, a few big acne scars, and am beginning to get some faint wrinkles too.</li>
            <li> quibble is with the dropper - the black markings do eventually come off in the gel and that&#x27;s sort of icky.</li>
            <li> so either 15% is really nothing, or I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> but I was really feeling bad with my face</li>
            <li> I usually leave on for 3 minutes every one to two weeks.</li>
            <li> Usually at the salon I get Salicylic or glycolic peels (I have acne)  </li>
            <li> The areas that were spot treated ended up with a small amount of frosting.</li>
            <li> I usually peel Thursday night, and by Sunday morning into Monday night</li>
            <li> I usually leave this on for about 4 min</li>
            <li> I have had peels in the past by professionals.</li>
            <li> I hate how it peels my skin, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> so I am not able to use it as often as I would like.  </li>
            <li> Skin usually starts to peel within a couple of days and is healed within a week.</li>
            <li> the time this TCA peel arrived, my skin was thinner than usual.</li>
            <li> This time, I used a bamboo stick to past the peel on my skin, since I didn&#x27;t like the feel of brush rubbing on my face.</li>
            <li> In the past I have received glycolic and salicylic acid peels from the spa&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was not sure how my face would react to it</li>
            <li> In the past I had always gone to professionals for a peel, but I will never spend $80 to $100 on that again.</li>
            <li> No more blackheads.</li>
            <li> It turned a little red until I washed it off with cold water, but there was no peeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall seeing a stronger TCA product from this manufacturer, which is too bad for me, but I will definitely check out their other products.</li>
            <li> I only let it sit on my skin for 1-2 minutes but by the next morning, the acne has decreased in size and doesn&#x27;t feel so painful.  </li>
            <li> This one you can hardly feel.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of this product but it did not do anything for my acne :(</li>
            <li> It can be used for at least six peels.  </li>
            <li> and I just started getting acne in my late thirties</li>
            <li> This has reduced it at least 80%.</li>
            <li> I left the peel on for 5-10 minutes and then rinsed my skin off for one minute using cold water</li>
            <li> It also helps with hormonal acne, which has been a challenge for me lately.</li>
            <li> If this results in anything negative I will update this review.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I had to start slowly with the time I allowed it to stay on my face.</li>
            <li> This peel is helping to slowly remove that spot.  </li>
            <li> So, there is no downtime - yet I can slowly see results.  </li>
            <li> Plus, a small amount is all you need, so the bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I took a chance hoping that this product wouldn&#x27;t fail me as the other one had</li>
            <li> Of course it is not perfect yet,I still have dark spots and some pores on my face</li>
            <li> I even had a really bad breakout that left a bunch of acne scars.</li>
            <li> Skin Peel, where your skin will peel off over 7 or so days similar to the peeling you might get with a really bad sun tan burn skin peeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this product again and this time it came in a thick gel form instead of a thin liquid.</li>
            <li> I have bad acne, and super bad cystic acne.</li>
            <li> and I did notice an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Since trying this product, I recommend other acne suffers</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until they do a TCA that is a little stronger!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical about this and was thinking 25 bucks seemed like a lot for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> --it is slightly viscous, like olive oil, so I have time to spread it around a bit (I am always afraid the peels will run into my eyes and mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> poor design of bottle.</li>
            <li> Washing with water made the pain even worse.</li>
            <li> Evened out skin tone and decreased lines.  </li>
            <li> I used a cotton pad to apply two thin layers of the peel to my problem areas.</li>
            <li> My blackheads has decreased about 70%.</li>
            <li> Another product I purchased was so thin and runny</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s wasteful, sloppy, and something you don&#x27;t need to worry about when buying from this company.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to get a sealed bottle that looked to be at least a third used.  </li>
            <li> Once I did the step of rinsing inbetween applications I saw a dramatic improvement.  </li>
            <li> It did not make any dramatic changes to my skin, although it was softer after the flaking.</li>
            <li> Skin on my chin seems to be peeling a little, but not like peeling like unrolling a sheet of plastic wrap or after getting bad sun tan.  </li>
            <li> I got this with the hopes that I could dull some of the bad acne scarring on my face.</li>
            <li> So I was a bit wary of ordering these kinds of peels from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had microdermabrasion treatments and peels done at a dermatologists, but they were too expensive</li>
            <li> and  I&#x27;m seriously ill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> I never dreamed it could lead to an infection so horrible to add the possibility I could actually die if these antibiotics don&#x27;t work.ttle for her birthday.</li>
            <li> and  I&#x27;m seriously ill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> I never dreamed it could lead to an infection so horrible to add the possibility I could actually die if these antibiotics don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was not the cure all I hoped it would be -</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and it is difficult for me to go without make-up.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> hence, the unfortunate result that got.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly, was packaged well and appeared to contain whatever it was claimed to have, BUT, sorry, it did not just work for me.  </li>
            <li> I also distributed the chemical in a very thin layer in order to be cautious.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch or what -- my skin isn&#x27;t so tough that it can withstand acid burns if I were to overdo it.</li>
            <li> For the expense (~$25 or so), it was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> rinsed with cold water over a minute before applying the neutralizer.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with cold water for about 2 mins and applied my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (your face won&#x27;t look burnt or crazy if you follow the directions).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my face and doesn&#x27;t even peel like crazy, which I like.</li>
            <li> nothing too crazy.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying a chemical peel to do at home, but this product has worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Started with one minute and the tingling wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> The peeling after the treatment was not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Face does peel away bad skin, spots, etc.</li>
            <li> It does not burn bad at all.</li>
            <li> Dose not make my skin peel as bad as Retin A. Can&#x27;t guarantee it will work for everyone</li>
            <li> However, my under eyes was bothering me so bad, after 10 or 15 days</li>
            <li> This time I used Anesthetic Cream on my face; I knew that the peeling would hurt my eyes so badly.</li>
            <li> Then my skin started pulling so bad, stretching my face, it hurt me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad bottle.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I couldn&#x27;t exchange it without a receipt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful, burning and itching tissue with exudate.  </li>
            <li> I am quite sick from the cellulitis.</li>
            <li> I am quite sick from the cellulitis.</li>

            <li> I was very unhappy with my skin texture and tone as well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as badly as the salicylic peels!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this was an awful product.</li>
            <li> LOTS OF FAKE REVIEWS HERE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> AWFUL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Peeling skin looks terrible with make-up applied on because it enhances the peeling.  </li>
            <li> Was horrible.</li>
            <li> 7 chemical peels followed instructions and cleansed with alcohol pads and still made my skin worst then before</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this peel after trying out Perfect Image&#x27;s 50% Lactic Acid Peel because I wanted to try something stronger. While the lactic acid peel left my skin feeling refreshed, the TCA peel really made me shed. My first time applying it left my skin sensitive and hot, causing me submerge my face in a sink filled with cold water. Then about four days later my transformation began. The old layers of skin began peeling off of my face. Success. Now the peel only burns if I don&#x27;t prep before the application. I usually schedule the peel so that my face peels in the comfort of my own home, so people won&#x27;t point and stare. After using it for a few weeks, my complexion has cleared up and my scars and wrinkles are less noticeable. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After having tried some of the other peels from Perfect Image (I liked them all) - this is my favorite.  I used this as maintenance for acne and some light wrinkles.  Works amazingly and is not as strong as my other peel.  I usually leave on for 3 minutes every one to two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been doing at-home peels for probably about a year now - maybe a little longer. I rotate between salicylic acid and glycolic acid - I&#x27;m up to 25% and 35% on those. I decided I needed something a bit more intensive to help with my acne scarring, because while I like those, they weren&#x27;t helping much with the texture of my skin. I chose this 12% TCA peel after doing some research, because I was scared to go right for the 25% and take the risk of my face falling off. But, I think I could&#x27;ve and probably should&#x27;ve went for the 25%, because I saw no results from this. No peeling at all, slight pinkish color right after, but that&#x27;s it. I left it on for the recommended amount of time, but I suppose since my skin is accustomed to the other peels, it&#x27;s more resistant. I think I&#x27;ll try more layers next time, because I don&#x27;t want to throw out a perfectly good bottle of product. **I&#x27;m not saying this product doesn&#x27;t work, and would suggest that beginners start here for sure. I just want to give a heads up to people who may be stepping up from lower level peels and want more visible results.</li>
            <li> This product was a gift to a relative.  She said she wanted this exact product, and I assume she has used this, and likes it.</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews for all sorts of peels I decided on this one.  It is a great light peel that can also be used for spot treatment.  It can be used for at least six peels.  My next purchase I am going to bump up to a higher concentration level.</li>
            <li> Have purchased from this seller before.  All great products.  Purchased this TCA peel and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Read reviews and instructions closely.  Had no problems, only great results.  Will be moving on to the 20% TCA next.  Just remember to follow directions exactly, and try a test patch first.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product to help with slight acne scaring and sun damage, i followed the directions 100% and nothing happened, i felt slight tingles during the application and redness for 20 mins after, following 10 days later.. absolutely NOTHING! no tightness,no peeling, i was certain i did something wrong and read some reviews and read that most people didnt get results unless they washed it off in between layers. i decided it deserved one last chance and still NOTHING! it was a complete waste of time and money. i cant believe i threw away $30 on this, please dont waste your money like i did.</li>
            <li> I always use the products on myself before I use them on my clients.  I really like the consistency and the gentleness of there products.  As a professional I want to underscore that my recommendations are for professionals only and I don&#x27;t advocate the general public use of these products.  As a professional, Timeless is my trusted supplier of peels and serums.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this i put too much on my cheeks turned white in seconds so i washed it off immediately. About ten minutes later my cheeks were bright red i was a little scared. The next day my cheeks were still red like i had sun burn. Day two it still was red and started to peel. now im on day three its peeling a lot but not as red. i&#x27;ll update in a few days, fingers crossed. ok so im on day five and still a little peeling no redness. i see a slight difference in my skin, i guess ill need to do another one to give a better view. i will say i like this tca peel better than the first brand i purchased. i will repurchase this one again for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used peels often and really like this one. My skin is super smooth afterward and it does not overly dry it out. Highly recommend this for anyone suffering from adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have never seen results like this from a product and i will tell you, i am so happy with how my face looks now. I will continue to buy these products.  It makes your face look younger and remove alot of imperfections like sun marks or acne.  I love this!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent facial peel!&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I do a peel I see&lt;br /&gt;improvements on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks brighter, more&lt;br /&gt;even skin tone and scars&lt;br /&gt;are fading! Just remember this is&lt;br /&gt;acid, so follow the directions&lt;br /&gt;on the bottle for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Usually at the salon I get Salicylic or glycolic peels (I have acne)  but I tried this one because TCA is supposed to go deeper into the layers of your skin. Maybe it was a lower acid concentration, but this peel was not nearly as harsh as any that I&#x27;ve tried at the spa, and I even did two layers when my esthetician only ever does one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it did work well and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a more gentle peel. I am going to order the Salicylic next, and if it produces similar results I will never get a facial again. This saves so much money I can&#x27;t believe it. I have spent hundreds of dollars and can do the exact same thing at home for the cost of what I used to tip my esthetician!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend also tried it (he has never done a peel before) and said his skin felt very fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No long term conclusions as I just did my first one last week, but if you want a light peel for overall facial rejuvenation this one is great. If you are doing the peel specifically for acne, I have had better success with Salicylic peels.</li>
            <li> I love this peel. I love the way it makes my skin look and feel. It is not a deep peel for me, but enough to take off the dead skin and make my skin look refreshed. I also use this in conjunction with their skin peel pads. I like the TCA/Salicylic acid combo.</li>
            <li> I purchased TCA 12% Gel Peel-Enhanced with Salicylic Acid&amp;Botanical Extracts last week, on Wednesday. By Friday morning I got it, so I could not wait until evening to try it. I have to say upfront that I did ViPeel 3 weeks ago, and have been taking care of my skin with a lot of love and care. Also, I have been using TCA peels on a regular basis at my beautician&#x27;s office for a few years. So, my skin is not new to all those peels and treatments.&lt;br /&gt;This is my experience with TCA 12% at home: I DID not do a patch test, for I am familiar with the peel. After I degreased my skin by applying 50% Isopropyl Alcohol 3 times I did apply the peel according to the peel procedure instructions, and kept 10 minutes until my skin became red (frost did not occur), washed it off. I repeated the application of the peel 3 times, and each times I kept it 10-15 minutes. After I washed it off with water, I did spray on my skin Aloe Vera to cool it down. A minute later I applied Pure Hyaluronic Serum and my moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;3 days later I got NO results, but I did not panic but was ready to see peeling starts any day, for my skin felt very tight and looked glossy (these are signals of readiness).&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 - chin, nose area! Day 5 - forehead, neck, chest! Day 6 - everywhere!!! Day 7 - clean skin, but most importantly MY 2 BROWN SPOTS on my left side are 90% GONE!!! I still cannot believe it. Thank you, my brain, that you did not follow to an advice of my beautician to use laser to remove those brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, 8 days later I performed the second peel. I did it once and kept 30 minutes until it became red. Followed by Aloe Vera and my pure hyaluronic serum with my moisturizer. Now, I am writing my review, and going to order that peel for my Mother to send it to Russia, and buy for myself a stronger percentage TCA peel, for my skin is ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please DON&#x27;T rush with higher percentage of TCA peel, be sure your skin is ready for this. Use that peel on a regular basis every 10 days to build up tolerance of the skin.</li>
            <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;TCA 12% did a great job. After reading various guides on TCA i did this 12% peel on myself. I did spot treatment with a tooth pick on my indented acne scars. Spots turned white (Frosted) and i washed TCA off with water. Frosting disappeared after 30 mins. Waited 2 days until skin peeled off by itself. Will continue to repeat peels ever 4 weeks for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;SHIPPING, first class international stated it takes 8-11 days but it turned out, I had to wait 30 business days!! until I got my product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product</li>
            <li> After an intensive research of chemical peel, I decided to give it a try. I really want to get my beautiful skin back to the look before it got suffered from sun damage and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have got sort of understanding on all kinds of chemical peels through my research. Reading products description and their customer reviews is very important to make sure I will not put a wrong chemical on my face! I then decided to stick on the peels from \\&quot;Perfect Image LCC\\&quot; as I believe this manufactory provides the best quality peels with incorporating natural plant extracts or organic ingredients. Cost a little bit more but makes huge differences. It&#x27;s really worth it as I do not want to take any risk of trying those cheaper products which may cause potential health risks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I planed to start from mild peel \\&quot;Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel\\&quot; for a couple of weeks to let my skin to get used to the acid and also exfoliate the surface skin. I will then use stronger peel \\&quot;TCA 12% Gel Peel\\&quot; to remove the outer damaged layer of the skin. After the new skin growing up, I will use \\&quot;Glycolic Acid 30% Gel Peel\\&quot; to stimulate skin promote collagen and even skin tones and texture as another period of treatment. So I have bought these three kinds of peels and had patch tests to where the skin I want to treat. They really gave me the result I expected. The quality of the products is obviously! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve only used it once since I just got it recently. I was really apprehensive at first because my skin is normally so sensitive that it can&#x27;t even take 5% retinol products. So when I tried it, I put only three drops in the palm of my hand and dabbed it all over my face. I could tell it was working when I felt the immediately stinging sensation. Then I stood in front of the mirror deciding how long I should keep it on my face. After a minute or so, I started to panic when it dawned on me that I might have to go to school with a red face the next day. I washed it off. Fortunately, I woke up with my face intact the next morning. My face never peeled but it felt very tight. the palm of my hands, surprisingly, started to peel after three days which I didn&#x27;t mind. Overall, it was a good first try and I am glad that I took precaution with this new product. From now on, I&#x27;ll use it only on weekends so that my skin would have time to recover should anything happened. I think I&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome peel. I&#x27;ve had done peels before but this one was strong enough to clear my skin from my acne outbreak. Since I have sensitive skin I only left it for 2 minutes and I didn&#x27;t peel. I think I will use it every 3 weeks from now on.</li>
            <li> I tried doing the peel twice, following all instructions and I can honestly say it did nothing.  Second try I even left it on for 10 minutes, not even a tingle.</li>
            <li> This peel is quite intense but works great on my acne prone oily skin. I have purchased it twice already.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist had recommended this product to me and so far I am very pleased with it!  I was looking for a gentler or milder tca peel since with previous experience, have found that higher percentages are not always best in improving my skin conditions.  The instructions were simple to read and follow.  It had all the instructional steps laid out nicely on the insert card.  Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any down time, which I have generally experienced with higher strength peels.  I like that it has soothing botanicals in the formula (thank goodness for those!), which I think has helped in the overall appearance of my skin.  So far, I have been using this 12% tca gel peel for about 6 weeks, and have noticed a slight lightening in the melasma spots on my cheeks and lower jaw line.  After the peeling process, I noticed my skin was actually more clear and smooth than before I had started.  This product has helped my skin tremendously and I hope they keep selling it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to peels I have used them for over 8 yrs at home and professionally. From glycolic to the VI peel.This peel does what its suppose to. If you suffer from oily acne skin with post hyperpigmentation this may be the peel for you. If you are new to peels I would recommend a lighter peel like a gylcolic or salcylic peel first. This peel compares to the VI peel which I have done and I got the same results. You do peel lightly over 3 - 4days but the result is even tone smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;use sunblock and dnt force the peeling. use mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product is not strong enough to peel. The skin was flaking a couple days after the first use but then it it stopped working after that.</li>
            <li> I am a young black woman and have lots of dark spots due to past acne breakouts. I tried this peel to try and lesson those dark spots and it really does work. When I did the first peel I didn&#x27;t see any results, but after the 2nd and 3rd peel I did notice a huge difference in the appearance of my dark spots and my skin over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I am really satisfied with this product and will keep using this strength in the future.</li>
            <li> I decided to try an at home chemical peel after having experienced a increase in hyperpigmentation due to acne.  After reading various product reviews, I decided to try the TCA 12% Gel Peel, because I liked what people had to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first use, I experienced very little peeling, and none of it was in the areas of my face that it was most needed, so I went back and reread the product reviews, and one in particular caught my eye.  One reviewer mentioned using the product for 10 minutes, washing it off, then repeating the process two more times.  I waited 10 days before attempting this method.  Although I was only able to repeat the process once due to the burning sensations intensity magnifying upon the second attempt, I was very pleased to find that after three days, my face did peel.  I could see improvement in the overall texture of my skin, particularly on my forehead and on my chin, where I had enlarged pores.  In addition, although I didn&#x27;t do so the first time, the second and subsequent times I used the product, I made sure to clense my face with rubbing alcohol, as the product instructions specify.  Please note, if you choose to use the product in the same manner I did, make sure you only use the rubbing alcohol before starting the application process.  If you use it in between the steps, you are going to burn your face badly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later I repeated the process, and noticed that the hyperpigmentation was reduced by as much as 75 - 80% and the texture of my skin continued to improve, with a lessoning of the small acne bumps I had on the side of my face disappearing, and a marked reduction in the one or two cyst like acne bumps I had on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue to use this product, and would recommend it to anyone who like me, really wants to experience excellent results, without the added expense of a salon visit.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t peel at all. No burining no redness. Just very light peel for me&lt;br /&gt;I tried it 3 times. Once a week cuz no peeling so I add more layer n stay longer each week. :( disappointed</li>
            <li> I have always had skin that does not exfoliate as it should and have relentless trouble with whiteheads on my chin that seem to be underneath a layer of skin and never go away.  I have used AHA (alpha hydroxy Acid) products like creams and scrubs, which do help some but the problem persisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I started a peel regimen with Perfect Image TCA 12% Gel Peel and after just two weeks, I was already seeing improvements. The white heads are disappearing and my face is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this TCA 12% Gel Peel because it contains salicylic acid (beta hydroxy). Since I used only alpha hydroxy in the past I did some reading and learned that alpha hydroxy acids are water soluble only, while beta hydroxy acid is oil soluble and is able to penetrate into the pore, which contains sebum, and exfoliate the dead skin cells that clog the pore.  Beta hydroxy acid is better used on oily skin with blackheads and whiteheads. This certainly makes the TCA Gel Peel the perfect choice for me.  I also liked the anti-inflammatory properties described in the product details because I have sensitive skin that can sometimes turn really red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have discovered chemical peels that I can do at home and then to see so quickly that the Perfect Image TCA peel actually works.  I can hardly wait to see how my skin will look after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used all the peels in the perfect image line, and after trying all different companies, I am a customer for life! Their products are top quality, customer service is great, products are relatively inexpensive...and my skin has never looked better!! Thanks for the great product line, and keep up the good work :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my spa for a while and it works great, awesome resurfacing peel, improves fine lines, wrinkles and acne scars!</li>
            <li> This new bottle seemed much more potent than the last one I bought awhile back.  The first bottle was 12% and this one was 15%--not much difference, I thought, but my skin thought otherwise.  I got a great peel with only one pass left on less than 5 minutes.  I&#x27;ve had TCA peels at dermatologists&#x27; offices for many years, so knew what to expect.  This product allows me to do lighter (but still very beneficial) more frequent peels than just a once-a-year deeper peel with a good 7-10 days of downtime.  Peels are not a one-time fix.  For me, even w/ a deeper peel, the best effects rally last only a month or so, so finding this product has saved me LOTS of money and helped me keep up my aging skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite peel. I prefer it over 20 or 30% salicylic acid peels. It seems to be gentler.</li>
            <li> Product was great.  No issues whatsoever.  My face is looking so great with the help of this product.  I have dark skin and nothing more than 20% TCA is recommended for dark skin because of the very high chance of resulting in even worse scaring and hyperpigmentation that you&#x27;re trying to fix in the first place.  So if you are dark skinned this 15% is perfect.  Yes, you will have to apply several, like 4-5 treatments, to get those fabulous results people talk about, but you can go as often as weekly-ish if your skin doesn&#x27;t react poorly to it.  Highly recommend this product and seller.  For more help with using TCA read reviews at RealSelf.com.  The site was *very* helpful when I did my first 15% TCA application at home.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my cheek that has been hanging out for over a decade. Since treating it with this product 3 times it is lighter than with any (retin-a, hydroquinone, kojic acid, etc.) other product I&#x27;ve used.  My pores look cleaner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After prepping, I spot treated areas that I felt needed more work, scars, dark spots, and large pores.  Then after 3 minutes I spread the peel all over my face with a synthetic fan brush, and let it sit for another 2-3 min before rinsing thoroughly with cool water.  The areas that were spot treated ended up with a small amount of frosting. The peeling was minimal, nothing that caused anyone to ask what I had done.  When I pointed it out to a friend, she said it looked like I had a bit of a sunburn.  Each time it took about 7 days to finish peeling.  I am so surprised that this product has shown any sort of results.  I used to do AHA, lactic acid, and mandelic acid peels.  None of them provided what this has.  I will finish this bottle up, and get the next strength up.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for around 8 years and have done several rounds of accutane treatment... and to my horror my acne came back.&lt;br /&gt;On top of this, I&#x27;ve used various chemical peelers and still no significant effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peel is AMAZING !!&lt;br /&gt;Ive been able to do the peel on a Saturday and go to university without having to worry about my skin flaking off during the day. It tightens your skin and gives it a good finish. The peeling is quite subtle and gives you a natural finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to order from Perfect Image next time.. may be a stronger peel, but I recommend starting off with a weak peel and moving to a stronger one eventually .</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this worked great for me. Started with one minute and the tingling wasn&#x27;t so bad. The redness didn&#x27;t last either. I was worried about it. A minute of this gave me a very slight peel a few days later which I was looking for. Didn&#x27;t want an extreme peel. I just use it to lightly shed the outer layer of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. Have no complaints. Great product. See results the more you use (once a week).  Goodbye sun spots and scars!</li>
            <li> I used the peel last year (late 2012). My skin peeled a lot, and the texture of my skin changed (was smoother). When I used it this time, I did not notice as much peeling, so I think my skin has gotten use to this strength. Therefore, I will use the new strength, level 3, the next time. I believe it will work better.</li>
            <li> Im 23, with ligh tan african/american skin... I bought this for some acne marks on my face my scars are not really that bad, so I figured as a first time chemical peel 15% would be decent, I watched and read review and for some this had amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Day 1- It arrived on time about a week after purchasing I read the directions and they were easy enough, I didnt do a patch test I just went for it, so I washed and dried my face and wiped it down with witch hazel until it was dry and clean. I put the peel all over my face and let it sit there for 5 minutes.. I did not feel a burn at all... so I washed it off dried my face and applied again this time for 11 minutes there was a slight more burn only felt like a light sunburn if someone touchs it.. washing it off with the cold water I felt more of a burn and decided to not do anymore layers because this is my first time. After words my face felt dry, but mostly my T-zone. Which I was disapointed beause my scars on on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2- Nothing just dry skin applied spf facelotion&lt;br /&gt;Day 3- same as day 2&lt;br /&gt;Day 4- I can start seeing peeling skin from my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Day 5- I washed my face and got most the peeling skin from my nose and that was basically it.&lt;br /&gt;It really didnt make any noticiable difference with my face, BUT it did make my skin smooth lol now I just add a little to my face mask, because it did make my skin look nice even though it didnt peel. Im going to try it on my mother who is 49, and ligh/fair skinned maybe it will work better for her. :)</li>
            <li> I noticed fairly immediate results with this product. I noticed that I had to start slowly with the time I allowed it to stay on my face. By the end of the bottle I could tolerate up to 10 minutes and a second application. I will purchase again but wil probaly use a higher acid level. Great price, especially when compared to salon treatments.</li>
            <li> Had no peel whatsoever. Maybe I just need to use a higher percentage acid. I guess it just depends on your skin.</li>
            <li> I liked this new addition to my facial regime. I use it once a week and can feel some of the &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; sensation which tells me that the solution is doing its job. A couple of days later after my first use, I had some peeling around the sensitive area around my nose. Also, the pimple I had then shrunk the next day. So far I have used it twice over 2 weeks. My face is on its good days. I have to try this over time to know how effective it will be. At this point, I think I am pretty satisfied with this new addition to my facial regime. Hopefully the effects after continued use will be as good as I had hoped when I bought this.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this was an awful product. It clears up the acne&lt;br /&gt;for a little while but the acne comes back. This was my first time&lt;br /&gt;using any kind of peel. So I went with a low strength because I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;want anything to harsh. My skin didn&#x27;t peel, at all. I don&#x27;t have bad&lt;br /&gt;acne and I just started getting acne in my late thirties so I assumed&lt;br /&gt;this would do the trick. This product is good for maintaining acne&lt;br /&gt;if its moderate acne. But it will have to be used weekly and from&lt;br /&gt;now on.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product. Gentle, yet effective. Would definitely buy again in the future. The price is also not bad.</li>
            <li> One of the best i&#x27;ve ever used, takes about 4-5 days for peeling to start, stay inside while it happens</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the TCA peel from Perfect Image for a few months now and I can truly say that it has worked wonders for my face.  To someone with problematic acne, acne scars, and hyper-pigmentation, this peel is truly a godsend.  I&#x27;ve tried other peels before and none of them gave me a peeling effect like the TCA.  Unlike my glycolic and salicylic peels which only caused light shedding, the TCA peel caused my whole face to peel within days and was more affective towards removing scars and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little squeamish when it comes to chemical peels, so I was a little hesitant on trying ine outside of a doctor&#x27;s office, yet alone at such a high grade. But this was a breeze. Was easy to apply no severe sensation or anything. A little redness, but it cleared after about an hour. First I thought it was a dud seeing as tho I didn&#x27;t experience nothing but slight soreness for about 2 days. Then the following morning my face was covered in these scaly dry patches. Kinda freaked out a lil but I read other reviews on TCA &amp; saw that it was normal. Within about a week my face had fully shedded &amp; man was I impressed! smile lines were less noticeable sun spots drastically faded, my face is so smooth &amp; glowy!! I can&#x27;t stop touching it! Wish I could use as a daily treatment, but to be safe I&#x27;ll stick to a 90 day period. Going to purchase the latic formula &amp; see how that works on a bi-weekly routine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product althou it&#x27;s only 12% it&#x27;s strong enough and you see results instantly I give a 10</li>
            <li> Following directions is key.  Great advice from poster who indicated that she applys alchol first to degrease as intructions state.  But the best advice was apply, rinse with water, then reapply.  THat made a tremendous difference for me.  I have applied peels before and I was wondering why it was not working as well as it did before.  Once I did the step of rinsing inbetween applications I saw a dramatic improvement.  I also have hyperpignmentation and I spot treat by applying peel via qtip to only the dark spot.  ANother step is I have my fan near by so if my face feels \\&quot;hot\\&quot; if you place your face near the fan it cools it down.  Of course this is not for long, I rinse the product off shortly after the \\&quot;heat\\&quot; begins.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, very well made and priced. It has minimized my pores and exfoliated my skin giving me a flawless smooth look. It has also helped erase any acne marks or blemishes on my face. I will be buying this product again, I love it! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this peel and i think it is alsmost as good as the professioinal peeling product i get at a spa, however, i have noticed changes in consistency of the product after 1 year.. it got looser in consistency and less potent, i guess it is time to reorder : )</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple peels--glycolic, lactic, kojic, Jessner--and this one is by far my favorite.  TCA does not make my face turn red the way lactic acid does, and peels evenly revealing a very smooth surface underneath.  The salicylic acid helps out with the occasional blemish.  I am on my second bottle, and also bought one as a gift for my sister (who loves it too!).  If you are hesitant to try TCA, don&#x27;t be!!  I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I like this peel and have done about 5 of them. You can repeat the process every week or so as it is not very harsh and it is good because it has the salicylic acid which is good for acne. I did get flaking after leaving it on for 5 minutes. The second and third times I did this peel I layered and did 10 or so minutes - be careful though! It did not make any dramatic changes to my skin, although it was softer after the flaking. The flaking and dryness stayed with me for two weeks though- be sure to moisturize! There is a lot in the bottle (about 20 peels) and it is a good value. When I finish this, I&#x27;m going to move up a level in percentage to about 20-30. Overall, a good mild peel that does result in skin improvement after a month or two of weekly use.</li>
            <li> It worked well enough for me. I think I need a stronger % since my face sought peril that much.</li>
            <li> I used this hesitantly because its TCA. After following the directions, I was pleased with the results, minimal peeling. I would say that the solution is likely buffered and not close the same as an in office peel. However; with regular use, it could be a great maintenance program.</li>
            <li> The instructions claim that you should ONLY put this on your skin for 30 seconds to start. There are warnings that it can burn and that your skin will peel. Well, I wanted it to have some strength to it, but it is *totally* inert/benign. It does absolutely zip. I can put it on my face and leave it for 10 minutes and it has zero effect. I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch or what -- my skin isn&#x27;t so tough that it can withstand acid burns if I were to overdo it. I got the 15% (one of the lowest percentages) because of the warnings about what TCA peel can do -- so either 15% is really nothing, or I got a bad batch. For the expense (~$25 or so), it was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the item in the past but this particular one came defected with the cap blown up. It could be a shipping issue, I am looking to reorder in the future. Looking forward to finish my old peel from this brand that I really like .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times now, and it really does clear your skin. You DO need to follow instructions carefully, not exfoliate beforehand, and NOT leave it on for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, USE SUNSCREEN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be a good once-a-week peel. I&#x27;m being very cautious with it, though, as it is extremely strong. I&#x27;m simply amazed at how much clearer my skin looks. Used with caution, this is a much better result than any over-the-counter product.</li>
            <li> I KNOW EVERY BODY &#x27;S SKIN IS DIFFERENT I PURCHASE THIS FOR SKIN DISCOLORATION I HAVE ON MY LEGS BUT THIS PRODUCT DIDN&#x27;T DO NONE FOR MY SKIN MAY BE I&#x27;LL TRY A DIFFERENT ONE&#x27;S</li>
            <li> I love using this peel to keep my skin fresh and resilient to all the bad things that are out in the world. I use a fan brush to apply it and it  goes on perfectly evenly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> After 10 years of paying for a esthetician, I can duplicate the same results at home. Of course, my initial fear was ruining my skin with the personal &amp;#34;hands on approach&amp;#34;. But I believe my results surpass any treatment that I have hand prior. In addition, there was absolutely no redness after use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months and I have noticed that my skin has been improving. Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> does nothing although I kept in on for hours and used several days in a row... not even any pealing</li>
            <li> This product effectively helped fade acne scarring on my cheeks: I used a tiny brush to apply on pigmented spots (only) and left it on for about 5 minutes. I did this weekly. I estimate that the marks faded about 30-40% with six months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that i preferred the above method over the all-over use, which worked, but I simply found the experience too unpleasant to repeat after two attempts. (I&#x27;m not tough!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a lighter option from Perfect Image for future use.</li>
            <li> I used the Glycolic previously but this TCA is the best!  I followed the procedure that another review indicated.  I put three layers on, 1 to 2 minutes apart.  I wait 30  minutes, wash it off and do the whole thing two more times.  I only do the alcohol wash before the first application.  I can&#x27;t wait until they do a TCA that is a little stronger!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this peel after trying a lactic acid peel and found it wasn&#x27;t strong enough. Before trying this one, I read through all the reviews. My technique for use is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face with a mild cleanser, I use Clinque or Neutrogena in the bar form.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply Isopropyl Alcohol(50%) with a cotton ball as a pre-peel prep. I do this three times allowing for it to dry in between.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply the peel and wait 10 mins. Rinse face thoroughly with cool water (pay particular attention to the hairline. Wait a few minutes and reapply peel for a total of three applications.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a light moisturizer after peel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are very noticeable with this technique. A few things to note, I don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin but to have some sun spotting. This has reduced it at least 80%. The peel with make your skin feel tight for about 2-3 days, then you will start to peel. Peeling lasts 2-3 days and can be minimized with a good moisture cream. I have been doing the peels once a week and taking every third or fourth week off in the rotation. What to expect in the results reduced lines, dark spots, fine wrinkles, and a big reduction (almost elimination) of blackheads and other acne nastys.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle!!! Follow the directions, and in 4-6 weeks your skin will look amazing. I have clear skin, but large pores, I now have clear skin and smaller pores. This is the ONLY product I have ever used and achieved results like this for minimizing my pores.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any real skin problems, this is a must try.&lt;br /&gt;Might just be the best personal product I have ever purchased, that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> This product works great and my wife asks me to apply it to her often because of the great results. Definitely read the directions and test first, but it&#x27;s a great product and the company has good shipping and packaging</li>
            <li> The product does the job great. Make sure you follow the instructions to get the best result.&lt;br /&gt;If you do it correctly, the result can be very good, and much cheaper than going to the spa.</li>
            <li> I was worried about doing an at home peel, but this product surpassed my expectations.  It was comfortable--not too stinging--and yet each application has produced great results.  I have used this twice, every two weeks, with no burning and improved skin texture and tone each time.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alayne</li>
            <li> A little &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve had this product before and it was liquid.  This one was liquid with granual-like pieces in it.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product. My acne blemishes disappeared in abt three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It was amazing. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars in the salon an never had results like this.</li>
            <li> I have tried twice so far. I am mid thirty asian. My skin is oily and pimply. It worked great on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st time.&lt;br /&gt;Applied all over my face. It brighten up whole face. GIrls that I work with noticed and said my skin is getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd time&lt;br /&gt;Just applied on my age spot on my cheek. Half of it became like scab and fell off. My age spot is now half gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd time&lt;br /&gt;I used on some scars that I have on my leg, the marks are now thinned and not as visible. Short-pants and skirt look good on me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to wait to do whole face till fall as where I live I am under strong sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is very mild. I have used it several times a week on my face and hands for a a few months and never felt any sting. I alternate with retin a and have finally started seeing some dark spots lighten a bit. I&#x27;ve had some light peeling and my pores look a little better. I have sensitive skin--or so I thought. Wish I had bought the 20 percent but I was afraid it would be too strong. After using this up I will use the stronger peel.</li>
            <li> Gel peel made my skin peel, then scar went away.  That simple.  3 -4 weeks usage and still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> I have been using a salicyclic acid peel for about 2 year, I was using another product off amazon which worked great as well. I tried the 100% salicylic by Perfert Image and really liked it but I felt my face wasn&#x27;t peeling as much as I wanted. I did some research and I wanted to try TCA peels. I do like the product but I prefer to have the stronger 100% salicylic acid over the TCA Gel Peel. I have had problems with cystic acne in the past and I feel this product helps in conjunction with other treatments. Luckily, I have gotten my face under control and use the acid peels to keep my fresh looking fresh and get rid of any lingering scars. Perfect Image in definitely a good brand and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Excellent .i&#x27;ve just used once. But i&#x27;ve really good result. My acne scars are almost gone</li>
            <li> Followed the directions with no alterations and even layered the peels after I wash the previous peel, I only managed to get MINOR peelings!!! It never fixed my acne scars nor other discolorations BUT!!! It does &amp;#34;Prevent&amp;#34; acne!!! The minor peelings are the acne that is deep into your skin. For example, when you see bumps or dots before the yellow things on the center of an acne appear, the peel goes deep into your skin and cleanses it. And a few days later you will see peelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, This peel is for people who look for Acne prevention NOT FOR color correction for scars and such. I honestly would recommend this product even though it did not solve my problem.</li>
            <li> there is no solid cap for this bottle. it has only a rubber dropper on top which you can see in the pic. now i have to figure out a way to ship this item back without further spilling. poor design of bottle. i could not even use it.</li>
            <li> LOTS OF FAKE REVIEWS HERE!!!!!! Don&#x27;t let them fool you</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions that came with this product, but it just didn&#x27;t work at all for me! I even tried it a couple of times to see if things changed--but nothing happened! I even did what a reviewer on here suggested, but it felt like if I was just applying water onto my skin. I&#x27;m going to try another brand, because this item right here didn&#x27;t do what it was suppose to do. And $30.00? It&#x27;s not even worth 5 CENTS! SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to get a sealed bottle that looked to be at least a third used.  The packaging was very clearly sealed in the hard plastic with perforated dots around the neck of the bottle where you tear it away, yet the viscus liquid was never filled to the top.  The dropper was also ballooned out and full of air, looking like it was suffering from some strange pressure situations or that it wasn&#x27;t in top form.  I applied it last night and it did tingle/burn like it was supposed to.  I haven&#x27;t experienced an actual peel or any peeling yet, but my pores and skin tone looked nice when I woke up in the morning.  I just don&#x27;t believe the value is here in a product that we are supposed to use liberally if the bottle isn&#x27;t even full.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with this bottle and will definitely purchase another one, maybe even a higher concentration.  Results were good and easy to use.  I have used it weekly.  Slight peeling occurs about 3 days after use which leaves skin soft.  By the 7th day, I am ready for my next application.</li>
            <li> So I was a bit wary of ordering these kinds of peels from Amazon. I have used peels in the past from Sephora; specifically, Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Daily pads (which were awesome by the way, just pricey), and Dr. Brandt Laser A-peel creme (which burned like a *(#* if you left it on too long, and the results weren&#x27;t as good).&lt;br /&gt;The price and the reviews seemed right, so I went ahead and got this. The first night I did a patch test; my skin tolerated it just fine. So I did my whole face; no burning. I rinsed it off and noticed right away my skin felt tighter, and it was alot smoother. The next day I decided to do it again; this time, doing a double layer. It did burn a bit, mostly when I was washing it off. But no redness, no peeling, just a smooth, tight, albeit itchy face.&lt;br /&gt;But my skin looks freakin&#x27; amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have some big pores here and there, a few big acne scars, and am beginning to get some faint wrinkles too. And I have some major hormonal cystic acne issues sometimes. I found that peels do help with the acne in a big way. So I&#x27;m hoping this one will too.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is something you should get if you have the aforementioned skin problems. It&#x27;s a no brainer!!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so soft, I can&#x27;t stop feeling it!! :)</li>
            <li> Skin looked great after one use. Loved the feel after using the product. Make a dramatic change after one use but requires constant use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would diminish a large acne scar on my back. After almost three weeks of using the product the scar has faded quite a bit, and I expect the scar to be almost completely gone after a couple of more weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li> After using this, my skin did feel smoother but I was hoping it would help with post hyper-pigmentation inflammatory scars. It&#x27;s not too strong and didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects on my skin so that&#x27;s an okay in my book since my skin can be extremely sensitive and react badly. I say give it a try if it sounds like something you need.</li>
            <li> This peel is great!  It&#x27;s easy to use for a beginner and does the job!  I do recommend following the directions that come with the bottle to make sure you are getting the best level of peel possible with out damaging your skin.  Once you get used to it, you can work up your minutes.  Plus, a small amount is all you need, so the bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> For my delicate skin it was just the right percentage.  This would be excellent use on African American skin like myself.</li>
            <li> I got this with the hopes that I could dull some of the bad acne scarring on my face. I have only used it once so far but saw a nice difference in the reduction of the redness in old acne scars and it tightened up my face nicely. I used this with cerave moisturizer and had very limited peeling. I could have gone to work the next day and say I got a bit sunburned on the beach. I only had it on for 30 seconds to a minute. I plan to do it once a month for a bit and see how it does over time!&lt;br /&gt;If you have patience and realize that this is a process, not a one time fix all, then you will love it!</li>
            <li> Didnt do nothing for my skin I had to order one that was more percentage then that one it sting just a little but it didnt help what I wanted off</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product out.  I took accutane about a year ago and still have some light scarring on my cheeks.  I have used this product probably four times now.  I would wash my face, cleanse it with an alcohol pad, and then apply the product.  There was no burning whatsoever.  It felt like I just put water on my face.  Nothing happened.  I would always use it two or three times each time I used it.  The only reason I am giving it two stars is that I did usually notice some very very very light peeling a few days after each use.  But I am not sure this really did much.  I will not be repurchasing.  If anyone has suggestions, I am all ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with acne-like symptoms since I was a teenager....now I&#x27;m in my 50s.  The most troublesome aspect is blackheads....this product helps remove the outermost layer so that products to help get rid of and prevent those pesky blackheads can get in.  I saw almost immediate results.  I followed the directions carefully but ended up leaving the product on longer than stated in the directions.  I had zero adverse impacts.  This is a good product to start with if you use peel products.  Using anything stronger without some experience using a milder product may end up hurting you.</li>
            <li> I used this peel 4 times and yet to see results. Vinegar made my skin look better than this whicg is disappointing</li>
            <li> I use this once a week as part of my skin care regime. Softens lines and clarifies skin tone. Always use caution when using home peels!  I have used several over the years, so my skin is pretty much used to them. I dont how this would affect skin that has never experienced acid peels, but I have never had any down time with the particular strength. Highly recommend this product line</li>
            <li> This Glycolic Acid Peel has really helped to clear up my face and give it a nice glow. It went on nicely and didn&#x27;t burn too badly. I didn&#x27;t actually peel, but I did see results. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this gel peel 4 times since I ordered it and followed the directions word for word each time. Every time Ihave had great results, immediately smooth skin, a little peeling a few days after and less oily, less breakouts and overall better complexion. Make sure you follow directions and you will get great results.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne and sensitive skin for years and now age is catching up to me. In addition to lots of prescription products, I&#x27;ve spent a ton on facials and chemical peels. No more!  After reading the reviews here, I thought I would give this a try. I&#x27;m SO glad I did. It does exactly as promised, with a gentle formula, a great smell and a low price.  Depending on how long I leave the product on(about 5 mins in face and 10 on my back and the backs of my hands) my peeling is very minimal. But my age spots, acne scars, and wrinkles are much reduced. I have fewer breakouts and my pores look smaller and &#x27;cleaner.&#x27;. Overall, my skin is fresher and clearer and the tone is much improved.  I use the peel one time a week for 6 weeks and then wait 2-3 months and repeat the process. Just follow the very complete directions included and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a great review about this product and have been thinking about doing the peel myself for a long time. Finally have time to order the TCA peel, at first wasn&#x27;t sure how strong I should go with so I start with the 12%. It turn out to be perfect concentration for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much visible redness after the peel (maybe because my skin is used to sunburn here in Florida. But after 4-5 days I can feel the peel and my skin is super smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I think I may be inlove. I have bad acne, and super bad cystic acne. I ave never delt with acne until my adult life and I have tried everything! I have only used this product once. I left it on my face for 30 seconds then rinsed it off. I repaeted the process a few minutes later seeing it said you could. The second time I didn&#x27;t want to tempt burning my face, so I only left it on for 2 minutes. I am on day 4 now and my face is a little flakey but no real bad pealing. BUT OMG WHAT A DIFFERENCE to my face, acne pretty much cleared up and I am loving it. Will keep updated can&#x27;t wait to do it again.</li>
            <li> Between having first teenage acne, then lovely early-twenties hormonal acne, I have the hyperpigmentation to show for it, as well as unpredictable cystic acne, blackheads, and general pustules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product after reading the reviews to help fade my acne scars (which are smooth and discolored, not pitted or raised). I followed the instructions (definitely degrease your face with isopropyl alcohol!) and left it on for 3 minutes. I did not get frosting (I did not want frosting, since I do not have the luxury of 7 days recovery time). I then rinsed with cool water for a minute, patted dry, and put on a light layer of coconut oil before going to bed. My skin felt a little tight, but was of normal color. When I woke up the next morning, I noticed a dramatic difference: my skin was already more even-toned and some active cysts and pustules were going away. I continued my normal skin care routine for the next 3 days, then repeated my 3-minute \\&quot;peel.\\&quot; It just keeps getting better and better! 3 days after the 2nd application, I am getting some \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; that basically is like dry skin, but I haven&#x27;t had any new acne form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respect the acid and moisturize! I will DEFINITELY be re-ordering this product, since a single treatment at the derm is 3x the price of this whole bottle!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really strong, and ive been using some really strong stuff on my face. I&#x27;ve been using the most potent benzoyl cream as well as tea tree oil, the combination worked amazingly well for a long time, not sure if it was exactly healthy on my skin but got rid of all breakouts.&lt;br /&gt; my skin had developed an immunity to the combination and it didn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This stuff is really powerful, it will make you peel. You&#x27;re suppose to use it as a mask.. which you could and it works well, but you&#x27;ll be peeling and drying out a lot. I&#x27;ve been using this just as a spot treatment for when i start to see something coming up, or in areas where I tend to break out, and it works great. The next day the area isn&#x27;t even inflamed anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this and was thinking 25 bucks seemed like a lot for a small bottle. But this stuff will last me a long time and is really strong, I only use a tiny bit at a time. Depending on your skin I guess you could use it differently. I tend to just breakout in certain areas and don&#x27;t need to use it like a mask so that&#x27;s what I do. I also cleanse first with tea tree oil, and sylistic acid pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have been using proactiv or their stuff but your body has built up a tolerance I&#x27;d definitely try this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at home peel for several years.  I had some reservations about doing it at home but if you follow the directions you will have beautiful results.  Another reviewer mentions cleaning the skin with alcohol before applying the 12 % TCA solution.  I did not the first time and my results were a bit spotty.  The second time, I did the alcohol cleanse, removing all traces of oil on the skin and the results were beautifully even... my skin was just fresher looking, the tone much more even, and it seemed to respond to my nightly cleanse and products so much more with the dead skin cells removed.&lt;br /&gt;You could spend 10 times the amount of these products at a spa for the very same result.  I also like that by doing this at home, I can control the peel, repeating every so often rather than one extreme peel at a high price.  I use this product about every 2-3 months for ongoing results.&lt;br /&gt;The directions are very clear and the price is very fair and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and highly recommend it. I trust this company!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying a chemical peel to do at home, but this product has worked wonders. The reason for considering a peel is to reduce some acne scarring and enlarged pores. I have had microdermabrasion treatments and peels done at a dermatologists, but they were too expensive and I couldn&#x27;t have them done often enough to see results. I have used this product 3 times with 10 days in between each treatment. And I&#x27;m overly impressed with the results. New and old acne scars are much smoother and less obvious with every treatment. The pores on my cheeks and nose are obviously smaller and the overall appearance of my skin is completely different with minimal irritation. I have recommended this product to my parents who are both now regularly using it. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background about myself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 23-year-old male who has suffered from acne since I was 16. I&#x27;ve had numerous bouts with prescription medications, creams, cleansers, dermatology visits, accutane, facials, peels...you name it. Although my acne has subsided in most part due to an accutane cycle I was on about 2 years ago, I was left with very stubborn acne marks and hyperpigmentation. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne during my early 20&#x27;s so I decided accutane was my best solution. After the accutane cycle ended, so did my breakouts. However, my battle with acne was not so easily won. I was left with extremely stubborn acne marks. To my avail, I figured these marks would fade over time. Boy was I wrong! These marks well were present a year later with little or no fading. After this, I resorted back to my old regimen of using Retin-A cream for my scarring. Although the Retin-A cream helps with cellular turnover, it only provided little help to my scars. Although decreased in appearance, they were still very much present. Fast forward to present day, I am still using Retin-A cream 7 months later and the scars have barely diminished. Up until now, I lost hope for a cure other than spending thousands of dollars on laser surgery. That&#x27;s when I discovered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is incredible. I used it the first night it came in the mail. I followed the instructions and left the product on for about 2 minutes then washed it off. At first my face was red but it went back to normal after 30 minutes. The next morning, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. My hyperpigmented scars have diminished noticeably then they ever have with any treatment I have used, and this was only OVERNIGHT. Even after 7 months of Retin-A treatment this product has done nearly its equivalent overnight. I have spent loads of money of on treatments that don&#x27;t work this well and fast and for only $24.95, this productis a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking in the mirror and emotionally, I was very moved. After I had given up hope, this product has helped me realize that I shouldn&#x27;t give up on my goal of having clear skin. As of right now it has only been 3 days since my first use of the product, but I cannot wait to see my next results in weeks to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect Image, I am forever in your debt. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I used it for once or twice. The problem I had is that the rubber nipple was somehow eroded by the content and has a big hole on it, The liquid was leaking out and turned rusty color. I did not want to use it anymore. I contacted the seller who told me that they could send me another rubber nipple, which would not solve the problem at all. I throw the bottle away. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> i really like this peel.  it&#x27;s great for an overall, healthy glow and to freshen up your skin.  unfortunately, i have noticed that if you have any indented scarring on your face it can make it appear deeper right after you apply the peel.  i believe that tca does help scarring in the long term but it can make it appear more severe immediately after the application.  if this is not an issue for you, then i think this is a great peel from a reliable company and i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional TCA peels before, and this product works exactly the same.  Follow the package directions, and watch the fine lines and brown spots disappear over time.  How awesome to pay a fraction of the price I was paying at the skin clinic!  I take a 2 week break between peels to let my skin recover; the melasma and fine lines are definitely going away.  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I had researched and read every 80 5 star reviews at the time of purchase. According to the research, it is supposed to work best on fair skin. I&#x27;m a blue-eyed blonde. I read and followed the directions exactly. Although I&#x27;m fair skinned, I rarely have any problems with skin creams, cleansers, etc. I applied the solution according to instructions. Near the end of time limit, I noticed \\&quot;icing\\&quot; or \\&quot;frosting\\&quot; in one area. I immed. rinsed with cold water over a minute before applying the neutralizer. Approx. 7 - 10 days later, my skin was so inflamed, we had to leave  our vacation to Hilton Head early. I spent the entire trip inside. My face was so swollen, I could not shut my left eye completely. I had 2 doctor visits followed by a recent trip to the E.R. where I was diagnosed with peri-orbital cellulitis, an infection and inflammation of skin cells. Mine completely surrounded my left eye. It had the appearance someone had punched my eye. It&#x27;s painful, burning and itching tissue with exudate.  Apparently, this product is supposed to work on the 1st layer of skin (epidermis.) Skin has 3 layers, Second layer is the dermis, followed by sub-cutaneous. When the white \\&quot;icing/frosting\\&quot;  appears, it indicates the product has gone deeper to the 2nd or 3rd layer. This is what occurred with me. Skin has natural bacteria living on it. When there was a break in the skin,(can be so small to view with the naked eye) bacteria can enter. I had to receive IV antibiotics, a CAT scan to rule out Ocular Cellulitis which would have lead to emergency surgery. I&#x27;m on my 5th round of antibiotics. I&#x27;m also a Reg. Nurse. Fortunately, due to my background, I recognized the urgency to seek more care. I&#x27;m sure the co. is worried about a lawsuit. I have no intentions to file, as I realize there is always a risk, regardless of number of 5 star reviews. Nothing is ever 100%. In fact I gave the rest to my best friend who loved it. She has a darker skin tone and brown eyes. I even bought her a second bottle for her birthday. According to statistics, most love the product. I was the exception.  Just because everyone seems to file a lawsuit over anything (person who sued McDonalds because her coffee was too hot or they made some kids fat comes to mind.) It shows no matter how much research is done and followed every instruction, inc. pre-test, it can go wrong. So far. this $30 product has cost me thousands (for wrinkles barely visible) in med. bills, CAT scan and 5 rounds of antibiotics, including IV antibiotics in the hospital. I used it in Sept &#x27;12. It&#x27;s 1/2013 and I&#x27;m still recovering. Perhaps it&#x27;s time to stop worshiping youth, listening to double standard ads (40 yr. males are distinguished and females, a travesty to look our age.) I feel it&#x27;s fair to add my personal opinion to the product review. However, I admit buying into the myth women needing to look 21 when they&#x27;re 80 and had so much work, they barely resemble a human.  ADDEMUM: I&#x27;m writing this from my hospital room. I&#x27;m receiving the 2 strongest IV antibiotics made, one being vancomycin. I hate to write this review as I&#x27;m sure most likely the exception, unless you were a company to screen reviews. I never had that impression. I am quite sick from the cellulitis. I&#x27;ve had 3 CAT scans now and  I&#x27;m seriously ill. I bought the product due to every review was 5 stars. I sincerely hope you print my review. God help you if you did not print unfavorable reviews.  My medical bills will be astronomical. I&#x27;m sorry. I wish I had never purchased this product. I never dreamed it could lead to an infection so horrible to add the possibility I could actually die if these antibiotics don&#x27;t work.ttle for her birthday.

            <li> I have been doing chemical peels at home &amp; at the spa for YEARS now. I know what it feels like to have a peel and a TCA peel at that. This one you can hardly feel. It feels like alcohol on your face. It barely stings. You should get frosting from a peel like this and NOTHING. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this. AWFUL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have done the PTR peel pads and loved them, but felt like I needed to move it up a notch to get my skin where I want it to be.  I am 44 now, and my skin has taken on that rougher texture (I hesitate to call it &amp;#34;ruddy&amp;#34; yet) of an older complexion.  Since my skin is not sensitive at all, and I have used the peel pads regularly, I do this peel once a week instead of the recommended 10 days --I smooth it on my freshly washed face, neck, upper chest, and hands, then I wait about 5-10 minutes, rinse it off, and then do it again, wait about 2 minutes and rinse.  Only the second time I do it do I get some light tingling/burning.  I still don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; just some really light flaking here and there--mostly around my mouth.  My skin looks much younger and the pores on my cheeks and nose are more shallow and smaller.  In fact I am so happy with this product that it is a planned stocking stuffer for all the females who don&#x27;t want to look their age on my Christmas shopping list...including myself.  ;-)</li>
            <li> seem to be working perfectly. peel my skin light because of the low dose. but it work the way it suppose to.</li>
            <li> You need to know how to use this product..but it is great for the skin. Makes your skin beautiful and smooth</li>
            <li> no burn and no peel after 6 minutes.  . my skin is very soft and my pores have really gotten smaller.  i am very happy with this product and looking forward to using the next stronger peel.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, with an oily T-zone.  This peel helped lessen the bumpiness and wrinkles and my skin looked refreshed. I was flakey for 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and packaged well.  Very detailed instructions included and product was easy to use.  I am on my 2nd Peel and the results have been great.  Will order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I had used a TCA peel of 25%, and although it did not sting, I was too skittish to leave it on my face longer than 4-5 minutes. The results were non evident. I decided to try this product because of the lower level of TCA and the blend with salicytic acid. The purity of the ingredients was another draw.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived earlier than expected, prettily packaged with thorough directions, stressing safety.&lt;br /&gt;I followed them to the T and left the product on the maximum time, although I did feel a bit of a sting.&lt;br /&gt;When I washed it off, my pores were tightened, and my face looked clearer. There was no redness, no sign of peeling. Since I have a tolerance to salicylic acid and probably other chemicals, keeping it on longer does nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;I do use the product. more like a strong astringent then a peel. I would recommend this to people starting out using peels or to those with sensitive skin. If you&#x27;re looking for a middle deep (or even light) peel, you may want to look for a stronger percentage. I don&#x27;t recall seeing a stronger TCA product from this manufacturer, which is too bad for me, but I will definitely check out their other products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having a baby and having cystic acne from hormonal imbalance.  I only let it sit on my skin for 1-2 minutes but by the next morning, the acne has decreased in size and doesn&#x27;t feel so painful.  I gave it 4 stars because it is not recommended that you use it while breastfeeding (which isn&#x27;t stated on the product info page).  My doctor said anything I put on my skin doesn&#x27;t really affect the baby but I was careful and used it when I wasn&#x27;t breastfeeding as often.</li>
            <li> I am very experienced with glycolic peels and this is my first experience with this peel.  I did as other reviewers have done and applied the peel for 15 minutes, rinsed and reapplied the peel again for another 15 minutes then rinsed.  This peel DOES NOT HURT!!!  I was amazed that I was not uncomfortable at all during this peel process but I am used to other peels so maybe my face can take it.  I applied the peel on Tuesday night and by Friday morning, my face started to peel and continued to peel all the way through Tuesday.  The peeling started on my chin and around my lips, next came my cheeks and the forehead was last to peel.  I did attend my daughters&#x27; soccer games on Saturday and should have worn sunscreen but I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be as hot as it was (I am in Texas.)  I don&#x27;t leave a ton of reviews here on Amazon but I can honestly say that this is the best peel I have ever used since my entire face ended up peeling whereas other peels have only managed to make parts of my face peel.  I will definitely purchase this again :)</li>
            <li> Never having had peels, I started very slow and waited more time than suggested between peels. Am using for fine lines and hyperpigmentation left over from pregnancy. After three uses, I definitely see hyperpigmentation fading and expect it to get better after more uses. Fine lines seem less noticeable too, but I should&#x27;ve taken photo before to compare accurately. I would definitely recommend it and I&#x27;m a big chicken when it comes to faces and possible peeling.</li>
            <li> I purchased this peel about two months ago and have used it five times so far.  READ AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. I cannot impress upon readers enough how important this is.  It is your face we are talking about. That said, I did read and re-read directions, as well as, many reviews on Amazon before taking the plunge.  I have had salon peels before, so I was familiar with the process, but did not want to do anything to make matters worse.  I am a female age 51 with freckles, aging and wrinkles from sun damage in my youth and darkening under my ears at the jaw line from pregnancy. The first peel, I left on for the minimum time of two minutes and I really didn&#x27;t see any changes other than a slight tightening, the second and third peels about a week apart, I left on for three minutes and three and one-half minutes respectively.  I had mild burning at my forehead line. I didn&#x27;t see much change except maybe some brightening and tightening. The fourth one I increased the time to four minutes and had burning over much of my face. Mild Peeling began in about four days and my freckles were some lighter. I just completed the fifth one about three days ago, leaving the product on for the max. of five minutes. There was significant burning this time. I should have set up the dryer as others have suggested. I just fanned my face and of course, it subsided once I washed it off.  My face feels tight and I know there will be more peeling. My freckles are lighter still. I like this product. I was very cautious in my use of it. Don&#x27;t get in a hurry.  It took years for your face to show problems.  They won&#x27;t disappear overnight. I will probably use this strength once more and then move to a stronger peel.</li>
            <li> I brought this peel to help lighten my dark spots.  After a few treatments, my dark spots appeared lighter.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> The product is great! It&#x27;s just strong enough to turn over my skin but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either.  I have sensitive skin too.  I use acetone (recommended by an esthetition) first to dry out my skin and prepare it and then I started for just a minute of the peel a couple months ago and now I&#x27;m up to 6 minutes with the peel.  Highly recommend it.  It saves time and money!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite peel. It&#x27;s effective without irritating or drying skin too much. It helped me to improve tonality of the skin and control breakouts. For wrinkles, I use a stronger 20% TCA formulation but because of the downtime it requires, I can only use it twice per year. 15% TCA is a perfect balance between effectiveness and tolerance, no downtime, once per week regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a peel every two weeks since I bought this product four months ago and I love the results.  I usually peel Thursday night, and by Sunday morning into Monday night I&#x27;m peeling.  I like to speed up the after-peel by doing a gentle exfoliating wash twice a day (after 2 days).  I am latin and have very fair olive toned skin.  Remember, lots of sunscreen if you plan to be outdoors after the peel (and always of course) and a good moisturizer at least 2x a day.  I like to apply fresh aloe vera from my backyard as a mask to better my results.  I&#x27;m running low and ready to try the 30% next..... will update!</li>
            <li> This stuff works like a champ.I use it about once a week or rotate it with my other exfoliating acids. Do follow the directions. I would even recommend a patch test. I usually leave this on for about 4 min and I never leave the bathroom (water source for rinsing). I also keep a bottle of baking soda and water there for neutralization if I get into trouble. I rotate the types of acids I use so my skin does not get used to any of them.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne with congrsted pores and sebacious filaments. this helps keep those yuckies at bay! It also works great with mild acne scars but be patient!  It works best if you do little by little.  Having said that, you don&#x27;t have to keep this on long to see great results.  The first time I used it I followed the directions to the T and even my oblivious husband noticed how smooth my skin was! Follow this with Cerave cream in the tub. It&#x27;s a gentle but thick and highly moisturizing cream with  hyaluronic acid which brings plenty of moisture that is crucial for healing.  With those two miracle products,  I wake up with plump, clear, and radiant skin.  I now use this about 2X a month and every 4-5 days I alternate between a 30% glycolic acid and a 40% lactic.  If you want to maintain results I recommend st Ives exfoliation pads for daily use.  They have I think 3-5% lactic acid and work great!</li>
            <li> This product is great for age spots or scars.  It really does reduce the look of these spots.  I had them on my face where I would not go anywhere without makeup.  Now, it does not bother me at all to go out with just my bare face. (except of course moisturizer.)  I am now proud of my skin at age 55.</li>
            <li> I have had peels in the past by professionals. So I know how it is suppose to feel. This product does not feel like that. But, I did notice some peeling just not what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the hope of helping to remove the dead skin on my face. I am an acne sufferer and after years of research, on my own, I know that acne is a three-pronged malady; it requires three conditions to form:  bacteria, skin that doesn&#x27;t completely slough off, and extra sebum. These three issues work together to create a perfect environment for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to help remove the dead skin cells on my face that don&#x27;t fall off naturally on their own. At first, I was a little hesitant about the strength of the peel. I figured I would need something stronger than 12% ,but I read other reviews that recommended starting at a lower percentage and working up. I&#x27;m glad I started with 12% because any higher and I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to use it as regularly as I have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it on a Wednesday night and, for the next two days, all my acne lesions will have gone from red and inflamed, to the same color as the surrounding skin. When I first started using it, the effect was so dramatic that,  compounded with Thanksgiving and Christmas over-indulging, my coworkers thought I was pregnant!!&lt;br /&gt;Saturday and Sunday following a peel I will see my skin begin to slough off and my face will get really flaky. But most of the flakes will be gone in time for work on Monday. I will wait to use any exfoliation products until I am certain that the majority of skin finished flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product every third week and noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin. Unfortunately, it was not the cure all I hoped it would be - I still had acne - but it was definitely helpful and I did notice an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Since trying this product, I recommend other acne suffers give it a try. I have since been able to afford health insurance and my dermatologist prescribed topical tretinoin. I would say that if you can&#x27;t afford health insurance or a dermatologist visit; this peel is &#x27;Almost&#x27; as effective as prescriptiontretinoin in helping to remove dead skin build-up.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, gives my skin that boost and really makes my skin glow.  People have noticed the difference in my skin also.</li>
            <li> The tca acid will burn a lot. The skin will probably peel, too. It does its job well. In the end, it&#x27;s well worthed it.</li>
            <li> I use this peel on my shaved scalp to help clear buildup to help prevent hair loss.  I can really feel it invigorating my skin as it tingles.  I also use it on my face which feels great as well.  Recommended to anyone who wants to have clean skin free of sebum!</li>
            <li> The product works very well for the price point.  While it still packs a punch it is a good starting point for do it at home peels.  I definitely suggest you buy a proper tool to spread the product on your face.  I follow the instructions and use it once a week I don&#x27;t think I will ever go anywhere for a facial peel again.  Definitely going to repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> It makes wherever you put it darker and a little crinkley too at first. Once your skin peels though the new skin is lighter and softer. Like the scar or dark spot might not be completely gone,but it lightens it for sure. If you keep using it no doubt the scar will go away completely. I use it on my knees and my acne scars and even a few scars I had from cuts or falling and they all got lighter. I even had a really bad breakout that left a bunch of acne scars. I&#x27;m black, but I&#x27;m not that dark so the acne scars stood out big time. Used this stuff for maybe 4months and now all the scars are almost completely gone. Most of them are gone. Just like the massive pimples that left big dark scars are still kind of visible, but ot really. I hate how it peels my skin, but the results are worth it. I also use the other peels by these people, I feel like all of them do the same great job so you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews I had high expectations for this product, but after using it I must say i am disappointed. Even with a lot of layering during the application, five days later I did not see even a pin point peel on the area I had applied it. I followed the directions perfectly and got no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, on to the next product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional chemical peels before, and this peel does the job! Only thing is I believe it&#x27;s a little stronger than what was used on me before because for the first time, I actually peeled a little. I used 2 doses.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have acne scars &amp; large pores thinking it would reduce there appearance. This product does exfoliate although I also use a self tanning lotion so I am not able to use it as often as I would like.  However, when I did use it on a weekly basis my skin looked vibrant.  It also took a few tries to get the time down correctly for my skin type.</li>
            <li> IS SO NICE!I WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE WHEN THIS WILL FINISH BECAUSE ALL MY FAMILY IS USING IT!MY SKIN IS SO SOFT NOW!</li>
            <li> I tried many other TCA but none are as good as this one. Amazing result.</li>
            <li> I normally get my peels done at a Doctors office and they work great. I ordered this one and it does burn while it&#x27;s on. I did have the frost look after the peel. My skin also peeled a lot. I guess with all those things that happened the peel works great. I love that it worked because paying $225 to $19 saves me a lot of money. I will continue to do it weekly and hopefully it continues to help my skin.</li>
            <li> I am using this to clear up my adult acne as well as treat the dark spots on my hands. So far, I have done one treatment on both my face and hands, which has resulted in a good deal of flaking and skin sloughing, not to the point that I am raw or red (which is what I hoped for). I am very happy with the instructions and product. I hope to be able to do these on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> Used on my hands and I love how my hands look and feel. They don&#x27;t look old and wrinkled anymore. Love showing off my hands now. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used it a few times over the past couple months and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good peel. Not too strong, but it is strong--you can feel it working. In my experience it&#x27;s best to leave it on no more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I had previously used an 8% product from a different brand, and while this one was a bit less expensive, at a 12% strength, it felt less potent than the 8% product, so if I order again, I will shoot for a stronger peel. I do love doing peels regularly. It keeps the pores more refined, tightens things up a bit and helps with the fine lines. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use a skin that had not had a peel in years. It works great!  Not too harsh and the results are fantastic. Skin usually starts to peel within a couple of days and is healed within a week.</li>
            <li> This is the very first time for me to use chemical peel.  After hitting 51, I was shocked to find my nasolabial folds got more prominent then my cheek started sagging. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, except very faint fine crows feet next to my eyes. My main concern has been sagging, and I wanted to find ways to  tighten skin since then. First time in my life, I started using Microcurrent, LED light and Derma roller and spending time to look at my face in mirror everyday. While doing so, I realized that smooth and even toned skin is what contributes youthful look. I wanted to use peel to get rid of dark sun spots and redness on T zone.  All I know is that creams and lotions wouldn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose TCA because it says it goes deeper than other chemicals. I chose 12% because it is the first time for me to use chemical peel and having no time to hiding at home for a week.  Although I am a first timer, I have been using daily peel products.  MD skin Care Alpha Bata Daily Facial Peel 2 steps system for past 10 days, Strivectin Over-night Facial Resurfacing Serum several times in past 6 months. I found that the result is not visible. I also have been using Olay Regenerist daily peel a few times in a month and NEUTROGENA WAVE Sonic lately. Those are more like scrubbing and make skin thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As experimenting with all those treatment at home, I noticed my facial skin got thinner, smoother and feeling tighter. My cheek is still sagging but nasolabial folds are less prominent.  It was scary to try out such strong chemical peel but made up my mind because of finding difference after leaving MD Skin Care&#x27;s Step 1 for 15 min. (instructions says 2 min, but I forgot.)  Next morning I woke up with much tighter, brighter and smoother skin, and I wondered why.  It though didn&#x27;t happen again by doing so, I thought peel would do a lot for this, and stronger peel would make a difference.  One mistake.. one of frosted spots must have stayed too long, I got new brown spot because of this. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time this TCA peel arrived, my skin was thinner than usual. Since my skin is sensitive, I did patch test on my inner elbow and under chin. 3 min passed, I felt no irritation at all. Instead of waiting for 2 days, I washed my face, rubbed with alcohol soaked cotton balls 4,5 times until there is no stain left on the cotton ball I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instruction, applied the peel with a cosmetic brush and left 3 min., then washed with water.  It stings, but not that bad at first. After applying the peel 2nd time, stinging sensation got increased to be burning. I was scared by the time 3 min passed. There was no &#x27;Frosting\\&quot;, but a part of skin got reddish. Washing with water made the pain even worse. I grabbed the box of baking powder that I have, poured on my palm. It stopped the burning sensation within 10 sec, and I got relieved.  Dried my face, I applied Step 2 neutrizer of MD Skin Care Alpha Bata Peel, then DMAE-Alpha Lipoic C-Ester Creme that I ordered with this peel, Strivectin, Neurtogena Pure &amp; Free Liquid Sunblack SPF 50 at the end.  My face felt nice and tighter, I wore make up and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next morning, my face was nice and tight.  The tone looks even since reddishness under nostrils are gone.  Large pores on T-zone looks smaller.  As dragged skin on my finger, the size of pores looks the same only when being pushed. Instruction says it can be used 1,2 a week, and I thought my skin can handle it. I did the 2nd peel.  This time I used an air circulator fan, repeated 5 min + wash for 3 times. I wore make up and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd day, no work today.  my face was still the same. I thought I should try it again.  This time, I used a bamboo stick to past the peel on my skin, since I didn&#x27;t like the feel of brush rubbing on my face. I did layering three times, 3 min each layer without washing between, then moisturizer and sunscreen. My skin started looking dry and somewhat wrinkle-ish...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th day, waking up in the morning, my skin feels little dry and dark spots looks little darker or just lost glow that I had lately.  Skin on my chin seems to be peeling a little, but not like peeling like unrolling a sheet of plastic wrap or after getting bad sun tan.  I have to work tomorrow, need to get it done. I did 4th application for 5 min twice.  I got used to the process, but not the pain.  Without fan, the bottle would have been in my trash basket.  At this point, 1/4th of bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frosting means that it reached to peeper layer, and it never happen to me at this time. My skin doesn&#x27;t get red after washing, also. After applying 4 days in a row, my skin looks dull and dry like after using strong astringent everyday without moisturizer for years.  I smiled at me in the mirror, my smile makes wrinkles all over my face!  I will try covering my face with steamed towel tonight. I am looking forward to seeing how lighter dark spots would become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 days passed since the last day of application.  I&#x27;ve experienced slight peel, and it has completed. I&#x27;ve applied the peel on the back of my left hand so that I can see the difference by comparing them. No miracle happened to improve the appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10th day: I have done it twice more while using md skincare daily peel to remove skin faster every day. Finally, I started getting frosting spots. Since frosting means skin being melted, I washed my face immediately.  After two days, when wiping with alcohol to prepare for another peel, I finally saw dark spots from sun burn on the one side of my upper cheek have faded to be 50% lighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, instead of washing, I applied more acid after small frosting spots appeared. I found that key is to apply acid thicker than I thought for wider area to frost.  I was comfortable to keep layering and extended time to 30 min.  After washing off the acid, my skin color looked milky.  I know it will work and shows satisfiable results this time.  I ordered facial steamer for peeling process gets faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last update:&lt;br /&gt;TCA peel 35% arrived. I had been using 12% very often past 3 weeks. Because of this, 35% frosted my skin after a couple of min.. It turned to be a huge purple patch after one hour.  As time passed, it became darker and darker!!  I tried not to think it is a horror story and would stay forever. With help of my brand new facial steamer, the lizard skin patch peeled after 5 days. Looking at before and after pictures of my face, my skin tone has improved 90%.  Dark shade on cheek bones from sun damage is gone, acne scars are less visible.  Most sun spots are gone and the lest is lighter.  Although it left a new brown spot,I am very happy.  Besides, it was fun to look at those brown sun spots being peeled in mirror while giving facial myself.</li>
            <li> Update 1/23/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with a 30% Glycolic Peel and then a 12% TCA peel (each for about $25), but they both were definitely a waste of time and money as far as getting a great \\&quot;Light\\&quot; Skin Peel (although these two products were higher quality for the minor results they were suppose to accomplish - just no where strong enough to get a great \\&quot;Light\\&quot; skin peel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 12% TCA peel is what I would describe as a \\&quot;flaking\\&quot; skin peel. See more on this 12% TCA Peel below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 15% TCA is definitely what I would call a great \\&quot;Light\\&quot; Skin Peel, where your skin will peel off over 7 or so days similar to the peeling you might get with a really bad sun tan burn skin peeling. Your skin will peel off about the thickness of a piece of paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily control the amount or depth of peel you see by starting with only a one pass peel of 1 to 3 minutes to see the minor effects of the 15% TCA peel first. But then you can do the real 5 minute peel a few weeks later to get the deeper \\&quot;Light\\&quot; Skin Peel. You&#x27;ll definitely see a thin skin layer peel off. You&#x27;ll still be able to put moisturizer on and go out and about for the duration of most of the peel (at least for the first 4 or 5 days) so that is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 20% TCA Peel will produce a really Deeper and Thicker Skin Peel. You won&#x27;t be able to go out of your house for 7 to 10 days while your skin peels like a cracking leather belt. I had this done and I would definitely not recommend anyone do this alone for their first peel attempt -- instead go with the 15% TCA Peel and do it for a minute or two as a single pass to see how it works (for skin reaction caution do it on a test area like the side of your jaw or where recommended elsewhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Always start with the application on your \\&quot;trouble areas\\&quot; like the \\&quot;T-Zone\\&quot; first so they have slightly longer \\&quot;contact\\&quot; times and will \\&quot;Peel\\&quot; slightly more, getting ride of the \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/2/2012&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done the 5th peel now, and I&#x27;ve figured out that you should start each peel pass with the \\&quot;T\\&quot; trouble zone (nose and above eyebrows) because it means when you&#x27;ve covered your whole face you have slightly longer \\&quot;contact\\&quot; with each pass done, on the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone. This is better than say starting with your forehead (because then your forehead has the longest contact time). So your while you may take a minute to cover your whole face, your \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone gets 2 minutes contact time per pass plus the extra 1 minutes it took to cover your whole face. Just a suggestion on what facial parts to do first (start with your problem zones and work to your least problem facial zone last).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done this technique on my 4th peel (the same number of passes as my 3rd peel) but I got better results on the trouble \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone area without having to do extra passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this product three times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first peel I tried a 2 minute pass followed by a second 30 second pass on the trouble \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone (nose and above eyebrows). It turned a little red until I washed it off with cold water, but there was no peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second peel I tried a 2 minute pass, followed by another 2 minute pass, and a 3rd 30 second pass on the problem area \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone. I actually got a little skin flaking here and there, like a very light light sun burn. Nothing that would be noticed if you went out in public, only if you looked really close in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd peel I tried a 2 minute pass three times, followed by a 4th and a 5th 2 minute pass on the trouble \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone area. In 24 hours the redness was gone. by day 36-48 hours I peeled here and there where I did only the 3 two-minutes passes (the non \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone areas). By the 48-72 hours I began peeling on the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone areas where I went deeper with the peel and did the extra 4th and 4th 2 minute peels. I expect the peeling to be done by the 5th day (nothing you can&#x27;t put moisturizer on and goout if you want). The skin peeling is still pretty light, and the skin flaking/peeling thickness is about the thickness of a see through piece of paper (very thin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only CON is that it seems as though the peel is not even on areas because the application is not even (I&#x27;ve tried gauze pads but they absorb too much of the TCA gel; so I use cotton balls as the applicator but they don&#x27;t seem to be the best at delivering an even gel layer across the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really needs to include an \\&quot;applicator\\&quot; for applying the gel evenly across the skin (instead of leaving users to themselves to try to figure out what to use as an \\&quot;applicator\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems like a good product to prepare your skin for a 20% TCA peel, if you&#x27;re not in a hurry for the immediate results of a 20% TCA peel which I would think would cause a good sun tan like peeling on the first try. By my experience you can get 4 or 5 peels out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect Images quality manufacturing and packaging process is definitely a comforting knowledge when using any peeling product (they add products to the gel that others TCA peels don&#x27;t add, in order to keep the TCA gel in the bottle safer). I wish Perfect Image would offer a higher TCA peel like 20%.</li>
            <li> Very effective, much better than Skin Labratory products.  I have sensitive skin, started on my neck and worked up. I only left it on for 2 minutes total as it began to really burn.  It produced a light peel which I never got wth the stronger Skin Labs product.  The real benefits were weeks later.  Evened out skin tone and decreased lines.  I will definately buy this product again</li>
            <li> I purchased this peel for three purposes:&lt;br /&gt;1. Control melasma&lt;br /&gt;2. Tighten pores&lt;br /&gt;3. Control periodic blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing for the melasma (I have since purchased a glycolic peel with better results for that issue), but my pores appear smaller and this product keeps my skin clear 99% of the year when applied every 2 weeks. It does not burn like other peels, and the dropper really makes application of the product easier. I also like the consistency--it is slightly viscous, like olive oil, so I have time to spread it around a bit (I am always afraid the peels will run into my eyes and mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this peel for people who want to maintain clear skin and tighten the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product so that I can save some money getting it done at a spa.  I only used it twice but so far I like it.  The peeling after the treatment was not too bad.  I&#x27;d have to use it more to find out if it lightens my face.</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion. In the past I have received glycolic and salicylic acid peels from the spa&#x27;s. I have spent hundreds of dollars, and these treatments left me with very minimal visible results. I decided to try the TCA for the first time, and I am very happy with the results. I purchased the TCA for some slight dark areas on my face. A day after applying the TCA, my face is brighter, the tone is evening out, and is minimally exfoliating. I think these are great results for a light TCA peel. The results are far better than my glycolic and salicylic acid treatments combined. It works better, and faster than a lightening cream I purchased just recently as well.</li>
            <li> This worked just as everyone describes. Read the other reviews for great pointers on how to use for the most benefit. I&#x27;ll be stepping up to the next concentration now. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I have had many professional peels and microderms completed at spas and I find this to be far superior. When I think how much money I have spent, $40-$70 a pop on those procedures, without ever seeing results I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t tried this sooner. I have suffered with hormonal acne for about 11 years now, and while much of that has subsided I am still left with pigmentation and some scaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only completed the peel twice, and am pleased with the results. I see here that others have suggested their own variations on the directions, but thus far I have followed them exactly. I cleanse my face with dove soap (twice to remove makeup) and then cleanse with rubbing alcohol until my cotton balls show no signs of residue or makeup. I then applied the peel using q-tips to avoid wasting the product, waited 5 mins, and then applied the second layer and waited an additional 5 mins. After applying the second layer the burning does get pretty intense so I would recommend using a fan if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peel cleared up all active bumps on my face, ones that would have otherwise taken several weeks (possibly months) to subside, almost overnight. As a result I haven&#x27;t had other bumps form either. For the first couple of days after the peel my skin is pretty pinkish/red and tight, and a great moisturizer is a must. About three days after my skin started some minor peeling, and I am pretty amazed by how the peel seems to target my problem areas because those are the only areas that really seem to peel on my face. I have noticed slight changes in the appearance of the pigmentation on my face and the depth of scaring, and I can only imagine that sticking with this would show fantastic results in the coming weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone as long as you follow the directions, and always test your skin before (like the directions state). For someone like me that has spent so much money on spa treatments and has never seen any results from them, it does sound almost too good to be true that I could spend $30 on this product and have several treatments showing significant results, but it is true!nd has never seen any results from them, it does sound almost too good to be true that I could spend $30 on this product and have several treatments showing significant results, but it is true!</li>
            <li> I got this for a nice facial peel. That did not happen actually. I did not have any peeling or improved skin. I have used this about 4 times and with each time increasing the procedure. The directions come in the box and are very clear. So I don&#x27;t believe this product worked as it should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy some makeup that broke my face out one day and I decided to use this, it cleared it all up. My face was so red, blotchy, pimples showing up. I was freaked. I washed the makeup off and sat there thinking about what to do. I went to bed. In the morning I used this stuff and then applied layers of moisture cream. Perfect. Saved my skin. I will keep it on-hand for times like that.</li>
            <li> well, it lightened it but did not get rid of it.  If you are looking to use this to get rid of age/liver spots... look else where.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice every 10 days.  It is very gentle and did not sting. The first time I saw little change although I did peel.  The second time I used it, I followed some of the advice here of repeating the process twice.  The major peeling for me started on the 8th day so next time I will time it such that the major peeling falls on a weekend.  Peeling skin looks terrible with make-up applied on because it enhances the peeling.  I have acne scars and it is difficult for me to go without make-up.  After the peeling was done, skin was smooth but the acne scars remain. I will give it a few more tries and try not to rush the process.  I took some before pictures just for my records so I can compare if the product is working.  Later I may try the stronger TCA and use it only on acne spots.</li>
            <li> This peel is worth trying out.  Make sure you clean your face and use astringent before peel.  I like to layer this peel b/c the strength is low and sometimes do two whole rounds on the same day to really penetrate.  Helps w/ post pregnancy melasma, sun spots (former lifeguard), acne, and smoothing out over all.  You will need to use this peel about 2-3 times, a month apart, to notice significant difference but you will see changes after the first time.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, oily/combo skin, olive skin tone, post babies.  Good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Well, I first started with the Glycolic peel at 30% and did fine for a month or two, but wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted.  Then the lactic acid peel was too much for me so I decided to try this one.  And this has worked great for the last 2 months.  I would equate it to the peel you get at the spa.  Going to go with the TCA 20% next I think.</li>
            <li> I first must say this company is outstanding in may ways. Before I purchased the TCA product from Perfect Image I read all of the reviews. I was very impressed to see how many 5 stars and good things were said about it. I ordered the product on Wednesday June 6, 2012. I received an email confirmation stating \\&quot;estimated delivery June 15th\\&quot; to my surprise when I got home Friday the 8th it was in my mailbox. A plus for such quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a chemical peel done before until recently. I watched a video on Youtube of a at home Lactic Acid peel and thought I would try it. So far, I&#x27;ve done two Lactic Acid peels and its been ok. I then started researching all different types of chemical peels. I read and watched videos of the TCA peel I decided to try it to see how much of a differance the peel would make on my skin. I&#x27;ve been blessed not to suffer of a big acne problem like most people I see but, I do have some skin discoloration on my checks and some acne on my nose and forehead. The moment I received the TCA I read the instructions. I washed my face, rubbed the alcohol and used a fan brush to apply the solution evenly on my face. I kept it on for 10 min until my face turned red(no frost occured). I did feel a little burn/sting sensation but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle. I washed my face with cold water for about 2 mins and applied my moisturizer. I only applied the peel one time since it&#x27;s my first time using the TCA peel I was not sure how my face would react to it and I did not do a trial test. But, the instruction do state to repeat the steps twice. I could immediately feel and see a differance on my face. It feels tighter, cleaner, my complexion became lighter and more even. This is only day two and I still feel my face tight and smooth, I haven&#x27;t peeled yet but, I am not worried about that. I&#x27;ll wait 10 days before I do another treatment and this time I will apply it two times. So far, I like my first results. I would recommend this product and I will purchase from Perfect Image again. Until the next time.</li>
            <li> my face is peeling well, i did a double layer, i am not new to using chemical peels, so if you are new to chemical peels, follow the directions well, I love the ease of using the dropper to put drops on cotton ball .. I will buy this product again once this is used up ... excellent product!</li>
            <li> I am an Aesthetician and so I was a bit skeptical about purchasing a peel that was available to the public. I bought this one with the intention of purchasing more if it went well and I&#x27;d say it went well! I was very impressed with the quality, and the instructions provided were very detailed.</li>
            <li> This is a great peel to help brighten your complexion and get rid of acne. I am in my 40&#x27;s and have acne-prone skin. My face looks so much better after only one application! I will definitely buy this product again. The cleanser is awesome too.</li>
            <li> I have seen a noticeable improvement in my overall skin quality since using this product for the past few months. Tone is clearer, fine lines are diminished, and skin looks younger. I also use it on my neck and chest, and my chest in particular looks much younger with the perpetual redness now gone. For reference, I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s with light skin and considerable sun damage from my youth. I use this peel about once a week, sometimes twice, and sometimes just do my chest and neck. When I first started using it, I could only keep it on for a couple of minutes or so as it burned, but my skin has built up a tolerance so I can now leave it on for several minutes. My forehead, chest, and neck are less sensitive to the peel than the rest of my face, so I apply it to those areas first, then wait a few minutes before applying it to my whole face.  The only visible skin peeling I&#x27;ve seen was just a few small patches on my cheeks and around my mouth when I first started the product. Since then, I haven&#x27;t seen any skin peeling, as it works invisibly and underneath the surface. Follow with good moisturizer (I also recommend 100% hyaluronic acid, also available from Amazon) and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING.</li>
            <li> No matter the Perfect Image peel you purchase, you will notice a visible difference. I started with leaving the TCA 15% on my face for two minutes, then worked up in 30 second increments.  After removing the peel with cold water, you will notice a significant difference in the texture and overall smoothness of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very large pores in my &amp;#34;T-Zone&amp;#34; that continuously get clogged.  This is the first product I have ever found that has not only shrunk the pores, but is beginning to completely erase them.  I use a toner 24-48 hours after the peel, and, can see visibly see the blackheads/clogged pores being stripped from my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to get a pimple.. I would suggest applying the TCA to a Q-Tip, dabbing the blemish, letting it set for x:xx duration, then removing.  The TCA instantly attacks the bacteria, allowing for the pimple to disappear/heal much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about my experience with The Perfect Image&#x27;s peels.  I am... a customer for life.</li>
            <li> So, background: 18, fair, oily &amp; sensitive-skinned, severe cystic acne since eleven. (Eleven!) I&#x27;ve basically every drug store brand of acne medication, Proactiv, Murad, all-natural things, clindamycin, tretinoin, doxycycline - nothing worked at all. I was looking at accutane, which I didn&#x27;t want to use. I ended up hearing about the effectiveness of TCA peels and as a literal last resort, I bought this and [[ASIN:B007004PZO Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Green Tea Extract (Professional)]]. My skin is used to peels -- I had been using a weekly 20% salicylic acid peel, with little effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discontinued the salicylic acid peels a month prior. The week beforehand, I didn&#x27;t exfoliate or use retin-A, then washed with the gel cleanser every day. That Friday, I cleaned my face with alcohol and applied the peel. I left it on for a total of ten minutes, with three layers. It didn&#x27;t hurt as badly as the salicylic peels! I kept my face moisturized and used hydrocortisone cream to control the itching. It took about two weeks for the peeling to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product has stopped the extreme oiliness of my skin, which has cut down the acne by a lot. It&#x27;s now a month and a half after the application. I have to deal with dry skin now, but that&#x27;s much easier to manage. I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the scarring, but I only did one application. I plan on doing another in December, on winter break from college, and will do it for longer/deeper than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These peels are great to do every once in a while. Do it every few months to really kill the oil in your skin, then maintain the effect with a lighter peel. My skin isn&#x27;t completely acne-free, but it looks a LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, several months later: I use this product occasionally for maintenance on my acne scars. It does a good job at fading them, though it&#x27;s a slow process. Again, don&#x27;t buy if you want immediate results. Healing blemishes takes time.blemishes takes time.</li>
            <li> Just now used this product in December and it really works. Face does peel away bad skin, spots, etc. Be patient, it&#x27;s not overnight. Also, use gloves when applying or your finger tips will peel too. I&#x27;d definitely buy again. My new skin is super soft and feel and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price and I am on to the strobger ones try this and get a good discount as well so that was alos veru nice</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its claims. Keep in mind these treatments work but be sure to follow directions word for word , they are a little more potent than your standard otc products. I have been doing peels for a while now, I strongly suggest you start with lower strength peels if its your first time. Their peels seem to be safer than others I have tried because of the gel like nature instead of the more watery products out there. ALso be patient with results, they will come if you continue to use them the correct way. I don&#x27;t have visible peeling anymore but I can tell my skin is much more refined now and has a nice glow to it. I have eliminated most of my age spots and reduced some sharp lines around my mouth and eyes. So far its been a great product. Highly recommend it to anyone! A for sure must get.</li>
            <li> Me: Caucasian; aged 36; look younger than my age; hormonal melasma spots on forehead/ upper lip; few lines; some clogged pores at jawline.&lt;br /&gt;Looking to: tighten, lighten and unclog complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Product positives: can be rinsed off with water; only mild tingling even at 4 minutes; did not damage or burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I see ZERO effect with this product. I have tried it on my face, decolletage, and hands, which are admittedly a bit sun damaged. I have used home peels before, and have gotten much better results with the HQ peel (instant tightening, some peeling, fewer blackheads). The only reason I tried this product instead is because I understood TCA to be a stronger ingredient than the alpha/ beta/ hydroquinone in the HQ. Perhaps this is my error, but at any rate, this product did not deliver the results it promises, no matter how open-minded I was to trying it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: didn&#x27;t hurt me, but didn&#x27;t help me either. Do consider other options.</li>
            <li> I started this peel 2 weeks ago. It made my skin so soft after the first use and it did not burn or hurt my skin like other peels out there. A few days later, it turned to be a little flaky (I left in on for 4 minutes in a thin layer) and my skin already looked better and the acnes were GONE. I just did the second peel this week and I will continue using it since the product is so gentle, inexpensive, and it really works!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quick and nicely packaged. I have been using this product for two months now and I love it. I use it every week and sometimes I would reapply every day until my skin starts peeling. This product is effective and works great on hyperpigmentation as described. My skin has not been this clear since I cant remember! I would highly recommend this over the more pricey brands that I have tried. It works just as effective and it costs 3 times less!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update* I bought this product again and this time it came in a thick gel form instead of a thin liquid. It does not seem to be working as well as before therefore I am lowering my rating.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne. I break out, and I have acne scars and hyper-pigmentation. This product fades acne scars and evens out skin tone. It does a great job doing that! If you have \\&quot;active\\&quot; acne, the peel may cause you to break out (The same thing happened when a dermatologist did my TCA peel.). It does not burn bad at all. It is actually gentler and more comfortable than the peels I&#x27;ve had my dermatologist&#x27;s office. It&#x27;s better. I applied 50% rubbing alcohol to my skin prior to applying the peel. I used cotton balls to apply the peel and Q-tips to apply the peel directly to scars (do the later first). I left the peel on for 5-10 minutes and then rinsed my skin off for one minute using cold water (It was gentle enough for me to apply it a second time that day.). I then applied a SPF 15, oil-free, sensitive moisturizer (Olay). My skin did frost but that went away after thirty minutes. I repeated the process the next day. After the peel, I washed my face with Dove soap and used Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel as an astringent. Your skin will feel softer and it will glow. I will try to salicylic peel to see if it helps with breakouts. This product is great for acne scars and evening out skin tone for those who don&#x27;t have \\&quot;active\\&quot; acne. I highly recommend it. This is a great product. I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li> I have had used many products of this type but this product works best for me.  I find that it is strong enough to help with my skin where the other products were not.  It could be very drying so use it carefully until you know how you might react</li>
            <li> In the past I had always gone to professionals for a peel, but I will never spend $80 to $100 on that again. This is a nice level 2 peel. It is actually the first time I&#x27;ve tried this at home myself. The first time I left it on for 5 minutes.  A month later I left it on for 10 minutes. My skin flakes a little at day 2 after the peel, and my skin is left smooth and glowing. This bottle was in the $30 range, and is enough for at least 10 peels. What a bargain. I recomment this peel.  I feel that if used regularly, it can help with fine lines and uneven skin color.</li>
            <li> this peel is great for beginners,or those with some skin sensitivity...it is easy to manage and control.Mild enough to add a drop or two to your moisturizer to keep your poor tight and skin clear. I don&#x27;t have acne but use this for occasional breakouts(all over face) ,and also a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> helps with my moderate Cystic acne! Dose not make my skin peel as bad as Retin A. Can&#x27;t guarantee it will work for everyone</li>
            <li> Hello ,&lt;br /&gt;I used \\&quot;Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator\\&quot; with this product and it was so easier than little cotton balls; they take forever. When I first applied, I used perfect image&#x27;s \\&quot;Salicylic Gel Peel + Salicylic Deep Gel Cleanser\\&quot;. And I also bought their Repair Cream. Well this was my first time so I wanted to make sure I was doing right. I was so scared to burn myself. I applied, and I could only wait 3 minutes. And it just turned out red and nothing more; then I decided to wash my face to get over the burning feeling, which was unbearable. After that I decided to apply one more layer and keep the same. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t do it but I was really feeling bad with my face so I decided to do it. I didn&#x27;t do my under eyes area with that since it was 20% Salicylic peel; it was strong for under eyes. That helped a lot for my face, and I had a good peeling, my face got so wrinkly, I couldn&#x27;t go out for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I felt good. However, my under eyes was bothering me so bad, after 10 or 15 days, I got this one, \\&quot;TCA 12% with 5% of Salicylic gel peel\\&quot;. I heard that 12% TCA would be fine for the eyes. This time I used Anesthetic Cream on my face; I knew that the peeling would hurt my eyes so badly. After Anesthetic Cream, I cleaned my face good; and applied Vaseline on the areas that I wouldn&#x27;t want this gel run and caused trouble. I applied gel all over the face starting with the T- zone (I was careful applying with brush, and didn&#x27;t take a lot on one time, just a little by little), and then finally applied around the eyes leaving enough space between the eye area. I could only stand for about 2.5 minutes and washed it off. It burned me but I didn&#x27;t see any good affect for peeling, just redness. Then I applied again and waited for 3.5 minutes. Here the gel affected good because I applied with that brush, and it delivered the gel everywhere with good amount. OMG, I literally cried in pain. Then I washed off it and gently dried and applied repair cream on my face, lots and lots of it. It felt good, it was cool and it comforted my skin. My skin turned into red and then most of the areas turned into brown in a day or so. Everywhere was became so wrinkly, so I applied that repair cream again and again, and some antibiotic cream also around my eyes. Then my skin started pulling so bad, stretching my face, it hurt me. Yet, I constantly washed and applied cream. So it started healing and then peeling very soon soon. Today is the 4th day and almost all gone, just little bit around. My under eyes are stretching, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes after I got rid of the brown and bruised dried skin. I can literally feel the tightness there; I can&#x27;t believe. It is only after one try. If I had gone to skin clique and had a professional done it on my face with a strong amount, it might have been much better, but I am ok with that strength right now, because it hurts me so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am trying to say here is that using good applicator, we can still get good results with this strength too. We can wait a little longer (not so long of course, just a minute or two more since there is already good amount of product on the skin). So that was my experience; I had been trying anti-wrinkle creams for months now and nothing worked. And now I tried these products, and I feel much better with my face. I feel happier when I look at the mirror. By the way I also bought one more thing, \\&quot;MD Forte 2 facial cream\\&quot;.I read on the internet, and decided to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sorry that it seems kind of I am advertising products here but I just wanted to share my experience with you all. During the shower I also try to massage my face, kind of exfoliating too, so lightly without hurting it. After I got out of the shower, I dry my face gently and apply my MD forte cream. My face felt like velvet when I touched it. I can&#x27;t believe, Thank God,I am soo happy. Of course it is not perfect yet,I still have dark spots and some pores on my face and I haveto use it more to get rid of them, but I am still happy; because first time I actually felt I got some kind of result from a product; this really made me happy. I cried.. When I touched my face I don&#x27;t feel that lose ugly feeling any more.I didn&#x27;t even want to look at my face on the mirror. Now, after that,my face actually feels tighter and happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review. I hope you will be happy too. You don&#x27;t need to do what I did, I have no idea about the best use of this product, so please don&#x27;t consider me as a guide at all. I watched lots of YouTube videos to learn something about it before I even tried it. That gave me courage and also the reviews here were so helpful. So, finally I wanted to share my experience with you, that&#x27;s all... Hope you will be happy too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish you all wonderful healthy days...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...</li>
            <li> This is a great product, not only improves acne condition but helps to reduce pore sizes and scars, i recommend it, tough read the instructions carefully so you will be able to use the product and get the most benefit out of it, its a professional grade product with great results.</li>
            <li> A year ago I had blepharoplasty surgery and still had some wrinkles at the corners of my eyes. I did not want to keep doing daily treatments of Retin A or Botox and was looking for other options. I found this product while searching and completely enjoyed the quality and effect. While I would recommend an application brush, I simple cut the figures of a rubber glove and spread it on areas of my face. I use this less frequently than the Retin A and I feel I&#x27;am achieving similar results. I certainly will continue with this product.</li>
            <li> Really effective, deep peel without the down time (your face won&#x27;t look burnt or crazy if you follow the directions). Perfect for beginners (like me). Great for age spots, redness, and scars. And with Amazon Prime I got this product in two days with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review, but this product deserves a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I spent $250 on laser pigmentation removal. It worked okay, but left behind several stubborn brown spots on my forehead and cheeks (that I have from the sun and birth control) and it also gave my face red spots that weren&#x27;t going away. I also have some acne scars that I wanted to get rid of. After using this product just once, my brown spots are about 70% lighter and the redness and scarring I had are almost all gone. I wish I had known about this product first, I could have saved a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on at home peels before I purchased this product, and this is the perfect peel if you&#x27;re looking for RESULTS with NO DOWN TIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions carefully, made sure the cleanse my face with isopropyl alcohol. I used a cotton pad to apply two thin layers of the peel to my problem areas. I left it on for 3 minutes and then put a layer over my whole face which I left on for 3 minutes. I didn&#x27;t see any frosting or redness, but washed it off after a total of 6 minutes. DAY 1: I was slightly red for about a half hour afterwards, but this went away. DAY 2: The problem areas where I left it on longer started to look more leathery and wrinkled. Nothing anyone would notice but me. DAY 3: I started to peel, it just looked like dry skin. DAY 4: The problem areas peeled, but the rest of my face (where I only left it on for three minutes) didn&#x27;t. DAY 5: My peeling is pretty much all done and the skin underneath looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to wear makeup every day except on day 4 when the peeling was noticeable (like whenyou peel after a sunburn) - my foundation and cover up just made the peeling stand out more. I know you&#x27;re not supposed to exfoliate or pick at the peeling or anything (you don&#x27;t want to cause scarring, which you will do if the peeling isn&#x27;t done, so be careful), but truthfully I knew my peel was done on day 5 and so I did exfoliate GENTLY to remove dead skin and my skin looks fantastic! I hope you try this product, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be as happy as I am!</li>
            <li> This product works amazing.  I have used it on my face upper lids and hands.  I would not suggest anyone putting this on or around their eye unless they are experienced and extremely careful.  This product does not burn excessivly and after rinseing and neutralizing peels about 3 days later. Does what it says!! :)</li>
            <li> Being a woman of colour, I was very skeptical about using the TCA peel, but I&#x27;m so happy I did. Initially there was some burning and slight discomfort. The next 3 days I just looked alittle crisp, like I had gotten a tan. It took about four days before I actually started to peel and I started to shed almost like a snake...but then I got a glimpse of the new skin being revealed and I was completely amazed. the new layers were firmer, tighter, clearer and so much better. If great results are what you&#x27;re looking for then I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Top of the line product at a reasonable price! Skin never looked better! Skin is soo smooth! No more blackheads. Yay!!</li>
            <li> This peel seems to get down in deep. It doesn&#x27;t burn my face and doesn&#x27;t even peel like crazy, which I like. I think it&#x27;s great for beginners. Great value, quality, and price.</li>
            <li> I am not used to having peels and my skin is super sensitive; so why didn&#x27;t i feel anything when i put this on my face???? For real nothing happened! no tingling, burning, NOTHING! disappointed....And i didn&#x27;t even peel...</li>
            <li> Love this peel. More gentle than the non-gel TCA peels. I&#x27;ve tried the same product but lower % TCA peel also very good just peeled less. Would purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Finally a peel that works! This Gel Peel doesn&#x27;t make you feel like your skin is burning unlike the other chemical peels that I&#x27;ve tried. The peeling of the skin is even. After a few days I saw that my skin looks a lot clearer, it feels smoother, it&#x27;s even toned and my acne scars, which is my biggest problem, less visible. It is an amazing product and I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some nice professional peels in the past, but it often took a few repeats to get the deeper peel I was looking for. I wanted to try my own, having seen the process and knowing what to expect. This product definitely gives professional results! The peel is deep and even if using a brush, however one needs to carefully prep (dilute and test 5%, then 10%, until you know what strength is right for you). About two days in the heavy peeling occurs, leaving a very fresh layer of skin. My pores are smaller, dark spots are fading and overall skin texture is great. It also helps with hormonal acne, which has been a challenge for me lately. If you can tolerate a little pain for 10 minutes, you will love the long term effect of this product (I purchased 4% lidocaine lotion online, which helps a little).</li>
            <li> This product is really helpfull for acne and acne scars. I mostly used it on my face and neck. I would only suggest that you keep in mind that there is a down time know as healing time which only applies if you put it on your face however it is worth it if you have the time. The healing time for me is around 3-5 days. I would say the healing time you would mostly have is 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomed this to everyone who has acne and/or acne scars especially people who acne on their face. If you have acne on your body I would recomend you use something stronger such as the 20% Salicylic Acid since your body can&#x27;t support.</li>
            <li> A little background, i&#x27;m 42, olive skin, not sensitive skin, and it has been looking a bit rough lately after a long summer out in the sun. My pigmentation gets worse every summer esp on left side (car window side). I use sunblock regularly but usually do not reapply often enough. I have not done much exfoliating or Retinol the last 6 months because I was under the wrong impression that I had been actually making the pigmentation worse. I have done maybe 2 skin peels in my life and in general have good skin for my age, per a dermatologist less wrinkles than average but more uneven skin tone than  average for my age. On to the product. I like it but I had to leave it on much longer than recommended. I am not recommending this for anyone else but it so far is working for me. I just put on my first applications today so I do not know yet if there will be peeling but my pigmentation is lighter and overall my face looks smoother. I did not do the 1-2 week prep work of deep cleansing, retinols so this may be why I had to leave it on so much longer. I washed my face with a gentle cleanser and then cleansed it with alcohol 2x. I did a total of 3 treatments but the first one was 15 minutes (apply on cheeks first (thickest area of my face plus most pigmentation), the next 20 minutes and the next 30 minutes. I hope I did not do some damage I am not aware of yet but I did this because I did not feel any tingling, stinging after the directed 10 min. max. Now that I have done all 3 treatments I do not really have any redness either just a little around sensitive areas such as the mouth, nose corners and top of cheek bone. If this results in anything negative I will update this review. Also as I see the end results over the next few days I may give 5 stars. It will be interesting to see how long I leave it on next week since I have this initial peel done. If I feel stinging earlier I will remove it. If it continues to take this long to see results for my skin type/ damage I will look for something stronger. If anyone has recommendations I would love to hear them.ook for something stronger. If anyone has recommendations I would love to hear them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the peel as the directions indicate, but it is now 7 applications later and I only peeled slightly a few days ago. I&#x27;d have been better off to stay with retinol purchased in the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product. Having had a VI Peel that cost me $350, I wanted to find a more affordable option with similar results. On receiving the TCA peel, I was very careful to first complete the patch test and see if my skin reacted in a negative way. After seeing that my skin didnt react badly, I decided to try and do a full face peel a few days later. My first and second peel was very mild as I ended up leaving the product on my skin for only 5 to 10 minutes. I also distributed the chemical in a very thin layer in order to be cautious. The results ended up showing as some flaking and slight peeling which I wasnt too happy with. The third attempt was much more successful as I specifically targeted my cheeks and used two thick layers of the product, applied seven minutes apart, and being left on the skin for a total of 15 minutes. This resulted in a thicker layer of peeling skin with a bit of a downtime. It has been two weeks since I administered my third peel, and I am very happy with my results. (My basic skin concerns are uneven skin tone due to acne and also some minor rolling acne scars.) I also have a birthmark on my cheek, which the peel ended up successfully lightening by 40%. My acne scars also seem to have improved, and the skin tone is much more even. I am excited to use this product, and am planning to do a peel every one to two months. It is important for the skin to have time to heal in between each peel. I also cant wait to try out other products from this company!</li>
            <li> I was SO nervous about giving myself a home peel, but after reading all the reviews I felt as though I could handle it.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  What&#x27;s great about this particular product is the VERY thorough instructions that came with the solution.  Don&#x27;t be a cowboy; read the directions and be cautious if it&#x27;s your first peel!  I did only one layer and left it on for 5 minutes before washing it off.  I did not frost, and the pain wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  It&#x27;s now day 4 and I don&#x27;t have any browning or peeling so although I know my skin tolerated the peel, I&#x27;ll need to do two layers the next time.  I&#x27;m also going to try another peel from this company that I can use on a weekly basis.  BTW - excellent costumer service.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like how I had to keep reapplying this stuff every 10 mins, just to try and get the peeling to work. Torturing myself with face burn was not my idea of fun.  In fact I never did get that peeling to work, and just left my skin so dry and wrinkley it made me look old for a couple of days. Was horrible.</li>
            <li> excellent product and highly recommend for all skin types.  Even worked for my sensitive type of skin. Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love how the product works. It didn&#x27;t sting or burn my face but still left it feeling very smooth. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my complexion yet, but I am optimistic. My only wish is that this product was more affordable.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is beyond repair but this did not work for me but it might for you.Did receive in timely matter.</li>
            <li> This chemical peel is not too harsh and it makes your face feel really soft. I&#x27;m looking forward to ordering more of perfect Image products in the future, and very good prices.</li>
            <li> I got this peel on august, I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and the results Oh my Gosh they are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;My sunspots are almost gone, and I&#x27;ve tryed many Brands with no Result&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Perfect Image</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous to order this, but after reading some reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try it. I had a peel done professionally, but due to cost, I was looking for something with similar effectiveness but cheaper. This&lt;br /&gt;product did just that. I had perfect skin in my teens, but when I turned 27 I had frequent breakouts (almost like blisters at times) and areas of dryness. I was very unhappy with my skin texture and tone as well. The first time I used this product it did burn a bit. I left it on only a few minutes. I could see visible peeling the next morning. I used my usual moisturizer throughout the day and after only a few days, the peeling stopped. My skin was smoother and I had far less breakouts. The best thing about this product, is you can use it all over your face or as more of a spot treatment. I have always followed the instructions exactly (i.e. alcohol swab before application of gel) and I have no complaints. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for treatment of mild breakouts or those just looking for a fresher &amp; smoother look.</li>
            <li> In January 2012 I purchased a 25% TCA peel from another well renowned cosmetic company.  My goal was to remove a few minor unsightly blemishes on my arm and inner thigh.  All I got however were two horribly large burn scars that forced me to eliminate almost all of my clothing choices and of course, a courtesy refund from the company.  FYI, being that I am African American, I was at greater risk for hyperpigmentation, so my skin didn&#x27;t respond well---hence, the unfortunate result that got.  I searched months for a solution that would rid my body of the permanent damage but nothing turned up.  Finally I researched Perfectimage-llc.  David Petrillo, (who I now believe is a reputable customer service representative) explained how their products are not like other peels, in that they arent harsh, but over time help to lighten scars. He recommended the TCA Peel and Glycolic.  On the other hand he stated that there were no guarantees based on the depth of scarring that I was already left with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this was not my first rodeo, I was utterly skeptical, extremely nervous, and had ambivalent feelings about putting myself in the same fololish situation that I did before, having not consulted with a professional.  Nevertheless, I took a chance hoping that this product wouldn&#x27;t fail me as the other one had and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months and four treatments later, from my first purchase (August  2012) my  8\\&quot; scar is barely visible,  and I&#x27;m almost ready to wear sleeveless clothes again.  I can&#x27;t thank Perfect Image enough for their customer service and qualify products.  I will continue ordering from this company as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a reason to not like this product, therefore I rated it a 5.  I&#x27;ve been using this product in conjunction with hyper pigmentation products to try and turn back the clock and undo damage from the sun.  So far, I am pleased.  My skin is becoming more even toned and the freckles are fading.  Additionally, my skin seems clearer, softer with reduced fine lines.  I had been using 30% glycolic peels prior to this so my skin adjusted well to the TCA peel.</li>
            <li> The first three times I used this, it worked great.  I noticed a huge difference in how my skin looked and felt.  However, the last couple of times I used this it just doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough anymore.  Maybe, I need to move to a stronger peel now that my skin has gotten used to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addition to my previous comment... I wanted to be clearer in my review for people who may have similar problems.  I have a sun spot on my cheek.  I&#x27;ve tried two different lightening creams (estee lauder and clinique) with no improvement.  This peel is helping to slowly remove that spot.  Also, I have some lines on my face, and they are getting better as well.  Thirdly, I have a problem with minor (sometimes worse) breakouts, and this is improving that as well.  Overall a great product.  To address the comment I received - that person is correct about doing multiple layers.  Which I have started to do.  For my 6th peel, I applied three layers.  Each of which I did after waiting 5 minutes in between.  Also, I did leave the peel on a bit longer.  Eventually, I will move up to a stronger peel.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, it did help me to recover from the sun burned.  I will buy product from this company again next time,</li>
            <li> Peel worked well to help smooth lines and tighten skin. You&#x27;ll want to leave it on longer over time so you can get the full effect. The peel worked best for a friend of mine with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Works well. Would recommend especially for cystic acne. Be are to use as written to avoid skin burns.  This is meant for professionals.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. This product did absolutely nothing for me.  I followed the instructions exactly and used it several times over a month&#x27;s time. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This really helps to brighten a dull complexion.i found it to be very gentle but effective.great to use at home.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I have had mild peels in the dermatologist&#x27;s office, so I know what to expect from them. I bought the salicylic acid wash that is recommended with this product; you use it for a few days prior to the peel. I followed the instructions very carefully. The first time, nothing happened (no peeling either). The second, third, and fourth times, I followed the advice of another user and left it on 15 minutes, rinsed, and repeated the procedure three times in all. I did have some mild flaking and my face looked brighter afterwards, but my hyperpigmentation and fine lines have not improved at all. (They are not bad, so I was hoping this product would be enough for them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product could be great for you if you have acne or just need to brighten your skin a bit. If you&#x27;re looking for a very mild product, this will be great for you. I&#x27;m moving up to the higher percentage and am hoping to see more results.</li>
            <li> I tried the the day I received it. I have never tried a chemical peel before. It didn&#x27;t hurt me but I did turn red. It left my skin very smooth and hydrated after 6 days. I usually have rough skin so this was a godsend.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase of this peel. I have used it 3-4 times in the past few months. I&#x27;ve had good results with very little skin irritation compared to some other peels I have used. I also really like the TCA and salicylic blend. I have conbination skin, so I want a product that addresses both fine lines and lore pores/ minor breakouts. In the past I have used alpha beta peels, but this product is a much gentler way to obtain similar results.</li>
            <li> i have used this product twice.  first time for 45 seconds (because i was scared) and second time for 1 min 45 seconds.  to the eye you couldnt see that my skin was peeling but 3 days after i wiped my face with a black cloth and sure enough dead skin was on there.  i had no redness and no burning. i love this product! i got it to fade my dark spots from post acne and it has done exactly that.  for the heck of it i am going to do 1 more treatment in about 10 days and then i am stopping because i literally dont need anymore make up on my face anymore this product has completely done its job. my skin looks great and feels softer then ever.  i even had someone comment about my face!  i spoke with an esthetician who is a friend and she totally spooked me out (as did my mom) about using this, i am SO GLAD i did not listen. if i can i will update you after my 3rd peel.</li>
            <li> This worked great for me but I quickly built up a resistance for it the 2nd time I used it and it took a lot longer for the chemical to start to work. The first time I used it, it only took about 5 mins within application but the results were good both times.  Definitely do your research, read the directions and be careful and good luck.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of this product but it did not do anything for my acne :( I used it 3 times in hopes that it would eventually heal my skin but it was a no go.</li>
            <li> I was nervous trying a TCA 12% peel for the first time, but this product was great.  I wanted a deeper peel than the traditional AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) peels in had used in the past. The stinging was kept to a minimum with the inclusion of the botanical extracts.  My face did peel for a few days, but nothing too crazy.  My skin looked great after a week or so. Great quality product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see huge improvements yet but I have gotten comments on my skin. Use it for the backs of my hands also. Use lots of cool water to get it all off. I neutralize it after with a t. spoon of baking soda and cup of water on a wash cloth and blot only, not rub. I only flake and I do use a few passes after a couple of minutes like it suggest. I have peels on my hands though because I paint on thicker there. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it was working for me. I never felt it sting when it was on my face and my face never peeled afterwards. I may need a stronger percent.</li>
            <li> I am not very sensitive to smells at all, but this was so strong,  that I could barely breathe when it was applied. However it is a very nice &amp;#34;lunch time peel&amp;#34; skin is left nice and pink with not much discomfort and little to no peeling if applied as the directions Recommend.  still I felt like my throat was closing hours after because of the scent.</li>
            <li> I am 33 years old, with fair skin. My skin is very tolerant - it&#x27;s not sensitive to any products, I&#x27;m not prone to break-outs, and I don&#x27;t have sun damage, wrinkles or discolorations. I&#x27;ve used a 35% Glycolic peel twice per week for the past year, and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any real improvement from that, I can feel it working when I apply it and I think it is helping to maintain my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try something stronger than glycolic so I ordered this 12% TCA. I had previously done a patch test on my neck with a 20% TCA serum and was shocked by the degree of burn that it caused - the patch test peeled like a snake for 10 days and remained red and tender for nearly a week after. So, I was expecting the 12% TCA to be significantly stronger than glycolic, but obviously less so than the 20% TCA solution. A patch test on my neck with the 12% TCA did nothing. I proceeded with applying it to my face a few days later and strictly followed the directions, leaving it on for only 1 minute the first time. It did nothing. I did not even feel a tingling when I applied it. The following week I left it on for the full 4 minutes. Still nothing. No tingling, no tighteness, certainly no frosting. ZERO effect. I tried it again a few more times and continued to feel like I was applying nothing but a syrupy water to my skin. The last time I used this, I left it on for 8 minutes (twice as long as the recommended maximum) just to try to get some kind of effect from it. Still nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that the bottle of Perfect Image 12% TCA that I was sold is either fake, defective or past expiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone back to using 35% Glyolic from Skin Laboratory, which burns slightly upon application, and leaves my skin feeling taut and scrubbed after washing off, so I know it is vigorously exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was a waste of money and I threw the bottle away half-full.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much since I used this peel. It is gentle but very effective. My blackheads has decreased about 70%. My skin is smoother and softer. Be aware, the 2 times you use it, your acne might get a little worse, but be patient; you will see the result very soon.</li>
            <li> Works Well, will purchase again</li>
            <li> Since in my teens I had a serious problem with acne which led to deep acne scars on my face and of course discolouration.  The acne continued during my twenties and thirties only clearing up when I used birth control pills.  When I stopped the pills the acne came back.  I tried light laser peels, retinol creams and did acne facials but the problem still persisted. The acne scars and the two toned complexion was still evident.  I purchase this product and applied it  on my face.  Felt  little burning and washed out immediately.  In about 5 days time saw my face peeling.  After about 2 days my face was completely peeled. The spots were lighter and the acne scars a little less visible.  And the acne was gone! The second time I left the peel longer. This time my face seemed so radiant after peeling. After 4 months of using this product my face has never looked better and I am extremely pleased.  The acne scars are 70% improved and most of the marks have gone.  I plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I followed exact product directions as well as the past reviewers instructions but no developments whatsoever.  Perhaps I got a bad bottle.  Too bad I couldn&#x27;t exchange it without a receipt.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my mother in law for christmas because she liked the 20% salicylic acid peel that i had.  i got her this because she is 45 and was looking for something to revamp per skin.  i chose this one because of the good product reviews and she loved it!!! she uses it once a week and even though she already had beautiful skin this peel gives her a nice glow and it looks wonderful on her.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything in the book. Differin, Rentin- A Micro, Proactive etc.... Nothing seemed to do the trick. For the first time, I feel confident and proud of my skin. Thank you Perfect Image :)</li>
            <li> This product is formulated specifically to help reduce wrinkles, fine lines, acne, scars, and reverse the visible signs of aging on YOUR FACE.  I have some sun spots on my back and will try Lactic Acid by Perfect Image.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this peel being as effective as the one I had done at the medi-spa, but I was pleasantly surprised. It actually gave me a more even all-over peel than the one I paid $125 for. I&#x27;m definitely going to be ordering this peel again.</li>
            <li> This peel is perfect.not too strong or weak.skin felt less dry using this.ill be reordering and telling my friends about this peel</li>
            <li> The product is good. It burns me a lot but I hm just fan myself until I take it off. Works well. Saves money since you don&#x27;t have to go to the spa to do it.</li>
            <li> After decades of outdoor sports, and despite fairly consistent use of sunscreen, my pale skin has lots of freckles (which I don&#x27;t mind) and brown spots - freckles that have joined together to cause trouble (that I do mind).  I use stronger TCA for individual spots, but then I end up with brown crust, followed by peeling that lasts for days and finally red patches that at least can be covered by makeup.  This 12% is terrific for overall rejuvenation that leaves me looking normal.  This product produces only very mild peeling that isn&#x27;t very noticeable  and my skin looks and feels smooth and more even textured.  It seems to target the more pigmented areas (at least that&#x27;s where I get the mild peeling) without feeling like some sort of punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended for weekly use as part of your overall &#x27;maintenance&#x27; routine.  I&#x27;ll still have to use the nuclear stuff for the tough spots, but this is terrific for general use.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described, good price, no complaints. Would recommend this company. Shipping was prompt with amazon prime as always.</li>
            <li> It did not work did 7 peels and I had such high hopes for this product I did 7 chemical peels followed instructions and cleansed with alcohol pads and still made my skin worst then before</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product.  Personally, I DO NOT peel with this product.  So, there is no downtime - yet I can slowly see results.  I am using this to fade red marks from prior acne.  It is something that I can use frequently.  I use 3 layers with 3 min for each.</li>
            <li> I bought this about two months ago and use it twice a week, but I don&#x27;t see much change with my skin. I do feel the slight burn whenever I use it, and I feel that I break out less often, other than that I don&#x27;t see much improvement. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and hope it is what I expected it to be like.</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked better than this product to remove dark spots on my back from acne. I&#x27;ve tried other peels such as glycolic acid but this one worked a lot better. My skin would start peeling about 3 to 5 after I applied the peel and would last about 4 days. No big deal, a very small sacrifice to make. After I was done with the bottle my dark spots were completely gone.</li>
            <li> If you do follow the directions closely it is a good peel. Not great for highly sensitive skin but mine is somewhat sensitive and does fine with it. Wear sunblock! Cetephil Face Lotion is great to use after because it has no additives, don&#x27;t combine with retinol containing skin care products.</li>
            <li> This is a great peel for beginners and is working really well on my acne scars! I have not had any redness or peeling from it but I have noticed (after my second use) my acne scars fading by about 25%. The longest I have kept it on so for is 6.5 minutes, but I will work up to 10. I use a blow dyer on low, cool setting to ease the stinging. I will definitely keep using this and see how much my acne scars disappear. I also bought a brush with it which is really nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly highly recommend SUNSCREEN daily for a solid week after you use this if you are going to be out in the sun at all. I got pink in the cheeks four days after doing a peel while using 30 SPF sunblock and only a couple hours in the sun.</li>
            <li> If you have done other peels before, then you will need something stronger than this.  I have done glycolic, lactic, and salicylic acid peels for the last year or so and was hoping to get a deep peel from a tca. Unfortunately, this was no where near strong enough to do anything to my skin. I did the peel 3 times in a row and left it on for 15+ min with no effect. I&#x27;ll be trying 20% tca next.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly, was packaged well and appeared to contain whatever it was claimed to have, BUT, sorry, it did not just work for me.  Following the instructions, I only felt the minutest sting, no redness, no flaking---no peeling. Probably, it is just not the right concentration for me. I just wish Perfect Image LLC offered sample sizes so I did not have to burn USD30 just to test it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews where people are so cavalier about using various acids on their face.  Not me.  I watch the mirror like I&#x27;m expecting some horror movie at any moment.  When I finally decided to try TCA 12%, it was after trying mild Glycolic and Lactic products that provided &#x27;ok&#x27; results.  I realize that each person&#x27;s skin might respond differently to these solutions, so go with what you feel is best. I had really great results with skin smoothness and pore size reduction from this product and minimal skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll be going back for more Perfect Image products vs a couple of others. First of all, the consistency of the peel solution is perfect.  It&#x27;s viscous enough that it doesn&#x27;t run, or drip.  This to me is paramount in my mind. Another product I purchased was so thin and runny I ended up tossing it out. Lastly, the packaging is user-friendly. This may seem &#x27;silly&#x27; at first, but wait till you order a product that comes to you and there&#x27;s no way to get the liquid out but to pour it. That&#x27;s wasteful, sloppy, and something you don&#x27;t need to worry about when buying from this company.</li>
            <li> Top-notch. I use it about once every two weeks and the texture/tone of my skin has improved visibly. For my own use I leave one layer on for 5-7 minutes and then add a second. For me this results in a light-medium peel after 4-5 days, but everybody will be different. One bit of advice for layered or deeper TCA peels is to refrain from getting your skin wet/washed for as long as you can stand it after the peel has been applied. Absolutely moisturise + lots of SPF, but no washing, scrubbing or soaking. This helps the skin stay supple and protected from cracks or tears in the peeling layer until its good and ready to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only quibble is with the dropper - the black markings do eventually come off in the gel and that&#x27;s sort of icky.</li>
            <li> This product,although much less percentage than you can get with an office visit does a remarkable job with age spots caused from sun damage. I do have some melasma on my face that it really did not seem to even touch or fade much.........the Glycolic seemed to do a much better job of that for me when I used that. The Glycolic I also purchased from Perfect image last year and it was great. Will purchase this TCA again once fall returns!!</li>
            <li> The jury is still out.  I&#x27;m using it mainly to get rid of a slightly pitted scar on my face - it seems to be starting to work, but it looks like it may take awhile.</li>
    </ol>
