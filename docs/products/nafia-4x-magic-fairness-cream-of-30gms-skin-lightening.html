            <li> I did not have any problem with this, though, but what I did not like was the half the quantity inside the already small bottle.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really works.  Give it a few weeks and the results are truly amazing.  I really like the results that I have seen.</li>
            <li> I have bought this cream 2 times and i noticed the result in my skin.My face is very smooth and soft.The sad part of it is the quantity,the bottle is too small.I am writing review for the first time.I live in germany and the shipping time was also great.I am very surprise that some of people here are not satisfy with this cream.The only negative which i mentioned is the quantity.The bottle is too small that is why i  deducted one star.</li>
            <li> false advertisemen .......... extremely small, and I had to sign for it.</li>
            <li> This cream really works I used it for about 5 days and I was really amazed my skin is so light now I was sort of Gabrielle union complexion and now I&#x27;m more riahnna so yes it works Nafia is the cream to use for results..</li>
            <li> Do not buy complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like someone is sitting at home producing this tacky product&lt;br /&gt;Fake reviews does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I am from the city where this cream took off. A college girl basically combined different whitening creams with a skin cream called betnovate which contains steroids.&lt;br /&gt;Yes this cream really does work. But once you stop using it your skin shade will go back to being darker than you started with. And worse, if you keep using it the steroids will finally start showing the damage its been doing on your skin. I have a friend who got serious hyperpigmentation on her skin due to this cream. Her doctor said that the steroids contained in this cream have the potency to eventually affect her liver.&lt;br /&gt;Also the other creams that are being used in this are all banned by the FDA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know all the creams being used in this product because I got the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; from the same college 3 years back. I have made it myself as well. But once I researched the actual creams it was not at all worth it.</li>
            <li> its ok,but too small for the price</li>
            <li> It does not work...&lt;br /&gt;Very dissatisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I went in Brazil last year and I got a tan.&lt;br /&gt;I am so white and it suppose to be easy and faster... 2 bottle until now and NOTHING...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not wanna change my color I just wanna get fairness on my tan that is it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it. Waste money, 100%&lt;br /&gt;Lier all.</li>
            <li> The product works.  What I do not like is the small amount.  The bottle it came in is small....I did not have any problem with this, though, but what I did not like was the half the quantity inside the already small bottle. The small bottle seem like it&#x27;s full to the top, but when you put your finger in the middle, it is full of air...nothing.</li>
            <li> I used this product ,and it seemed to have worked some,not at all what i thought it would do,i was ok with have my skin looked ,i might buy this product again in the near future,it just takes so long to ship to you,that was the biggest problem i had with this company,but the product itself ,i thought it did a good job,my skin look better ,than i thought it would have looked,so i would think about buying from this seller again,it takes a while to ship just remember that when you decide to order this.</li>
            <li> I think all the reviews on this page are fake. If you look at the date for the reviews all of them says one month ago. so sad how people would lie and make you spend your hard earned money on something that don&#x27;t work... I was about to add this product to my cart until I read the reviews.</li>
            <li> I used this product on a dark area on my leg for 2 months and this cream did absolutely nothing it took 2 weeks for shipping and the bottle is tiny I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> As many have already stated, the reviews and photos promoting this product are fake. I fell for the so call before and after photos; the very same ones here were used for a product from Europe called Nur76. This crap is all so fake and these lotions do not work. If you google Beyonce or Rihanna, somehow these products appear to give the illusion that this is what these women used to make their skin lighter and fairer. I paid $90 for a product using these very same pictures and description and they are fake.  The positive reviews are fake, the cream is fake and the advertisement is fake.</li>
            <li> Considering it took  6weeks to get this tiny bottle .. It does work but wished it had come with more of the product.&lt;br /&gt;For the cost I would recommend another product. This one is too much for too little.&lt;br /&gt;Again the product does seem to work but for a thimble full the cost should be much less.</li>
            <li> i did follow the instructions, let the cream sit for 10 hours and my complexion didn&#x27;t change... i did exfoliate multiple times before applying the cream and didn&#x27;t work. Highly Dissapoint with the product. Plus I can tell most reviews here are fake!</li>
            <li> these reviews are so fake pay close attention before purchasing this product, besides the reviews are so racist! talkng about \\&quot;i was negrooo...\\&quot; thats crazy!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand it. Why does Amazon continue to allow these scams to flourish? This is a plague on Amazon... a very embarrassing one, at that. Is Amazon so caught up in making their little cut from each sale that they will close their eyes to these outright scams?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that you cannot trust 5 stars reviews on Amazon anymore is very disturbing. Once upon a time, I would come to Amazon to read the reviews for something I was interested in buying, even if I wasn&#x27;t planning on buying it from Amazon... that was how much I valued Amazon&#x27;s reviews. But now, that has all changed. Amazon has become a CESSPOOL for garbage books and garbage products being sold by people whose only goal is to RIP YOU OFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you read reviews, you should always start with the ONE STAR reviews...that is where you will get the TRUTH about the product or book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE. THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP-OFF. THE FIVE STAR REVIEWS ARE BOGUS, FAKE, PLANTED REVIEWS INTENDED TO SUCKER YOU INTO BUYING THIS GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> Took a while for delivery but used about 2months and noticed a significant improvement in the tone of my skin. Not only lightend my skin but blended the problemed area very well. On my forehead where i had discoloration due to a chemical burn... all gone!!!! I recommend using with glutathione/ kojic acid soaps and a heavy skin moisturizer such as LUBRADERM :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The containers are very small... i recommend buying two or more.</li>
            <li> Im also sure these reviews. Im sure THEY ARE FAKE. Dont be fooled. Its all a scam. If it it wasnt this stuff would probably mess your skin up.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought the cream was good, but the second time was very very disappointing ... they changed the cream of another kind ... a lot more oily .... and it made ​​my facial wounds ... I felt my skin sweating and choking .. . has no air.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was different from the first time I bought cream&lt;br /&gt;In addition, they forgot to close the lid and cream flowed out ....&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed, I would not buy it again ...&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
            <li> I do not think that you will like this product or the customer service. I did not see much improvement and I used it to nearly the last drop. It is not a very good value either the container was very small. Then there is the customer service they are not very friendly. I give this 2 thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God bless,&lt;br /&gt;K.M.</li>
