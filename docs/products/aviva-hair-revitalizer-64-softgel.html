            <li>Wishing Good luck  for others.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s another bonus to this amazing product.....</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say make up your own mind about purchasing this product based on these reviews</li>
            <li>I make most of my purchases on Amazon based on reviews.</li>
            <li>My husband has been taking it for one month and his bald spot is already looking so much better</li>
            <li>trust me you will love it</li>
            <li>I have been using hair vitamins/supplements for years now and have tried so many.  </li>
            <li>I have only wonderful things to say about AVIVA.  </li>
            <li>and now my hair has grown in more, so</li>
            <li>I was introduced to them while shopping on HAUTELOOK (a website I highly recommend for great deals) and it was being sold at a discounted price</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful for her recommendation because in just this short amount of time, I am already seeing great results.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend Aviva to anyone looking for an all-natural way to strengthen and grow their hair.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it</li>
            <li>my hair is strong and healthier.  </li>
            <li>but I feel comfortable with this supplement.</li>
            <li>I went back to using hairfinity and I am happy again, well except for my face.</li>
            <li>My part has filled in thicker, and I even have baby hair growth in the front of my scalp.</li>
            <li>This is great for all different types of hair problems.</li>
            <li>have many of my friends who tried it for 90 days diligently taking all the right dosages for 3 months with NO changes whatsoever.</li>
            <li>this is a beautiful pink capsule that swallows with ease but has no effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I couldn’t believe how effective this product is and how much new hair started to fill in the area where I had nothing.  </li>
            <li>and I am SUPER excited about it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking it now for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>The hair get better really heathy</li>
            <li>I cried of happiness as I thought the only way out was a transplant which I can’t afford.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on my bold spot.</li>
            <li>The new hair growth I received within even just the first month was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Finally, a friend of mine who has been taking Aviva for about 7 months now and has seen amazing results, suggested that I also try it.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>Its worth the try.</li>
            <li>but I like to ballpark a good average</li>
            <li>The soft gel pills are easy to take with my already established vitamin regime.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase my bottles on Living Social for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is beginning to grow back in, grow faster, and look better than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like how this product delivers on its claims!</li>
            <li>I suffered no ill side effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My first suggestion to her was AVIVA.</li>
            <li>Also very easy to swallow and no side effects of taking on an empty stomach.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While there are no &amp;#34;miracle ingredients&amp;#34; in this product - it does address almost every reason why her hair was not growing.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty cool - a nutritional and herbal supplement that supports and restores the bodies natural state of health</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate that it&#x27;s gluten-free and fish-free</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>This one really works.  </li>
            <li>All the reviews are bogus and made by &amp;#34;customers&amp;#34; ( if by customers)  who were paid to write something positive.&lt;br /&gt;Check them out - they all use their FULL names and NEVER posted anything prior.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without AVIVA!</li>
            <li>After switching back my hair is growing tremendously</li>
            <li>I stand by their products and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>bought her a box of Aviva a little more than a month ago</li>
            <li>My hair is stronger, and the new growth is all over.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see any new growth yet</li>
            <li>Finally a product for hair loss that really works!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also extremely soft!</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait until all these new hair gain more length.  </li>
            <li>Within a week of discontinuing it my face started to clear up</li>
            <li>but I think that may have made things more ... delicate for me after I work out.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker,shiny and so soft.</li>
            <li>the oils are coming back and my hair looks and feels so much healthier</li>
            <li>This really works, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>The quality of my hair completely improved.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too early to tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should really change the pills to a different color-</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 6 weeks now and my hair is slowly growing but most of all-</li>
            <li>so it seems a bit dodgy that all 11 reviews below have NO previous reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>First let me say I am an African American woman with texturized hair, not that it matters but someone may want to know.</li>
            <li>Although the pills might seem a little big, they&#x27;re gel-like cap makes it easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>I was born with very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Since starting Aviva, my hair has stopped shedding and there seems to be some new growth.</li>
            <li>My thin hairline upfront filled in with soft baby hair, and now I&#x27;m really noticing the thickness increasing throughout my entire scalp.  </li>
            <li>But after taking it for a month, my wife sees baby hairs growing back in previously bare spots.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s made my hair really soft and much less shedding!</li>
            <li> Definitely no new growth, and no reduction in shedding either.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for hair fallout that disappointed me.</li>
            <li> which I have never gotten with any other hair</li>

            <li> There are other things out there can soften hair with less cost, won&#x27;t continue to buy.</li>
            <li> One day it just hit me, it had to be this pink garbage!!</li>
            <li> Over the past years my hair has become brittle, dry and not growing.  </li>
            <li> Well just after three in a half weeks I had to go in for a fill</li>
            <li> the pink just feel too artificial for a natural product.</li>
            <li> Tried few things b4...</li>
            <li> and i have noticed that my hair is shedding less!</li>
            <li> only other review you should pay attention to - is the one warning you of all these &amp;#34;inflated&amp;#34; and exaggerated  statements.</li>
            <li> I have been taking AVIVA for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> , I usually get my nails done about five to six weeks.</li>
            <li> It has the most horrible side effects.</li>
            <li> all I got was stronger nails :/</li>
            <li> Very few strands of hair in the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half, and the amount that my hair sheds has already decreased SIGNIFICANTLY (no more clogged drains).</li>
            <li> but they seem scripted and forced.</li>
            <li> but then it started to thin out after a while.</li>
            <li> Also, the capsules smell bad and I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> so this stuff is just bad.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s mother has had thinning hair for years, and she hated it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although this formular made my hair feel healthier, I am still very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t make my hair fuller</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST HAIR VITAMIN I HAVE EVER TAKEN.</li>
            <li> Well it was the worst decision I made.</li>
            <li> I have terrible acne scars, terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> waiting for results s far less than a month drinking them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aviva for almost a month now and i have noticed that my hair is shedding less! I have been wearing extensions for years and my hair has become brittle and dense. I can already see my hair starting to grow back where it was damaged.</li>
            <li> I make most of my purchases on Amazon based on reviews. Granted, the items I purchase don&#x27;t all have 5 stars but I like to ballpark a good average so it seems a bit dodgy that all 11 reviews below have NO previous reviews on Amazon. All 11 reviews below rate this product with 5 stars. All 11 reviews below have been using the product for approximately the same amount of time and all with the same results. I&#x27;d say make up your own mind about purchasing this product based on these reviews but they seem scripted and forced. I make a point not to support companies who sell bogus review space on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this product. She told me that she got good results out of it. I got mine from hautelook.com last month and I am taking it for about 3 weeks. I hope it&#x27;s going to work for me as well.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend Aviva to anyone looking for an all-natural way to strengthen and grow their hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half, and the amount that my hair sheds has already decreased SIGNIFICANTLY (no more clogged drains). I also really appreciate that it&#x27;s gluten-free and fish-free; I get so nervous about the chemicals I put in my body but I feel comfortable with this supplement. LOVE THIS STUFF! Strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s mother has had thinning hair for years, and she hated it!&lt;br /&gt;I bought her a box of Aviva a little more than a month ago and she used the product.&lt;br /&gt;Now her hair it is beginning to grow back in, grow faster, and look better than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are no &amp;#34;miracle ingredients&amp;#34; in this product - it does address almost every reason why her hair was not growing.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty cool - a nutritional and herbal supplement that supports and restores the bodies natural state of health&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how this product delivers on its claims!</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful pink capsule that swallows with ease but has no effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have many of my friends who tried it for 90 days diligently taking all the right dosages for 3 months with NO changes whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Thank you to Aviva my hair is strong and healthier.  It looks fuller and with lots of body.  Money well spend</li>
            <li> I bought a 90-day supply, and have stopped taking it after 60 days.  Definitely no new growth, and no reduction in shedding either.  It may work for some, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up.  Also, the capsules smell bad and I&#x27;m not sure but I think that may have made things more ... delicate for me after I work out.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for six weeks and already am seeing great results. My hair is thicker,shiny and so soft. My husband has been taking it for one month and his bald spot is already looking so much better the area is thicker and is starting to fill in. Even if you don&#x27;t have a bald spot or thinning hair I recommend this just for the way it makes your hair look. I also noticed my nails are growing faster, I usually get my nails done about five to six weeks. Well just after three in a half weeks I had to go in for a fill so it&#x27;s another bonus to this amazing product.....trust me you will love it</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; does absolutely nothing. All the reviews are bogus and made by &amp;#34;customers&amp;#34; ( if by customers)  who were paid to write something positive.&lt;br /&gt;Check them out - they all use their FULL names and NEVER posted anything prior. DO not believe a word written.&lt;br /&gt;The only other review you should pay attention to - is the one warning you of all these &amp;#34;inflated&amp;#34; and exaggerated  statements.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended to buy Aviva for stronger and healthier hair. I&#x27;m hoping this product will work for me.</li>
            <li> Finally a product for hair loss that really works! Within 2 weeks of using this product I could wash my hair and not find an abundance of hair in the drain.  Same thing with brushing it.  Very few strands of hair in the brush. And an added bonus, regrowth around the hairline. I&#x27;ve tried so many products for hair fallout that disappointed me. This one really works.  Also very easy to swallow and no side effects of taking on an empty stomach. I can&#x27;t live without AVIVA!</li>
            <li> First let me say I am an African American woman with texturized hair, not that it matters but someone may want to know. THIS IS THE WORST HAIR VITAMIN I HAVE EVER TAKEN. It has the most horrible side effects. I was introduced to them while shopping on HAUTELOOK (a website I highly recommend for great deals) and it was being sold at a discounted price so I said hey why not give it a try. Well it was the worst decision I made. I began to break out like 10 teenagers put together and it started after taking it for about 3 months. Since I was taking it for so long initially I didn&#x27;t think the break outs was because of it. I thought it was foods I ate, shampoos, change in the weather, etc. One day it just hit me, it had to be this pink garbage!! Within a week of discontinuing it my face started to clear up but the damage was already done. I have terrible acne scars, terrible! Forget about drinking water because I drink plenty of it? I always drink a lot of water so this stuff is just bad. I wouldn&#x27;t even recommend anyone even try it because it takes some time to see results (good/bad). Now the results, the only thing it did was thicken my hair but then it started to thin out after a while. Length? Nothing worth mentioning. My eyebrows even thinned out...go figure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went back to using hairfinity and I am happy again, well except for my face. Hairfinity works ladies! After switching back my hair is growing tremendously even my eyebrows grew back!! I am and always will be team Hairfinity! I stand by their products and I highly recommend them. No side effects whatsoever!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using hair vitamins/supplements for years now and have tried so many.  Over the past years my hair has become brittle, dry and not growing.  I have used this product for 6 weeks now and my hair is slowly growing but most of all- the oils are coming back and my hair looks and feels so much healthier which I have never gotten with any other hair supplement- all I got was stronger nails :/</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that it is working--after 3 months.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;m going on 5 weeks now and not only is my hair growing but it&#x27;s also extremely soft! I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens over the next few months. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my hair really soft and much less shedding! Although the pills might seem a little big, they&#x27;re gel-like cap makes it easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> I have been taking AVIVA for the past few months.  The new hair growth I received within even just the first month was amazing.  My thin hairline upfront filled in with soft baby hair, and now I&#x27;m really noticing the thickness increasing throughout my entire scalp.  I can hardly wait until all these new hair gain more length.  The soft gel pills are easy to take with my already established vitamin regime. I suffered no ill side effects whatsoever. No allergies, no nausea feeling after taking the pills.  I have only wonderful things to say about AVIVA.  Truly a wonderful product.  A dear friend of mine just underwent chemo therapy and lost all her hair.  My first suggestion to her was AVIVA.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Aviva for almost a month now and I can already tell that it&#x27;s working.  I have tried every combination of vitamins that you can think of to make my hair healthier and to make it grow, but nothing has worked.  Finally, a friend of mine who has been taking Aviva for about 7 months now and has seen amazing results, suggested that I also try it.  I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful for her recommendation because in just this short amount of time, I am already seeing great results.</li>
            <li> Since starting Aviva, my hair has stopped shedding and there seems to be some new growth. This really works, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought a three month supplies and by the end of the third month except softer hair I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on my bold spot. Although this formular made my hair feel healthier, I am still very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t make my hair fuller and that is the only reason I wanted to try it. There are other things out there can soften hair with less cost, won&#x27;t continue to buy.</li>
            <li> The hair get better really heathy</li>
            <li> Tried few things b4... this product is definitely doing its job according others i tried before. Wishing Good luck  for others.  Its worth the try.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Aviva now for 4 months and I have seen great results. I was born with very fine, thin hair. I thought that there was nothing that I could do about it. I&#x27;ve tried all the thickening shampoos and other products out there that haven&#x27;t worked. All you do is take 2 capsules of Aviva a day, and you&#x27;re set. My part has filled in thicker, and I even have baby hair growth in the front of my scalp. I always felt like my forehead was big and now my hair has grown in more, so it doesn&#x27;t look as big! My hair is stronger, and the new growth is all over. Even my hair stylist noticed a big difference. This is great for all different types of hair problems. I am so thankful for this product.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of taking Aviva, hair started to grow in my bald spot.  I couldn’t believe how effective this product is and how much new hair started to fill in the area where I had nothing.  I cried of happiness as I thought the only way out was a transplant which I can’t afford. The quality of my hair completely improved.  It is healthier and shinier. I definitely recommend Aviva.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I try this product and I am SUPER excited about it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking it now for about 3 weeks and I feel my hair is healthier but I don&#x27;t see any new growth yet but it&#x27;s too early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;My friend had incredible results so I am very happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase my bottles on Living Social for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before decided to take the plunge, I did my research on the ingredients on the Avivahair website.  In additional to minerals like silica and vitamins like folic acid, it also contains Oriental medicinal herbs like Fo Ti which are sold over the counter in Asia to combat graying and thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it work for everyone?  I doubt it.  But after taking it for a month, my wife sees baby hairs growing back in previously bare spots.  We bought the 90 day supply and will report  back if her hair re-growth continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;We are now nearing the end of Month 3 on Aviva- hair is definitely growing back, and it is darker than ever.  Aviva has not completely eliminated all of the balding patches, but over 2/3 of bare areas are now sprouting.  Treatment coincided with a period where sleep and stress levels improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should really change the pills to a different color- the pink just feel too artificial for a natural product.</li>
            <li> I believe my hair has stopped falling....</li>
