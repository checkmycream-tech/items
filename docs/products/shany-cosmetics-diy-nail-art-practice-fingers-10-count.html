            <li>I love these thing&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Okay so if you need fingers like I do.  </li>

            <li>This items i love it</li>
            <li>She loves to do nails and this gives her the tools to practice so she can do an even better job polishing nails.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these fingers, I use one as a dish towel hook on the cabinet door under my sink.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed using them .</li>
            <li>Like it would like to order more when you get.</li>
            <li>Please let me know when you get more,</li>
            <li>i can say is that the forms are made of a strong  plastic that seems to be durable.</li>
            <li>Overall they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as happy with this purchase as I have been with others purchased here on amazon because I only received 9 practice fingers instead of the 10 advertised.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t thing that would work very well either.</li>
            <li>special</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe a cool Halloween decoration?</li>
            <li>The nail fits right in there without falling out when polishing it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of unhappy with the fact that I only recieved 9 out of the 10 but other than that I&#x27;m kind of happy that I will be able to get to practicing on them.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m going to practice free hand nail stamping on the clear nails for future choices, and I&#x27;m SURE</li>
            <li>Love this product, to practice different acrylic styles.</li>
            <li>First time using these.</li>
            <li>And they are pretty neat.</li>
            <li>It a positive for individuals that would like an easier way of removing the finished acrylic nail from the practice form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(pun intended ;-) for much needed practice on my part.  </li>
            <li>REAL</li>
            <li>The price is much lower than the ones you can purchase at the beauty supply stores.  </li>
            <li>thanks you the others  </li>
            <li>Although when I 1st looked at them, they sort of looked creepy lol,  </li>
            <li>but i think is because i&#x27;m new working with it.</li>
            <li>Then, you put your stamped, clear falsie away, and find the plate that you have labeled on the falsie!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am now waiting on two boxes of 500 clear nails for practice sessions.  </li>
            <li>There is not a way to paint on these directly</li>
            <li>I took advantage of the fact that this item was an Add-On item that Amazon offers.</li>
            <li>I also noticed in other reviews where people complained about some of these not being full size and these ones said there were full size--NOT TRUE!!--THEY ARE NOT EVEN ACTUAL FINGERNAILS!!!</li>
            <li>I looked through several of these similar items and read the reviews--I was looking specifically for practice nails that I could paint directly on and could be wiped off with nail polish remover and reused.  </li>

            <li> In the past a bought some from other company and they were really bad, but the quality of this was good</li>
            <li> If you use nail glue you will drive yourself mental.</li>
            <li> So in other words it holds the fingernail in place.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acrylic nails, held by these little fingers while being stamped, without polish, will provide a nice reference for choosing what we would like to stamp over our base coat.  </li>
            <li> less than beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> At less than $4 for 500 pieces, I HAD to by two sets!&lt;br</li>
            <li> ALL THE WAY AND NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO RETURN!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a negative for people that would like to use nail forms to practice forming the nail without the need of plastic tips, nail forms cannot be used be cause any product that is applied to the nail plate of the form (sans an artificial nail) will seep into these wells and run down to the back.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING</li>
            <li> now I have to buy the $1 store fake nails to attach</li>
            <li> are difficult to work with</li>
            <li> The practice finger has a wells around the nail bed that allow for an artificial nail to be inserted into them, these can be seen as negatives and positives.</li>
            <li> IT IS JUST A NUBBIN WITH A GAP WHERE YOU CAN INSERT FAKE NAILS!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The fingers are good the only thing is that the nail would not stay in and you can&#x27;t glue it on</li>
            <li> I love these thing&#x27;s. Although when I 1st looked at them, they sort of looked creepy lol,  but i use them just to practice. I&#x27;ve never removed the plastic for the sticker at the bottom, which would be used to mount them as a display. Overall they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> GREAT IDEA WORKS REAL WELL</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY IF YOUR GOING TO BE GLUING NAILS ON . they will NOT stay !! And I only got 5 fingers not 10 !</li>
            <li> Okay so if you need fingers like I do.  These are great.  The nail fits right in there without falling out when polishing it.  So in other words it holds the fingernail in place.  What more should I say it works.  The price is much lower than the ones you can purchase at the beauty supply stores.  Let&#x27;s just say I brought all ten (10) fingers for the price of one finger at our beauty supply place.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I looked through several of these similar items and read the reviews--I was looking specifically for practice nails that I could paint directly on and could be wiped off with nail polish remover and reused.  I also noticed in other reviews where people complained about some of these not being full size and these ones said there were full size--NOT TRUE!!--THEY ARE NOT EVEN ACTUAL FINGERNAILS!!! IT IS JUST A NUBBIN WITH A GAP WHERE YOU CAN INSERT FAKE NAILS!!  There is not a way to paint on these directly and YES, THEY ARE SMALL--NOT FULL SIZE!!  FALSE ADVERTISING ALL THE WAY AND NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO RETURN!!  now I have to buy the $1 store fake nails to attach so I can practice--if I can find any....</li>
            <li> Works for nail service practice! less than beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased these practice fingers thinking that they would help me practice not only acrylics but also gel. let me out line why they won&#x27;t work for gels. The practice finger has a wells around the nail bed that allow for an artificial nail to be inserted into them, these can be seen as negatives and positives. It&#x27;s a negative for people that would like to use nail forms to practice forming the nail without the need of plastic tips, nail forms cannot be used be cause any product that is applied to the nail plate of the form (sans an artificial nail) will seep into these wells and run down to the back. It a positive for individuals that would like an easier way of removing the finished acrylic nail from the practice form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i can say is that the forms are made of a strong  plastic that seems to be durable. I&#x27;m not as happy with this purchase as I have been with others purchased here on amazon because I only received 9 practice fingers instead of the 10 advertised. I took advantage of the fact that this item was an Add-On item that Amazon offers. I&#x27;m kind of unhappy with the fact that I only recieved 9 out of the 10 but other than that I&#x27;m kind of happy that I will be able to get to practicing on them.</li>
            <li> This items i love it thanks you the others  Im not received yet</li>
            <li> I should have thought of that, but I&#x27;m not in cosmetician training!  &lt;lol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will be \\&quot;handy\\&quot; (pun intended ;-) for much needed practice on my part.  I don&#x27;t EVER want to shell out $60 a piece for simple manicures for my two daughters&#x27; special events!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m going to practice free hand nail stamping on the clear nails for future choices, and I&#x27;m SURE my girls and their friends will want to play along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now waiting on two boxes of 500 clear nails for practice sessions.  At less than $4 for 500 pieces, I HAD to by two sets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acrylic nails, held by these little fingers while being stamped, without polish, will provide a nice reference for choosing what we would like to stamp over our base coat.  This is a great idea I found on YouTube.  Then, you put your stamped, clear falsie away, and find the plate that you have labeled on the falsie!</li>
            <li> I was actually looking for something that I could use to attach &#x27;press-on&#x27; nails to so I could paint and decorate them. If you use nail glue you will drive yourself mental. Nothing sticks to these things. I&#x27;m guessing that these are meant to be used for practicing with acrylic nails. To be honest, I don&#x27;t thing that would work very well either. There is a sticker at the bottom that allows you to attach the fingers to a desk or workstation but unless you plan on keeping them there forever there just is no point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a cool Halloween decoration?</li>
            <li> I like these they help me practice my skills, you know what they say  practice makes prefect. So try them!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good time on shipping and product</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my niece as a birthday gift.  She loves to do nails and this gives her the tools to practice so she can do an even better job polishing nails.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these fingers, I use one as a dish towel hook on the cabinet door under my sink. I have one in my cubicle for my sun glasses and keys. I give them to my friends and neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using them as stocking stuffers this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Love this product, to practice different acrylic styles.</li>
            <li> are difficult to work with but i think is because i&#x27;m new working with it. but the idea about getting more practice fingers is good.</li>
            <li> In the past a bought some from other company and they were really bad, but the quality of this was good and I really enjoyed using them .</li>
            <li> First time using these. And they are pretty neat.</li>
            <li> Like it would like to order more when you get. Need for my students. very pleased. Please let me know when you get more,</li>
