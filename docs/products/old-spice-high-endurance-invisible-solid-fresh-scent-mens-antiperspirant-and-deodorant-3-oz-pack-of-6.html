    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Best Anti-Perspirant I have found.  </li>
            <li>Great quality for the money.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and my husbands swear by it.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>and I think it smells really good.</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>got it by warehouse deal and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>This smells great and keeps me clean.  </li>
            <li>But these Old Spice are perfect!</li>
            <li>My husband uses this every day, and I love the ability to pick it up online without going to the store.  </li>
            <li>As a package of 6 together the price is cheaper than most stores with a sale.</li>
            <li>The degree 24 hours gives better protection.</li>
            <li>After you apply the deodorant, it is mostly invisible, except if you were to apply overly liberal doses of it, and so will not stain your tee or shirt.</li>
            <li>This brand is My husband&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>This was ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many Anti-Perspirants...</li>
            <li>which is what&#x27;s most important.</li>
            <li>Lasts very long and smells very good.</li>
            <li>I do love the fresh smell, it makes you feel in the boat.</li>
            <li>I like most of the scents and decided on Fresh.  </li>
            <li>Did not realize that it leaves a white residue, otherwise it works great.</li>
            <li>The new &amp;#34;Fiji&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Denali&amp;#34;, etc... series of deodorants tend to have a strong, over-powering smell that can get up your nostrils, so I liked the fact that this series does the job of deodorizing, and does it well.</li>
            <li>Yes it is my Favorite thank you very much</li>
            <li>Love the smell, don&#x27;t love the white stains in all my shirts...</li>
            <li>If so, let me take a quick shot at describing the product:&lt;br /&gt;Old</li>
            <li>This is the only anti-perspirant that I&#x27;ll use so I was glad to see Amazon had it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>the 6 pack, you will have deodorant for one hell of a long time, unless you use more than 11 swipes when applying or go to the gym more than 5 times a day.</li>
            <li>Spice High Endurance Fresh leads with vibrant aromas of baby powder and marshmallows accentuated with notes of warm caramel, apple pie and sweet plum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the regular Fresh scented deodorant, so I tried the deo/antipersperant</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Fresh Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I had used this product in the past and liked it, so I decided to buy it in bulk to make sure I would have it.</li>
            <li>Not fancy and sometimes get white marks on my clothing, but overall a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I will rebuy more than likely.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s tried many but always comes back to this one.  </li>
            <li>If you are shopping for deodorant on Amazon without having tried it first, then you are a braver person than I.  </li>
            <li>It is an OK deodorant will not last the promised 24 hours after 12 you start to &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I first bought this exact deodorant in 1995, in Grade 7, and haven&#x27;t switched since.  </li>
            <li>The Old Spice stick stays true to the end.</li>
            <li>Subscribe and Save has saved me so much time and energy by delivering these types of items to the front door.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The bar has a silky yet supple texture leaving only light traces of residue when gliding on.</li>
            <li>if the stick is turned out too much it will press against the sides and pinch against the deodorant.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using Old Spice since before we were married some 41 years ago.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant smells great but does a mediocre job at being an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a real deal breaker because I can apply it as often as I want since I bought 2 of these packs for ridiculously cheap</li>
            <li>could not verify how high the endurance actually gets, but preliminary tests indicate pretty damn high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of the above happen, and it&#x27;s the only Anti-Perspirant that works the full 24 hours (sometimes longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the scent isn&#x27;t as prominent, and sweating causes my black undershirts to turn a shade of white until they&#x27;re washed, but I still like it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still the idea that this is an antiperspirant and deodorant and should make a modest attempt at both.</li>
            <li>For some reason all the ones I can find in stores are all in the old containers.</li>
            <li>I like old spice.</li>
            <li>Exact same stuff as you get in the store, only you pay $2 a stick instead of $4.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant/anti perspirant product that will keep me from getting sweaty or stinky for at least 24 hours or more.</li>
            <li>I have wore many deodorants that would last me all day working outside and then exercising afterwards having only been applied once heavy in the morning.</li>
            <li>Most days I find myself simply sweating through it after only being outside a few minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>After trying out several different deodorants I finally settled on the Old Spice solid deodorants, since they did the job without having an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind what container it&#x27;s in, but this new container is harder to turn the knob and the cap tapers off, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new brand since the other ones I had been using weren&#x27;t working as well anymore.</li>

            <li> It is very sticky so when showering you will need to scrub your axilla at least 3 times to get it all off.</li>
            <li> Or worse of all, the protection doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised and my poor colleagues are treated to my natural scent.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of deodorant exclusively for the past decade because it just works.</li>
            <li> slimy armpits, no burning sensation, no overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> Just getting hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Trust me it sucks.</li>
            <li> but I ordered the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> All of them leave me under arms feeling uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> Good price. Received as advertised!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this every day, and I love the ability to pick it up online without going to the store.  Subscribe and Save has saved me so much time and energy by delivering these types of items to the front door.  My walmart list has been reduced to milk, meats, and frozen goods.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, don&#x27;t love the white stains in all my shirts...</li>
            <li> As a package of 6 together the price is cheaper than most stores with a sale. Comparable pricing at Wal-Mart with coupon</li>
            <li> Lasts very long and smells very good. I switched from Dove deodorant because it would always crumble and fall apart towards the end of the stick. The Old Spice stick stays true to the end.</li>
            <li> I have wore many deodorants that would last me all day working outside and then exercising afterwards having only been applied once heavy in the morning.

            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the regular Fresh scented deodorant, so I tried the deo/antipersperant and it&#x27;s not much different. the scent isn&#x27;t as prominent, and sweating causes my black undershirts to turn a shade of white until they&#x27;re washed, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new brand since the other ones I had been using weren&#x27;t working as well anymore. This works the 24 hours for me.</li>

            <li> If you are shopping for deodorant on Amazon without having tried it first, then you are a braver person than I.  If so, let me take a quick shot at describing the product:&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice High Endurance Fresh leads with vibrant aromas of baby powder and marshmallows accentuated with notes of warm caramel, apple pie and sweet plum. The bar has a silky yet supple texture leaving only light traces of residue when gliding on. The nose lingers without being overpowering and lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  could not verify how high the endurance actually gets, but preliminary tests indicate pretty damn high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the 6 pack, you will have deodorant for one hell of a long time, unless you use more than 11 swipes when applying or go to the gym more than 5 times a day.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of Fresh Old Spice. I also like buying it in bulk!</li>
            <li> This smells great and keeps me clean.  I like most of the scents and decided on Fresh.  I only need apply in the morning and the anti-persperant keeps me all day.  It is not a gel but rather the white stick.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many Anti-Perspirants... All of them leave me under arms feeling uncomfortable. Or itchy. Or worse of all, the protection doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised and my poor colleagues are treated to my natural scent. Trust me it sucks. But these Old Spice are perfect! None of the above happen, and it&#x27;s the only Anti-Perspirant that works the full 24 hours (sometimes longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing on the market for men&#x27;s hygiene!</li>
            <li> nice. got it by warehouse deal and the scent is nice. soothing feelings. you can buy it. I like old spice.</li>
