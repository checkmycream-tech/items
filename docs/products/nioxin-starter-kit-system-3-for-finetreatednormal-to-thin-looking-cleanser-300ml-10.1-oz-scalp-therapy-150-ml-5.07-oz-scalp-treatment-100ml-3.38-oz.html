            <li>Amazing products.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice, cooling sensation on your scalp.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>It gives this good, healthy look and helps my hair to do well.</li>
            <li>I have really liked this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>if I could substitute or add my own conditioner.</li>
            <li>gave it 2 stars because I liked the scent and tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how this product got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>My ends seem to be splitting more than before I started using this product, and my scalp was actually more dry/irritated!</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was by far the best.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>Good quality, good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>However, it certainly does a great cleaning job and makes your scalp tingle</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am sooo pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels so much more healthy.</li>
            <li>I had thinning hair on top and an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because its supposed to promote a healthy scalp, and reduce thinning hair.</li>
            <li>It does seem to give it a bit more body than before.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and it is OK.  </li>
            <li>Love the nioxin kit.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>, PLAN TO ORDER MORE AS NEEDED</li>
            <li>and I did not get better.  </li>
            <li>I will keep this up for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had to check over my husband before he leaves for work to make sure there are no strands stuck to him or his clothes (gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it supposed to be more volume</li>
            <li>I love this starter kit</li>
            <li>, I thought I&#x27;d try Amazon for better prices.</li>
            <li>I felt I was pulling out even more hair trying to comb through the snarls and tangles.</li>
            <li>In fact, I noticed more and more hair in the sink, on the floor and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for close to 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I see results, my hair feels thicker or with more volume.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>and it changed my hair for the better.  </li>
            <li>The #3 bottle seems to give my hair more body.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love to use the minty shampoo as body soap.</li>
            <li>It wakes me up and feels so clean, you know lkie flossing with mint floss!</li>
            <li>It is a very good product for any hair but especially for chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>and wow I am amazed and so happy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product gave me such great results.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for anyone with thinning hair as well as for breakage.</li>
            <li>Love the tingling cool feeling on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I had fine hair and didn&#x27;t like the way it felt.</li>
            <li>so I received this hair system for free to try it out.    </li>
            <li>The smell is very menthol-y, but also nice.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It puts my hair in soft feelings and smells good.</li>
            <li>My husband looked at me last night and says \\&quot;your hair looks good, looks thicker like a lion!\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>Regardless, the product is easy to use and has had no bad effect on me.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to go one higher and see how the #4 for color treated hair works better.  </li>
            <li>I think I need to give it some more uses first.     </li>
            <li>significant improvement within 2 to 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Also gets your hair really clean, as well as most higher end shampoos</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first day, but after a week, my hair is looking as good as it did in high school, and that was 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up on my hair and my hair feels clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product that I have used before and cannot obtain through normal retail channels where I live.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Please know, when you use the scalp spray - it will leave you skin bright RED -</li>
            <li>The scent is quite nice and the products leave your hair soft and manaegable, but</li>
            <li>Nioxin System 3 really does work, I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this product, my skimpy, baby fine hair is feeling much thicker and looks very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smells great though, like mints...just not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS !!</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>maybe too much so if you have fine, color treated hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Well, much to my sorrow, this didn&#x27;t really help my hair grow in thicker nor do I feel like I grew in more.</li>
            <li>A lot of people have had success using this with hair loss and they&#x27;ve said that it&#x27;s stopped their hair loss.</li>
            <li>Fresh minty smell.  </li>
            <li>Its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have used this same brand before and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Will worth the money.  </li>
            <li>; I just have very very fine hair which barely covers my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched to Jon Frieda&#x27;s Root Awakening line, which is cheaper, more readily available and left my hair in a vastly better condition (soft, managable, and noticibly fuller within the first two weeks).</li>
            <li>This product has a wonderful mint smell and has been very gentle on my hair as well, would recommend it to others to try who have thin hair problems.</li>
            <li>It is just right for me</li>
            <li>Really gets you scalp clean.  </li>
            <li>and I see new hair growth!!!</li>
            <li>This is great considering the extremely hard water in our area.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m not terribly unstatified, but I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li>This product actually made me lose more hair.</li>
            <li>The cleanser and conditioner also looked cheap and old.</li>
            <li>Felt thicker volume with the first use.  </li>
            <li>After shampooing, you might want to rub in a litle leave in conditioner (not a heavy on) because theirs is vey light.</li>
            <li>I literally counted how many hairs I lost 15 in total.</li>
            <li>I love Nioxin products, wish I had purchased much larger bottles.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they would supply more of the Therapy bottle.  </li>
            <li>She even picked up my first kit from beauty supply for me.</li>
            <li>Final step, I applied scalp treatment, after spreading the liquid out the whole scalp, I combed my hair as direction, they were falling out one more time.</li>
            <li>I used this religiously for a month before realizing that it really wasn&#x27;t just in my head and that I was losing more hair than before I used it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is color-treated and fine, and has no volume usually, but this stuff makes it full and bouncy!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have hair loss</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my scalp feel (and my cat loves the minty smell).</li>
            <li>It really reminds me of a Tea Tree treatment.</li>
            <li>this product saved my hair and kept me out of a depression--need to use all three to really get the benefits.  </li>
            <li>because it does the job I need it to do, it really takes care of my hair.</li>
            <li>You cannot imagine how much hair falls out in the shower and again when I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li>It helps but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;patches\\&quot; of missing hair, I can definitely see my scalp on top a lot more than I did before, and I would find strands of hair throughout the house.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen as much hair coming off in the comb, or in the shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it helps prevent hair loss,but it&#x27;s not to pricey to not try it.  </li>
            <li>I saw so much improvement in reducing my hair loss.  </li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t really \\&quot;thinning,\\</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the shampoo makes much difference</li>
            <li>I have recommended the Nioxin to my mother who is going thin on her head and we will see if she is as happy as me with the results.</li>
            <li>it did not make my hair soft or manageable, and i felt like i was losing more hair when i brushed it because it was so unmanagable.</li>
            <li>I get that this system focuses on your scalp not your hair, but I need the thin hair I have left to look its best.</li>
            <li>Started the use of Nioxin a few weeks ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Right now I think it is two early to tell.</li>
            <li>where in runs down your neck or ears - BRIGHT Red.  </li>
            <li>that said, it&#x27;s a decent shampoo.</li>
            <li>One of the symptoms is having thinning hair (mine is mild to moderate).</li>
            <li>Besides it makes everything that comes into contact with it super red.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought these products at the advice of my hairdresser with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I think they should modify the nozzle so that it sprays a little more like a mist than</li>
            <li>My hair looks better now than it has in a few years.</li>
            <li>It feels almost too thin &amp; watery and I feel like I need to use a lot of the product to do any good.</li>
            <li>But I do notice that my hair is very clean and fluffy after using it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a very refreshing minty scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and I do notice some new growth.</li>
            <li>All three products were brand new, in their box</li>
            <li>I like it but haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth yet.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to anyone who needs help in reducing hairloss and growing new hair.</li>
            <li>I have 2 inches of new hair growth in the front at part.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference not only in the health of my hair, but in the overall condition and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me more than few months to get clear skin with oral acne</li>
            <li>I purchased this 3-step (No 3) Nioxin product based on my hairdresser&#x27;s strong recommendation and previous use of Nioxin products.</li>
            <li>So it is very clear the way it works.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to determine if it will be helpful to my fine, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>So far the only result I have been able to see is that I am loosing less hair than before using it, but I haven seen any new hair growing because of the use of the product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out any worse than a normal shampoo does, but I don&#x27;t see any remarkable difference in the thickness or quality of my hair.</li>
            <li>I am sometimes sensitive to cosmetic products - but not this one.</li>
            <li>After some research, I figured that maybe my current shampoos were leaving too much scalp buildup that was causing my hair to fall out.</li>
            <li>Nioxin provided me the opportunity to regrow my hair,provide nourishment after shampoo which made me look a whole lot better,and peace of mind in presenting myself to the public.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about a difference yet, but my hair feels soft and not brittle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether I used too much or not enough or what</li>
            <li>I then went back to the product I was using before and am much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the sheer amount of hair shed really scared me.  </li>
            <li>I have less breakage and my hair is full.  </li>
            <li>No other products needed for my straight, blonde cut.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner both smell fresh and minty, and I have noticed no dryness at all, as some other reviews reported.</li>
            <li>This kit not only cleans and volumizes but also creates an opportunity for new hair growth!</li>
            <li>(I used the same amount of shampoo/conditioner I would normally use), but these products made my hair so unmanageable</li>
            <li>said the same thing but saw new growth.</li>
            <li>Both of the Nioxin Cleanser bottles arrived only half full.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how my fine, limp hair looked after using the Nioxin system only one time - clean, shiny and thick with lots of body.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Because wrinkles, hot flashes, night sweats, and stubborn weight gain aren&#x27;t enough, now I&#x27;m seeing an alarming amount of hair in the drain every time I shampoo.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I shave the sides of my head, what&#x27;s on top will look thicker and I&#x27;m really tired of the bald-ish patches on the sides.</li>
            <li>I would not say that I have more hair, but it def makes changes to my thin</li>
            <li>Recent, minor health issues had left my hair looking dry, thin and drab, even after a great cut.</li>
            <li>In the first 2 weeks of using I had less hair falling out</li>
            <li>It was quite a pinch on my social security budget to buy these items</li>
            <li>It actually works really well with my thinning hair due to my thyroid issues and Lupus.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair, down til right about my butt</li>
            <li>After drying my hair naturally, it was a frizzy puffball and felt dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>My hair strands were filling my hair brush every week and was becoming quiet thin, since I started using this product on my hair has almost quit thining out</li>
            <li>&quot; it was always thin and baby fine.  </li>

            <li> The texture and smell is good.  </li>
            <li> This was a good purchase and price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the line of my part is not as faded, which is a good sign.</li>
            <li> Good product if you need to give your hair a boost of confidence.</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> They smell good.</li>

            <li> Did not have good results.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Yes, I loved the smell and the tingling sensation it gives to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I like product, is a good product.  </li>
            <li> If not I think I might continue to use this product once in awhile because it does work as a good shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I been using for this for 2 months now and very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser is very pleased as am I.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and delivery of product.</li>
            <li> Love this - works well!  </li>
            <li> So glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Great seller, product arrived very quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Amazing products.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice, cooling sensation on your scalp.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> It gives this good, healthy look and helps my hair to do well.</li>
            <li> I have really liked this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> if I could substitute or add my own conditioner.</li>
            <li> gave it 2 stars because I liked the scent and tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how this product got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> My ends seem to be splitting more than before I started using this product, and my scalp was actually more dry/irritated!</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was by far the best.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> However, it certainly does a great cleaning job and makes your scalp tingle</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I am sooo pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels so much more healthy.</li>
            <li> I had thinning hair on top and an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because its supposed to promote a healthy scalp, and reduce thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It does seem to give it a bit more body than before.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and it is OK.  </li>
            <li> Love the nioxin kit.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> , PLAN TO ORDER MORE AS NEEDED</li>
            <li> and I did not get better.  </li>
            <li> I will keep this up for sure.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had to check over my husband before he leaves for work to make sure there are no strands stuck to him or his clothes (gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it supposed to be more volume</li>
            <li> I love this starter kit</li>
            <li> , I thought I&#x27;d try Amazon for better prices.</li>
            <li> I felt I was pulling out even more hair trying to comb through the snarls and tangles.</li>
            <li> In fact, I noticed more and more hair in the sink, on the floor and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for close to 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I see results, my hair feels thicker or with more volume.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it changed my hair for the better.  </li>
            <li> The #3 bottle seems to give my hair more body.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love to use the minty shampoo as body soap.</li>
            <li> It wakes me up and feels so clean, you know lkie flossing with mint floss!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product for any hair but especially for chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> and wow I am amazed and so happy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product gave me such great results.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for anyone with thinning hair as well as for breakage.</li>
            <li> Love the tingling cool feeling on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I had fine hair and didn&#x27;t like the way it felt.</li>
            <li> so I received this hair system for free to try it out.    </li>
            <li> The smell is very menthol-y, but also nice.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It puts my hair in soft feelings and smells good.</li>
            <li> My husband looked at me last night and says \\&quot;your hair looks good, looks thicker like a lion!\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> Regardless, the product is easy to use and has had no bad effect on me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to go one higher and see how the #4 for color treated hair works better.  </li>
            <li> I think I need to give it some more uses first.     </li>
            <li> significant improvement within 2 to 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Also gets your hair really clean, as well as most higher end shampoos</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first day, but after a week, my hair is looking as good as it did in high school, and that was 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up on my hair and my hair feels clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used before and cannot obtain through normal retail channels where I live.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Please know, when you use the scalp spray - it will leave you skin bright RED -</li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice and the products leave your hair soft and manaegable, but</li>
            <li> Nioxin System 3 really does work, I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my skimpy, baby fine hair is feeling much thicker and looks very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smells great though, like mints...just not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS !!</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> maybe too much so if you have fine, color treated hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Well, much to my sorrow, this didn&#x27;t really help my hair grow in thicker nor do I feel like I grew in more.</li>
            <li> A lot of people have had success using this with hair loss and they&#x27;ve said that it&#x27;s stopped their hair loss.</li>
            <li> Fresh minty smell.  </li>
            <li> Its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have used this same brand before and liked it.  </li>
            <li> Will worth the money.  </li>
            <li> ; I just have very very fine hair which barely covers my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to Jon Frieda&#x27;s Root Awakening line, which is cheaper, more readily available and left my hair in a vastly better condition (soft, managable, and noticibly fuller within the first two weeks).</li>
            <li> This product has a wonderful mint smell and has been very gentle on my hair as well, would recommend it to others to try who have thin hair problems.</li>
            <li> It is just right for me</li>
            <li> Really gets you scalp clean.  </li>
            <li> and I see new hair growth!!!</li>
            <li> This is great considering the extremely hard water in our area.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m not terribly unstatified, but I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> This product actually made me lose more hair.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and conditioner also looked cheap and old.</li>
            <li> Felt thicker volume with the first use.  </li>
            <li> After shampooing, you might want to rub in a litle leave in conditioner (not a heavy on) because theirs is vey light.</li>
            <li> I literally counted how many hairs I lost 15 in total.</li>
            <li> I love Nioxin products, wish I had purchased much larger bottles.  </li>
            <li> I only wish they would supply more of the Therapy bottle.  </li>
            <li> She even picked up my first kit from beauty supply for me.</li>
            <li> Final step, I applied scalp treatment, after spreading the liquid out the whole scalp, I combed my hair as direction, they were falling out one more time.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously for a month before realizing that it really wasn&#x27;t just in my head and that I was losing more hair than before I used it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is color-treated and fine, and has no volume usually, but this stuff makes it full and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have hair loss</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my scalp feel (and my cat loves the minty smell).</li>
            <li> It really reminds me of a Tea Tree treatment.</li>
            <li> this product saved my hair and kept me out of a depression--need to use all three to really get the benefits.  </li>
            <li> because it does the job I need it to do, it really takes care of my hair.</li>
            <li> You cannot imagine how much hair falls out in the shower and again when I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> It helps but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;patches\\&quot; of missing hair, I can definitely see my scalp on top a lot more than I did before, and I would find strands of hair throughout the house.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen as much hair coming off in the comb, or in the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it helps prevent hair loss,but it&#x27;s not to pricey to not try it.  </li>
            <li> I saw so much improvement in reducing my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t really \\&quot;thinning,\\</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the shampoo makes much difference</li>
            <li> I have recommended the Nioxin to my mother who is going thin on her head and we will see if she is as happy as me with the results.</li>
            <li> it did not make my hair soft or manageable, and i felt like i was losing more hair when i brushed it because it was so unmanagable.</li>
            <li> I get that this system focuses on your scalp not your hair, but I need the thin hair I have left to look its best.</li>
            <li> Started the use of Nioxin a few weeks ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Right now I think it is two early to tell.</li>
            <li> where in runs down your neck or ears - BRIGHT Red.  </li>
            <li> that said, it&#x27;s a decent shampoo.</li>
            <li> One of the symptoms is having thinning hair (mine is mild to moderate).</li>
            <li> Besides it makes everything that comes into contact with it super red.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these products at the advice of my hairdresser with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I think they should modify the nozzle so that it sprays a little more like a mist than</li>
            <li> My hair looks better now than it has in a few years.</li>
            <li> It feels almost too thin &amp; watery and I feel like I need to use a lot of the product to do any good.</li>
            <li> But I do notice that my hair is very clean and fluffy after using it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a very refreshing minty scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I do notice some new growth.</li>
            <li> All three products were brand new, in their box</li>
            <li> I like it but haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth yet.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to anyone who needs help in reducing hairloss and growing new hair.</li>
            <li> I have 2 inches of new hair growth in the front at part.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference not only in the health of my hair, but in the overall condition and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me more than few months to get clear skin with oral acne</li>
            <li> I purchased this 3-step (No 3) Nioxin product based on my hairdresser&#x27;s strong recommendation and previous use of Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> So it is very clear the way it works.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to determine if it will be helpful to my fine, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> So far the only result I have been able to see is that I am loosing less hair than before using it, but I haven seen any new hair growing because of the use of the product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out any worse than a normal shampoo does, but I don&#x27;t see any remarkable difference in the thickness or quality of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am sometimes sensitive to cosmetic products - but not this one.</li>
            <li> After some research, I figured that maybe my current shampoos were leaving too much scalp buildup that was causing my hair to fall out.</li>
            <li> Nioxin provided me the opportunity to regrow my hair,provide nourishment after shampoo which made me look a whole lot better,and peace of mind in presenting myself to the public.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about a difference yet, but my hair feels soft and not brittle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I used too much or not enough or what</li>
            <li> I then went back to the product I was using before and am much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the sheer amount of hair shed really scared me.  </li>
            <li> I have less breakage and my hair is full.  </li>
            <li> No other products needed for my straight, blonde cut.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner both smell fresh and minty, and I have noticed no dryness at all, as some other reviews reported.</li>
            <li> This kit not only cleans and volumizes but also creates an opportunity for new hair growth!</li>
            <li> (I used the same amount of shampoo/conditioner I would normally use), but these products made my hair so unmanageable</li>
            <li> said the same thing but saw new growth.</li>
            <li> Both of the Nioxin Cleanser bottles arrived only half full.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how my fine, limp hair looked after using the Nioxin system only one time - clean, shiny and thick with lots of body.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Because wrinkles, hot flashes, night sweats, and stubborn weight gain aren&#x27;t enough, now I&#x27;m seeing an alarming amount of hair in the drain every time I shampoo.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I shave the sides of my head, what&#x27;s on top will look thicker and I&#x27;m really tired of the bald-ish patches on the sides.</li>
            <li> I would not say that I have more hair, but it def makes changes to my thin</li>
            <li> Recent, minor health issues had left my hair looking dry, thin and drab, even after a great cut.</li>
            <li> In the first 2 weeks of using I had less hair falling out</li>
            <li> It was quite a pinch on my social security budget to buy these items</li>
            <li> It actually works really well with my thinning hair due to my thyroid issues and Lupus.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, down til right about my butt</li>
            <li> After drying my hair naturally, it was a frizzy puffball and felt dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair strands were filling my hair brush every week and was becoming quiet thin, since I started using this product on my hair has almost quit thining out</li>
            <li> &quot; it was always thin and baby fine.  </li>
            <li> I rarely wear my hair down, so I haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in volume, but I am definitely losing much less hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money, could not tell any difference and the product looked and smelled extremely old!!  </li>
            <li> I was also dissapointed in how long the standard shipping took.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product having used Nioxin products before to help with some hair loss (I&#x27;m a compulsive hair-dyer and so at times  my scalp/hair really takes a beating) and in the past I&#x27;ve always been satified; but after a month of using this package, though I found considerably less hair falling out each time I washed my hair, I did experience unexpected dry-ness.</li>
            <li> The skin becomes very irritated and you need to wash it off and wait half an hour until it calms down.</li>
            <li> I was so afraid of touching my hair cuz it may make them fall out, so I just let it stay there for 3 mins and washed off.</li>
            <li> I am female, 48 years old, and have noticed my color-treated hair thinning in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> it for a long time for alopecia;</li>
            <li> The shampoo goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could have used these products long enough to review their effectiveness at thickening my hair, but I had to stop using them after three tries.</li>
            <li> I check my hair by parting it down the middle (where female pattern baldness occurs) and check for any fading.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I shampoo my hair by the cleanser and got bunch of my hair on my balm ( as I said my hair had stopped falling out since using the tablets, so I totally got shocked when seeing that much hair falling out again)</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry out my hair</li>
            <li> I do recommend adding a leave in conditioner on the ends of your hair if it is prone to breaking or is dry.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel dry like it</li>
            <li> It really works for hair starting to thin.</li>
            <li> Not totally convinced that it&#x27;s working, my hair is still falling out due to a temporary medical condition, but maybe it is falling out less.  </li>
            <li> If anybody has had actual hair re-growth with other products, Please let me know before I&#x27;m having to shop the Dolly Partin wig shop!</li>
            <li> It should be applied to the scalp in towel dried hair (not completely dry),</li>
            <li> After using this product for 4 days, my hair got very dry and brittle and broke off 1\\&quot; from the root.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disapointed that the conditioner was in a smaller bottle than the shampoo : the picture is misleading.</li>
            <li> the product smells like mint medicine, which isnt so bad, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed less breakage - only a few hairs on my brush.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure this was solely due to the product or a possible thyroid problem.  </li>
            <li> I no longer can feel the buildup that used to feel with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and other people</li>
            <li> I have ordered other items (CD&#x27;s, books, etc.)</li>
            <li> Thinning hair due to medication and menopause.  </li>
            <li> kit is small, which wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me because this was just to try it out.</li>
            <li> and when i use other products.</li>
            <li> Now it is fuller but without the dryness and stiffness that other \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; products can cause.  </li>
            <li> I have been using every other day for about 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but it really does change the texture of your hair, making it feel thicker.</li>
            <li> I have notice less hair falling out in shower</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t want to chance of getting less hair than I started with.  </li>
            <li> I lose less hair and it got thicker.</li>
            <li> In other words, it hits one spot on your scalp and then runs down, usually towards your face.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks its been less loss.</li>
            <li> However, I thought it was because my hair was not familiar with those chemicals yet, so gave it another try.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since I notice that my hair was thinning a little.</li>
            <li> I has stopped using them now, after few weeks using ( about 3 times/ week) w/o any improvement but worse-ment.     </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Totally wasted my  money.</li>
            <li> It also dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I know that other reviews have recommended using this product for at least two months, but I couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other hair product in almost a year and within a month or two people around me noticed my hair looking healthier and fuller!!!</li>
            <li> I started using it because I noticed that my hair has been falling out for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> from Amazon, in the past, without any problems.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that does anything, but it makes you FEEL like it&#x27;s working.    </li>
            <li> so I am pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my hair loss worse!  </li>
            <li> Since the system is designed to work together, and I&#x27;m not really sure if all of the three steps are required for effectiveness, I have no idea</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s very few hair strands in my brush now.  </li>
            <li> Other people commented that they didn&#x27;t experience any hair growth or filling in of thin places</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m west indian and already had extrem fine hair now it is even worst now.</li>
            <li> hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> After negative blood tests and increasing my vitamin intake, nothing seemed to help.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin recharge complex for months and it worked on me.</li>
            <li> the Nioxin recharge complex stopped working on me since then too.</li>
            <li> the stars on for the late delivery, not the  product.</li>
            <li> recommend it, at least for a trial.</li>
            <li> Even worse , the scalp treatment bottle was missing from the package.</li>
            <li> My hair is now thick and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is a slow process.</li>
            <li> Actually broke my hair really bad and stop using it after a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> i am not balding, i just have thin hair and was hoping to see less hair on my brushes with this product, and i was WRONG.</li>
            <li> My first time using this Nioxin system was horrible as a nightmare.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t get worse using these products</li>
            <li> I have thin oily hair and when I wash my hair it feels and looks like I&#x27;m going to be bald.</li>
            <li> I was told by my hairdresser to use this product as a stress issue is causing my hair to fall out and therefore, thin.  </li>
            <li> ill never buy it again.</li>
            <li> However, it does make it difficult when you have thinning on your hairline on your forehead.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended nioxin products but they were so expensive at the salon</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to bite the bullet and get the expensive stuff from the salon.</li>
            <li> I just felt uncomfortable calling for tech support on shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of shampoos but this one beats all records of useless ingredients for hair growth.</li>

            <li> I love it my hair has always been very thin but after using this for a week i can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 4 days, my hair got very dry and brittle and broke off 1\\&quot; from the root.  However, I&#x27;m not sure this was solely due to the product or a possible thyroid problem.  No longer using this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 3-step (No 3) Nioxin product based on my hairdresser&#x27;s strong recommendation and previous use of Nioxin products. Recent, minor health issues had left my hair looking dry, thin and drab, even after a great cut. Amazon&#x27;s price was by far the best. I was amazed at how my fine, limp hair looked after using the Nioxin system only one time - clean, shiny and thick with lots of body. No other products needed for my straight, blonde cut. I&#x27;ve also noticed less breakage - only a few hairs on my brush. I am sometimes sensitive to cosmetic products - but not this one. Lastly, I get compliments on my hair from friends and even strangers almost every day with no time in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!!!!!!!! I started using it because I noticed that my hair has been falling out for the past couple of years. After negative blood tests and increasing my vitamin intake, nothing seemed to help. After some research, I figured that maybe my current shampoos were leaving too much scalp buildup that was causing my hair to fall out. Let me tell you that my hair no longer falls out at the rate it used to. I am sooo pleased with this product. My scalp feels so much more healthy. I no longer can feel the buildup that used to feel with other shampoos. I will be a Nioxin junky for life!!!! Thank you Nioxin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Well, much to my sorrow, this didn&#x27;t really help my hair grow in thicker nor do I feel like I grew in more. According to my hair care specialist, what Nioxin is supposed to do is stimulate the follicles so that the follicles not producing hair will begin to. That didn&#x27;t happen with me. A lot of people have had success using this with hair loss and they&#x27;ve said that it&#x27;s stopped their hair loss. I don&#x27;t really have hair loss so I can&#x27;t speak to that; I just have very very fine hair which barely covers my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, it&#x27;s a decent shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up on my hair and my hair feels clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering going with a mohawk. Maybe if I shave the sides of my head, what&#x27;s on top will look thicker and I&#x27;m really tired of the bald-ish patches on the sides.</li>
            <li> This shampoo kits is great, smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is the product that was recommended to me in the salon but it was cheaper to get online.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 months but my hair does seem stronger &amp; healthier.  I have fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin recharge complex for months and it worked on me. My hair wonderfully stopped falling out for months. Then I decided to try this Nioxin system (i got a perm so i chose this). I thought it would work great and I would have some hairs regrowing, but I was so disappointed. Firstly, I shampoo my hair by the cleanser and got bunch of my hair on my balm ( as I said my hair had stopped falling out since using the tablets, so I totally got shocked when seeing that much hair falling out again) then I applied Nioxin scalp therapy as they said, and my hair kept falling out like non stop. I was so afraid of touching my hair cuz it may make them fall out, so I just let it stay there for 3 mins and washed off. Final step, I applied scalp treatment, after spreading the liquid out the whole scalp, I combed my hair as direction, they were falling out one more time. There was hair here and there on my shoulders and the counters.     My first time using this Nioxin system was horrible as a nightmare. However, I thought it was because my hair was not familiar with those chemicals yet, so gave it another try. But the situation never improved :(    I has stopped using them now, after few weeks using ( about 3 times/ week) w/o any improvement but worse-ment.     And the bad thing is the Nioxin recharge complex stopped working on me since then too. And now I m so depressed again on stopping my hair falling out :(</li>
            <li> like the title says, I think it works..  hard to tell.  i&#x27;m going to go one higher and see how the #4 for color treated hair works better.  i&#x27;ll probably keep using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to determine if it will be helpful to my fine, thinning hair.  However, it certainly does a great cleaning job and makes your scalp tingle so I hope something is happening.  Great seller, product arrived very quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> This kit not only cleans and volumizes but also creates an opportunity for new hair growth!</li>
            <li> Worked great!!! Hair stopped shedding like crazy after using for about a week.  Fresh minty smell.  Would buy again if needed</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used before and cannot obtain through normal retail channels where I live. I was a little disapointed that the conditioner was in a smaller bottle than the shampoo : the picture is misleading.</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for almost 2 months. I really like the way it makes my scalp feel (and my cat loves the minty smell). I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation like some commenters have described and I have very sensitive skin. I rarely wear my hair down, so I haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in volume, but I am definitely losing much less hair. At one point, I was losing close to a handful every time I showered. Now, it&#x27;s maybe 10 hairs total.</li>
            <li> It worked for me. I had thinning hair on top and an itchy scalp. My hair came out by the handfuls when I combed it. SCARY! This stuff stops the itch and my hair does not come out like it did. My hair looks and feel thicker. Its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Nioxin provided me the opportunity to regrow my hair,provide nourishment after shampoo which made me look a whole lot better,and peace of mind in presenting myself to the public.I hope I never run out  of Nioxin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I like it so far. I have notice less hair falling out in shower and my hair feels thicker. I am going to continue using.</li>
            <li> ama zing product! Before I started using this product I could run my fingers through my hair and hAve 4 to 5 hairs in between my fingers at any point during the day. It has virtually stopped all of the hiar fall out. When I run my fingers through my hair now I get no hair or maybe one hair between my fingers. Also, it has stopped virtually all of breakage and my hair is fuller. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great kit if you want to try the product.</li>
            <li> the product smells like mint medicine, which isnt so bad, but not my favorite. I have very long hair, down til right about my butt lol. The conditioner is AWFUL. it did not make my hair soft or manageable, and i felt like i was losing more hair when i brushed it because it was so unmanagable. i used it til the bottle ran out, which was quickly lol. i am not balding, i just have thin hair and was hoping to see less hair on my brushes with this product, and i was WRONG. ill never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product having used Nioxin products before to help with some hair loss (I&#x27;m a compulsive hair-dyer and so at times  my scalp/hair really takes a beating) and in the past I&#x27;ve always been satified; but after a month of using this package, though I found considerably less hair falling out each time I washed my hair, I did experience unexpected dry-ness. My ends seem to be splitting more than before I started using this product, and my scalp was actually more dry/irritated! I know that other reviews have recommended using this product for at least two months, but I couldn&#x27;t handle it. I switched to Jon Frieda&#x27;s Root Awakening line, which is cheaper, more readily available and left my hair in a vastly better condition (soft, managable, and noticibly fuller within the first two weeks). I was also dissapointed in how long the standard shipping took. Overall, I&#x27;m not terribly unstatified, but I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is really terrific. I have very fine hair and this product gave me such great results. I noticed after the first day, but after a week, my hair is looking as good as it did in high school, and that was 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since I notice that my hair was thinning a little. I actually lost hair in front of my head while using this. I read other reviews and other people said the same thing but saw new growth. It&#x27;s been two months and I don&#x27;t see my hair growing back. This product actually made me lose more hair. I&#x27;m west indian and already had extrem fine hair now it is even worst now. Won&#x27;t recommand to anyone. Also it smelled like medicine.</li>
            <li> I ordered two Nioxin System 3 Starter Kits. Both of the Nioxin Cleanser bottles arrived only half full. I won&#x27;t be ordering any hair products from Amazon again.     I have ordered other items (CD&#x27;s, books, etc.) from Amazon, in the past, without any problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any dieefernce</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because its supposed to promote a healthy scalp, and reduce thinning hair. NIOXIN does just that! I don&#x27;t know if it will promote hair growth, but it helps to prevent fallout!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:40530c974a016b1291c9fed64365d9f0]] How can this horrible mix of chemistry be legal? Anybody know a good lawyer??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00139597G Nioxin Starter Kit, System 3 (Fine/Treated/Normal to Thin-Looking)]]</li>
            <li> Love this - works well!  It does seem to give it a bit more body than before.  Always loved Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month. I do notice hair seems thicker and I do notice some new growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Bzz Agent so I received this hair system for free to try it out.    It really reminds me of a Tea Tree treatment. The smell is very menthol-y, but also nice. It leaves a nice, cooling sensation on your scalp. Not sure if that does anything, but it makes you FEEL like it&#x27;s working.    Honestly, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I have no complaints. It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out any worse than a normal shampoo does, but I don&#x27;t see any remarkable difference in the thickness or quality of my hair. I think I need to give it some more uses first.     The only issue I think I have is with the leave in treatment. It feels almost too thin &amp; watery and I feel like I need to use a lot of the product to do any good.</li>
            <li> In the first 2 weeks of using I had less hair falling out that&#x27;s a great start. I recommend anyone try theses products&lt;br /&gt;mtprods.tv Mark</li>
            <li> this product saved my hair and kept me out of a depression--need to use all three to really get the benefits.  leval 4 is great as well but the third step leaves your hair sticky</li>
            <li> I have never been so impressed by any hair product!! I had fine hair and didn&#x27;t like the way it felt. I was told about this from my hair stylist. I have not used any other hair product in almost a year and within a month or two people around me noticed my hair looking healthier and fuller!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this system, along with the Nioxin Diamax treatment, for 5 days now. I can tell a huge difference not only in the health of my hair, but in the overall condition and texture of my hair. Last night at work, a friend said my hair looked thicker. She had no idea I have been using this...It is shiny, it is stronger, and it feels great. The shampoo and conditioner both smell fresh and minty, and I have noticed no dryness at all, as some other reviews reported. My hair is color-treated and fine, and has no volume usually, but this stuff makes it full and bouncy! Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Nioxin from Amazon earlier. When the package arrived, I was expecting a neat box with the 3 Nioxin bottles in it . Instead I found an old box that had been opened and not even closed back. Even worse , the scalp treatment bottle was missing from the package. The cleanser and conditioner also looked cheap and old. Definitely returning this product.</li>
            <li> The texture and smell is good.  The assumed benefit of reducing hair loss is to be seen...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> Just purchased Nioxin to help restore my hair which has been &#x27;out out control&#x27; since surgery.  progress is being noticed.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a great product ant this price was the best I&#x27;d seen anywhere&lt;br /&gt;Used it for a long time for alopecia;</li>
            <li> Thinning hair due to medication and menopause.  Felt thicker volume with the first use.  Definately would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Not totally convinced that it&#x27;s working, my hair is still falling out due to a temporary medical condition, but maybe it is falling out less.  Regardless, the product is easy to use and has had no bad effect on me.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price, fast delivery. It puts my hair in soft feelings and smells good. Thank you Nioxin. I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks and i&#x27;m loving it. I love the way it makes my hair feel and I can already notice a difference. It leaves a very refreshing minty scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Some how I didn&#x27;t receive this product when I was suppose to.  Guess it was the a postal problem.  I have used this same brand before and liked it.  this time I ordered the one for treated hair.  the stars on for the late delivery, not the  product.</li>
            <li> I bought these products at the advice of my hairdresser with high hopes. I used all three products according to instructions and had my daughters observe before, during and now when products are used up and there is no difference at all. It was quite a pinch on my social security budget to buy these items so I am pretty disappointed. The literature says money back guarantee but I have no idea who stands behind that guarantee.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and it is OK.  So far the only result I have been able to see is that I am loosing less hair than before using it, but I haven seen any new hair growing because of the use of the product.</li>
            <li> Love the nioxin kit. This was a good purchase and price. I was happy with this order and the results</li>
            <li> I love this product. It actually works really well with my thinning hair due to my thyroid issues and Lupus. My hair is now thick and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I consider Nioxin MY SHAMPOO. It is just right for me because it does the job I need it to do, it really takes care of my hair. It is a very good product for any hair but especially for chemically treated hair. It gives this good, healthy look and helps my hair to do well.</li>
            <li> Been using nioxin for years. Great product.  It does tend to dry out my hair so I use a leave in conditioner after I shower.</li>
            <li> This product has actually worked for me. I&#x27;m 24 and I have PCOS. One of the symptoms is having thinning hair (mine is mild to moderate). I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and have noticed that my thinning areas are actually filling in! I check my hair by parting it down the middle (where female pattern baldness occurs) and check for any fading. I&#x27;ve noticed that the line of my part is not as faded, which is a good sign. Keep in mind that this is a slow process. I am at the stage where I can feel the stubble of hair growing in where it once fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only critique I have about the product is the scalp treatment. The bottle is designed to spray the liquid at one concentrated point. In other words, it hits one spot on your scalp and then runs down, usually towards your face. The simple solution is to just tilt your head back when you do this. However, it does make it difficult when you have thinning on your hairline on your forehead. I think they should modify the nozzle so that it sprays a little more like a mist than a squirt gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is small, which wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me because this was just to try it out. If you have issues with thinning hair (especially with PCOS), it is at least worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have really liked this shampoo and conditioner.  This is a great product and seems to make my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF !! REALLY WORKS !! NIOXIN STANDS TO ITS NAME, PLAN TO ORDER MORE AS NEEDED ONLY THING I WOULD LIKE BIGGER BOTTLES</li>
            <li> Good product if you need to give your hair a boost of confidence. It doesn&#x27;t cover a bald head with hair, but it re-energizes what you have left of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have scalp issues and based on the reviews, thought I would give this a try.  I didn&#x27;t get worse using these products and I did not get better.  Please know, when you use the scalp spray - it will leave you skin bright RED - where in runs down your neck or ears - BRIGHT Red.  No pain, just looks awful.</li>
            <li> Like the way that it makes my hair and scalp feel.  Good.</li>
            <li> Product worked as advertised</li>
            <li> N oozing is great shampoo for repair and growth</li>
            <li> This product actually made my hair loss worse!  I used this religiously for a month before realizing that it really wasn&#x27;t just in my head and that I was losing more hair than before I used it.  As soon as I stopped, my hair loss started to lessen as well.  Horrible product!</li>
            <li> Actually broke my hair really bad and stop using it after a couple of times.  Totally wasted my  money.</li>
            <li> My hair strands were filling my hair brush every week and was becoming quiet thin, since I started using this product on my hair has almost quit thining out and there&#x27;s very few hair strands in my brush now.  This product has a wonderful mint smell and has been very gentle on my hair as well, would recommend it to others to try who have thin hair problems.</li>
            <li> All three products were brand new, in their box and I use them as directed. They smell good. After shampooing, you might want to rub in a litle leave in conditioner (not a heavy on) because theirs is vey light. I don&#x27;t know about a difference yet, but my hair feels soft and not brittle. We&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> I have had thinning hair.  My hairdresser suggested this product.  I have used it for a month and can see hair growing.  I will keep this up for sure.  The spray runs out in about a month, but the shampoo and conditioner will probably last about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have thin oily hair and when I wash my hair it feels and looks like I&#x27;m going to be bald. You cannot imagine how much hair falls out in the shower and again when I&#x27;m brushing. I bought this product after reading all the reviews and wow I am amazed and so happy. I been using for this for 2 months now and very pleased with the results. I noticed a difference the second time I used the system. I literally counted how many hairs I lost 15 in total. After a few weeks its been less loss. I will continue using happily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. I like it but haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth yet. However, I see my beautican later this week so will see what her opinion is. The scent is quite nice and the products leave your hair soft and manaegable, but maybe too much so if you have fine, color treated hair like mine.I can use all the body I can get. Will continue to use it and see what happens. Other people commented that they didn&#x27;t experience any hair growth or filling in of thin places so maybe we&#x27;re all hoping for a miracle that just doesn&#x27;t exist yet. If anybody has had actual hair re-growth with other products, Please let me know before I&#x27;m having to shop the Dolly Partin wig shop!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but it really does change the texture of your hair, making it feel thicker.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money, could not tell any difference and the product looked and smelled extremely old!!  It also dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I just began using this product but I hope to see results soon!</li>
            <li> Was looking online for products to help thinning hair look thicker. Still using it and find the product to be just fair.</li>
            <li> Will worth the money.  My hair looks better now than it has in a few years.</li>
            <li> It helps but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  Smells great though, like mints...just not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It really works for hair starting to thin. A little pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since it was recommended by a stylist.  My hair has always been thin/fine but I had a ton of it...and then after having my son, it just got thinner and thinner.  Although I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;patches\\&quot; of missing hair, I can definitely see my scalp on top a lot more than I did before, and I would find strands of hair throughout the house.  I&#x27;ve even had to check over my husband before he leaves for work to make sure there are no strands stuck to him or his clothes (gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seemed to work almost instantly, leaving my scalp feeling refreshed, hair thicker, cleaner and softer. I haven&#x27;t seen as much hair coming off in the comb, or in the shower. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any hair regrowth yet but it has only been a week.  My husband looked at me last night and says \\&quot;your hair looks good, looks thicker like a lion!\\&quot; :) For the leave-in treatment, there is a video on the Nioxin website that shows you how to apply it.  It should be applied to the scalp in towel dried hair (not completely dry), if doing this and not applying a lot of it, it should not leave your hair sticky feeling afterwards as some have mentioned.  Also, the scalp treatment is NOT a leave-in conditioner, so my stylist recommended using a leave-in conditioner after the scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my skimpy, baby fine hair is feeling much thicker and looks very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I started this 2 days after getting color which was about 2 weeks ago and the color has remained the&lt;br /&gt;same.  This is great considering the extremely hard water in our area.</li>
            <li> Did not have good results.</li>
            <li> theres no difference between this kit and when i use other products. it supposed to be more volume but i did not notice it at all.</li>
            <li> 5 stars exceeded my expectation. significant improvement within 2 to 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I love this starter kit</li>
            <li> Really gets you scalp clean.  I don&#x27;t know how much it helps prevent hair loss,but it&#x27;s not to pricey to not try it.  Also gets your hair really clean, as well as most higher end shampoos</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it says it will do. I have less breakage and my hair is full.  My curly and wave stay longer and stronger.  I strongly recommend it for anyone with thinning hair as well as for breakage.</li>
            <li> This works well for me. It shows immediate results for my hair type. I will recommend and purchase again. Good product.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nourished and renewed after using all 3 of these products.  With the additional support of vitamin D, my hair is getting thicker.</li>
            <li> I am female, 48 years old, and have noticed my color-treated hair thinning in the past couple of years. Because wrinkles, hot flashes, night sweats, and stubborn weight gain aren&#x27;t enough, now I&#x27;m seeing an alarming amount of hair in the drain every time I shampoo. My stylist recommended nioxin products but they were so expensive at the salon, I thought I&#x27;d try Amazon for better prices. I wish I could have used these products long enough to review their effectiveness at thickening my hair, but I had to stop using them after three tries. I don&#x27;t know whether I used too much or not enough or what (I used the same amount of shampoo/conditioner I would normally use), but these products made my hair so unmanageable I felt I was pulling out even more hair trying to comb through the snarls and tangles. After drying my hair naturally, it was a frizzy puffball and felt dry and brittle. I get that this system focuses on your scalp not your hair, but I need the thin hair I have left to look its best. Since the system is designed to work together, and I&#x27;m not really sure if all of the three steps are required for effectiveness, I have no idea if I could substitute or add my own conditioner. I guess I&#x27;ll have to bite the bullet and get the expensive stuff from the salon. For people who do want to try this, note that there is a telephone number on the bottles you can call with questions. I just felt uncomfortable calling for tech support on shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was told by my hairdresser to use this product as a stress issue is causing my hair to fall out and therefore, thin.  I am giving this a try and only hope it makes a difference</li>
            <li> I used it for a week and got a horrible break out all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;It took me more than few months to get clear skin with oral acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are prone to acne then stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> I saw so much improvement in reducing my hair loss.  I am so thankful for products like this. I will recommend this product to anyone who needs help in reducing hairloss and growing new hair.</li>
            <li> Nioxin System 3 really does work, I love this product. I have 2 inches of new hair growth in the front at part. My hairdresser is very pleased as am I.</li>
            <li> Well several of my friends have used this product and swear by it.  So, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yes, I loved the smell and the tingling sensation it gives to my scalp.  But it doesn&#x27;t work on me at all.  In fact, I noticed more and more hair in the sink, on the floor and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for close to 3 weeks, I didn&#x27;t want to chance of getting less hair than I started with.  I then went back to the product I was using before and am much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because I liked the scent and tingling sensation.  Otherwise, I would probably have given it 1 star.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser and works well. I do recommend adding a leave in conditioner on the ends of your hair if it is prone to breaking or is dry.</li>
            <li> I see results, my hair feels thicker or with more volume. I love the shampoo. I would not say that I have more hair, but it def makes changes to my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, at least for a trial.</li>
            <li> Ok.I used a lot of shampoos but this one beats all records of useless ingredients for hair growth. Besides it makes everything that comes into contact with it super red. The skin becomes very irritated and you need to wash it off and wait half an hour until it calms down. So it is very clear the way it works. Menthol irritates the surface of your skin that makes the blood flow into you hair follicles and that stimulates the hair growth. That is as for the spray. As for the shampoo and conditioner. Mehhhh. Same story. Nothing special. I have no idea how this product got so many good reviews. Shampoo makes hair puffy and frizzy and spray irritates the skin. It goes into a trash bin. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this system a short time, but I already see a difference in how my hair looks and feels. I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> Initially I saw that I had a bald spot, you keep using this stuff and it will definately show a difference...takes time</li>
            <li> I just got this, used it once and it changed my hair for the better.  My hair wasn&#x27;t really \\&quot;thinning,\\&quot; it was always thin and baby fine.  Now it is fuller but without the dryness and stiffness that other \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; products can cause.  So glad I found this!</li>
            <li> The #3 bottle seems to give my hair more body.  I don&#x27;t feel the shampoo makes much difference and the conditioner seems to make my hair softer, which I don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> Amazing products. I love it. I lose less hair and it got thicker. Recommended. Save money and buy online. Yay!!</li>
            <li> I love Nioxin products, wish I had purchased much larger bottles.  I believe anyone with thining hair or even regualr hair should use Nioxon..and I love to use the minty shampoo as body soap. It wakes me up and feels so clean, you know lkie flossing with mint floss!</li>
            <li> I like product, is a good product.  Have notice a difference in my hair.  Would prefer the follicle booster in a grease type formula.</li>
            <li> Started the use of Nioxin a few weeks ago and so far so good. I almost instantly felt the thickness especially shampooing my hair. Love the tingling cool feeling on the scalp. The only issue I have is when trying to comb through my hair, it&#x27;s knotted up and takes me a while to comb it but I can get use to that because I feel my hair getting thicker or fuller with every wash. I have recommended the Nioxin to my mother who is going thin on her head and we will see if she is as happy as me with the results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month now and I see alittle difference in my hair.  It also could be wishful thinking.  But I do notice that my hair is very clean and fluffy after using it.  I will continue to use this product for three months. By the end of that time I should  see a difference.  If not I think I might continue to use this product once in awhile because it does work as a good shampoo and conditioner.  Right now I think it is two early to tell.</li>
            <li> I only wish they would supply more of the Therapy bottle.  The shampoo goes a long way.  Feels great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This product was everything that I had anticipated. It has been great for my hair! Hair continues to look healthier with time.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my kidneys that required me to be on dialysis for a short time. Dialysis depletes any nutrient or vitamins in your blood and a month after finishing dialysis my hair began falling out like crazy. Not clumps but the sheer amount of hair shed really scared me.  I went to my hair dresser for a trim and she recommended Nioxxin to me.  She even picked up my first kit from beauty supply for me. This product works. I have been using every other day for about 6 weeks and I see new hair growth!!! I am impressed with this product.  Definitely worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel dry like it it had a film on it. Will not repurchase</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and delivery of product.</li>
