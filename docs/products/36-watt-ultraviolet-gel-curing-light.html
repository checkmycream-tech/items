            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>My product arrived promptly and perfectly packaged.  </li>
            <li>It is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent lamp</li>
            <li>I bought this lamp to use with the OPI Axxium Gels and have had wonderful results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my nails twice now, both times with perfect results.  </li>
            <li>I leave mine on 3 minutes and cure each coat using that setting and it cures perfectly!</li>
            <li>It cures my nails perfectly and the timers work like a dream.  </li>
            <li>The two minute timer is perfect, as gel cures at 1-2 minutes (2 minutes for darker colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I told them it was OPI (which inded is a very good   company).</li>
            <li>I purchased this 36-watt UV nail lamp and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>even though it was a used item it works great.</li>
            <li>it works great.</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great as advertised and is very easy to assemble the bulbs.</li>
            <li>Also great for the price :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that this is a great uv light!</li>
            <li>Its great to be able to do my own nails at home.  </li>
            <li>This uv light works great on the opi axxium gel polish.</li>
            <li>I am so insanely happy with this UV Gel Curing Light</li>
            <li>I bought this to do my own shellac/gellish manicures.</li>
            <li>This is just what I needed for doing my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, quick shipment</li>
            <li>That was an awesome surprise for me because when I was deciding what I absolutely wanted in a lamp, buttons on top was one feature I was sacrificing for this unit.  </li>
            <li>I saw much better product</li>
            <li>and I would prefer to have all the controls on the top.</li>
            <li>There was a switch on the top where I could choose between on and timer, and also a 2 minute timer button on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this light atleast 3 years ago and its still going strong!</li>
            <li>Amazon is a great place to shop and very user friendly.</li>
            <li>and it works perfectly and at half</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I received this lamp because it has a totally new look that how it is pictured (that&#x27;s a good thing).</li>
            <li>I recommend this rather than spending the money on the \\&quot;offical\\&quot; UV light for Shellac.</li>
            <li>UV gel light dryer from Nail Beauty 4u.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, it did not make me happy.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also done the shellac on my toes and my feet fit in the unit without any issues.</li>
            <li>and i can fit both hands in at once.</li>
            <li>The directions for the light are virtually non-existent.</li>
            <li>After using the light once it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Use this light to cure my Harmony Gelish polish.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this lamb and it is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>and this lamp is fabulous.</li>
            <li>and it worked fabulously.  </li>
            <li>I can fit my foot in it as well</li>
            <li>I paid more replacing the things that were damaged than the light was worth.</li>
            <li>I would highly, HIGHLY recommend this lamp to anyone looking to buy their own.  </li>
            <li>It is still in the original box.  </li>
            <li>Overall is a really good product I recommend buying this.</li>
            <li>cures quickly</li>
            <li>I GAVE MYSELF A QUICK MANI, PEDI.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this light!</li>
            <li>The light is a bit large but does the job.</li>
            <li>UV Gel Polishes only require 36W of UV light, which is what this, and most lamps provide.</li>
            <li>RIGHT AWAY.</li>
            <li>my own nails\\&quot; business again for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I bought the light for the CND Shellac nails and they set up perfectly per the directions on each of the polish bottles (base coat, color &amp; top coat).</li>
            <li>For the price this little unit is the perfect choice for either home use or low salon use.</li>
            <li>But it works very well!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve learned how to apply the gels, I will invest in a better lamp when this one stops working because the timing swithes are on the back</li>
            <li>FIRST</li>
            <li>It is a much more streamlined model and the buttons are on the top (back, left) of the unit.</li>
            <li>it is a few secounds off which is good to know when doing gel nails.</li>
            <li>(I would suggest that you all pass up the high priced &amp; hard to find CND Shellacs as the Harmony Gelish is just as good and about 1/3 the price!)    </li>
            <li>The price was amazing and the unit arrived in 2 days very carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li>I use the CND base and top coat and have used CND and gellish colors, both manicures turned out perfect!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many other more expensive light out there, but I tried this one because it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>There is also the easy push button control on the back, (which is where I prefer it, since I&#x27;m using it for clients and don&#x27;t have to reach around).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wanted a model with a large openning as shown here</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s huge size,absolutely bulky lamp,not for personal use.</li>
            <li>The alcohol wipe needs to be used after curing the second coat of gel color, before the final uv top coat, and again after curing the final uv top coat.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>When I initially installed the light bulbs, one did not work.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the Nail Beauty 4U, in response they asked me what company   nail gel I was using, and that the machine I was using was very powerfull.   </li>
            <li>SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>Not that it&#x27;s a complicated machine, but don&#x27;t forget to take the protective covering off the mirrors and the light tubes! :)</li>
            <li>My friend used it for the Tammy Taylor Gel Nails and the high priced CND Nail Shellacs &amp; she loves the lamp.    </li>
            <li>I paid for a new lamp.</li>
            <li>I used it with my new Gel Polish from OPI</li>
            <li>This is your average ultraviolet light that you would normally use at a salon.  </li>
            <li>With all of the supplies you need to do gel, the light is the most expensive item on the list.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The only reason I can&#x27;t rate this higher is because I never used it.  </li>
            <li>The only reason certain gel systems tell you to use their brand of lamp is because they want to keep your spending in their company.</li>
            <li>So far that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>As I could understand you cannot   expect any responsibility or professional customer service from this company.  </li>
            <li>Professional One Hand Nail Gel Curing UV Lamp 36W (EN2016)]]</li>
            <li>By that time I&#x27;m hoping the LED UV Lamps will be more affordable as they take only a few seconds to cure the gels.</li>
            <li>When I used it first time, I realized that it takes me 5-6 times  longer to dry the UV gel than recommended by OPI nail gel instruction.  </li>
            <li>I take it to jobs with me, and it has been fine for all the small jostling it takes on a weekly basis.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my impatience I actually completed my first manicure with only three lights and still, everything cured as it should, held up well, and stayed just as shiny as if it had all four.  </li>
            <li>That was comforting because I don&#x27;t know how long these bulbs will last or how much they&#x27;ll cost to replace, but I have a feeling</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve left the timer on 120 and always with completely cured results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since purchasing this lamp a few weeks ago i  Have already used it a bunch of times and definitely got my monies worth.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty reliable, sturdy little lamp.</li>
            <li>Any imperfection in my nails was due to my own difficulties in applying only a *thin* layer of polish.     </li>
            <li>I was looking at much more expensive lights, but ended up getting this one and really cut down the cost of my gel set.</li>

            <li> I actually made a mistake in buying this lamp due to the fact that I was wanting a LED lamp instead of UV.</li>
            <li> I use it to dry my nails with schlack</li>

            <li> The one I received looked a little bit different from the one in the picture.  </li>
            <li> setting is about 15 sec.</li>
            <li> but I had absolutely no problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the Harmony Gelish Shellac Red Roses,  Base &amp; Top Coats</li>

            <li> and I could not have done it without the other reviews and my trust in Amazon and their Amazon Prime vendors.  </li>
            <li> To all the naysayers who leave comments on this, or any other lamp, saying that it doesn&#x27;t cure their nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;Typically I use IBD gels, but also intermix those with any other gel brands I happen to pick up, and have not had any curing problems.</li>
            <li> I took a risk in buying as I felt due to the fact that a previous reviewer said that they had received a used lamp.  </li>
            <li> I can only assume that there was a bit of operator error involved in the beginning as perhaps I was being too timid with the delicate bulbs.  </li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE DEVICE HELPED ME</li>
            <li> Dries my gel polish in 90 seconds with a little timer that turns it off when done.</li>
            <li> I had a previous experience with MelodySusie Lamp which was worthless but this lamp is a real gem.  </li>
            <li> I say this: The people who are getting bad curing results are simply not doing their gel system correctly.</li>
            <li> The lamp that came to me, was used, has smudges on it, no protective film over the mirrors, and 3 broken lights.</li>
            <li> they ship wrong one when i buy then</li>
            <li> Now I am stuck to this useless device.</li>
            <li> After using the acetone liquid to remove the nails I had on and having it melt the plastic container I put it in, I was afraid to do any of this myself.  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you buy this lamp!</li>

            <li> Not the same as shown here on the web, received a different model.  Wanted a model with a large openning as shown here</li>
            <li> they ship wrong one when i buy then i have to return then pay again ship return ( 2 way cost ship ) it is not guar from A-Z like amazon.com say</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my own shellac/gellish manicures. Works great! I have even used the lamp for my feet. The lamp has a 2 and 3 minute timer setting.  Since purchasing this lamp a few weeks ago i  Have already used it a bunch of times and definitely got my monies worth.</li>
            <li> When I received this lamp I was shocked by it&#x27;s huge size,absolutely bulky lamp,not for personal use. I saw much better product</li>
            <li> I though that it was going to be as white as the photo showed. But it is a tan color almost with a tinge of yellow. But it works very well! SO i guess the appearance doesnt matter!! Thank YOU!!</li>
            <li> This uv light works great on the opi axxium gel polish. I would give it 5 stars but the only flaw is that the  3 minute timer does not work it simply just stays on. when Applying gel polish it should be timed acuratly so I use the 2 minute timer and it works on time. Overall is a really good product I recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> This is your average ultraviolet light that you would normally use at a salon.  You can do both hands at the same time if you \\&quot;stack\\&quot; them on one another. So far that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.  I recommend this rather than spending the money on the \\&quot;offical\\&quot; UV light for Shellac.</li>
            <li> My product arrived promptly and perfectly packaged.  It is a delight to use and I would recommend the product for gel nails do-it-your selfers.  Amazon is a great place to shop and very user friendly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 36-watt UV nail lamp and it works great. To \\&quot;Disappointed,\\&quot; (and others who have difficulty with the curing of gel products) the problem isn&#x27;t the lamp, it&#x27;s the product application process. I found that if you don&#x27;t use an \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; wipe application recommended by some gel product lines, the gel will not cure. The alcohol wipe needs to be used after curing the second coat of gel color, before the final uv top coat, and again after curing the final uv top coat. The alcohol wipe removes any residual tackiness of the gel. Try this and you won&#x27;t have any problems. I use the IBD and CND (instructions for CND did not indicate using the alcohol wipe step) products with this lamp with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed for doing my own gel nails at home. It is great! Cures them properly. I definitely wear sunscreen before putting my hands in though. The light is a bit large but does the job. Thanks. Also great for the price :)</li>
            <li> This lamp works like a charm.  Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not strong enough and start curing your gel longer.  The two minute timer works for each step of OPI for 1 fourth the price.  I can get both hands done in 45 minutes.  It&#x27;s an excellent lamp and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am so insanely happy with this UV Gel Curing Light and I could not have done it without the other reviews and my trust in Amazon and their Amazon Prime vendors.  The price was amazing and the unit arrived in 2 days very carefully packaged.  When I initially installed the light bulbs, one did not work.  However after swapping their positions they all functioned properly.  I can only assume that there was a bit of operator error involved in the beginning as perhaps I was being too timid with the delicate bulbs.  In my impatience I actually completed my first manicure with only three lights and still, everything cured as it should, held up well, and stayed just as shiny as if it had all four.  That was comforting because I don&#x27;t know how long these bulbs will last or how much they&#x27;ll cost to replace, but I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to the be in the \\&quot;doing my own nails\\&quot; business again for a long time.  Even longer since this type of manicure lasts literally 2 weeks without even the slightest chip.  Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.  I use it to dry my nails with schlack and it works perfectly and at half the price I had found it anywhere else!</li>
            <li> I purchased this 36watt UV gel light dryer from Nail Beauty 4u.  When I used it first time, I realized that it takes me 5-6 times  longer to dry the UV gel than recommended by OPI nail gel instruction.  Obviously, it did not make me happy.   I contacted the Nail Beauty 4U, in response they asked me what company   nail gel I was using, and that the machine I was using was very powerfull.   I told them it was OPI (which inded is a very good   company). Since than, I received no answer. As I could understand you cannot   expect any responsibility or professional customer service from this company.  Now I am stuck to this useless device.

            <li> I bought this lamp to use with the OPI Axxium Gels and have had wonderful results. I cure for the 15 seconds to set the nails, while applying the gels, and the final 2-3 minute gel cure and haven&#x27;t had a problem. I&#x27;ve also used the Harmony Gelish Shellac Red Roses,  Base &amp; Top Coats and it&#x27;s been great. (I would suggest that you all pass up the high priced &amp; hard to find CND Shellacs as the Harmony Gelish is just as good and about 1/3 the price!)    My friend used it for the Tammy Taylor Gel Nails and the high priced CND Nail Shellacs &amp; she loves the lamp.    Since I&#x27;ve learned how to apply the gels, I will invest in a better lamp when this one stops working because the timing swithes are on the back and I would prefer to have all the controls on the top. By that time I&#x27;m hoping the LED UV Lamps will be more affordable as they take only a few seconds to cure the gels.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend at her request and she loves it. Works great as advertised and is very easy to assemble the bulbs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my nails twice now, both times with perfect results.  I use the CND base and top coat and have used CND and gellish colors, both manicures turned out perfect!  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the timers - you can set it to stay on or time 120 or 180 seconds.   I&#x27;ve also done the shellac on my toes and my feet fit in the unit without any issues.</li>
            <li> even though it was a used item it works great. cures quickly and i can fit both hands in at once.</li>
            <li> I purchased this light atleast 3 years ago and its still going strong! I use it every 2.5 weeks. I leave mine on 3 minutes and cure each coat using that setting and it cures perfectly! Highly recommend this light!</li>
            <li> If Time is a factor in what you are useing this for.  NOTE it is a few secounds off which is good to know when doing gel nails. I use it in the on position when doing gel nails. On mine the 2 min. setting is about 15 sec. off which does make a difference in how they set up.</li>
            <li> I WOULD ALWAYS WOULD GO GET MY NAILS DONE. MY HANDS AND FEET WOULS ALWAYS COME OUT TO BE $50, EVERY 2 WEEKS. SO I DECIDED TO BUY THIS SO I CAN DO THEM AT HOME. I HAVE KIDS SO I NEED MY POLISH TO HURRY UP AND DRY. I GAVE MYSELF A QUICK MANI, PEDI. THIS LITTLE DEVICE HELPED ME SO MUCH. I DID MY TOES FIRST SO IT TOOK ME ME 12 MINUTES TOTAL TIME FOR MY TOES, AND 12 MIN FOR HANDS. THIS DEVICE IS ONLY BIG ENOUGH FOR ONE HAND AT A TIME, AND OF COURSE ONE FOOT AT A TIME. STILL THIS HELPS ALOT, IT BEATS SITTING AROUND WAITING FOR MY NAILS TO DRY, THEN TRYING TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO SMUDGE. MY TOES WERE DONE, PUT LOTION ON AND PUT SOCKS ON RIGHT AWAY. I AM SO GETTING ONE FOR MY SISTER. WOULD RECOMMENT TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> The only reason I can&#x27;t rate this higher is because I never used it.  After using the acetone liquid to remove the nails I had on and having it melt the plastic container I put it in, I was afraid to do any of this myself.  So this has never been used.  It is still in the original box.  Anyone want to buy it?</li>
            <li> got this lamp to use with the gelish nail polish system. it works great. big enough to use for feet as well.</li>
            <li> I bought the light for the CND Shellac nails and they set up perfectly per the directions on each of the polish bottles (base coat, color &amp; top coat). Any imperfection in my nails was due to my own difficulties in applying only a *thin* layer of polish.     The directions for the light are virtually non-existent. Not that it&#x27;s a complicated machine, but don&#x27;t forget to take the protective covering off the mirrors and the light tubes! :)</li>
            <li> After using the light once it stopped working.  There appeared to be a short between the bulbs and plugin area.....</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I received this lamp because it has a totally new look that how it is pictured (that&#x27;s a good thing). It is a much more streamlined model and the buttons are on the top (back, left) of the unit. That was an awesome surprise for me because when I was deciding what I absolutely wanted in a lamp, buttons on top was one feature I was sacrificing for this unit.  It cures my nails perfectly and the timers work like a dream.  I would highly, HIGHLY recommend this lamp to anyone looking to buy their own.  To all the naysayers who leave comments on this, or any other lamp, saying that it doesn&#x27;t cure their nails I say this: The people who are getting bad curing results are simply not doing their gel system correctly. UV Gel Polishes only require 36W of UV light, which is what this, and most lamps provide. The only reason certain gel systems tell you to use their brand of lamp is because they want to keep your spending in their company. Think of it this way... Go look at your body wash and I would bet you it says you should follow your shower with their brand of lotion. It is the same concept!  You will not be sorry if you buy this lamp!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, quick shipment</li>
            <li> The one I received looked a little bit different from the one in the picture.  There was a switch on the top where I could choose between on and timer, and also a 2 minute timer button on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many other more expensive light out there, but I tried this one because it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets.  It works great.  Use this light to cure my Harmony Gelish polish.  The two minute timer is perfect, as gel cures at 1-2 minutes (2 minutes for darker colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says it does, and is inexpensive.  Its great to be able to do my own nails at home.  With all of the supplies you need to do gel, the light is the most expensive item on the list.  I was looking at much more expensive lights, but ended up getting this one and really cut down the cost of my gel set.</li>
            <li> For the price this little unit is the perfect choice for either home use or low salon use. It has two timing options, 120 seconds or 180 seconds along with the option to have the lights stay on. There is also the easy push button control on the back, (which is where I prefer it, since I&#x27;m using it for clients and don&#x27;t have to reach around).&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems and it&#x27;s proven to be both reliable and sturdy. I take it to jobs with me, and it has been fine for all the small jostling it takes on a weekly basis.&lt;br /&gt;Typically I use IBD gels, but also intermix those with any other gel brands I happen to pick up, and have not had any curing problems. In fact, I&#x27;ve left the timer on 120 and always with completely cured results.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that this is a great uv light!</li>
            <li> I paid for a new lamp. The lamp that came to me, was used, has smudges on it, no protective film over the mirrors, and 3 broken lights. I paid more replacing the things that were damaged than the light was worth. DO NO BUY FROM THESE SELLERS. I have pictures that i will post of the damaged items if they do not contact me within a week.</li>
            <li> I just bought this lamb and it is FABULOUS.  I took a risk in buying as I felt due to the fact that a previous reviewer said that they had received a used lamp.  Well I did not and this lamp is fabulous. I used it with my new Gel Polish from OPI and it worked fabulously.  I would recommend this lamp to everyone.  I had a previous experience with MelodySusie Lamp which was worthless but this lamp is a real gem.  I actually made a mistake in buying this lamp due to the fact that I was wanting a LED lamp instead of UV. I was worried that my OPI Gel polish would not work with the UV lamp but I had absolutely no problem.  If you are considering this lamp, BUY IT.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty reliable, sturdy little lamp. Dries my gel polish in 90 seconds with a little timer that turns it off when done. I can fit my foot in it as well so I&#x27;m gelled from hands to feet!</li>
