            <li>I had been using a hand held mirror,but with my wall mount mirror both my hands are free.  </li>
            <li>Mounted it at a height my wife was comfortable with, and it still works for me to shave with.</li>
            <li>you can use hands free, that can be brought out at varying distances from the wall, and that swivels.</li>
            <li>This is a great mirror and now I can see the back of my head when styling my hair.</li>
            <li>EZ installation and the mirror is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I experienced using a similar mirror while on vacation.</li>
            <li>I like the mirror size of this one and since the bathroom is well lighted, I did not need a make up mirror with a light.  </li>
            <li>Mirror enhances the light in bathroom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  </li>
            <li>I have had this for a few months now and it is great!</li>
            <li>great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The wall mount is ok, but the part that attaches the entire thing to the wall mount is off a good 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>However,  if you position it the way you like to use it, then just swing the whole arm back (instead of folding it up) then it works great!!  </li>
            <li>Mounts easily and has a nice, contemporary look.</li>
            <li>Classy look and good build quality.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is FAR SUPERIOR to the Modona.  </li>
            <li>My husband said this was easy to install, and I love it for putting on my eyeliner and plucking my eyebrows, makes everything so much easier to see with the magnified side!</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised!!</li>
            <li>It was a gift and was exactly what she was looking for!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the one we had and a very useful item for any bathroom or makeup area.</li>
            <li>A well made product, large mirror, VERY strong</li>
            <li>Super easy to install...depending on your surface.</li>
            <li>Super Easy installation.</li>
            <li>It makes putting on make up super easy.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it makes it quick and easy to use because when I pull it out, the mirror is all set for me.  </li>
            <li>Installation was easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Overall I am super happy.</li>
            <li>Nice and clear and easy to mount.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks and it makes it so much easier to see when I&#x27;m grooming or putting on makeup!</li>
            <li>This is so useful!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it, buy it!</li>
            <li>Note that the 7X magnification is a higher magnification than most magnifying mirrors.</li>
            <li>It folds up neatly against the wall, and when I need it, it comes right out smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install (less than 10 minutes) and beautiful design.</li>
            <li>Nicely made and the mirror is a good size, I wish the magnafide side was a little stronger.</li>
            <li>Clean design and mirror images are not distorted.</li>
            <li>Have mounted on the wall next to vanity in master bath, and so far am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Pleasant surprise to find such quality these days.</li>
            <li>Great product can not live without it.</li>
            <li>I had a mirror like this before (in my old house) but THIS one is much better quality, sturdy!  </li>
            <li>Swings out easily, and the magnification is just right for applying eye makeup and tweezing the brows.</li>
            <li>The other is 7x for when you need to get a look real close-up for those perfectly placed eye liners or lip liners, etc.</li>
            <li>You can certainly pay much more ($$$) for a wall-mounted mirror -</li>
            <li>Priced right!  </li>
            <li>Arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>Good quality, right finish for brushed nickel and easy to in stall.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased at this little handy addition to grooming.  </li>
            <li>Great mirror as expected in description.</li>
            <li>As advertised, easy to install (I was lucky and found a wall stud), quick delivery, and certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li>(what bathroom isn&#x27;t?), it seems that the brushed nickel quality is good and that it will hold up well for years.</li>
            <li>and I would get the mirror all full of finger prints and makeup.</li>
            <li>Make sure you drill it onto the wall very well.</li>
            <li>Solid, sturdy mirror of good quality.</li>
            <li>Love the mirror, arrived on time and packaging was very well done..</li>

            <li>Stylish and very durable.</li>
            <li>The mirror surfaces are good optically, and 7x is plenty to see facial imperfections!</li>
            <li>full length and cabinet are others ).&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it.</li>
            <li>It looks good, and was about 35% cheaper than similar mirrors.</li>

            <li>Quick delivery, no issues.</li>
            <li>Seven times magnification seem adequate, shows you everything you don&#x27;t want to see, hairs, pores etc.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I kinda wish I had gotten a 10x magnification instead of 7x, but its certainly adequate.</li>

            <li>It is very easy to mount on the wall, I purchased this mirror because I use glasses and wanted to see clearly what I am doing when applying makeup to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t rust in a high moisture environment</li>
            <li>highly recomend.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>

            <li>Came with all necessary hardware (screws and anchors) and very easy to securely mount to the wall.  </li>
            <li>Folds right up against the wall so perfect for our very small bathroom.</li>
            <li>Looks great on my wall and definitely feels like high quality.</li>

            <li>Easy to install and very good-looking.</li>
            <li>mirror is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Just as the picture shows, it is even bigger than I imagined which I am glad about!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>This mirror is really great and tight.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is very sturdy, clear, and looks great in my new bathroom.</li>
            <li>FAST delivery, product is all I expected it to be - good quality, easy to mount and does the job</li>
            <li>Have had it up for a couple weeks now in a very humid (at times) bathroom and it is holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>seems great, well made, heavy duty</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I got this mirror so i can see the back of my head to do my own hair color.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have enough light in the room.</li>
            <li>Nice having the 7x magnification on the back side.</li>
            <li>Magnification is so much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, and swivels easily enough, but has some tension in it, so doesn&#x27;t swing away from you if you bump it...</li>
            <li>and now we have this handy mirror for close work or seeing the back and sides when trimming hair or haircoloring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase this one, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Nice, basic wall mount mirror.</li>
            <li>One star taken off for stiffness of moving parts (doesn&#x27;t work itself any looser) and for the tiny flaws my good eyes can see at the very edge of the mirror (almost under the nickel colored surround).</li>
            <li>All good, what I expected.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was simple to install and adjusts nicely.</li>
            <li>the metal is pretty true to color to the picture.</li>
            <li>The magnification is seriously powerful.  </li>
            <li>I laugh while she plucks.</li>
            <li>The magnification was a more than I expected, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll appreciate that</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised might be a better choice of words.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is what I was looking at, but I was seeing far more than I wanted.</li>
            <li>High quality, easy install.</li>
            <li>Item is as described, looks high quality and is easy to install.</li>
            <li>High quality product, well designed, easy to install.</li>
            <li>From a qualility standpoint it is great but stiff.  </li>
            <li>I can sure see more detail than I expected!</li>
            <li>The mirror came quickly and was exactly as described, and just what I needed.</li>
            <li>The fit &amp; finish is great but the 7X mirror side is poor quality in my opinion, you have to be just right looking into it for it to be in focus!</li>
            <li>Great mirror for tight spot in my bathroom!</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>Other reviewers note the stiffness of the articulated hinge, but we think that&#x27;s a good feature.  </li>
            <li>The finish looks good with my other bathroom fixtures.</li>
            <li>Husband mounted this at just the right height for me.</li>
            <li>I had planned to mount it right out side the shower and rotate it in when I wanted to use it.</li>
            <li>- just find the right distance for viewing.</li>
            <li>However the hardware, screws in particular were cheap and both broke when I mounted the mirror to the wall.</li>
            <li>I was able to mount it on the side wall of the bathroom sink and use it to view the back of my head in the full mirror.</li>
            <li>easy to install and very classy looking</li>
            <li>Good flexibility makes it very useful in my small, studio apartment.</li>
            <li>I would have loved to have hung it up in my new apartment, but when I moved, I lost a part crucial to its installation.</li>
            <li>more than OK when I received it, and it was a lot less than some.  </li>
            <li>arm is not as long as I would have liked</li>
            <li>Solidly built, sufficiently tight swing arms, excellent mirror clarity both sides.</li>
            <li>Such easy access too!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Classy and easy to install.</li>
            <li>After seeing what others of this same kind go for I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much</li>
            <li>Quick delivery &amp; very well made unit.  </li>
            <li>He has a clear image mirror on one side and flips easily to the magnification side.</li>
            <li>I mounted with ez anchor drywall anchors instead of the ones that come with it to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t rip from the wall while trying to move the hinges back and forth and it works great, feels solid to the wall!</li>
            <li>Makes it really easy to do my make up in the morning instead of trying to lean clear into the mirror in front of me.</li>
            <li>kind of upset that it took me this long to find this baby!!</li>
            <li>The glass is good and the mechanism is tight, sturdy and well finished, it also comes with screws and wall anchors for mounting.  </li>
            <li>It fogs up very fast.</li>
            <li>Next step is to mount an LED light above to try and get more downward light.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>When I am finished using it I easily fold it up out of the way,but handy enough for the next use.  </li>
            <li>Nice mirror to have in a bathroom with very limited counter space.</li>
            <li>This is a great mirror and very well made..  Getting older I need something with magnification to pull all those wild hairs and this is perfext and it tucks back out of the wah when not in use.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>Aside from that the materials feel pretty sturdy though.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced !</li>
            <li>I momentarily panicked when I saw the picture on the mirror&#x27;s box, since the color of the mirror on the box was closer to copper than to nickel., but opening the box, I saw that it is exactly the color</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>The swivel action is not as smooth as it could be.  </li>
            <li>very sturdy built and highly useful.</li>
            <li>a much better price than what I paid in a retail store for the same thing.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>

            <li>The first step into screw the metal brace into the wall.</li>
            <li>Also came exactly when promised.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more items from DecoBros in the future.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Unless the studs are exactly where you want to mount it, you will need to address this issue.</li>
            <li>It actually looks better this way.</li>
            <li>Exactly the product I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Sleek and pretty</li>

            <li>Exactly what I wanted with an affordable price tag.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I was able to put it back together.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>though - my wife loves it - and that&#x27;s what REALLY matters!...</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed.  </li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I had a wal mounted mirror that was pretty flimsy, and broke.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend drilling the hole first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This mirror has the look and feel of a higher end mirror.</li>
            <li>Shows facial features better than the lighted mirrors.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I found one for a lot more money with a  &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; finish which appeared to be the &amp;#34;chrome over plastic&amp;#34; often used in auto interiors - not built to last.  </li>
            <li>I am not sorry I went with 7x, but 5x might be a consideration for some.  </li>
            <li>Mirror was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Very easy to install (5 minutes) and exactly what I was looking for to free up counter space in a small bathroom.</li>
            <li>The installation of the mirror on the side wall was so simple, and it fold back flat to the wall so its not in anyone else&#x27;s way,,, I love the magnification, for doing my eyeliner, and tweezing my eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li>I love that it lays flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it was half the price of other mirrors I had looked at in retail stores and on line.  </li>
            <li>I am putting it up near a window for optimum daylight and love that t retracts back far enough to be out of the way.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed and is getting daily use:)</li>
            <li>It is so much sturdier than my last one and has greater magnification.</li>
            <li>I liked the first one so much that I bought one for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li>We had to return, not due to product quality, but it didn&#x27;t fit where we wanted to install it.</li>
            <li>It was everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>spent a good deal of time looking for something like this, mostly online, but also a few box stores.  </li>
            <li>Love my mirror...........don&#x27;t know how I did without it so long.</li>
            <li>I looked into it while getting ready and thought, WOW that&#x27;s useful!</li>
            <li>The magnifying side works great for getting a close up look at my eyebrows while plucking and other facial grooming that I need a close up look for.</li>
            <li>The finish is pretty and the bracket is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>7X may e too much as you need to get pretty close for it to come into focus.</li>
            <li>An easy fix to tighten it up, but I had already put several holes in the wall, confounded at first that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it up straight using 2 levels.</li>
            <li>Sturdy enough and easy to install.</li>
            <li>Make the extra effort and get a stud finder (pretty cheap at any hardware</li>
            <li>I recommend a power drill to make installation as easy as possible.</li>
            <li>Easy to hang, although I used different screws because we have plaster walls.</li>
            <li>Plus it adjusts easily and it magnified just enough for me to see without my glasses.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, large enough to use and strong enough to use with out glasses .</li>
            <li>It is well built, certainly will not wear out any time soon.</li>
            <li>Exactly what the wife wanted at a reasonable price compared to what was available at the local stores.  </li>
            <li>The finish is not high quality, but, most would find it acceptable.  </li>
            <li>All mounting hardware seems fine, would not use molly bolts enclosed, go get larger ones.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Item is very high quality - not flimsy at all.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality and</li>
            <li>It was easy to install and folds flat against the cabinet</li>
            <li>The regular mirror is great for everyday shaving and the magnifying mirror does the job we had in mind for it.  </li>
            <li>Very well built, nice and heavy material was used for construction.  </li>
            <li>Looks and works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and keeps the extension and angle I want.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>This mirror came fast and was just what I wanted, Now I can see all my flaws and wrinkles up close.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you are looking for this item!</li>
            <li>very well made.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves the fact that it is much easier to put on her makeup.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>He really likes it</li>
            <li>helps me to trim my hair on the back of my head, as well as detailed view through the magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>Very well built.  </li>
            <li>If a casting or a part machined from bar were used, the mount would be much sturdier.  </li>
            <li>It comes with drywall anchors, but there again, I didn&#x27;t feel like they would be a secure enough</li>
            <li>I like it that much buy 2</li>
            <li>it is very sturdy - very well</li>
            <li>The metal is very sturdy feeling.</li>
            <li>Thanks DecoBrothers.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Mirror is attractive looking in nickel finish, definitely looks like a more expensive mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>others as much as $20</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get ready with out it.</li>
            <li>Quality product - about as much magnification as you would ever want.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt as well.</li>
            <li>Product quality is also much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>This mirror is better than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have zero complaints and highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for it!</li>
            <li>The magnified mirror works very well when you get used to it</li>
            <li>Very well made and I like the magnification.</li>
            <li>Delivery very timely.</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than the hotel mirror that prompted us to buy this.</li>
            <li>The profile is very slim.</li>
            <li>This product is very well made, and the mirror stays in the position you place it.</li>
            <li>It is a far better value than similar mirrors that cost over twice as much.</li>
            <li>but I doubt you&#x27;ll get as much \\&quot;bang for the buck\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be a real problem.</li>
            <li>This is a really well made, quality piece.  </li>
            <li>Well made very sturdy exceeded expectations</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also 7x, so I can see really well.</li>
            <li>Also much easier to apply makeup, tweezers eyebrows etc.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable also for the value.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t used it much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and well made</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and well</li>
            <li>I suppose this will loosen a bit after much use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, functional and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really matter since it&#x27;s in my master bathroom and my husband and I</li>
            <li>This mirror was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Truly a must have and reasonable.</li>
            <li>After much consideration I purchased it on Amazon marketplace.  </li>
            <li>it was WAY better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the side with magnification.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li>Love it better thin</li>
            <li>I would recommend mounting it directly in a stud!!!</li>
            <li>Makes getting ready soooo much easier and doesn&#x27;t take up precious counter space like my other mirror did.  </li>
            <li>Compared to many other sites I looked at the price here was much lower.</li>
            <li>The DecoBros is less expensive, looks better, moves smoothly, and mounts MUCH more securely.</li>
            <li>(Apparently,the website is only accessible if you&#x27;ve registered a product with them.)</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this after reading other user reviews.</li>
            <li>The  mirror is a little larger than what I was expecting, but it is sturdy, tucks away nicely, and clears counter space!</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced, easy to install, and has been very sturdy so far (have been using for several months now)</li>
            <li>I used more heavy duty dry wall anchors that I already had (screw in type) which I love and make a project easier to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like the idea of having 2 different size mirrors (regular and magnifier) however, you really have to make sure you find a stud to place the mirror on the wall.  </li>
            <li>No problem with the mirror screwed into the stud, but I wonder if the same would be true using anchors in drywall.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what I wanted and it arrived early.</li>
            <li>This eliminated that entirely, and it looks just fine, and professional, adhered to the wall at eye level.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large diameter might be a problem in some locations, but gives me a very clear field.</li>
            <li>WIFE LOVES THE NEW MIRROR!</li>
            <li>Exactly as expected and easy to install.</li>
            <li>My better half loves it.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for contact lenses and shaving.</li>
            <li>Bought this as I am getting older and can&#x27;t see to put on my eye makeup anymore.</li>
            <li>It is just large enough and the 7X magnification is just right.  </li>
            <li>The finish and the construction are visually appealing and make it look like a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>As I got older I had to lean over the counter to put my makeup on</li>
            <li>but I knew it from the description and got it anyway since it is very hard to find another one with longer extendable arm within a good price range.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is highly magnified compared to my hand held mirror.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly</li>
            <li>Yes, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Construction and materials are high quality.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The magnification side is perfect for those of us getting a little older and need a little extra help when applying make up!</li>
            <li>7X magnification is a little over the top, but hey i don&#x27;t use it my wife does.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a little more extension</li>
            <li>It is a great product but difficult to use if use glasses.</li>
            <li>Magnification is a bit extreme but other than that all is good.</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s been hanging for a while in a normally damp area</li>
            <li>Two screw installation took a few min at most.</li>
            <li>As I get older it gets more difficult to get my 3 sets of pierced earnings in easily.</li>
            <li>Too heavy; doesn&#x27;t swing easily; the 7x magnification is too much.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is strongly made and rather heavy.  </li>
            <li>Swivels right up against the side wall, where I positioned it so that I could use the non-magnified side to see the back of my head in the bathroom mirror as well.</li>
            <li>I mounted it right next to the mirror over the sink.</li>
            <li>One thing that is a bit off however, is the left and right connections at the mirror aren&#x27;t quite level.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t get in the way sitting on bathroom counter, doesn&#x27;t get knocked down, and was easy to put up.</li>
            <li>The close-up mirror is perfect for makeup application and getting out those little irritating pieces of fuzz that make my contact lenses feel so</li>
            <li>once i bought some new screws (2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but then it might be new</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife to use in our new home.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for in my newly remodeled bathroom.</li>
            <li>Finish is nice and subtle, I wish I&#x27;d bought this years ago.</li>
            <li>Looks great - a little stiff - but does this trick.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>The mirror wouldn&#x27;t come down by any means but it was disappointing after paying $26 for what I thought was a more quality mirror that it isn&#x27;t more secure.  </li>
            <li>Large, finely ground mirror, big enough to contain the entire face</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>The magnification is great for delicate and hard-to-detect areas for make-up application and other uses.  </li>
            <li>i also use to see the back of my hair while getting ready!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, used different screws than provided to anchor into stud.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that stud-finding is necessary and limits where it can be put, because of the weight.</li>
            <li>This is such a wonder mirror and looks pretty too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve priced others of similar style and they are $10-15 higher in price.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror, one side regular the other side 7X magnification.</li>
            <li>Surprised at the weight and sturdiness for the price!  </li>
            <li>Very nice quality, heavy, bit bigger than I had expected</li>
            <li>The brushed chrome finish on the mirror is high quality, it took minutes to install, and the swivel arm seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This mirror was as good if not better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>I wanted something a little bigger than the small mirrors and more than the 5X magnification of most mirrors.  </li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected, mounted easily.</li>
            <li>It moves smoothly though a bit on the tight side.</li>
            <li>screws were a little light weight for the size of mirror</li>
            <li>Clear mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is clear and well made.</li>
            <li>the mirror is crystal clear.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear way before the vanity mirror dries.</li>
            <li>the mirror quality is clear and the magnification is a god send.</li>
            <li>The mirror is clear and without distortion and the swivel arms are snug and hold their position.</li>
            <li>old woman that needed a magnification mirror</li>
            <li>Not to cover, hide or do away with any of it, but rather to celebrate all that my aging face represents and to appreciate how far it has come.  </li>
            <li>I bought the identical mirror around ten years ago, with a chrome finish, and it served me really well.</li>
            <li>I needed an accordion mirror in one of my rental units because the sink is placed directly under a window.  </li>
            <li>You will need to screw directly into a stud with longer screws in order for this to hold.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mirror for the price.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and a bit larger than I imagined.</li>
            <li>Was way to mount to the wall and the long arm with hinges help to get the exact angle you desire.  </li>
            <li>My husband installed this mirror in the bathroom, near the existing mirror over the sink.  </li>
            <li>The combination of the two mirrors is very helpful for trimming hair on the back of the head.</li>
            <li>The two different magnification mirrors really help.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the wrinkles I am seeing on this almost 80 year old</li>
            <li>The only problem is that 7X magnification is a bit much for me - but that&#x27;s on me.  </li>
            <li>One for me and one for my Father who is 89 years old and having difficulty inserting eyedrops used in treating his glaucoma.  </li>
            <li>Did not try that, because I had already fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>I think it actually saves me time getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li>toddler loves it too, she wants to see the big herself</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right next to the big bathroom mirror</li>
            <li>Very well built, it is not sloppy against the wall, and doesn&#x27;t bow down when fully extended.</li>
            <li>a satin chrome finish.. subtle and lovely.</li>
            <li>The reflection in the mirror, both normal and magnified, is clear and the piece can be folded back against the wall when needed.</li>
            <li>This is such a clever invention.</li>
            <li>I was able to hang it up on my wall easily and in less than a few minutes, the only issue I had was with the dry wall in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Not very heavy</li>
            <li>Exactly as hoped and expected .</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I ended up mounting the unit upside down (with arm above mirror), and repairing the original holes in the wall.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror and another (Modona MR01-A) - for two different bathrooms in our new home.  </li>
            <li>easy installation (I am really not handy and never done anything like this before), but you do need a drill and screw drivers for installation.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that when I received this mirror, I would be able to order that part, and hang my chrome mirror in my daughter&#x27;s bathroom, but I will say that my only complaint is that I cannot contact the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>If it was brass or bronze it would be much heavier than it is and a lot more expensive, so I would say its aluminum with a nickle finish.</li>
            <li>We put this opposite the main mirror in the bathroom and it allows my wife to see the back of her hair</li>
            <li>bought this to replace an old one of a different brand.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to complete a recent bathroom renovation that I did.  </li>
            <li>very short 95 yr old Mother-in-law, she loves it.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than expected.</li>
            <li>One minor flaw preventing it from getting 5 stars: the hinge near the wall was much too tight for normal use and it took me a bit to fix that.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that the hinges are very stiff at first, making me worry that pulling the mirror out to use it could exert too much pressure on the screws mounting the mirror to the wall.</li>
            <li>Also 7x magnification is too much and would recommend going no higher than a 5x.  </li>
            <li>Super sturdy, very heavy duty and</li>
            <li>I was having a hard time holding my mirror and applying my makeup, now I am hands free and I can actually see!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There does seem to be a slight blur on the 7x when you look at a certain distance.</li>
            <li>I had thought that after some use, the mirror would swing loose - none of that so far.</li>
            <li>It was a little tight had to work it to get it to move free</li>
            <li>Double sided... normal magnification on one side and 7x on the other.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> More powerful than my 5x hand mirror.</li>
            <li> I had been using a hand held mirror,but with my wall mount mirror both my hands are free.  </li>

            <li> great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The wall mount is ok, but the part that attaches the entire thing to the wall mount is off a good 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However,  if you position it the way you like to use it, then just swing the whole arm back (instead of folding it up) then it works great!!  </li>
            <li> Mounts easily and has a nice, contemporary look.</li>
            <li> Classy look and good build quality.  </li>

            <li> I love the way it looks and it makes it so much easier to see when I&#x27;m grooming or putting on makeup!</li>
            <li> This is so useful!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it, buy it!</li>
            <li> Note that the 7X magnification is a higher magnification than most magnifying mirrors.</li>
            <li> It folds up neatly against the wall, and when I need it, it comes right out smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install (less than 10 minutes) and beautiful design.</li>
            <li> Nicely made and the mirror is a good size, I wish the magnafide side was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Clean design and mirror images are not distorted.</li>
            <li> Have mounted on the wall next to vanity in master bath, and so far am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Pleasant surprise to find such quality these days.</li>
            <li> Great product can not live without it.</li>
            <li> I had a mirror like this before (in my old house) but THIS one is much better quality, sturdy!  </li>
            <li> Swings out easily, and the magnification is just right for applying eye makeup and tweezing the brows.</li>
            <li> The other is 7x for when you need to get a look real close-up for those perfectly placed eye liners or lip liners, etc.</li>
            <li> You can certainly pay much more ($$$) for a wall-mounted mirror -</li>
            <li> Priced right!  </li>
            <li> Arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> Good quality, right finish for brushed nickel and easy to in stall.</li>

            <li> Great mirror as expected in description.</li>
            <li> As advertised, easy to install (I was lucky and found a wall stud), quick delivery, and certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> (what bathroom isn&#x27;t?), it seems that the brushed nickel quality is good and that it will hold up well for years.</li>
            <li> and I would get the mirror all full of finger prints and makeup.</li>
            <li> Make sure you drill it onto the wall very well.</li>
            <li> Solid, sturdy mirror of good quality.</li>
            <li> Love the mirror, arrived on time and packaging was very well done..</li>

            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>

            <li> FAST delivery, product is all I expected it to be - good quality, easy to mount and does the job</li>
            <li> Have had it up for a couple weeks now in a very humid (at times) bathroom and it is holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> seems great, well made, heavy duty</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror so i can see the back of my head to do my own hair color.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have enough light in the room.</li>
            <li> Nice having the 7x magnification on the back side.</li>
            <li> Magnification is so much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, and swivels easily enough, but has some tension in it, so doesn&#x27;t swing away from you if you bump it...</li>
            <li> and now we have this handy mirror for close work or seeing the back and sides when trimming hair or haircoloring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase this one, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Nice, basic wall mount mirror.</li>
            <li> One star taken off for stiffness of moving parts (doesn&#x27;t work itself any looser) and for the tiny flaws my good eyes can see at the very edge of the mirror (almost under the nickel colored surround).</li>
            <li> All good, what I expected.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was simple to install and adjusts nicely.</li>
            <li> the metal is pretty true to color to the picture.</li>
            <li> The magnification is seriously powerful.  </li>
            <li> I laugh while she plucks.</li>
            <li> The magnification was a more than I expected, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll appreciate that</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised might be a better choice of words.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is what I was looking at, but I was seeing far more than I wanted.</li>
            <li> High quality, easy install.</li>
            <li> Item is as described, looks high quality and is easy to install.</li>
            <li> High quality product, well designed, easy to install.</li>
            <li> From a qualility standpoint it is great but stiff.  </li>
            <li> I can sure see more detail than I expected!</li>
            <li> The mirror came quickly and was exactly as described, and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The fit &amp; finish is great but the 7X mirror side is poor quality in my opinion, you have to be just right looking into it for it to be in focus!</li>
            <li> Great mirror for tight spot in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> Other reviewers note the stiffness of the articulated hinge, but we think that&#x27;s a good feature.  </li>
            <li> The finish looks good with my other bathroom fixtures.</li>
            <li> Husband mounted this at just the right height for me.</li>
            <li> I had planned to mount it right out side the shower and rotate it in when I wanted to use it.</li>
            <li> - just find the right distance for viewing.</li>
            <li> However the hardware, screws in particular were cheap and both broke when I mounted the mirror to the wall.</li>
            <li> I was able to mount it on the side wall of the bathroom sink and use it to view the back of my head in the full mirror.</li>
            <li> easy to install and very classy looking</li>
            <li> Good flexibility makes it very useful in my small, studio apartment.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to have hung it up in my new apartment, but when I moved, I lost a part crucial to its installation.</li>
            <li> more than OK when I received it, and it was a lot less than some.  </li>
            <li> arm is not as long as I would have liked</li>
            <li> Solidly built, sufficiently tight swing arms, excellent mirror clarity both sides.</li>
            <li> Such easy access too!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Classy and easy to install.</li>
            <li> After seeing what others of this same kind go for I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much</li>
            <li> Quick delivery &amp; very well made unit.  </li>
            <li> He has a clear image mirror on one side and flips easily to the magnification side.</li>
            <li> I mounted with ez anchor drywall anchors instead of the ones that come with it to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t rip from the wall while trying to move the hinges back and forth and it works great, feels solid to the wall!</li>
            <li> Makes it really easy to do my make up in the morning instead of trying to lean clear into the mirror in front of me.</li>
            <li> kind of upset that it took me this long to find this baby!!</li>
            <li> The glass is good and the mechanism is tight, sturdy and well finished, it also comes with screws and wall anchors for mounting.  </li>
            <li> It fogs up very fast.</li>
            <li> Next step is to mount an LED light above to try and get more downward light.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> When I am finished using it I easily fold it up out of the way,but handy enough for the next use.  </li>
            <li> Nice mirror to have in a bathroom with very limited counter space.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror and very well made..  Getting older I need something with magnification to pull all those wild hairs and this is perfext and it tucks back out of the wah when not in use.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>

            <li> Reasonably priced !</li>
            <li> I momentarily panicked when I saw the picture on the mirror&#x27;s box, since the color of the mirror on the box was closer to copper than to nickel., but opening the box, I saw that it is exactly the color</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> The swivel action is not as smooth as it could be.  </li>
            <li> very sturdy built and highly useful.</li>

            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I was able to put it back together.</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> though - my wife loves it - and that&#x27;s what REALLY matters!...</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed.  </li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I had a wal mounted mirror that was pretty flimsy, and broke.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend drilling the hole first.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This mirror has the look and feel of a higher end mirror.</li>
            <li> Shows facial features better than the lighted mirrors.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I found one for a lot more money with a  &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; finish which appeared to be the &amp;#34;chrome over plastic&amp;#34; often used in auto interiors - not built to last.  </li>
            <li> I am not sorry I went with 7x, but 5x might be a consideration for some.  </li>
            <li> Mirror was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install (5 minutes) and exactly what I was looking for to free up counter space in a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> The installation of the mirror on the side wall was so simple, and it fold back flat to the wall so its not in anyone else&#x27;s way,,, I love the magnification, for doing my eyeliner, and tweezing my eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li> I love that it lays flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it was half the price of other mirrors I had looked at in retail stores and on line.  </li>
            <li> I am putting it up near a window for optimum daylight and love that t retracts back far enough to be out of the way.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed and is getting daily use:)</li>
            <li> It is so much sturdier than my last one and has greater magnification.</li>
            <li> I liked the first one so much that I bought one for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> We had to return, not due to product quality, but it didn&#x27;t fit where we wanted to install it.</li>
            <li> It was everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> spent a good deal of time looking for something like this, mostly online, but also a few box stores.  </li>
            <li> Love my mirror...........don&#x27;t know how I did without it so long.</li>
            <li> I looked into it while getting ready and thought, WOW that&#x27;s useful!</li>
            <li> The magnifying side works great for getting a close up look at my eyebrows while plucking and other facial grooming that I need a close up look for.</li>
            <li> The finish is pretty and the bracket is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> 7X may e too much as you need to get pretty close for it to come into focus.</li>
            <li> An easy fix to tighten it up, but I had already put several holes in the wall, confounded at first that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it up straight using 2 levels.</li>
            <li> Sturdy enough and easy to install.</li>
            <li> Make the extra effort and get a stud finder (pretty cheap at any hardware</li>
            <li> I recommend a power drill to make installation as easy as possible.</li>
            <li> Easy to hang, although I used different screws because we have plaster walls.</li>
            <li> Plus it adjusts easily and it magnified just enough for me to see without my glasses.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, large enough to use and strong enough to use with out glasses .</li>
            <li> It is well built, certainly will not wear out any time soon.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the wife wanted at a reasonable price compared to what was available at the local stores.  </li>
            <li> The finish is not high quality, but, most would find it acceptable.  </li>
            <li> All mounting hardware seems fine, would not use molly bolts enclosed, go get larger ones.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Item is very high quality - not flimsy at all.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality and</li>
            <li> It was easy to install and folds flat against the cabinet</li>
            <li> The regular mirror is great for everyday shaving and the magnifying mirror does the job we had in mind for it.  </li>
            <li> Very well built, nice and heavy material was used for construction.  </li>
            <li> Looks and works very well.</li>

            <li> very well made.  </li>

            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> He really likes it</li>
            <li> helps me to trim my hair on the back of my head, as well as detailed view through the magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Very well built.  </li>
            <li> If a casting or a part machined from bar were used, the mount would be much sturdier.  </li>
            <li> It comes with drywall anchors, but there again, I didn&#x27;t feel like they would be a secure enough</li>
            <li> I like it that much buy 2</li>
            <li> it is very sturdy - very well</li>
            <li> The metal is very sturdy feeling.</li>

            <li> I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than the hotel mirror that prompted us to buy this.</li>
            <li> The profile is very slim.</li>
            <li> This product is very well made, and the mirror stays in the position you place it.</li>
            <li> It is a far better value than similar mirrors that cost over twice as much.</li>
            <li> but I doubt you&#x27;ll get as much \\&quot;bang for the buck\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be a real problem.</li>
            <li> This is a really well made, quality piece.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really matter since it&#x27;s in my master bathroom and my husband and I</li>
            <li> This mirror was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Truly a must have and reasonable.</li>
            <li> After much consideration I purchased it on Amazon marketplace.  </li>
            <li> it was WAY better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the side with magnification.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Love it better thin</li>
            <li> I would recommend mounting it directly in a stud!!!</li>
            <li> Makes getting ready soooo much easier and doesn&#x27;t take up precious counter space like my other mirror did.  </li>
            <li> Compared to many other sites I looked at the price here was much lower.</li>
            <li> The DecoBros is less expensive, looks better, moves smoothly, and mounts MUCH more securely.</li>
            <li> (Apparently,the website is only accessible if you&#x27;ve registered a product with them.)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this after reading other user reviews.</li>
            <li> The  mirror is a little larger than what I was expecting, but it is sturdy, tucks away nicely, and clears counter space!</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced, easy to install, and has been very sturdy so far (have been using for several months now)</li>
            <li> I used more heavy duty dry wall anchors that I already had (screw in type) which I love and make a project easier to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like the idea of having 2 different size mirrors (regular and magnifier) however, you really have to make sure you find a stud to place the mirror on the wall.  </li>
            <li> No problem with the mirror screwed into the stud, but I wonder if the same would be true using anchors in drywall.  </li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted and it arrived early.</li>
            <li> This eliminated that entirely, and it looks just fine, and professional, adhered to the wall at eye level.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large diameter might be a problem in some locations, but gives me a very clear field.</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES THE NEW MIRROR!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and easy to install.</li>
            <li> My better half loves it.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for contact lenses and shaving.</li>
            <li> Bought this as I am getting older and can&#x27;t see to put on my eye makeup anymore.</li>
            <li> It is just large enough and the 7X magnification is just right.  </li>
            <li> The finish and the construction are visually appealing and make it look like a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> As I got older I had to lean over the counter to put my makeup on</li>
            <li> but I knew it from the description and got it anyway since it is very hard to find another one with longer extendable arm within a good price range.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is highly magnified compared to my hand held mirror.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly</li>
            <li> Yes, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Construction and materials are high quality.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The magnification side is perfect for those of us getting a little older and need a little extra help when applying make up!</li>
            <li> 7X magnification is a little over the top, but hey i don&#x27;t use it my wife does.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a little more extension</li>
            <li> It is a great product but difficult to use if use glasses.</li>
            <li> Magnification is a bit extreme but other than that all is good.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s been hanging for a while in a normally damp area</li>
            <li> Two screw installation took a few min at most.</li>
            <li> As I get older it gets more difficult to get my 3 sets of pierced earnings in easily.</li>
            <li> Too heavy; doesn&#x27;t swing easily; the 7x magnification is too much.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is strongly made and rather heavy.  </li>
            <li> Swivels right up against the side wall, where I positioned it so that I could use the non-magnified side to see the back of my head in the bathroom mirror as well.</li>
            <li> I mounted it right next to the mirror over the sink.</li>
            <li> One thing that is a bit off however, is the left and right connections at the mirror aren&#x27;t quite level.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t get in the way sitting on bathroom counter, doesn&#x27;t get knocked down, and was easy to put up.</li>
            <li> The close-up mirror is perfect for makeup application and getting out those little irritating pieces of fuzz that make my contact lenses feel so</li>
            <li> once i bought some new screws (2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but then it might be new</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to use in our new home.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for in my newly remodeled bathroom.</li>
            <li> Finish is nice and subtle, I wish I&#x27;d bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> Looks great - a little stiff - but does this trick.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> The mirror wouldn&#x27;t come down by any means but it was disappointing after paying $26 for what I thought was a more quality mirror that it isn&#x27;t more secure.  </li>
            <li> Large, finely ground mirror, big enough to contain the entire face</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> The magnification is great for delicate and hard-to-detect areas for make-up application and other uses.  </li>
            <li> i also use to see the back of my hair while getting ready!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, used different screws than provided to anchor into stud.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that stud-finding is necessary and limits where it can be put, because of the weight.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonder mirror and looks pretty too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve priced others of similar style and they are $10-15 higher in price.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, one side regular the other side 7X magnification.</li>
            <li> Surprised at the weight and sturdiness for the price!  </li>
            <li> Very nice quality, heavy, bit bigger than I had expected</li>
            <li> The brushed chrome finish on the mirror is high quality, it took minutes to install, and the swivel arm seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This mirror was as good if not better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I wanted something a little bigger than the small mirrors and more than the 5X magnification of most mirrors.  </li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected, mounted easily.</li>
            <li> It moves smoothly though a bit on the tight side.</li>
            <li> screws were a little light weight for the size of mirror</li>
            <li> Clear mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is clear and well made.</li>
            <li> the mirror is crystal clear.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear way before the vanity mirror dries.</li>
            <li> the mirror quality is clear and the magnification is a god send.</li>
            <li> The mirror is clear and without distortion and the swivel arms are snug and hold their position.</li>
            <li> old woman that needed a magnification mirror</li>
            <li> Not to cover, hide or do away with any of it, but rather to celebrate all that my aging face represents and to appreciate how far it has come.  </li>
            <li> I bought the identical mirror around ten years ago, with a chrome finish, and it served me really well.</li>
            <li> I needed an accordion mirror in one of my rental units because the sink is placed directly under a window.  </li>
            <li> You will need to screw directly into a stud with longer screws in order for this to hold.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and a bit larger than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Was way to mount to the wall and the long arm with hinges help to get the exact angle you desire.  </li>
            <li> My husband installed this mirror in the bathroom, near the existing mirror over the sink.  </li>
            <li> The combination of the two mirrors is very helpful for trimming hair on the back of the head.</li>
            <li> The two different magnification mirrors really help.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the wrinkles I am seeing on this almost 80 year old</li>
            <li> The only problem is that 7X magnification is a bit much for me - but that&#x27;s on me.  </li>
            <li> One for me and one for my Father who is 89 years old and having difficulty inserting eyedrops used in treating his glaucoma.  </li>
            <li> Did not try that, because I had already fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> I think it actually saves me time getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li> toddler loves it too, she wants to see the big herself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right next to the big bathroom mirror</li>
            <li> Very well built, it is not sloppy against the wall, and doesn&#x27;t bow down when fully extended.</li>
            <li> a satin chrome finish.. subtle and lovely.</li>
            <li> The reflection in the mirror, both normal and magnified, is clear and the piece can be folded back against the wall when needed.</li>
            <li> This is such a clever invention.</li>
            <li> I was able to hang it up on my wall easily and in less than a few minutes, the only issue I had was with the dry wall in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Not very heavy</li>
            <li> Exactly as hoped and expected .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I ended up mounting the unit upside down (with arm above mirror), and repairing the original holes in the wall.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror and another (Modona MR01-A) - for two different bathrooms in our new home.  </li>
            <li> easy installation (I am really not handy and never done anything like this before), but you do need a drill and screw drivers for installation.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that when I received this mirror, I would be able to order that part, and hang my chrome mirror in my daughter&#x27;s bathroom, but I will say that my only complaint is that I cannot contact the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> If it was brass or bronze it would be much heavier than it is and a lot more expensive, so I would say its aluminum with a nickle finish.</li>
            <li> We put this opposite the main mirror in the bathroom and it allows my wife to see the back of her hair</li>
            <li> bought this to replace an old one of a different brand.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to complete a recent bathroom renovation that I did.  </li>
            <li> very short 95 yr old Mother-in-law, she loves it.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than expected.</li>
            <li> One minor flaw preventing it from getting 5 stars: the hinge near the wall was much too tight for normal use and it took me a bit to fix that.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that the hinges are very stiff at first, making me worry that pulling the mirror out to use it could exert too much pressure on the screws mounting the mirror to the wall.</li>
            <li> Also 7x magnification is too much and would recommend going no higher than a 5x.  </li>
            <li> Super sturdy, very heavy duty and</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time holding my mirror and applying my makeup, now I am hands free and I can actually see!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There does seem to be a slight blur on the 7x when you look at a certain distance.</li>
            <li> I had thought that after some use, the mirror would swing loose - none of that so far.</li>
            <li> It was a little tight had to work it to get it to move free</li>
            <li> Double sided... normal magnification on one side and 7x on the other.</li>
            <li> The 1x mirror is very clear with no distortion, and even tho the 7x mirror has a slight vertical distortion on the edges it does not hinder its use whatsoever since my focus is entirely on my image in the middle of the mirror, and my image in that central area is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also folds back up to rest flat against the wall out of the way when not in use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I really needed, but that&#x27;s a small matter.</li>
            <li> The edges are a little blurry, but that may be normal for a magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality durable and heavy mirror.</li>
            <li> We put it on the opposite side of our (small) bathroom from the main mirror, and it works well to look at the back of the head.  </li>
            <li> Easily mounted on wall of very small bathroom; extends to provide the extra magnification sometimes necessary yet folds back into place to take up very little space.</li>
            <li> I pull it in and out so much, I am not sure how well the installation would hold up if it was not on a stud.</li>
            <li> i did have a problem with the enclosed screws not being long enough to support the weight of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> This mounts to the wall and when folded in, lays almost flat</li>
            <li> Also, the bottom of mirror scratches on the long arm every time you fold it back against the wall.</li>
            <li> Fits flat against wall when not in use</li>
            <li> It folds up flat against the wall</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t move the short arm, just the long arm.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought the mirror, I was a little nervous that the quality would be sub-par because it costs so much less than similar products.  </li>
            <li> Extends easily, swivels smoothly, mirror itself turns up and down, and swivels sideways on its base.</li>
            <li> This was the least expensive two-sided swivel wall mount mirror I found and the reviews were good, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Us, uh, mature ladies may need a little help since our eyes are a little, uh, mature to see well enough to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> The swivel is solid and isn&#x27;t loose or anything.</li>
            <li> yet loose enough to move the mirror in any position you want.</li>
            <li> Very well made, but very stiff to move which may lossen up over time.  </li>
            <li> Much bigger and sturdier than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had found this mirror a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I waited so long to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stiff when you first get it.</li>
            <li> Since the new vanity placed the regular vanity mirror a distance from us, we found that for close-up work like shaving and trimming was just too hard to see.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting joint between the long arm and short atm is way too loose, it can wiggle up and down several  mm.</li>
            <li> For me it is not easy to see myself clearly without moving either my face or the mirror.</li>
            <li> I can use the other side to see the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> and then some, has magnification on one side, regular on the other.</li>
            <li> The mirror arm is mounted slightly crooked on the plate, so it looks a little crooked on my wall.  </li>
            <li> I used a stud finder to ensure I mounted it into a wood stud rather than just in the dry wall.  </li>
            <li> It does not matter if the mirror is 8 inches wide since you can only use that center inch.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, it is tough at first to move the mirror but seems to loosen up with time.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> The arm was mounted on the wall plate a little off-center, but that slight imperfection is something I can live with.</li>
            <li> I just installed it two days ago, but it seems up to par with the one I bought feom a local store for my other bathroom, only this one was about $14 less.  </li>
            <li> Only draw back it is very tightly connected at the joint closet to the wall</li>
            <li> Especially if you don&#x27;t have a sit down vanity in your bedroom or bathroom</li>
            <li> /&gt;We had purchased a similar item from Loews and found it to be less than what we had hoped for on a number of aspects.  </li>
            <li> I decided to use larger drywall anchors than the ones provided but not sure it was necessary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay item, but not good enough, and i am going to replace it (too expensive to return).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy the least expensive choice, but the reviews looked good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the short arm that&#x27;s tight, so</li>
            <li> 4 stars instead of 5 at this time only because the &#x27;swivel arm&#x27; is tight - hopefully this will loosen up in time.</li>
            <li> Because you can only hand-tighten it, there&#x27;s a little bit of play.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, looks expensive compared to ones I looked at in Lowes and its 1/2 the cost!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t swivel very easily - this was a pro in my opinion because I don&#x27;t want my tenants swinging the mirror to and fro haphazardly.  </li>
            <li> My husband installed it with no trouble beside the medicine cabinet, and it has stayed sturdy even though I pull it out to use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> Heavier than I expected</li>
            <li> Holes in mount are drilled off center.</li>
            <li> Mirror was as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The screw holes on the wall plate are off center, so hinge itself tilts.</li>
            <li> just what i expected.</li>
            <li> No waves or irregularity in the glass.&lt;br /&gt;The hollow wall anchors were useless for mounting because the mirror is heavy and must be secure to move during use.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> : I initially had trouble mounting the mirror flush on the wall.</li>
            <li> If I mount this to the wall, the pressure required to extend the mirror will likely cause the mounting to loosen and detach within a few months.</li>
            <li> Well made and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Those that commented the magnifying side &amp;#34;was like a fun house&amp;#34; are wrong.</li>
            <li> I was careful not to buy junk, but considering the price</li>
            <li> When you use the magnification side of this mirror, there is an area in the center about one-inch in diameter which is not too distorted to use.  </li>
            <li> The swivel is stiff enough to hold the mirror in place at any angle</li>
            <li> This was delivered sooner than I expected!</li>
            <li> Could extend a bit farther, but other than that.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these mirrors in the past 6 years..2 for my self and 2 for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I did not find any other mirror like this, and don&#x27;t expect to for the price.</li>
            <li> My other one was from Bed Bath and Beyond - cheapo quality.  </li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> I might buy another mirror for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> the silver finish goes well with other products in my bathroom -</li>
            <li> so I think I will order one for the other side.</li>
            <li> The amount of distortion is small and the sharp area extends almost the entire width.</li>
            <li> The concavity of this 7X mirror is so extreme</li>
            <li> The only problem I can come up with is that I can now see a lot of what I had been missing before, and it takes me a little longer to do my makeup.</li>
            <li> One problem I encountered: The shaft where mirror arm attaches was a little loose and a bit off perpendicular, so I had a heck of a time mounting it plumb until I realized this.</li>
            <li> I love the 7x magnification, though it&#x27;s a bit scary seeing my pores up so close!!</li>
            <li> A little heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> and it got uncomfortable, especially now that I had a major surgery on my abdomen.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is that we had to mount this to plasterboard, and the metal wall anchor sets recommended for this type of mounting were not included.</li>
            <li> have my mirror installed upside down compared to the picture on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The handle was a little hard to move at the beginning, but after I moved it back and forth for a couple minutes, it became smoother.</li>
            <li> The other reservation is that because of the design it doesn&#x27;t seat firmly onto the mounting plate on the wall.  </li>
            <li> It literally took less than 5 minutes to install the mirror</li>
            <li> it is plenty, and distortion is much less.</li>
            <li> It comes with anchors and screws and takes less than 5 minutes to install.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working well just as previous reviewers had described</li>
            <li> Not the quality as my 2 previous mirrors.</li>
            <li> The arm joints are a bit stiff straight out of the package - so I would suggest you try to anchor the base to a wall stud if possible since  I&#x27;m not sure the small plastic wall anchors would survive long in daily usage otherwise.</li>
            <li> Only negative is it is a little stiff when trying to extend it out.</li>
            <li> The arm is a little stiff, but I rather have it a little stiff to move than loose and wobbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tight joints.</li>
            <li> No matter what I tried or how tightly I screwed the knobs</li>
            <li> All the joints are tight, so the mirror will stay at the angle you choose and wherever you move the swing arm, it will stay put.</li>
            <li> As per the reviewers&#x27; comments about the tight hinges, I hold the mounting plate when I move the arm so it doesn&#x27;t compromise attachment to the plaster wall.  </li>
            <li> And, because I agree the mirror is tight.  </li>
            <li> The hinges are tight.</li>
            <li> The movement is tight and appears to be made to stay that way.  </li>
            <li> I tried registering my new mirror, but the order number I had was not recognized, so I was unable to explore the Deco Brothers website.</li>
            <li> The swivels are a little tight, but if you will work them some, they will loosen up.</li>
            <li> One complaint she made is that the magnification gets blurry in areas and you need to focus on a small diameter to see properly.</li>
            <li> Arm starts to sag a little when it is fully extended.</li>
            <li> I had been using a little suction cup cheapie magnifying mirror when I happened upon this little guy.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other wall mount mirrors in the past, but the DecoBros 8-inch Two</li>
            <li> The packaging includes a little cardboard insert in the piece that mounts on the wall.</li>
            <li> a bit stiff.&lt;br /&gt;It may wear to become less stiff and will wait and</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the extension arms are very stiff to move around.</li>
            <li> The arm is a little stiff and takes a little effort to move.</li>
            <li> The base also doesn&#x27;t fit flush over the mounting plate.</li>
            <li> My vision is terrible so its nice to pull the mirror in close and not have to squint and trim.</li>
            <li> and hubby uses it to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> heavy weight.  </li>
            <li> Frame, swing bar and mounting bracket are heavy gauge.</li>
            <li> My husband had it hung up in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> All its missing is a range of motion on the Y axis.</li>
            <li> I use my mirror everyday</li>
            <li> I ended up taking out the screws behind the back plate and spraying some silicon lubricant in the holes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the frame was completely scratched up on one side.</li>
            <li> I recommend mounting to a wall stud because the unit is heavy and the swing arm is a bit stiff and does require a little effort to position for use or storage.</li>
            <li> Hinges are a little stiff but they may loosen over time.</li>
            <li> Lower joints a little tight and label maker tape to fix the typos on the product box!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit stiff once mounted</li>
            <li> Arms are a bit stiff, but will probably loosen up over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little things in life that matter!</li>
            <li> To my surprise, when I opened the package, there was this heavy well constructed product! -</li>
            <li> My fault for not better researching it.</li>
            <li> JUST what I needed for a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Finally a mirror I can use to put on makeup and pluck random chin hairs without my glasses</li>
            <li> Not sure what the mix up was, but we decided to keep it anyway.</li>
            <li> but it came in the wrong color that why the 4star only</li>
            <li> I had been using a small magnification mirror that was suction cupped to my mirror.</li>
            <li> And it fits in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> I just move it in or out a small bit as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the screws are neither phillips or flat head.</li>
            <li> e apart the first week from it&#x27;s mounting base...</li>
            <li> The Plus 7 magnification is hard to get used to, but once you do it works well.</li>
            <li> Faces of the mirror also get dirty quickly because it&#x27;s almost impossible not to touch them when you flip the mirror.  </li>
            <li> ( no more torches an pitchforks!)</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The hinges are difficult to move and even with machine oil and lots of manipulation, they are still too tight.</li>
            <li> If you need a wall mounted magnified mirror, you likely won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the arm is very hard to move.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and even worse eyes, an trying to lean over my sink to put on my makeup, with no glasses on,, was a nightmare!</li>
            <li> The quality of the mirror is  poor, and as a result the reflection images look distorted.</li>
            <li> My husband installed it on the bathroom wall behind decorative towels.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that anyone installing this mirror put the base into a wall stud, although the instructions also instruct how to use wall anchors in simple drywall.  </li>
            <li> , I thought it might be poor quality.</li>
            <li> When you are up close to it, it has a distorted magnification around the sides, it&#x27;s really irritating.</li>
            <li> I replaced a broken 5x mirror with this.</li>
            <li> It shows things on your face you have happily never noticed before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> replaced another brand that had broken.</li>
            <li> Poor workmanship.</li>
            <li> The hinge on the extension arm is so stiff that it is nearly impossible to extend the arm.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad back and a titanium plate in my neck, so leaning forward, whether it be over the bathroom sink or sitting in front of a standing make-up mirror, is painful for me.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to bend and if you use the Sheetrock screws provided, I have no doubt you&#x27;d inadvertently remove it from the wall!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> In addition to that, our bath room mirror / medicine cabinet can be difficult to see in at times.</li>
            <li> Difficult to figure where to install it,</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easier &#x27;cause I&#x27;m as blind as a bat.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find the nickel finish in home improvement stores.</li>
            <li> The functionality of it is 5 stars but the magnification of the mirror is weird.  </li>
            <li> and I am afraid if I don&#x27;t hold the base down when I extend it out that it would rip off from the wall.</li>
            <li> and she grudgingly admits she likes it.</li>
            <li> This may seem silly to say, but I can&#x27;t imagine a bathroom without this!  </li>
            <li> My husband purchased a very expensive mirror.</li>
            <li> I can look like a woman again, an not be afraid of scaring the villagers when I leave the house!</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Hated that one too.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a standing mirror from a store and hated how it couldn&#x27;t be adjusted.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Prompt delivery,great product. Easy to mount on the wall.</li>
            <li> Great product. Ordered twice, no issues. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> bought this to replace an old one of a different brand.  This item is superior to&lt;br /&gt;the one we had and a very useful item for any bathroom or makeup area.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy having the increased magnification.  i did have a problem with the enclosed screws not being long enough to support the weight of the mirror.  i dont think it was digging into the stud enough.  once i bought some new screws (2&amp;#34; i believe) then i was able to move it about as it was meant to work.</li>
            <li> Great price, easy installation. Enjoying this mirror!</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality and priced right.  Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Well constructed, easy to assemble. Looks and works very well.</li>
            <li> Great sturdy mirror. My husband installed it easily and it is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The mirror is great and I had it mounted in about ten minutes! Love it; love the quality!</li>
            <li> This was delivered sooner than I expected!</li>
            <li> Solidly built, sufficiently tight swing arms, excellent mirror clarity both sides. Mounted in our boat. Looks good (don&#x27;t know if it will stand up to the marine environment but it wasn&#x27;t advertised as such). Came on time, no damage.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Nice finish - good magnification - have yet to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; effects of shower steam on finish.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror. It mounted easily on the wall and it swings out and in very easily. I like the 7x magnification for putting on makeup. Great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed!</li>
            <li> excellent product,well made ,looks good,7.5 magnification is essential to good grooming!</li>
            <li> Good quality mirror.Easy to mount.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice mirror and extremely easy to install</li>
            <li> LOVE this mirror.  Very sturdy and keeps the extension and angle I want.</li>
            <li> Magnification is exceptional.  Easy to install.  Mirror stays where you put it; well made.  Decorative-does not look cheap.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wow! It works very well!</li>
            <li> This wall mounted mirror is exactly what I was looking for! We added a bathroom and the sink fell under an existing window leaving no place for a hanging mirror. We tried several things before I got the idea to look on Amazon for a wall mounted swivel mirror!  The reflection in the mirror, both normal and magnified, is clear and the piece can be folded back against the wall when needed. We LOVE it! The frame and arm is a beautiful chrome.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> great price and delivered on time.  Looks great.  made well.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing - just what I needed!</li>
            <li> Quality product.  Easy to install.  Deco Brothers shipped well wrapped and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Great solid product. My wife always wanted one of these but never told me until 30 years into my marriage! Seriously. Communication issues huh? She told me not to buy this because it would make the sink area too cluttered. I ignored her, installed it in 5 minutes and she grudgingly admits she likes it. One complaint she made is that the magnification gets blurry in areas and you need to focus on a small diameter to see properly. She has a point but it&#x27;s not cluttered and looks great.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror so i can see the back of my head to do my own hair color. Im SO glad I did. Had to play around with placement because of purpose but it works awesome. Heavier than I expected and we didnt hang it in the drywall, which is another reason for placement.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I wanted!  It is sturdier than the one that I was replacing and was quick to put up.  Some reviews mentioned that it was too &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t find it so.  It is tighter than the one I had before but it adds to the feel of its stability.  I can still move it in and out with one hand.  Overall great product!</li>
            <li> good mirror, love that it&#x27;s hands free.  not lighted, so make sure you have lots of good light where you are going to use it, or opt for a lighted one.</li>
            <li> Looks great - a little stiff - but does this trick.&lt;br /&gt;Easy mount - no problems.</li>
            <li> seems great, well made, heavy duty</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, easy installation, good product!</li>
            <li> The mirror looks great and the normal side is fine but the magnified side looks like a fun house mirror. It is unusable which is the reason I bought it as a gift. It gives you a headache looking at it.</li>
            <li> absolutely fantastic! As advertised. Thank you and keep up the great service.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice hanging on the wall, very easy to install. Could extend a bit farther, but other than that. Very happy with this item..</li>
            <li> As advertised, easy to install (I was lucky and found a wall stud), quick delivery, and certainly worth the money. Make sure you have enough light in the room.</li>
            <li> Great product at a competitive price!!</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Arm starts to sag a little when it is fully extended. Nice having the 7x magnification on the back side. We put this opposite the main mirror in the bathroom and it allows my wife to see the back of her hair</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT; WELL BUILT, WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and  in perfect condition.  The mirror was easy to mount  and it&#x27;s an attractive addition to my bathroom, especially  since  it frees up counter space.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is a quality product !!</li>
            <li> The screw that holds the mirror onto the arm was in sideways, so the mirror wobbles, and it was stripped, so I wasn&#x27;t able to remove it. The base also doesn&#x27;t fit flush over the mounting plate. Aside from that the materials feel pretty sturdy though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay item, but not good enough, and i am going to replace it (too expensive to return). The quality of the mirror is  poor, and as a result the reflection images look distorted.</li>
            <li> Holes in mount are drilled off center. The wall mount is ok, but the part that attaches the entire thing to the wall mount is off a good 1/4&amp;#34;. You can see  by eye its off. so you can then remount the wall mount the opposite way to compensate so it all works and is straight… try another brand made correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this mirror for the price.  Mounting was very easy, just two screws.</li>
            <li> Solid&amp;Sturdy. Lower joints a little tight and label maker tape to fix the typos on the product box! Probably why it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Cheap good mirror.  Easy to install and shaving is way easier now...My vision is terrible so its nice to pull the mirror in close and not have to squint and trim.</li>
            <li> Mirror was as I expected.  Easy to install.  And looks good.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, when I opened the package, there was this heavy well constructed product! - Sturdy item that&#x27;ll do it&#x27;s job ! Reasonably priced ! Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> This mirror came fast and was just what I wanted, Now I can see all my flaws and wrinkles up close.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 yr. old woman that needed a magnification mirror I could stand up to use. The mirror has been the best investment I have made for myself in a long time! I installed it myself and it was SO easy to do! All hardware came with it and doesn&#x27;t detract from my bathroom decor. Highly recommend it if you are looking for this item!</li>
            <li> Great mirror....Mounts to the wall easily and folds in and out of the way with ease.....</li>
            <li> High quality, easy install.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.  However the hardware, screws in particular were cheap and both broke when I mounted the mirror to the wall.</li>
            <li> Easy install and works great...I may put a bit of WD-40 on the hinge to allow for easier movement but then it might be new and so I will wait a week...</li>
            <li> Great mirror, excellent quality, great price, fast shipping. It is mounted on my wall and I use it every day. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Good mirror. I can see all the wrinkles and bumps on my face. Plus it helps with make-up application.</li>
            <li> FAST delivery, product is all I expected it to be - good quality, easy to mount and does the job</li>
            <li> very well made.  very good price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a simple solution for a makeup mirror in my bathroom. This one is perfect! I love the way it looks and it makes it so much easier to see when I&#x27;m grooming or putting on makeup!</li>
            <li> Looks solid...very nice.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were at a motel that had a mirror like this and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to get her one. This mirror is easy to install. I suggest using heavier mounting hardware. I mounted this one into a stud. It appears to be made well. Double sided... normal magnification on one side and 7x on the other. I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Love the look and the finish, it was easy to mount. My girlfriend loves the fact that it is much easier to put on her makeup. All is good!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality and easy to install.</li>
            <li> Very handy mirror and built nice and sturdy.  I do believe this will last for years...with it hanging up there is no danger of dropping and breaking it.  Love the magnification side also.  I do recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great quality,easy to mount.</li>
            <li> Easy to install (less than 10 minutes) and beautiful design. See attached photo.</li>
            <li> Just as needed - fits the space and moves well.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very good product. It&#x27;s mounts easily to the wall. The swivel is solid and isn&#x27;t loose or anything. The magnified mirror is also nice. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed - easy to install and works great!!</li>
            <li> The 7x magnification makes it so you can not even see yourself unless youre so close to it. Wish I bought the 5x. I didn&#x27;t want to return it once it was mounted. Oh well! Product looks fine.</li>
            <li> Good quality/solid, good price, easy to install!</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these mirrors in the past 6 years..2 for my self and 2 for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;They are well made and are easy to mount to the wall.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Mirror was easy to install and looks great. I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased with it.</li>
            <li> At age 70, I felt I needed to magnify every wrinkle, liver spot, flaccid eyelid and errant hair growth to the max.  Not to cover, hide or do away with any of it, but rather to celebrate all that my aging face represents and to appreciate how far it has come.  This mirror with its 7X magnifying glass serves to perfection my need to marvel in what is a reflection of a happy, optimistic and very grateful image.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! It is beautiful, and truly is a brushed nickel color. I momentarily panicked when I saw the picture on the mirror&#x27;s box, since the color of the mirror on the box was closer to copper than to nickel., but opening the box, I saw that it is exactly the color I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought the identical mirror around ten years ago, with a chrome finish, and it served me really well. I would have loved to have hung it up in my new apartment, but when I moved, I lost a part crucial to its installation. I had hoped that when I received this mirror, I would be able to order that part, and hang my chrome mirror in my daughter&#x27;s bathroom, but I will say that my only complaint is that I cannot contact the manufacturer. I tried registering my new mirror, but the order number I had was not recognized, so I was unable to explore the Deco Brothers website. (Apparently,the website is only accessible if you&#x27;ve registered a product with them.) So, aside from that frustration, I will say that the quality of this mirror is exceptional! I use it to cut my hair, and I can see my entire head by repositioning the mirror. I could not recommended this more strongly!</li>
            <li> This mirror is great!  I needed to add it to the bathroom and theres not much extra room in there.  This mounts to the wall and when folded in, lays almost flat so it is not in the way.  The magnification side is perfect for those of us getting a little older and need a little extra help when applying make up!</li>
            <li> Love the mirror!  Magnification is so much better than my old one. Also it looks and feels so well made.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It exceeds my expectation.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Wonderful mirror!</li>
            <li> This mirror is really great and tight.  Works perfectly in the bathroom, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He really likes it</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Easy installation. Looks great. My wife is happy. Magnification is a bit extreme but other than that all is good. I&#x27;d give 4.5 if I could.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  The wife is happy with it.  It&#x27;s solid, attractive and functional.  My only reservations are 2.  The swivel action is not as smooth as it could be.  Tried to help the cause with WD-40 but it still takes a fair amount of strength to rotate it. The other reservation is that because of the design it doesn&#x27;t seat firmly onto the mounting plate on the wall.  Because you can only hand-tighten it, there&#x27;s a little bit of play.  Other than those things, very happy.</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to get closer to a mirror for make-up and contacts.  Looks great and works well.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Product exactley as described</li>
            <li> Quality item at good price. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this mirror.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! I love it!</li>
            <li> it is easy to mount and is very useful and well made.</li>
            <li> Great product can not live without it.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, and folds up quite nicely against the wall when it is not needed.</li>
            <li> Love my mirror...........don&#x27;t know how I did without it so long. Just so handy..</li>
            <li> works well...good price</li>
            <li> The pivoting joint between the long arm and short atm is way too loose, it can wiggle up and down several  mm. The result is every  time you move it, you feel like the weight of mirror will cause the extension arms to snap. Also, the bottom of mirror scratches on the long arm every time you fold it back against the wall.</li>
            <li> It is a great product but difficult to use if use glasses. The Plus 7 magnification is hard to get used to, but once you do it works well. I use it primarily for trimming my beard</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror...girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. Best addition to my bathroom. I use it every single day. Looks great on my wall and definitely feels like high quality.</li>
            <li> Great quality mirror! Very pleased with this purchase and price.</li>
            <li> Impressive product--very high quality. Easy installation. I&#x27;m thrilled. And I can finally see!!</li>
            <li> The mirror is ok considering the price. There are some imperfections in the mirror glass on both sides. Otherwise it&#x27;s as described. Sturdy enough and easy to install.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this makeup mirror! The 7x magnification is perfect for me. I can see to apply my makeup wihout having to deal with my reading glasses. I&#x27;ve also used the regular mirror side to check the sides and back of my hair occasionally. My husband installed it with no trouble beside the medicine cabinet, and it has stayed sturdy even though I pull it out to use it at least once a day. The only problem I can come up with is that I can now see a lot of what I had been missing before, and it takes me a little longer to do my makeup. I&#x27;m really okay with that!</li>
            <li> This mirror is everything i wanted it to be! Easy to hang, good quality!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to complete a recent bathroom renovation that I did.  Since the new vanity placed the regular vanity mirror a distance from us, we found that for close-up work like shaving and trimming was just too hard to see.  I wanted a wall-mount mirror that we could pull closer to do this type of fine work without straining our eyes.  The regular mirror is great for everyday shaving and the magnifying mirror does the job we had in mind for it.  Now that it&#x27;s been hanging for a while in a normally damp area (what bathroom isn&#x27;t?), it seems that the brushed nickel quality is good and that it will hold up well for years.</li>
            <li> very sturdy built and highly useful. helps me to trim my hair on the back of my head, as well as detailed view through the magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Looks attractive, great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the article because I packed all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Looks great! Easy to install!!</li>
            <li> A perfect mirror....excellent quality and good magnification. Swivels right up against the side wall, where I positioned it so that I could use the non-magnified side to see the back of my head in the bathroom mirror as well. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> performs 100% up to description and expectation</li>
            <li> Very easy to install! Priced right!  Looks nice, and swivels easily enough, but has some tension in it, so doesn&#x27;t swing away from you if you bump it... Perfect!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time! Bought it for a Christmas gift for my mother but I opened up the box to look at it and wow! Very nice quality, heavy, bit bigger than I had expected but my fault for not measuring! The magnification is great for make up applications and such. My dad said he can&#x27;t wait to use it to shave in the mornings so he no longer has to bend over the counter. It&#x27;s a lovely gift! Considering buying one for myself!</li>
            <li> Great product -- just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;And a much better price than what I paid in a retail store for the same thing.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this mirror!!! I have a bad back and even worse eyes, an trying to lean over my sink to put on my makeup, with no glasses on,, was a nightmare! I would always end up with makeup lines, and sore back at the same time! The installation of the mirror on the side wall was so simple, and it fold back flat to the wall so its not in anyone else&#x27;s way,,, I love the magnification, for doing my eyeliner, and tweezing my eyebrows!!! I can look like a woman again, an not be afraid of scaring the villagers when I leave the house! ( no more torches an pitchforks!) LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MIRROR!</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  Clear mirror.</li>
            <li> Nice product, it does the job</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. the 7x magnification is excellent. I mainly use it for contact lenses and shaving. I never thought about it (because stigmatically these are meant for women&#x27;s makeup) until I was at a hotel that had one. I looked into it while getting ready and thought, WOW that&#x27;s useful! So I got one. It&#x27;s groovy.</li>
            <li> Very well built.  Love it.</li>
            <li> easy to install and very classy looking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very solid, well built mirror....but the supplied anchoring screws are totally inadequate if you are mounting the mirror to drywall. Plan on purchasing better anchor bolts to support the weight.</li>
            <li> Great quality mirror. Good instructions. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great quality mirror and very easy installation.  I especially like that the wall plate is a smaller size (compared to others) - doesn&#x27;t require a lot of wall space.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, clean lines and no distortion on the 8x magnification. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  It is extremely easy to mount, it&#x27;s sturdy and maneuvers well to appropriate direction placement on the extender.  The magnification is great for delicate and hard-to-detect areas for make-up application and other uses.  The overall size of the mirror is perfect and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for years and finally got it.  Love it and wish I had bought it sooner.  Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Stylish, sturdy and well made design. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not the fault of the vendor.  I was expecting this to be a longer arm.  My fault for not better researching it.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  Perfect for the bathroom!</li>
            <li> Worked as designed, easy install, sturdy product.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR putting on eye makeup and hubby uses it to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Received it on time.  The 7X mirror is great!</li>
            <li> love the mirror ! good quality mirror</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> JUST what I needed for a small bathroom. Very stylish and practical as well.  The magnification side is ideal for doing one&#x27;s eyebrows.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Husband mounted this at just the right height for me. I can move it or tilt it anyway I want.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror.  The one shortcoming is the steel cover that fits over the studs on the wall mount plate and to which the arm is attached is made of stamped sheet metal rather than a sturdy casting.  As a result, the mounting cover flexes and the mirror bounces.  If a casting or a part machined from bar were used, the mount would be much sturdier.  I did not find any other mirror like this, and don&#x27;t expect to for the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the anchors that come with it. It almost fell out 2 days in. Get some toggle bolts.</li>
            <li> Met all of my expectations and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying my makeup. Hubby installed it easily!!!  Very happy :)</li>
            <li> Love the mirror and out of the way in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> as advertised and very prompt shipping!</li>
            <li> Top quality and easy to install.</li>
            <li> Delivery was speedy and product is just what I was looking for in a mirror.</li>
            <li> perfect for my needs, was delivered fast and secure... no complaints here!</li>
            <li> real nice for what we paid. screws were a little light weight for the size of mirror but i put bigger ones in. very nice.</li>
            <li> I used a mirror like this at a hotel and said... &amp;#34;I need one of those.&amp;#34;  After reading the reviews I decided to give this one a try.  I am very pleased with it.  It was easy to install, the stiff joints (which another reviewer did not like) help to maintain stability in any position and the quality of the metal framework is excellent.  I haven&#x27;t used the magnification yet, but the regular mirror is excellent.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I use it daily for makeup application and blow drying my hair.  I will gladly get this product again.</li>
            <li> I had a mirror like this before (in my old house) but THIS one is much better quality, sturdy!  I call it my &amp;#34;rear view mirror&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s great to have hands free and be able to style the back of my hair.  This may seem silly to say, but I can&#x27;t imagine a bathroom without this!  My other one was from Bed Bath and Beyond - cheapo quality.  This is definitely a good one!</li>
            <li> Easy to install with really nice optics. My wife loves it, but I keep running my head into it - she never folds it back.</li>
            <li> Good product. The swivels are a little tight, but if you will work them some, they will loosen up. I did not use the screws that came with the unit, I felt like they were too short. It comes with drywall anchors, but there again, I didn&#x27;t feel like they would be a secure enough hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an attractive set up as well. The 7X seems to be plenty strong. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> These mirrors are not only awesome in quality, but also exceptional in value! Classy and easy to install. And did I mention that they have a lifetime warranty! You&#x27;d think that I was a salesman for these but I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m just truly impressed with the quality of these mirrors!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and easy to install.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are nearing 50 and our eyesight is not as good as it used to be. In addition to that, our bath room mirror / medicine cabinet can be difficult to see in at times. This side mount swivel mirror is great. I was able to easily mount it to the side of our wall mounted medicine cabinet, and it has been extremely useful. We use it every day.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift to my wife. Installing was very easy and has held up quite well. I had thought that after some use, the mirror would swing loose - none of that so far.</li>
            <li> Fits just where I wanted it to .Very nice</li>
            <li> Works well to put on make-up with the magnifier side, and I like that I can use the other side to see the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my mirror I&#x27;m glad I got it in my has been installed it</li>
            <li> Seems like a high-quality product. Looks good and works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror and very well made..  Getting older I need something with magnification to pull all those wild hairs and this is perfext and it tucks back out of the wah when not in use.</li>
            <li> Difficult to figure where to install it, but now it is terrific.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install on the wall. I used more heavy duty dry wall anchors that I already had (screw in type) which I love and make a project easier to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my mirror installed upside down compared to the picture on Amazon. I like it better that way. The arm is a little stiff, but I rather have it a little stiff to move than loose and wobbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the two knobs on the sides of the mirror. I use that to pull the mirror closer to me. The mirror I had before did not have those and I would get the mirror all full of finger prints and makeup.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  Well made, heavy weight.  Hangs perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great quality, simple to install (I literally own one screwdriver) and great price!</li>
            <li> Super easy to install, great product with good optics. Just as nice as the fancy hotel one I was trying to replicate.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, easy to install, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MIRROR!!!  It is the best; the wall mount is secure, simple, and stylish.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> PERFECT FOR MY BATHROOM.  BOUGHT IT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great. The edges are a little blurry, but that may be normal for a magnification mirror. The extending arm works great and it is made very well.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Looks great and it is a quality piece.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easier &#x27;cause I&#x27;m as blind as a bat.</li>
            <li> Works great. no complaints. Easy mounting.</li>
            <li> Great for the shower.  You can practically mount it anywhere it swings in so many directions.  Looks good also.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife , she loved it</li>
            <li> It was a little tight had to work it to get it to move free other then that great product arrived early and shipped great thanks</li>
            <li> I like it that much buy 2</li>
            <li> love it.best mirror in the house.i brought  2 of them ,my daughter love it too.seen them in a motel in charollettes&lt;br /&gt;ville va.</li>
            <li> Installed quickly and works perfectly! Love it!</li>
            <li> Good quality and great look.  I used a stud finder to ensure I mounted it into a wood stud rather than just in the dry wall.  The hardware that came with the mirror was ample enough for mounting.  The mirror can be adjusted easily and it holds position once adjusted.  It&#x27;s working great forme and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror, easy to mount. The mirror quality isn&#x27;t the greatest but for the price, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it, arrived on time, great deal</li>
            <li> Well made and met specifications exactly.  Came with all necessary hardware (screws and anchors) and very easy to securely mount to the wall.  Looks great!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and a very attractive mirror. I am impressed. It&#x27;s perfect in my cottage bathroom!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking mirror, just exactly what we needed in our downstairs bathroom.</li>
            <li> Easily installed. Easy to manipulate  Good magnification  Fits flat against wall when not in use</li>
            <li> Very nice construction, easy to attach, great value.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this mirror. I have a bad back and a titanium plate in my neck, so leaning forward, whether it be over the bathroom sink or sitting in front of a standing make-up mirror, is painful for me. This wall mounted mirror allows me to bring the mirror to my face, which eliminates the need to lean in to get close enough to the mirror. It arrived on time, was packaged well and was easy to mount to my bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece of merchandise. Large, finely ground mirror, big enough to contain the entire face and then some, has magnification on one side, regular on the other. Extends easily, swivels smoothly, mirror itself turns up and down, and swivels sideways on its base. Extends, or folds up neatly against the wall. I use this for applying makeup, extended out over the sink, because I am nearsighted, and leaning over the sink to get close to the mirror was a hassle. This eliminated that entirely, and it looks just fine, and professional, adhered to the wall at eye level. Finish is nice and subtle, I wish I&#x27;d bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.  Easy to install. But the hinge that&#x27;s welded to the wall plate was welded on crooked.  Not a lot, but noticeable if you look. Faces of the mirror also get dirty quickly because it&#x27;s almost impossible not to touch them when you flip the mirror.  Correction: not a weld...screws.  The screw holes on the wall plate are off center, so hinge itself tilts.</li>
            <li> ok.... this mirror is AWESOME!! kind of upset that it took me this long to find this baby!! i use this in my bathroom for my makeup. i don&#x27;t have a big bathroom or vanity for that matter. and this is such a wonderful convenient mirror! it is very sturdy - very well made- easy to hang. a great product. i also use to see the back of my hair while getting ready! LOVE IT!!!!! &lt;3</li>
            <li> just what i expected. good quality.</li>
            <li> I installed this in my sailboat and it&#x27;s a very nice addition. Some question if this is brass or bronze with a nickle finish. The box it comes in suggest none of that. If it was brass or bronze it would be much heavier than it is and a lot more expensive, so I would say its aluminum with a nickle finish. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t rust in a high moisture environment and it holds it&#x27;s position well with it&#x27;s tight joints. Super easy to install...depending on your surface. The mirror itself is clear and well made.</li>
            <li> Very nice for this price point.  Make sure you drill it onto the wall very well.</li>
            <li> We had to take a pliers to the arm to get it to open but otherwise all is fine Thank you.</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I was looking for. It was very easy to mount (make sure you mount it in a stud).  It&#x27;s pretty heavy because it&#x27;s good quality. Looks good and works great. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as hoped and expected . Easy to install, large enough to use and strong enough to use with out glasses . Would get again and would recommend . Two screw installation took a few min at most.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Excellent mirror. Perfect size, extension, magnification. Perfect for bathroom. Easy installation and goes great with my brushed nickel design. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I needed a good mounted magnifying mirror and this was exactly what I needed. After seeing what others of this same kind go for I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much so I chose this one. It took about 5 minutes to put up (and I am NOT a whiz with tools), feels solidly mounted, works and looks great.</li>
            <li> Item is very high quality - not flimsy at all.  Very attractive, easy to install and just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This was easy for my son to hang on the wall. It&#x27;s right next to the big bathroom mirror and now we have this handy mirror for close work or seeing the back and sides when trimming hair or haircoloring. I love it!</li>
            <li> It does not look nice, function well. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It was everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be based on the positive reviews.  It was just what I wanted and needed!  I must add that the finish is especially nice.. a satin chrome finish.. subtle and lovely.</li>
            <li> easy installation (I am really not handy and never done anything like this before), but you do need a drill and screw drivers for installation. arm is not as long as I would have liked but I knew it from the description and got it anyway since it is very hard to find another one with longer extendable arm within a good price range.</li>
            <li> Solid, sturdy mirror of good quality. The mirror stays in place at whatever angle you adjust it to, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the mirror.. I&#x27;ve had no issues with the swing arm.. The quality is very good for the price I paid..</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertized and looks good in the bathroom. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Very good mirror need it to apply make up very happy</li>
            <li> Love the mirror. Works great and looks very elegant.</li>
            <li> Great value. Shipped promptly, arrived in perfect condition, and installed easily.</li>
            <li> Very good, does what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this and is perfect in the bathroom...</li>
            <li> Sturdy product. Easy to install. I love that it lays flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> This is so useful! Us, uh, mature ladies may need a little help since our eyes are a little, uh, mature to see well enough to put makeup on. This doesn&#x27;t get in the way sitting on bathroom counter, doesn&#x27;t get knocked down, and was easy to put up. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Easy to install. Works great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised!! Great quality and easy to install. Wonderful value (many $ less than BBB in store option that I already own). I recommend this product without reservation.</li>
            <li> This an excellent wall mirror for the bathroom.  It is very easy to install&lt;br /&gt;which only took two screws.  My wife likes it because it can be installed&lt;br /&gt;for any height level. I might buy another mirror for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very nice item,  got it for my very short 95 yr old Mother-in-law, she loves it.</li>
            <li> We use this every day.  So convenient and the mirror is crystal clear.</li>
            <li> I needed an accordion mirror in one of my rental units because the sink is placed directly under a window.  Therefore, the only option to have a mirror over the sink was to have an accordion mirror.  After reviewing all of the mirror&#x27;s on amazon, I opted for this one. It&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t swivel very easily - this was a pro in my opinion because I don&#x27;t want my tenants swinging the mirror to and fro haphazardly.  Instillation was very easy and came with a couple sizes of screws and drywall anchors. The first step into screw the metal brace into the wall. Once that&#x27;s in the mirror and cover plate go onto the metal brace and the two screw knobs screw into the metal brace.  No matter what I tried or how tightly I screwed the knobs the cover plate wiggles back and forth.  The mirror wouldn&#x27;t come down by any means but it was disappointing after paying $26 for what I thought was a more quality mirror that it isn&#x27;t more secure.  Otherwise, my tenant is very happy and says the magnification on the one side is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these mirrors at hotels and loved them. I wanted to be hands free to apply make up all the times so I ordered one and it works great. My husband installed it on the bathroom wall behind decorative towels. I just pull it out to use and fold it back against the wall when I&#x27;m done. It is highly magnified compared to my hand held mirror.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Super Easy installation.</li>
            <li> Five stars! Right price and nice look! Elegant and beautiful color. Goes with any bathroom decor</li>
            <li> the mirror is quite clear,  works great on the wall and is easy to use.  great for detailing makeup!!!  great price</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my bathroom. I was having a hard time holding my mirror and applying my makeup, now I am hands free and I can actually see! More powerful than my 5x hand mirror.</li>
            <li> Great addition to our bathroom.  We use it all the time for shaving, make-up and contact lens installation. Frame, swing bar and mounting bracket are heavy gauge.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mirror for all my beauty needs.  My husband purchased a very expensive mirror. I hated it. He tried again.  Hated that one too.  I purchased the DecoBrothers mirror myself.  It is sturdy, simple, the magnification is perfect, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Much bigger and sturdier than I expected for the price.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Surprised by how attractive the accent screw bolts are.  Nice and heavy.  The 7 X was just what I needed and you cannot beat the price for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mirror for my make up. I am putting it up near a window for optimum daylight and love that t retracts back far enough to be out of the way. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> The Deco mirror is a quality product and easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had purchased a similar item from Loews and found it to be less than what we had hoped for on a number of aspects.  The quality of the DecoBros mirror is excellent and the 7x mag is substantially better than most you will find available for a higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TJO</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror: flawless surfaces, good magnification, solid frame and hardware. Very easy to install.</li>
            <li> I just got this mirror and I love it, great quality easy-to-use and easy to install I highly recomend.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> This mirror showed up under shower mirrors. I had planned to mount it right out side the shower and rotate it in when I wanted to use it. It is NOT a shower mirror. It fogs up very fast. Good mirror other wise</li>
            <li> A well made product, large mirror, VERY strong so you see every line you didn&#x27;t want to know about, however, great for putting on makeup.  I love the sturdiness of the arm and its flexibility.  Folds up nicely against the wall.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and looks pretty decent. I decided to use larger drywall anchors than the ones provided but not sure it was necessary.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror! The metal is very sturdy feeling. It was easy to install and the mirrors are great. The magnification side is just what I wanted and does not distorted at all, up close.</li>
            <li> Works great! It was easy to install and folds flat against the cabinet I mounted it on. It looks great and the mirror quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and very easy to install.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror and it was very easy to install. All of the screws and anchors are in the box as are the instructions. The arm is a little stiff and takes a little effort to move. But it seems to be quite sturdy and the magnification is great</li>
            <li> Very well made, but very stiff to move which may lossen up over time.  Also 7x magnification is too much and would recommend going no higher than a 5x.  From a qualility standpoint it is great but stiff.  The 7x was my choice and is not a reflection (no pun intended) on the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> excellent mirror for attaching to wall above sink to put makeup on, especially eye makeup, Good value</li>
            <li> I love everything about this wall mirror!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mirror if you just want something quick to use for make-up, etc.  I would recommend mounting it directly in a stud!!! It is very hard to bend and if you use the Sheetrock screws provided, I have no doubt you&#x27;d inadvertently remove it from the wall!  But it suites my purposes and arrived in a timely manner.  Not bad!</li>
            <li> This mirror was quite easy to install. My husband had it hung up in a few minutes.  It makes putting on make up super easy.  When I am finished using it I easily fold it up out of the way,but handy enough for the next use.  I am so glad I purchased this mirror. I had been using a hand held mirror,but with my wall mount mirror both my hands are free.  Wish I would have purchased this years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this for shaving. Great value for the price. Nickle blends with our faucets and it only took minutes to mount it. Next step is to mount an LED light above to try and get more downward light.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mirror!  Looks good and easy to install.  My only concern/complaint is that the screws and anchors will not hold this mirror to the wall.  You will need to screw directly into a stud with longer screws in order for this to hold.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, no issues.</li>
            <li> Great for no hands looking at rear of head</li>
            <li> Mirror was easy to install. Very reasonably priced. Good value!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely magnification mirror; it makes my bathroom look like a spa.  The close-up mirror is perfect for makeup application and getting out those little irritating pieces of fuzz that make my contact lenses feel so rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation instructions are very good.  I would recommend that anyone installing this mirror put the base into a wall stud, although the instructions also instruct how to use wall anchors in simple drywall.  The whole thing is strongly made and rather heavy.  Make the extra effort and get a stud finder (pretty cheap at any hardware store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is better than expected, a true nickel finish, very easy to install. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> Great mirror for the price, easy to install.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, good looking, good quality, easy to install, shipped promptly and arrived in good order.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the screws are neither phillips or flat head. They are rectangular, perhaps european.  I&#x27;ll have to find an appropriate tool to mount this.  Then I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to install works great.  Finally a mirror I can use to put on makeup and pluck random chin hairs without my glasses</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and size. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase one of these mirrors for some time now. I hesitated because the price was low, I thought it might be poor quality. I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase this one, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product, quality, service, delivery and price.  It&#x27;s just what my wife wanted!</li>
            <li> This is georgous!  It is substancial and it looks and feels (weight wise) just like a more pricey one.  I used a mirror like this at a hotel and just had to have one.  I am glad I bought it and wonder what I did without it!</li>
            <li> Works and looks great. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend brought me this mirror for my birthday and I love it.  The wall mount swivel is just a great ideal.  Thanks DecoBrothers.</li>
            <li> Just what I paid for and fast shipping</li>
            <li> (from the Video Guy&#x27;s wife Joan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the mirror.  It folds up neatly against the wall, and when I need it, it comes right out smoothly and easily.  Great for eye makeup, brow plucking, and any other plucking that might be needed.  (I&#x27;m of an age where I get unwanted &amp;#34;sprouts&amp;#34; from time to time.)</li>
            <li> Bought this as I am getting older and can&#x27;t see to put on my eye makeup anymore. I had been using a little suction cup cheapie magnifying mirror when I happened upon this little guy. It was reasonably priced, easy to install, and has been very sturdy so far (have been using for several months now) It folds up flat against the wall so it&#x27;s not in the way. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and it works just great, was easy to install and looks great!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it -- magnification is what I wanted; product is a very nice quality!  Also came exactly when promised.</li>
            <li> Love the mirror, arrived on time and packaging was very well done.. Thanks</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase! It literally took less than 5 minutes to install the mirror and I am very satisfied with this product. It shipped rather quickly, and I would surely purchase another item from Deco Brothers.</li>
            <li> Just received this and it is just as described.  I wanted something a little bigger than the small mirrors and more than the 5X magnification of most mirrors.  It is just large enough and the 7X magnification is just right.  It installed easily and extends out more than most.  Best of all, it was half the price of other mirrors I had looked at in retail stores and on line.  And, it looks just like the more expensive ones.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect. My second mirror.</li>
            <li> awesome!!  Love it! Easy install, cane promptly.</li>
            <li> Great mirror &amp; price!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than big box stores, seems sturdy and well designed.  Easy to install.  Happy.</li>
            <li> Could not be happier! Easy to use, looks expensive compared to ones I looked at in Lowes and its 1/2 the cost! love love love.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for the price.  The fit and finish are perfect and it is very sturdy.  The mirror arrived fully assmbled and includes screws to attach to the wall.  Lowes wants $40 for a comparable mirror so this is a great value.  I will purchase more items from DecoBros in the future.</li>
            <li> It works. Arrived before delivery date.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to mount on the wall, I purchased this mirror because I use glasses and wanted to see clearly what I am doing when applying makeup to my eyes. For me it is not easy to see myself clearly without moving either my face or the mirror.</li>
            <li> It has just the right magnification &amp; looks great in my bathroom. It was very easy to install. I like the length of swivel because it was not short.</li>
            <li> Great buy, easy install</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife.  It works great for her and it was very easy to install.  I recommend a power drill to make installation as easy as possible.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mirror for the price. Well made and no distortion in the mirror at all. Mounts to the wall with minimum effort.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Great value</li>
            <li> Elegant design and very easy to install. Item comes with lifetime warranty.  7X magnifed side is excellent for attention to detail. Chrome finish fits my bathroom style.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality product and the best deal around...the mirror looks great in my bathroom and looks like it cost a lot more than it did!  Very happy!!!</li>
            <li> I love it already, great looking, strong. Can&#x27;t wait to put on the wall.</li>
            <li> This mirror is so easy to install, it took just a couple of minutes. The mirror works great too. The magnifying side works great for getting a close up look at my eyebrows while plucking and other facial grooming that I need a close up look for. The standard size is wonderful too. The hardware is beautiful. I love the finish of the metal. I am so glad I bought this after reading other user reviews. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice, basic wall mount mirror.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, great seller. Thanks</li>
            <li> In one word BEAUTIFUL.  Looks like it cost much more than it did and is perfect for anyone who needs glasses to actually see to put on makeup and (I guess), to shave.  One of the nicest mirrors I have seen and at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love the magnification of mirror; hung on my wall easily and I am very pleased with product.  Arrived on time</li>
            <li> Solid construction, not flimsy at all. I was happy with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Great ! Just as listed</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. The arm was mounted on the wall plate a little off-center, but that slight imperfection is something I can live with.</li>
            <li> Like the idea of having 2 different size mirrors (regular and magnifier) however, you really have to make sure you find a stud to place the mirror on the wall.  A little heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror, easy to mount, seems to be well made. I was able to mount it on the side wall of the bathroom sink and use it to view the back of my head in the full mirror. It would have been nice to have a longer arm but it still works great. Mounted it at a height my wife was comfortable with, and it still works for me to shave with. Seven times magnification seem adequate, shows you everything you don&#x27;t want to see, hairs, pores etc. Going to buy another for the guest bath.</li>
            <li> Mirror is perfect for anyone who needs reading glasses.  Easy installation.</li>
            <li> This mirror is excellent. The finish is flawless, the joints are tight and it&#x27;s easy to mount with all hardware included. More important, my wife loves it. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Mirror is attractive looking in nickel finish, definitely looks like a more expensive mirror. The 7x magnification is perfect for makeup. I am used to 10x magnification for close work., so worried that 7x would not be enough- it is plenty, and distortion is much less. No waves or irregularity in the glass.&lt;br /&gt;The hollow wall anchors were useless for mounting because the mirror is heavy and must be secure to move during use. Unless the studs are exactly where you want to mount it, you will need to address this issue. I replaced the provided screws with 1/8 x 2&amp;#34; toggle bolts, which worked perfectly through the sheetrock. One problem I encountered: The shaft where mirror arm attaches was a little loose and a bit off perpendicular, so I had a heck of a time mounting it plumb until I realized this. An easy fix to tighten it up, but I had already put several holes in the wall, confounded at first that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it up straight using 2 levels. I ended up mounting the unit upside down (with arm above mirror), and repairing the original holes in the wall. It actually looks better this way. Just make sure everything is tightened up and you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> Delighted with quality and style of this mirror. Clean design and mirror images are not distorted. Glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these mirrors and they are great quality!</li>
            <li> I love it!  The  mirror is a little larger than what I was expecting, but it is sturdy, tucks away nicely, and clears counter space!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and well made.  Only negative is it is a little stiff when trying to extend it out.</li>
            <li> We love the mirror! However, the picture on Amazon that we ordered it from appeared to be brass/gold looking.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror we received was chrome. Not sure what the mix up was, but we decided to keep it anyway.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mirror.  It works great for me, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror, very sturdy and stylish.</li>
            <li> This is such a clever invention. It&#x27;s so great to have a 1x and powerful 7x mirror you can use hands free, that can be brought out at varying distances from the wall, and that swivels. All the joints are tight, so the mirror will stay at the angle you choose and wherever you move the swing arm, it will stay put. The mirror was easy to install, and folds nicely out of the way when not in use. I chose the pewter finish, which is very attractive and works with our decor. Very nice product!</li>
            <li> The mirror was delivered on time and in great condition. It is built with sturdy materials as the description mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other wall mount mirrors in the past, but the DecoBros 8-inch Two Sided Swivel Wall Mount Mirror is the best that I have had. I was easy to mount with a minimum of effort. Sturdy and not wobbly as some can be.</li>
            <li> great mirror my wife uses it for makeup every day</li>
            <li> Excellent quality mirror at a wayyyyy bargain price. I love the 7x magnification, though it&#x27;s a bit scary seeing my pores up so close!! Highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Perfect mirror for my needs.  Shipped quickly. Well made and packaged well.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great - just as advertised!</li>
            <li> Looks good and great value for the money!  It works just like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected, mounted easily. Operates well. I mounted it right next to the mirror over the sink. Warning: mirrors don&#x27;t lie, don&#x27;t use the zoom side unless you can handle the truth</li>
            <li> Easy to install great magnification fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the mirror. Only draw back it is very tightly connected at the joint closet to the wall and I am afraid if I don&#x27;t hold the base down when I extend it out that it would rip off from the wall.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how well made this mirror is for the price. The swivel is stiff enough to hold the mirror in place at any angle yet loose enough to move the mirror in any position you want. The finish and the construction are visually appealing and make it look like a more expensive brand. The 1x mirror is very clear with no distortion, and even tho the 7x mirror has a slight vertical distortion on the edges it does not hinder its use whatsoever since my focus is entirely on my image in the middle of the mirror, and my image in that central area is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am extremely pleased with this purchased and would not hesitate to buy another product from this manufacturer again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product with great cost! Stylish and very durable.</li>
            <li> As described. solid construction. good image with magnification. Seemingly comparative good value. others as much as $20+ more.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks good,</li>
            <li> I really like it but it came in the wrong color that why the 4star only</li>
            <li> Nicely made and the mirror is a good size, I wish the magnafide side was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Easy to hang, although I used different screws because we have plaster walls.</li>
            <li> I did look for the high-end wall mirror which I used in a hotel and really liked, but I checked the reviews out for this inexpensive one. I don&#x27;t usually buy the least expensive choice, but the reviews looked good.  As per the reviewers&#x27; comments about the tight hinges, I hold the mounting plate when I move the arm so it doesn&#x27;t compromise attachment to the plaster wall.  It&#x27;s just as good as the one I used in the hotel.  Very nice mirror - wish I had it years ago!</li>
            <li> Lovely Mirror with 7x magnification. Sturdy and easy to put up. Stays where I put it and a great make-up mirror.</li>
            <li> Love it! I relieved my product on time.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!  Couldn&#x27;t get ready with out it.</li>
            <li> Elegant looking....Goes great with any decor in Bathroom.</li>
            <li> Quality product - about as much magnification as you would ever want.  Mounts easily, sturdy.  I like it.  Mine doubles as a hand towel rack too.</li>
            <li> When a woman needs reading glasses she needs this mirror. Easy to install, the magnified side gives a close up view of those clumps of mascara the regular side has you miss. Very good looking and easy to adjust. Recommend highly</li>
            <li> Very nice for the money!</li>
            <li> Excellent value.  Quality is quite good and at the price paid I could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror and now I can see the back of my head when styling my hair.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good mirror. The mirror surfaces are good optically, and 7x is plenty to see facial imperfections! My only complaint is that the extension arms are very stiff to move around. I wonder if the stiffness will stress the wall mounting in time.</li>
            <li> This was perfect fit for me, just the right size, easy to install (just two screws to the dry wall). the silver finish goes well with other products in my bathroom - so no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great value. Handsome and well made.</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Quality, sturdy product. I installed it so I can see the back of my head to color my hair. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  Very sturdy and a bit larger than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Very fast delivery. Mounted it very quickly and now my life is a lot easier with this mirror.</li>
            <li> If your bathroom is well lit and you don&#x27;t need or want a lighted mirror with the hassle of wiring or a plug this is the way to go. It is simple and elegant and of great quality - especially for that price! It comes with anchors and screws and takes less than 5 minutes to install.  And it is anti-fog, so it&#x27;s clear way before the vanity mirror dries. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. Always wanted one.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  7x&#x27;s was ok, could have used 10x magnifying.</li>
            <li> Super sturdy, very heavy duty and the mirror quality is clear and the magnification is a god send. I would advise my friends and family to buy it, in fact I bought one after using it in the bathroom of my mothers home.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my wife for Christmas and she loved it. Pretty sturdy construction and was easy to mount. One thing that is a bit off however, is the left and right connections at the mirror aren&#x27;t quite level.</li>
            <li> Price was fair considering what dept. stores were charging and a good product.</li>
            <li> Great product,  just do wish it was engineered to move on 3 planes. All its missing is a range of motion on the Y axis. The tilting mirror does help though.</li>
            <li> A+ buying experience.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Much better than the one it replaces.  And for some reason it doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower, where it&#x27;s mounted.  I like what I see in it as well - me!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and fits perfectly in the space I had.</li>
            <li> The mirror looks just like it does online, and fits well with the decor in my bathroom.  It was easy to hang and it has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly nice mirror.  EASY to install</li>
            <li> Perfect!! My wife loves it. Shipped fast. Easy to install.</li>
            <li> We just installed it this weekend. It was easy to i stall. Looks great.  Mirror swivels ro regular and 7x magnification. Has a swivel arm to better move mirror. I&#x27;m hsppy.</li>
            <li> Mirror is very sturdy, clear, and looks great in my new bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works great. Looks great</li>
            <li> Well made, good quality mirror. Did not supply mounting screws (no biggie). 7X magnification is a little over the top, but hey i don&#x27;t use it my wife does. Simple install and it looks like it will last, that all I care about.</li>
            <li> Very handy in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this mirror.  Sturdy construction and a great look in the Master Bath.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived quickly.  It&#x27;s a bit stiff once mounted but the quality is good and it&#x27;s nice looking, a great size and very useful!</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  Was way to mount to the wall and the long arm with hinges help to get the exact angle you desire.  It also folds back up to rest flat against the wall out of the way when not in use.  Looks great at dime store price.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I *love* this mirror! I saw a similar one in my hotel room, just had to have one for home. This is one of the cheaper ones available, and its a great deal. It has a very nice nickel finish, which I was super happy about. The way it mounts on the wall is very easy and super secure. I kinda wish I had gotten a 10x magnification instead of 7x, but its certainly adequate. Overall I am super happy. Delivery was very prompt as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Item is as described, looks high quality and is easy to install.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product. Compared to many other sites I looked at the price here was much lower. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love the mirror!  Service was great! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the mirrors!  Installation was easy. Looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> My husband installed this mirror in the bathroom, near the existing mirror over the sink.  The combination of the two mirrors is very helpful for trimming hair on the back of the head.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, used different screws than provided to anchor into stud. Wife is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I was looking for. Installed easily and works perfectly. The two different magnification mirrors really help. Product quality is also much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Swings out easily, and the magnification is just right for applying eye makeup and tweezing the brows. Nickel finish matches the fixture finishes in our bath nicely. Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Works well in my bathroom.  The quality looks great at the price.  The handle was a little hard to move at the beginning, but after I moved it back and forth for a couple minutes, it became smoother.</li>
            <li> This mirror is better than I expected for the price.  The glass is good and the mechanism is tight, sturdy and well finished, it also comes with screws and wall anchors for mounting.  I recommend mounting to a wall stud because the unit is heavy and the swing arm is a bit stiff and does require a little effort to position for use or storage.</li>
            <li> Met expectations. Good quality, sturdy mirror. Arms are a bit stiff, but will probably loosen up over time. Great mirror for the price. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> GREAT mirror!  I am sending it back!  Don&#x27;t like the wrinkles I am seeing on this almost 80 year old face!&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t know they were there!!!  Shucks!</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations. I suggest mounting the plate either into a wall stud or strong anchor. Other reviewers note the stiffness of the articulated hinge, but we think that&#x27;s a good feature.  The mirror is nice, no apparent distortion on the magnifying side; the plating is good quality. Recommended, and a good value.&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> On bathroom wall now.&lt;br /&gt;Once on wall became primary mirror and most used ( full length and cabinet are others ).&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it. Quick delivery and well packed.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t need to wear foggy glasses in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Drill or punch in two holes in wall, and two screws and you are done.</li>
            <li> Exellent quality and design!</li>
            <li> Stylish and well made!  I wish I had bought it sooner!  Makes getting ready soooo much easier and doesn&#x27;t take up precious counter space like my other mirror did.  Love the quality--it moves when I need it too, and stays in position when I need it too.  Sleek and pretty to look at.  I happily use it every day.  Even my husband uses it. ; )</li>
            <li> Great price, decent quality. The hinges are difficult to move and even with machine oil and lots of manipulation, they are still too tight.</li>
            <li> Five stars because this &amp;#34;was&amp;#34; a beautiful mirror. Unfortunetly I had to return it. I&#x27;m 56 and guess I need a 10x magnifying glass because I was having to use my 2.50 reading glasses to get that perfect up close image I was hoping for. Oh the joys of getting older:)</li>
            <li> perfect for what i wanted and wanted to pay!  can&#x27;t complain about anything...</li>
            <li> Looks very nice on wall, not cheap looking, VERY easy to install, 1x side is perfect - no waves or distortion, and 7x side shows EVERY detail clearly.  I have good eyesight, but the magnifying side does a much better job at finding stray eyebrow hairs than my eyes alone can.  One star taken off for stiffness of moving parts (doesn&#x27;t work itself any looser) and for the tiny flaws my good eyes can see at the very edge of the mirror (almost under the nickel colored surround).</li>
            <li> I have one already and needed another one and these are great..I like it to put on my makeup and the magnifying side is good also.</li>
            <li> The mirror was easy to install. Exactly what I wanted with an affordable price tag.  Shipped quickly with no problems. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice product great price. Good for birthday or Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> I searched quite a bit before finally making my purchase of this two-sided swivel wall mount mirror.  I saw the reviews and was impressed, but to be honest, I was having a hard time believing that the mirror would be as good as the reviews claimed--especially since the price is so reasonable!  This was the least expensive two-sided swivel wall mount mirror I found and the reviews were good, so I decided to give it a try.  And I&#x27;m glad I did!!  The product is a very good quality.  It was easy to install (be sure to install in a stud).  It&#x27;s very attractive and it looks like I paid a lot more for it.  I have zero complaints and highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for it!</li>
            <li> The mirror is better than it looks on the pictures. Nice finish and quality. Installed in just five minutes. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Looks good. Nice quality (sturdy). Easy to mount. Tip: I initially had trouble mounting the mirror flush on the wall. The packaging includes a little cardboard insert in the piece that mounts on the wall. This is there for protection, should be removed before installation.</li>
            <li> EZ installation and the mirror is fantastic. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality! Great value.</li>
            <li> All good, what I expected.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It serves her purpose when she does her hair , etc.  The nickel finish goes nicely with our bathroom fixtures.</li>
            <li> Simple unit, worked well, put together sturdily.  No problems!</li>
            <li> High quality product, well designed, easy to install.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Just what we needed.  A quality product</li>
            <li> My wife loves this makeup mirror.  She uses it all the time when applying makeup.  It works well and was very easy to install.</li>
            <li> easy to install and good x factor</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this item. Also a great price.</li>
            <li> Attractive and in my case easy to mount as it was on a wall stud. The magnified mirror works very well when you get used to it - just find the right distance for viewing. Great value.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.  Good quality, right finish for brushed nickel and easy to in stall.</li>
            <li> Sturdy design, great finish and color. Looks more expensive then it was. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very well made and I like the magnification.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, sturdy and well made. Looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase. The brushed chrome finish on the mirror is high quality, it took minutes to install, and the swivel arm seems very sturdy. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great quality and great price. Delivery very timely.</li>
            <li> As advertised, good quality, strong extension rods and mounting bracket, does not sag when extended. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and good magnification. Folds right up against the wall so perfect for our very small bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 becasue I was hoping for polished nickel instead of satin nickel.  And, because I agree the mirror is tight.  However,  if you position it the way you like to use it, then just swing the whole arm back (instead of folding it up) then it works great!!  It&#x27;s the short arm that&#x27;s tight, so I don&#x27;t move the short arm, just the long arm.  In fact, it makes it quick and easy to use because when I pull it out, the mirror is all set for me.  For the price, I&#x27;m thrilled!  Yes, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> I experienced using a similar mirror while on vacation. I had been using a small magnification mirror that was suction cupped to my mirror. The one I used on vacation spoiled me, so I went on a search for one that wasn&#x27;t curved, but flat.&lt;br /&gt;This was perfect and so easy to install. I could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Mirror came right on time and in perfect condition.  Was easy to mount on the wall.  It does everything I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> works great no issues.</li>
            <li> I like the mirror size of this one and since the bathroom is well lighted, I did not need a make up mirror with a light.  It was simple to install and adjusts nicely.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror. Very attractive, sturdy, and useful.  It&#x27;s large diameter might be a problem in some locations, but gives me a very clear field. Adjustability and stability in different positions is very good.  Both my husband and I like the 7X side for personal grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that stud-finding is necessary and limits where it can be put, because of the weight. One solution is to install a decorative horizontal design element secured to the studs, then use that to attach the mirror. We decided not to do this after all, but thought about it in placing the mirror. We put it on the opposite side of our (small) bathroom from the main mirror, and it works well to look at the back of the head.  In a larger bathroom that might not work as well.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Been wanting one of these for along time, don&#x27;t know how I got along without it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful mirror.  The hinge on the extension arm is so stiff that it is nearly impossible to extend the arm.  If I mount this to the wall, the pressure required to extend the mirror will likely cause the mounting to loosen and detach within a few months.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  the product was as described and easy to install.  It is a good product.  The only problem is that 7X magnification is a bit much for me - but that&#x27;s on me.  I will probably reorder a 3X</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Hope they like it.</li>
            <li> Nice and works great.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice shaving mirror for my bathroom, and this one is working out just fine. Easy to mount (I was able to find a wall stud to drill into) and a good size for shaving. My only concern is that the hinges are very stiff at first, making me worry that pulling the mirror out to use it could exert too much pressure on the screws mounting the mirror to the wall. No problem with the mirror screwed into the stud, but I wonder if the same would be true using anchors in drywall.  The hinges seem to work more smoothly and easily over time.  A good purchase, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for tight spot in my bathroom! Affordable and easy to install- love it!</li>
            <li> nice looking item, bit ca,e apart the first week from it&#x27;s mounting base... I was able to put it back together.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, well made perfect magnifier for my vision .</li>
            <li> Very sturdy item, with great adustability. Easy to install. Much nicer than the hotel mirror that prompted us to buy this.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just what I was looking for.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> This mirror was as good if not better than what I expected. It went up on the wall w/o any difficulty. Excellent product. It arrived quickly as well. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product with an easy install. Good price, very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonder mirror and looks pretty too. It&#x27;s a little stiff when you first get it. But, loosens up over time.</li>
            <li> Really happy with my magnified wall mirror, it&#x27;s very well made and very sturdy, I love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful mirror.  Solid construction.</li>
            <li> Good mirror.  Looks and super zoom</li>
            <li> Handsomely crafted, smart design, great tool for the bathroom .</li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror at a good price. When folded in? The profile is very slim. Easy to install snc the metal is pretty true to color to the picture.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. We stayed at a hotel with a similar mirror and I loved it. I have a great deal of difficulty seeing my face up close because I am so very nearsighted. I have been trying to lean over the sink to get close enough to the mirror to apply make up around my eyes. Not anymore. Wish I had found this mirror a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;Item came quickly, price was food, quality excellent. I love it!</li>
            <li> Well made mirror, good quality &amp; very nice nickel finish goes well with my nickel fixture.</li>
            <li> I have two of these mirrors and love it.</li>
            <li> Great quality and so easy to install.  Sturdy mounting hardware. 7X magnification is wonderful.  Pleasant surprise to find such quality these days.</li>
            <li> Works great! As described..</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy; easy installation and good quality product. Shipment arrived quickly as promised. A good add on to your bathroom if you are looking for a decent shaving/make-up mirror .</li>
            <li> This product is very well made, and the mirror stays in the position you place it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is well put together. The nickel finish is nice. The hinges are tight. Great Product!</li>
            <li> well designed and easy to install</li>
            <li> Nice product, does exactly what I wanted, and looks good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t appreciate receiving spam for feedback requests. If I had known my email would be inundated with feedback requests I would not have purchased this item.</li>
            <li> Just as the picture shows, it is even bigger than I imagined which I am glad about! And it fits in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very well built, nice and heavy material was used for construction.  Extremely easy to hang, my wife loves this and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES THE NEW MIRROR!</li>
            <li> The magnification is seriously powerful.  You can see things you probably don&#x27;t even want to :)</li>
            <li> Good flexibility makes it very useful in my small, studio apartment. Easy to install.</li>
            <li> This mirror has been in great addition to our bathroom. I see better to put makeup on. My husband sees better to shave. Mirror enhances the light in bathroom. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  I liked the first one so much that I bought one for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> The reviewers who reported how solid and well made this vanity mirror is were correct. It is a far better value than similar mirrors that cost over twice as much. Installation was easy and quick.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent piece of craftsmanship. It is well built, certainly will not wear out any time soon. I would buy this again if needed, and if anybody that views this review is in question about this product, do not worry, it&#x27;s worth it, buy it!</li>
            <li> easy to  install and very sturdy - great buy</li>
            <li> Quick delivery &amp; very well made unit.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to use in our new home. She has had a couple of such mirrors of different brands over the years and this one is a standout. It came well-packaged and damage-free and includes all the hardware you&#x27;ll need to install it.There is good detail in the fit and finish of this product - and, for the price paid, the overall value is superb. You can certainly pay much more ($$$) for a wall-mounted mirror - but I doubt you&#x27;ll get as much \\&quot;bang for the buck\\&quot;.  The arm joints are a bit stiff straight out of the package - so I would suggest you try to anchor the base to a wall stud if possible since  I&#x27;m not sure the small plastic wall anchors would survive long in daily usage otherwise. Bottom line though - my wife loves it - and that&#x27;s what REALLY matters!...</li>
            <li> used other hardware to install ,looks great and my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed.  Now i can put my makeup on without my eyeglasses.</li>
            <li> This mirror hit every need for me when searching  for an affordable wall mirror. Easy to install, and great for when I put on makeup, tweez my eyebrows and need at extra closeup.</li>
            <li> Good mirror, nice quality. It&#x27;s stylish and even has screw covers. It looks great on the wall. Such easy access too! It&#x27;s been working well just as previous reviewers had described, that is why I got this one. These kind of mirrors can be so pricey. This one was in my range. I love using it because one side is 1x, so I don&#x27;t need my glasses to do make-up. The other is 7x for when you need to get a look real close-up for those perfectly placed eye liners or lip liners, etc. You get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;There does seem to be a slight blur on the 7x when you look at a certain distance. I don&#x27;t find it to be a real problem. I just move it in or out a small bit as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this mirror because of the quality received for the price.</li>
            <li> Beautifully designed and does a good job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price wife says she doesn&#x27;t know how she lived without it</li>
            <li> Nice. Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, nice finish and quality build. I have dual vanity&#x27;s in our bathroom so I think I will order one for the other side.</li>
            <li> This is PERFECT!!!! Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Good quality, looks great.  Has good amount of extension and functionality (swivel/tilt), but folds neatly against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> Love it better thin I imagined  it was gana  be.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with purchase!</li>
            <li> great! Great product and great seller.</li>
            <li> Well made and easy to install.  Looks great and functional.  Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> This is just what my husband needed to see how to shave without the need of his glasses. He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> Not very heavy but it will serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just what I was looking for in my newly remodeled bathroom. I was unable to find the nickel finish in home improvement stores. This is a high quality durable and heavy mirror. hoghly recommend.</li>
            <li> We love it - my husband can shave in the shower with no mess!!</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  Nice and clear and easy to mount.</li>
            <li> This mirror was a gift and it was a tremendous hit with the recipient. She loved it, installed it herself (easy) and now cannot imagine preparing for work in the morning without the use of this wall mirror with the 7x magnification.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  Mounts easily and has a nice, contemporary look. I&#x27;ve priced others of similar style and they are $10-15 higher in price.</li>
            <li> Everything it says it is</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who LOVES it.  It looks great in the bathroom, it functions well with the magnification and it arrived on time as stated.</li>
            <li> Solidly built, perfect size, fits well on the bathroom wall...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  Easy to install and so handy.  It is the best! and very good quality for the price!!</li>
            <li> Mechanically, the mirror arm and dimensions work out nicely.  The mounting is easy.  The finish is not high quality, but, most would find it acceptable.  If you need a wall mounted magnified mirror, you likely won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this years ago.  This is a really well made, quality piece.  We got it on the wall in about 5 minutes.  Very attractive item too.</li>
            <li> Well made and works as expected.</li>
            <li> great mirror and very good price mounting it was very easy</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  I love the telescoping arm.  It fits great!</li>
            <li> Returned item, was supposed to be chrome but was brass.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this mirror.  Love the 7x which is great for eyebrow tweezing.  Good value.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described. As mentioned, it is tough at first to move the mirror but seems to loosen up with time. Also, the quality of the mirror is excellent. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  Have had it up for a couple weeks now in a very humid (at times) bathroom and it is holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> Person who received mirror very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time</li>
            <li> Nice mirror but has a couple of spots of corrosion on the finish.</li>
            <li> I had a wal mounted mirror that was pretty flimsy, and broke.  This one is great!  Not only is it the perfect magnification, it tucks away against the wall when not in use.  Perfect fo my needs.</li>
            <li> Well made very sturdy exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Quality product</li>
            <li> Solid and beautiful, I love it!</li>
            <li> Very well made and a good price too!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Great mirror, great price!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, one side regular the other side 7X magnification. I was able to hang it up on my wall easily and in less than a few minutes, the only issue I had was with the dry wall in my bathroom. Would recommend drilling the hole first.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! Very well built, it is not sloppy against the wall, and doesn&#x27;t bow down when fully extended.</li>
            <li> Great mirror as expected in description. Secures nicely on bathroom wall, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> nice clean looking  not too big .</li>
            <li> Works great. Very sturdy. Love how it fits flush with the wall and I pull it out to put on my make-up.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Easy to install and looks great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great looks really nice I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  Just as described.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality!  Very well constructed and is getting daily use:)</li>
            <li> Love this swivel mirror.  I need the reverse image to braid my hair.  Mirror is just what I needed</li>
            <li> This mirror has the look and feel of a higher end mirror. Note that the 7X magnification is a higher magnification than most magnifying mirrors. That is what I wanted. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE the space saving feature of this mirror!!  The functionality of it is 5 stars but the magnification of the mirror is weird.  When you are up close to it, it has a distorted magnification around the sides, it&#x27;s really irritating.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror.  It looks great and was very easy to install!</li>
            <li> The mirror came quickly and was exactly as described, and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Good price, decent quality, installed easily, packed well.  Meets wife&#x27;s needs for a face mirror.  I laugh while she plucks.</li>
            <li> The fit &amp; finish is great but the 7X mirror side is poor quality in my opinion, you have to be just right looking into it for it to be in focus! Not the quality as my 2 previous mirrors.</li>
            <li> We had to return, not due to product quality, but it didn&#x27;t fit where we wanted to install it. Very good product however.</li>
            <li> Very nicely constructed, functional mirror, works just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love love love this mirror!!! Best buy on Amazon yet!!</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful mirror. I recently repainted my bathroom and this is the perfect accessory. It arrived in perfect condition. Thank you for a quality piece of work!</li>
            <li> Love it! Looked great and affordable.</li>
            <li> Very nice mirror. It was a gift and was exactly what she was looking for!!  Very good quality. Would definitely buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> a well made product ..but a movement ia a bit stiff.&lt;br /&gt;It may wear to become less stiff and will wait and see.&lt;br /&gt;overall a good item for the money.</li>
            <li> It looks more expensive than it was.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Well made, easy to install, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for</li>
            <li> We have three mirrors of this type. Paid 40-60 dollars each for the others and this one at $20 was every bit as nice as the others. The mirror is clear and without distortion and the swivel arms are snug and hold their position. A great find at the price.</li>
            <li> I replaced a broken 5x mirror with this. The optics are much better on this one. It&#x27;s also 7x, so I can see really well. It&#x27;s bigger than I really needed, but that&#x27;s a small matter. We mounted it on a stud. I can position it easily. It looks good, and was about 35% cheaper than similar mirrors. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these mirrors.  One for me and one for my Father who is 89 years old and having difficulty inserting eyedrops used in treating his glaucoma.  The product is very well made and beautiful too.  The 7x magnification is wonderful and the mirror was easy to install.  The nickle finished looks great and I like that it folds up out of the way.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this expanding mirror is easy to mount.  He has a clear image mirror on one side and flips easily to the magnification side.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and a very sturdy mirror!</li>
            <li> I really made a great choice when I purchased this item!  As I get older it gets more difficult to get my 3 sets of pierced earnings in easily. This is a great addition to my bathroom. Also much easier to apply makeup, tweezers eyebrows etc. I would recommend this product to anyone! The price is reasonable also for the value.</li>
            <li> The mirror is excellent -- perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great finish and perfect size! easy to mount!</li>
            <li> Shows facial features better than the lighted mirrors. Very good product; easy installation.</li>
            <li> 5 stars! Love it. Easy to put up, good quality, fair price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my motor home so I haven&#x27;t used it much.  A snap to install.  Can&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work fine!</li>
            <li> Too heavy; doesn&#x27;t swing easily; the 7x magnification is too much.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, beautiful mirror. The finish is pretty and the bracket is very sturdy. I was able to hit the stud and glad I did. Since it is so sturdy, you need to give it a push to fold it back to the wall and needs the stability of the stud.</li>
            <li> Great mirror. My better half loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!!  Even though it shows every wrinkle, hair, etc. on my face, it helps with applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install (5 minutes) and exactly what I was looking for to free up counter space in a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror. I can&#x27;t believe that I waited so long to purchase it. It&#x27;s very sturdy and well made and it&#x27;s easy to put up. It came quickly and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Beautiful mirror that blends in with our décor.  The magnification is perfect and flawless.</li>
            <li> Product is very good quality. I like the flexibility of the arm to move in different locations and angles. Didn&#x27;t realize how great the &amp;#34;7X&amp;#34; magnification would be!! I can sure see more detail than I expected! Item was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Meets my needs and appears durable.</li>
            <li> Easily mounted on wall of very small bathroom; extends to provide the extra magnification sometimes necessary yet folds back into place to take up very little space.</li>
            <li> Very nice mirror, looks great and it&#x27;s very sturdy. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Very easy to hang and made beautifully to cover the screws. Love how you can pull it out and move it around to get it in the perfect lighting. The magnification is perfect for seeing those tiny hairs for plucking. When folded up it is flesh against the wall so it&#x27;s not in the way. Love this!! The finish is beautiful also.</li>
            <li> Product looks and works fine.Some reinforcement needed for wall mount,used different screws .</li>
            <li> I had purchased a standing mirror from a store and hated how it couldn&#x27;t be adjusted. I returned it and ordered this one instead, and installed it the day it arrived. Super easy install, looks great, and it&#x27;s a clear image. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror under $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;Good size mirror with nice finish.  It is very sturdy and well made.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This mirror was great for the reason I needed it - just the right size, tilt, swivel, and magnification. Just a bit of WD40 to loosen up the hinges, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Well made and easy to install</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Good quality, size. Easyiinstall.</li>
            <li> very good -as advertised</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Mom. She loves it! It was exactly what she was looking for. It was also a good price for this type of mirror.</li>
            <li> Great mirror at a great price.  Easy to install and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Mounted easily and the magnification is fabulous. Love it!</li>
            <li> This mirror is a great value for your cash. It moves smoothly though a bit on the tight side. I suppose this will loosen a bit after much use. The glass is clear and magnification is very good.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror.  I was away on business and the hotel I stayed in had a mirror like this is the bathroom and I had to have one at home.  Especially if you don&#x27;t have a sit down vanity in your bedroom or bathroom this is perfect for applying your makeup .</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months now and it is great!</li>
            <li> When I first bought the mirror, I was a little nervous that the quality would be sub-par because it costs so much less than similar products.  However I am pleased to say that it is a sturdy, attractive product that is easy to install and functions perfectly.  I am thrilled with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Just had installed.  Magnification is great.  4 stars instead of 5 at this time only because the &#x27;swivel arm&#x27; is tight - hopefully this will loosen up in time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for at a decent price. color is brushed nickel and matches perfectly with my fixtures.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what the quality would be for the cost and was amazed!  So happy to have this... better than being in a high class hotel and in my own bathroom.</li>
            <li> This mirror looks nice and is up to my expectations. The only negative thing I can say is that we had to mount this to plasterboard, and the metal wall anchor sets recommended for this type of mounting were not included.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product as pictured. Very sturdy makeup mirror. Great Price!</li>
            <li> great product, especially for the price. Fast shipping too, can&#x27;t beat it. Hinges are a little stiff but they may loosen over time. I mounted with ez anchor drywall anchors instead of the ones that come with it to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t rip from the wall while trying to move the hinges back and forth and it works great, feels solid to the wall!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, functional and sturdy. Love it!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was good quality...I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> The magnification was a more than I expected, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll appreciate that as I age.</li>
            <li> I love it! You would never regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using &amp;#34;cheater&amp;#34; glasses to apply my makeup. With this wall mounted magnified mirror, I don&#x27;t need the glasses. This is a very convenient way to get ready in the morning and it looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the wife wanted at a reasonable price compared to what was available at the local stores.  Classy look and good build quality.  I&#x27;d recommend buying heavier duty wall anchors.  Had some that I bought from HD that supported 50lbs.  Mounted the mirror onto the anchors and the wife couldn&#x27;t be happier - allows her to put on her contacts without having to lean way over the sink to get close enough to the vanity mirror.  The size is nice and she was happy with the magnification.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend loved it.!!! extremely easy to install</li>
            <li> Installed easily, was exactly what I was looking for.  The mirror arm is mounted slightly crooked on the plate, so it looks a little crooked on my wall.  Had I been paying attention, I would have adjusted for it when I mounted it so it wouldn&#x27;t be quite so noticeable.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter since it&#x27;s in my master bathroom and my husband and I are the only ones that see it!  Otherwise, great product, sturdy, and does the trick!</li>
            <li> Very high quality and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and didn&#x27;t have to leave home to get it!  I have one in every bathroom of my home!</li>
            <li> This mirror was better than I expected. Beautiful quality that went perfectly in my newly remodeled master bathroom.  Excellent item and very affordable .</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, it was easy to install and looks great.</li>
            <li> Well built. Very good product for the price. Make sure when installing, anchor to wall stud.</li>
            <li> Great mirror!  So versatile, with a great magnification.  Nice silver nickle finish.  Simple to install.</li>
            <li> Good product, seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for the place needed. Also a great price!</li>
            <li> Great mirror. Easy to install and very good-looking. It is sturdy, too, and matches our brushed nickel hardware in that bath. Definitely a good buy, and significantly better quality than those we saw in the brick &amp; mortar shops.</li>
            <li> Love it...I can put my makeup on a lot easier with the magnified side.</li>
            <li> Surprised at the weight and sturdiness for the price!  Love this mirror!</li>
            <li> Simply fantastic!...bought two for my bathrooms.  Mounted nicely...looks great and yes sturdy.  I am very pleased at this little handy addition to grooming.  Truly a must have and reasonable.</li>
            <li> excellent product - thank you</li>
            <li> Easy to install and seems to work well. 7X may e too much as you need to get pretty close for it to come into focus.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this mirror. Construction and materials are high quality. The arm is sturdy and extends a good length. Those that commented the magnifying side &amp;#34;was like a fun house&amp;#34; are wrong. The amount of distortion is small and the sharp area extends almost the entire width. Looks very nice on my wall and with good lighting in front of where I placed it, I don&#x27;t miss the ring lighting of the other lamps in this category.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great and easy, easy to install.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I am so happy to have this mounted in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It fits well in our bathroom. Its size and magnification go well together for our use. The price is inexpensive, yet its quality does not yield at all to those that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - easy to install, looks &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> Clear, rotates well, good magnification, sturdy, and attractive.</li>
            <li> I use my mirror everyday and I love it.  It was such a chore trying to put my eye makeup on in the mornings, but with the magnified side of the mirror applying my eye makeup is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Sturdy.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband mounted my mirror as soon as it arrived.  Now I can see my eyebrows to pluck them accurately.  The mirror is beautiful and highly functional.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. Seemed great.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  It is so much sturdier than my last one and has greater magnification.</li>
            <li> Great product and a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for the price!</li>
            <li> My husband said this was easy to install, and I love it for putting on my eyeliner and plucking my eyebrows, makes everything so much easier to see with the magnified side! Plus I can pull it closer to me if I need to. A must for any woman&#x27;s bathroom. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> It is a great product at a very reasonable price. My wife loves it. One minor flaw preventing it from getting 5 stars: the hinge near the wall was much too tight for normal use and it took me a bit to fix that. I ended up taking out the screws behind the back plate and spraying some silicon lubricant in the holes. Then, looking in the bottom hole, I saw that if you can take off the bottom &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; of the hinge, there seems to be an adjustment screw for the tightness of the hinge. Did not try that, because I had already fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> The mirror was easy to install and looks great. I think it actually saves me time getting ready for the day. Plus it adjusts easily and it magnified just enough for me to see without my glasses. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Product delivered as description was written.  It was super easy to install and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived in a timely manner. Unfortunately the frame was completely scratched up on one side. the arm is very hard to move. Besides that it looks like a great product.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly - Price was right - Quality item - very pleased overall:&lt;br /&gt;I spent a good deal of time looking for something like this, mostly online, but also a few box stores.  I found one for a lot more money with a  &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; finish which appeared to be the &amp;#34;chrome over plastic&amp;#34; often used in auto interiors - not built to last.  After much consideration I purchased it on Amazon marketplace.  It came in a matter of days, and by Priority Mail which made it happen, no doubt.  I was OK with the price when I bought it, but more than OK when I received it, and it was a lot less than some.  What impressed me was the quality and I don&#x27;t impress easily - and seldom write reviews.  Pleasantly surprised might be a better choice of words.  I was careful not to buy junk, but considering the price it was WAY better than I expected.  I purchased the nickel finish.  It has a good look.  The movement is tight and appears to be made to stay that way.  The mirrors are excellent, but be sure you know what you are looking for in magnification. I chose the 7x magnification, thinking it was mid-range.  Maybe it is what I was looking at, but I was seeing far more than I wanted. me.  I am not sorry I went with 7x, but 5x might be a consideration for some.  If I ever need to find a spec of dirt on my eyeball I know where to start!</li>
            <li> Nice mirror to have in a bathroom with very limited counter space.</li>
            <li> The mirror is good quality and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  Wish it had a little more extension but beside that, love it!  Good magnification!</li>
            <li> The mirror looks great, has excellent magnification, easy to mount hardware and quality brushed nickel.</li>
            <li> I love my mirror! Makes it really easy to do my make up in the morning instead of trying to lean clear into the mirror in front of me.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! My husband loves it too! As I got older I had to lean over the counter to put my makeup on and it got uncomfortable, especially now that I had a major surgery on my abdomen. My husband got me this mirror and I use it daily. It&#x27;s the little things in life that matter!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my husband who likes to take care of his skin.&lt;br /&gt;The review mentioning dust on eyeball was not joking! This mirror works too well. It shows things on your face you have happily never noticed before.&lt;br /&gt;My toddler loves it too, she wants to see the big herself all the time.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has easily installed it and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived quickly in good condition. Just what I wanted. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The concavity of this 7X mirror is so extreme the only place I envision it would be of use is in a funhouse.  When you use the magnification side of this mirror, there is an area in the center about one-inch in diameter which is not too distorted to use.  It does not matter if the mirror is 8 inches wide since you can only use that center inch.</li>
            <li> Excellent, high quality, heavy duty mirror. Nice magnification. No distortions that bother me. Very nice bargain. Packaged well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror and another (Modona MR01-A) - for two different bathrooms in our new home.  This mirror is FAR SUPERIOR to the Modona.  The DecoBros is less expensive, looks better, moves smoothly, and mounts MUCH more securely. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  Just like the one at the hotel on vacation.  Very nice finish. Love it!</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted and it arrived early.</li>
            <li> Mirror was exactly as described. Seems to be of good quality. Have mounted on the wall next to vanity in master bath, and so far am very happy with it. Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product and the service was excellent. The mirror arrived intact and very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it---just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it seems well made and my wife uses daily</li>
            <li> Much nicer than expected. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love love this mirror, does more than i thought. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> replaced another brand that had broken. All mounting hardware seems fine, would not use molly bolts enclosed, go get larger ones. Works great otherwise.</li>
            <li> Looks good and installed easily.  I only wish the magnification was 10x rather than 7x.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mirror.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever made up my face without it.  I installed it on a wall by my vanity and made sure it was on a stud inside the wall.  I pull it in and out so much, I am not sure how well the installation would hold up if it was not on a stud.</li>
            <li> Bought this about 7 months ago, and it has help up nicely. I don&#x27;t really use the side with magnification. Feels very solid and well made. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works ok but the mirror isn&#x27;t mounted to the wall plate precisely.  So, when you mount the bracket perfectly vertical, the mirror actually swings out at a downward angle.  Poor workmanship.</li>
            <li> Very nice, as expected.</li>
            <li> Solidly constructed, nice appearance, easy to install, good value, and delivered on time.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. The magnifying side is great, almost too good. Too many wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  It was easy to install.</li>
            <li> I just installed it two days ago, but it seems up to par with the one I bought feom a local store for my other bathroom, only this one was about $14 less.  The finish looks good with my other bathroom fixtures.</li>
