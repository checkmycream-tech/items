            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I have used many foundations before but most come off throughout the day.</li>

            <li>, I used to date, an I&#x27;ve tested a lot of foundations, its not spotty or orange like its true to color and blends well</li>
            <li>, I have a box full of bottles that I tried to use as a replacement.</li>

            <li>After it was discontinued I tried many other brands.</li>
            <li>it was really good.nice covering ,easy to apply..and long lasting.</li>
            <li>However, the first time I wore it outside, it completely melted off my face.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred 107 over 106, but glad to find this at least.</li>
            <li>They are both natural beige</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beoming harder and harder to locate this product as it is no longer sold in most stores.</li>
            <li>I was barely sweating and all of it came off.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s beoming harder and harder to locate this product as it is no longer sold in most stores. It&#x27;s too bad, as I have used it for about 30 yrs. Max Factor is still sold in overseas market but for some reason, no longer in US.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred 107 over 106, but glad to find this at least.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. A messy child porn case banded the sale of max factor, for the plaintive s family. So they started Max. Feel bad for the families involved.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to buy this in my perfect color (107) but I&#x27;m happy to be able to get this product at all! Love Amazon!  I&#x27;ve stocked up on this, getting it while I still can.  I wears so well all day and is aptly named.</li>
            <li> ireally like max factor product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its really annoying not to have&lt;br /&gt;such product in us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope it will be in the shelve soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like the product</li>
            <li> Best foundation, I used to date, an I&#x27;ve tested a lot of foundations, its not spotty or orange like its true to color and blends well</li>
            <li> This is great foundation. Wonderful coverage-if you have redness or acne-this foundation covers it beautifully! Seller is great. I always get compliments on my make up.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on the wife and she likes it. She&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy. Will bite her on the butt very soon!  Delivery on time.</li>
            <li> Love this make up.  I always go back to it &amp; have used it foe years.  Since I can no longer find it in the store, Amazon is my go to place.</li>
            <li> they stopped making this...why I&#x27;ll never know..it was really good.nice covering ,easy to apply..and long lasting.Won&#x27;t be able to get when this is gone.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup for any skin type.  I have oily skin and it goes on with a matte finish and is long lasting. Would recommend to everyone. Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Wish I could buy locally. Always used this product</li>
            <li> This is suitable with my skin. no allergy. suitable color as well. it&#x27;s hard to find a cosmetic which is matched with your skin color.</li>
            <li> on time very satisfied</li>
            <li> This is a nice light make-up that goes on smoothly and feels great.  Especially nice on very hot days.  It does not feel like its melting off.</li>
            <li> No comments at all,  original items perfect response and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this foundation for 20 years. The quit selling it in the US several years ago, I have a box full of bottles that I tried to use as a replacement. Thank goodness it&#x27;s still available in England!!</li>
            <li> It always happens, when you like a product something changes and you can no longer it get the brand or the color.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I have used it for years.  The color that I prefer is no longer manufactured but this is a close match.  Don&#x27;t know why Max Factor stopped US sales but I surely miss the product.  Glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation for 10 years. Covers well and feels light as though you have nothing on. In hot weather I need touch ups.</li>
            <li> I have used many foundations before but most come off throughout the day. This foundation is easy to apply, blends in well, and matched my skin tone. However, the first time I wore it outside, it completely melted off my face. No joke. I was barely sweating and all of it came off. I tried this with and without primer and still had the same result. Lasting performance? The longest it performed was an hour. I guess I&#x27;ll stick with Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse, which won&#x27;t rub off or melt off my face and blends in well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve neve been able to find a foundation that works as nicely as this.  It covers wonderfully, stays on, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
            <li> My mother (85 yrs old) used to use this product and was absolutely unable to find it. I found it here, and ordered her 5 bottles right away. If she&#x27;s happy ... I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I guess Max Factor is no longer in business, so I was very happy to find this excellent product that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor makeup for years and years. After it was discontinued I tried many other brands. No matter what I tried nothing gave me the coverage I wanted. I finally ran out of the 5 bottles I bought when it became unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Blush. The one disappointing thing with my order was I bought 2 bottles and they are not the same shade. They are both natural beige but you can tell if you put them side by side,one is lighter than the other. Oh well I will make the one that is more orange work by mixing it with the lighter one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years, and was always completely satisfied.  Now they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores any more, and I am delighted to be able to find it online.  I just hope it doesn&#x27;t disappear again.</li>
