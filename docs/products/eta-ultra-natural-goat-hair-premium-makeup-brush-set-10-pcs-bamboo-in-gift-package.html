            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>LOVE these ETA brushes.</li>
            <li>They are the most softest brushes I could ever hope for.</li>
            <li>:)</li>

            <li>love each tool it came with&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok so lets start from the beginning.</li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased with my brush set..</li>
            <li>â€‹Im in love with these brushes....</li>
            <li>but I must say am glad I have this.</li>
            <li>These are truly the best value brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought,  and I&#x27;ve been experimenting with brushes for about 15 years (!).  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality -- especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love my brushes.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;These are on my wishlist for sure.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>I really love my brushes.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I took my time to write this review, as I wanted to make sure that the brushes won&#x27;t start shedding after couple washes.</li>
            <li>i really like many of the brushes!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set - would make a great gift too.</li>
            <li>super soft and places make up on face flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I have flawless application, compared to a popular &amp;#34;eco&amp;#34; set with synthetic bristles that I had purchased for my daughter which sometimes catches a little on a cheek or on some moisture on her eyelid.</li>
            <li>Or the smell of fresh dye!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whenever I 1st got it once I removed it from the plastic packaging it had a Very strong chemical smell but don&#x27;t worry clean it</li>
            <li>It is great quality and very soft.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of the brushes.soft and smooth feeling</li>
            <li>They wash well and more importantly</li>
            <li>There is no shedding, the initial smell is not bad at all, and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The other brushes are excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash them with shampoo or brush shampoo.</li>
            <li>By far, these are the most superior brushes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for good quality brushes, but on budget.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash the canvas case, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I used brush shampoo and was fine afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Just wash them with dove soap or baby wash and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>and they clean easily.</li>
            <li>Upon recieving these brushes and unpackaging them, there will be a light smell.</li>
            <li>Easy to Clean</li>
            <li>They give a flawless look especially the flat top kabuki when applying liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>that I have them in hand and can see their quality and their gentle but effective application</li>
            <li>They arrived today and I love them, they are so soft and nicely made.  </li>
            <li>Such good quality and so $$$ cheap!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and there is a good combination of brush types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many,  but loved only a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She loved how soft they were and how they spread her make up.</li>
            <li>I have used many professional brushes and popular brands like Sigma, Mac, Real Techniques, Sonia Kashuk, but I have found these brushes to be great quality and they even beat the quality of some high end brushes I use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely these brushes!!!</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied!!</li>
            <li>Normally she shops for brushes at Sephora and found the quality of these to be even better than what she had been paying much more money for.</li>
            <li>Got these babies a week early and from what i can see and feel they are exceptional.</li>
            <li>Several of my friends are makeup artists or cosmetologists who gave me several recommendations and when I showed them my brushes they were so impressed by them that they all wanted some more brushes and were jealous of the ones that I had.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a travel case since I do travel a lot, all for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet, however, I&#x27;m very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about them.  </li>
            <li>My wife enjoyed the gift and told me it was better than her old Mac Brushes.</li>
            <li>this by far is my most favorite one.</li>
            <li>I was super excited once I received the brushes.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>I love my brushes so much.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice but it&#x27;s too soft for me, to allow the definition I want.</li>
            <li>The brushes work very well, but what I am most pleased with is that they do not shed and that they are very plush.  </li>
            <li>This set is a very good quality for the price, especially being natural goat hair.  </li>
            <li>I love my new brushes!</li>
            <li>There is nothing skimpy or cheap feeling about these brushes, and real hair DOES make a huge difference in how they feel and how polished the end result is.  </li>
            <li>When I have brushes that I can clean easily my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much and</li>
            <li>Nothing a quick wash couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Do wish some of the face brushes were a bit bigger but overall am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>The case seems like it will last awhile, it rolls up nicely and compactly to fit in luggage or a purse.</li>
            <li>I do wish the face brushes had one larger more full coverage brush but overall a great product.</li>
            <li>In love with my new brush set.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the bag, there was a strong chemical smell which went away after I washed with gentle soap (Dove).</li>
            <li>I am satisfied, they are well made bamboo handles and very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>but they are still exactly I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Will probably stick with MAC, they last along time and are better quality!</li>
            <li>They give flawless application and are soft yet firm.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about ordering these because although good, this product only had 4 reviews.</li>
            <li>The brushes are shipped nicely, each brush is individually wrapped and placed inside of the cloth brush carrier.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect such nice brushes for that price.</li>
            <li>What everyone said about them being super soft and not shedding is true!</li>
            <li>I received my brushes right away after ordering them.  </li>
            <li>I have tried some ULTA brushes and several other beauty brushes but these are very reasonably priced and I have been impressed with the quality and the service.</li>
            <li>These are my first natural hair makeup brushes, and I love them.  </li>
            <li>When I opened them up this afternoon I was pleasantly surprised to find these brushes are insanely soft and lovely!</li>
            <li>I washed them many times and not a single hair fell out.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great the only thing is we wished there was a bigger powder brush in the set</li>
            <li>Soft bristles are easy to use.</li>
            <li>They were delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>With a little care they will last a good long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Great for relieving rectal itch...</li>
            <li>There was Definately a funny smell from the packaging-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most likely not going to buy from ETA again and won&#x27;t recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>They seem to be very well-made!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be order more products from BeautyezShop.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for anyone who is into cosmetic art!!</li>
            <li>They did have a smell when I first received them, however, after machine washing the bag and hand washing all the brushes, the smell seems to be gone.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is to make the bag a darker color -- this would do a better job of hiding makeup that gets on the bag from the brushes.</li>
            <li>But I guess that&#x27;s really my issue not the brushes!</li>
            <li>Pretty good brushes, but it think I expected to like them more based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the flat kabuki</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used about half of them, and they&#x27;re soft and seem to do a very good job.</li>
            <li>because otherwise come the New Year my two adult daughters will suddenly have gorgeous brushes and I&#x27;ll have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to clean and minimal shedding.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how they are going to perform in the long run, but as of today, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I bought these after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I just got this set in the mail today, and at first impression I am really liking them.  </li>
            <li>They are soft, full, and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>only Con I have is that the brushes weren&#x27;t labeled, but this is an easy fix--- just look it up and match the shapes to the names of the brushes or go to images on google , Bing i,or just ask a friend.</li>
            <li>They are very high quality</li>
            <li>Very high quality material.</li>
            <li>High quality and super soft!</li>
            <li>but my first impression is that these are high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are made from real hair and so they are easy to clean and maintain with a little bit of shampoo without falling apart or damaging them.</li>
            <li>So very soft!!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Much softer than anticipated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and neatly packed.</li>
            <li>I like these so much</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable of the quality of the brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really lose with these</li>
            <li>I feel I pay too much for this set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I used them before my sister did, haha</li>
            <li>They really make a difference when applying makeup&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t washed them yet but they seem to be very well made</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>After opening the package I immediately noted that the set looks very high-end.</li>
            <li>The person that received the brushes really likes them.  </li>
            <li>Once I am able to give them a test run (once my face calms down from hot wax), I will update my review.</li>
            <li>They do have a strong chemical smell when first taken out of the package, but I used non alcohol wipes to clean them vigorously, then let them dry and air, and the next day the chemical smell was gone.  </li>
            <li>All the brushes are very useful for daily and intricate make-up application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to makeup, but I knew I wanted a set of non-synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft to touch, and they look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I have used other brushes that seem to provide better coverage.</li>
            <li>was a little hesitant to believe that a really good quality set could come at such a reasonable price,  but the hesitancy was for naught.  </li>
            <li>They are soft, which is nice, but they shed so badly that it overshadows anything good that I may have had to say.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first set of natural hair brushes</li>
            <li>They do have a bit of a chemical whiff when first opened but that disappeared completely after about 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>although i use these brushes as well as other larger headed brushes such as the all over the face brush just because i prefer face brushes to be bigger but everything else is perfect.</li>
            <li>The chemical smell upon opening was alarming, but after a quick washing with dr. bronners peppermint soap it faded right away.</li>
            <li>My new favorites!</li>
            <li>One thing to point out is that these brushes are for sure synthetic (all have the duo fiber (works wonders with foundation and blending in general even powder products) and definitely not natural hair.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and they don&#x27;t hogg my products!</li>
            <li>, I will highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li>I have couple high end sets.</li>
            <li>All came in a neat little canvas roll up case which I think is very cute and matches with the wooden</li>
            <li>Really are professional</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe that I can buy a whole set of natural hair brush for this price.</li>
            <li>I just received these and haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they are very well made and soft.</li>
            <li>For someone who is learning what each brush is and what they do, it would be nice if it included a description of what each brush was (or at least an photo on the product page).  </li>
            <li>, I know they are well worth the $40 for someone who applies makeup regularly and wants natural materials in their cosmetic routine.</li>
            <li>The brushes are high quality and are very soft.</li>
            <li>There was no scent that didn&#x27;t seem normal for new brushes.</li>
            <li>It almost smells like new shoes.</li>
            <li>I have been using these brushes for about 4 months now, have washed them 3x and they are still like brand new.</li>
            <li>unfortunately i live in Canada and ordered them off the amazon.com</li>
            <li>The brushes are very compact, elegant and very well made, I.e. they do not lose hair, have no glue traces or unpleasant smell and are great for everyday use!</li>
            <li>Very soft, non-synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>They are very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many brush set in the past and</li>
            <li>Like mentioned by other reviews, you have to clean the brushes to get the chemical smell out.  </li>
            <li>When I used new brush it glided softly on my cheeks with no itchy sensation.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked was a black holder verses an off white holder so the dirt won&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li>Brushes i have a hard time with, i love a value, but i know the importance of quality.</li>
            <li>They are really soft and I do like the carrying case.</li>
            <li>so soft</li>
            <li>They are the softest brushes I have ever used, pick up color and brushes it on seamlessly</li>
            <li>Soft bristles</li>
            <li>really sensitive skin and my blush brush from MAC always gave me an itching sensation.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I purchased these, as they are made of natural hair.</li>
            <li>The only brushes that I don&#x27;t really use much are the smaller eye shadow brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes were soft.</li>
            <li>but they do not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from natural hair and bamboo.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>Definitely professional make up brush quality.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased and will definitely order other products by this brand!</li>
            <li>For those who are fans of high quality cosmetic brushes, I would totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I waited and waited for these to go on sale, having looked high and low for a makeup set that had natural/ethically sourced materials for the handles AND the brushes AND the case.</li>
            <li>I try to steer clear of synthetic bristles simply because they are not delicate enough; no matter what the producer claims, I can always tell the differenceâ€¦</li>
            <li>I just received mine today, I was looking for a set of makeup brushes that I would actually use and that are soft.</li>
            <li>but I wanted ACTUAL soft brushes</li>
            <li>Did I mention they are softer than my Mac and Bare Minerals brushes and don&#x27;t shed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have 1 natural hair powder brush similar to this</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s really into the whole make up thing and always complained about her brushes.</li>
            <li>When reading other reviews, I assumed they&#x27;d be soft but not this soft!</li>
            <li>finally found an unused set for $25, and I pounced as an early birthday present from my husband to me...</li>

            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of bristles on each brush, so they are not floppy, which is great.  </li>

            <li> I am beyond pleased with my brush set..</li>
            <li> â€‹Im in love with these brushes....</li>
            <li> but I must say am glad I have this.</li>
            <li> These are truly the best value brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought,  and I&#x27;ve been experimenting with brushes for about 15 years (!).  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality -- especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I love my brushes.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;These are on my wishlist for sure.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> I really love my brushes.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I took my time to write this review, as I wanted to make sure that the brushes won&#x27;t start shedding after couple washes.</li>
            <li> i really like many of the brushes!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set - would make a great gift too.</li>
            <li> super soft and places make up on face flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I have flawless application, compared to a popular &amp;#34;eco&amp;#34; set with synthetic bristles that I had purchased for my daughter which sometimes catches a little on a cheek or on some moisture on her eyelid.</li>
            <li> Or the smell of fresh dye!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever I 1st got it once I removed it from the plastic packaging it had a Very strong chemical smell but don&#x27;t worry clean it</li>
            <li> It is great quality and very soft.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the brushes.soft and smooth feeling</li>
            <li> They wash well and more importantly</li>
            <li> There is no shedding, the initial smell is not bad at all, and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The other brushes are excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash them with shampoo or brush shampoo.</li>
            <li> By far, these are the most superior brushes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for good quality brushes, but on budget.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash the canvas case, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I used brush shampoo and was fine afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Just wash them with dove soap or baby wash and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> and they clean easily.</li>
            <li> Upon recieving these brushes and unpackaging them, there will be a light smell.</li>
            <li> Easy to Clean</li>
            <li> They give a flawless look especially the flat top kabuki when applying liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> that I have them in hand and can see their quality and their gentle but effective application</li>
            <li> They arrived today and I love them, they are so soft and nicely made.  </li>
            <li> Such good quality and so $$$ cheap!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and there is a good combination of brush types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many,  but loved only a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She loved how soft they were and how they spread her make up.</li>
            <li> I have used many professional brushes and popular brands like Sigma, Mac, Real Techniques, Sonia Kashuk, but I have found these brushes to be great quality and they even beat the quality of some high end brushes I use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Normally she shops for brushes at Sephora and found the quality of these to be even better than what she had been paying much more money for.</li>
            <li> Got these babies a week early and from what i can see and feel they are exceptional.</li>
            <li> Several of my friends are makeup artists or cosmetologists who gave me several recommendations and when I showed them my brushes they were so impressed by them that they all wanted some more brushes and were jealous of the ones that I had.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a travel case since I do travel a lot, all for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, however, I&#x27;m very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about them.  </li>
            <li> My wife enjoyed the gift and told me it was better than her old Mac Brushes.</li>
            <li> this by far is my most favorite one.</li>
            <li> I was super excited once I received the brushes.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes so much.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but it&#x27;s too soft for me, to allow the definition I want.</li>
            <li> The brushes work very well, but what I am most pleased with is that they do not shed and that they are very plush.  </li>
            <li> This set is a very good quality for the price, especially being natural goat hair.  </li>
            <li> I love my new brushes!</li>
            <li> There is nothing skimpy or cheap feeling about these brushes, and real hair DOES make a huge difference in how they feel and how polished the end result is.  </li>
            <li> When I have brushes that I can clean easily my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much and</li>
            <li> Nothing a quick wash couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Do wish some of the face brushes were a bit bigger but overall am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> The case seems like it will last awhile, it rolls up nicely and compactly to fit in luggage or a purse.</li>
            <li> I do wish the face brushes had one larger more full coverage brush but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> In love with my new brush set.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the bag, there was a strong chemical smell which went away after I washed with gentle soap (Dove).</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, they are well made bamboo handles and very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> but they are still exactly I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Will probably stick with MAC, they last along time and are better quality!</li>
            <li> They give flawless application and are soft yet firm.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about ordering these because although good, this product only had 4 reviews.</li>
            <li> The brushes are shipped nicely, each brush is individually wrapped and placed inside of the cloth brush carrier.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect such nice brushes for that price.</li>
            <li> What everyone said about them being super soft and not shedding is true!</li>
            <li> I received my brushes right away after ordering them.  </li>
            <li> I have tried some ULTA brushes and several other beauty brushes but these are very reasonably priced and I have been impressed with the quality and the service.</li>
            <li> These are my first natural hair makeup brushes, and I love them.  </li>
            <li> When I opened them up this afternoon I was pleasantly surprised to find these brushes are insanely soft and lovely!</li>
            <li> I washed them many times and not a single hair fell out.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great the only thing is we wished there was a bigger powder brush in the set</li>
            <li> Soft bristles are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They were delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> With a little care they will last a good long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Great for relieving rectal itch...</li>
            <li> There was Definately a funny smell from the packaging-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most likely not going to buy from ETA again and won&#x27;t recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> They seem to be very well-made!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be order more products from BeautyezShop.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for anyone who is into cosmetic art!!</li>
            <li> They did have a smell when I first received them, however, after machine washing the bag and hand washing all the brushes, the smell seems to be gone.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is to make the bag a darker color -- this would do a better job of hiding makeup that gets on the bag from the brushes.</li>
            <li> But I guess that&#x27;s really my issue not the brushes!</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes, but it think I expected to like them more based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the flat kabuki</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used about half of them, and they&#x27;re soft and seem to do a very good job.</li>
            <li> because otherwise come the New Year my two adult daughters will suddenly have gorgeous brushes and I&#x27;ll have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to clean and minimal shedding.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how they are going to perform in the long run, but as of today, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I just got this set in the mail today, and at first impression I am really liking them.  </li>
            <li> They are soft, full, and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> only Con I have is that the brushes weren&#x27;t labeled, but this is an easy fix--- just look it up and match the shapes to the names of the brushes or go to images on google , Bing i,or just ask a friend.</li>
            <li> They are very high quality</li>
            <li> Very high quality material.</li>
            <li> High quality and super soft!</li>
            <li> but my first impression is that these are high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are made from real hair and so they are easy to clean and maintain with a little bit of shampoo without falling apart or damaging them.</li>
            <li> So very soft!!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Much softer than anticipated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast and neatly packed.</li>
            <li> I like these so much</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable of the quality of the brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really lose with these</li>
            <li> I feel I pay too much for this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I used them before my sister did, haha</li>
            <li> They really make a difference when applying makeup&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t washed them yet but they seem to be very well made</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> After opening the package I immediately noted that the set looks very high-end.</li>
            <li> The person that received the brushes really likes them.  </li>
            <li> Once I am able to give them a test run (once my face calms down from hot wax), I will update my review.</li>
            <li> They do have a strong chemical smell when first taken out of the package, but I used non alcohol wipes to clean them vigorously, then let them dry and air, and the next day the chemical smell was gone.  </li>
            <li> All the brushes are very useful for daily and intricate make-up application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to makeup, but I knew I wanted a set of non-synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft to touch, and they look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I have used other brushes that seem to provide better coverage.</li>
            <li> was a little hesitant to believe that a really good quality set could come at such a reasonable price,  but the hesitancy was for naught.  </li>
            <li> They are soft, which is nice, but they shed so badly that it overshadows anything good that I may have had to say.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first set of natural hair brushes</li>
            <li> They do have a bit of a chemical whiff when first opened but that disappeared completely after about 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> although i use these brushes as well as other larger headed brushes such as the all over the face brush just because i prefer face brushes to be bigger but everything else is perfect.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell upon opening was alarming, but after a quick washing with dr. bronners peppermint soap it faded right away.</li>
            <li> My new favorites!</li>
            <li> One thing to point out is that these brushes are for sure synthetic (all have the duo fiber (works wonders with foundation and blending in general even powder products) and definitely not natural hair.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and they don&#x27;t hogg my products!</li>
            <li> , I will highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li> I have couple high end sets.</li>
            <li> All came in a neat little canvas roll up case which I think is very cute and matches with the wooden</li>
            <li> Really are professional</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe that I can buy a whole set of natural hair brush for this price.</li>
            <li> I just received these and haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they are very well made and soft.</li>
            <li> For someone who is learning what each brush is and what they do, it would be nice if it included a description of what each brush was (or at least an photo on the product page).  </li>
            <li> , I know they are well worth the $40 for someone who applies makeup regularly and wants natural materials in their cosmetic routine.</li>
            <li> The brushes are high quality and are very soft.</li>
            <li> There was no scent that didn&#x27;t seem normal for new brushes.</li>
            <li> It almost smells like new shoes.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for about 4 months now, have washed them 3x and they are still like brand new.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i live in Canada and ordered them off the amazon.com</li>
            <li> The brushes are very compact, elegant and very well made, I.e. they do not lose hair, have no glue traces or unpleasant smell and are great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Very soft, non-synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> They are very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many brush set in the past and</li>
            <li> Like mentioned by other reviews, you have to clean the brushes to get the chemical smell out.  </li>
            <li> When I used new brush it glided softly on my cheeks with no itchy sensation.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked was a black holder verses an off white holder so the dirt won&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> Brushes i have a hard time with, i love a value, but i know the importance of quality.</li>
            <li> They are really soft and I do like the carrying case.</li>
            <li> so soft</li>
            <li> They are the softest brushes I have ever used, pick up color and brushes it on seamlessly</li>
            <li> Soft bristles</li>
            <li> really sensitive skin and my blush brush from MAC always gave me an itching sensation.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I purchased these, as they are made of natural hair.</li>
            <li> The only brushes that I don&#x27;t really use much are the smaller eye shadow brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were soft.</li>
            <li> but they do not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from natural hair and bamboo.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> Definitely professional make up brush quality.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased and will definitely order other products by this brand!</li>
            <li> For those who are fans of high quality cosmetic brushes, I would totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I waited and waited for these to go on sale, having looked high and low for a makeup set that had natural/ethically sourced materials for the handles AND the brushes AND the case.</li>
            <li> I try to steer clear of synthetic bristles simply because they are not delicate enough; no matter what the producer claims, I can always tell the differenceâ€¦</li>
            <li> I just received mine today, I was looking for a set of makeup brushes that I would actually use and that are soft.</li>
            <li> but I wanted ACTUAL soft brushes</li>
            <li> Did I mention they are softer than my Mac and Bare Minerals brushes and don&#x27;t shed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have 1 natural hair powder brush similar to this</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s really into the whole make up thing and always complained about her brushes.</li>
            <li> When reading other reviews, I assumed they&#x27;d be soft but not this soft!</li>
            <li> finally found an unused set for $25, and I pounced as an early birthday present from my husband to me...</li>
            <li> The white canvas case gets dirty very quickly and the brush second to the right started losing hairs a few months in.</li>
            <li> These will definitely last me a long time.</li>
            <li> They are well made and it feels like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> They did have that chemical smell that other reviewers complain about, but it&#x27;s not as bad as you would be lead to believe and it left the brushes after one good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> hopefully they will last a long time!</li>
            <li> then I expected but still totally usable.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft where they should be soft,  they&#x27;re firm where they should be firm.  </li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is that the brushes are not labeled, and this us confusing for me as I am new to makeup.</li>
            <li> All the other brushes I use daily.  </li>
            <li> As other people have noted, they do have an initial chemically smell, but that does go away.</li>
            <li> It comes with brushes that you will actually use not like other sets that come with brushes that never get used.</li>
            <li> --Used baby shampoo and let air dry</li>
            <li> ,  dry well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a single bristle fall out either.</li>
            <li> Such brushes can be pretty expensive, that&#x27;s why I was a bit hesitant to order these</li>
            <li> 1:1 tbsp dawn dish soap or babyshampoo mixed olive oil then dry with your brushes pointing down so water won&#x27; t drip down and loosing the stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> It showed up a week early, and had only a faint smell, like vinyl almost which washed away instantly..</li>
            <li> and it cost me $40 just for 1 piece, not a whole set.</li>
            <li> I first have to say that it had a weird odor, but I washed brushes and the odor was gone.  </li>
            <li> other than that they look and feel like the description says.</li>
            <li> Other than that I truly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what they other folks are talking about...who smells brushes anyway?</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with these brushes are that I&#x27;m really not sure which is the bronzer brush, crease brush, etc</li>
            <li> besides that I have no clue what half of the brushes are used for....</li>
            <li> This is so not true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little wiggy about my brushes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money,  the bristles come our and stick to your face when you use them.</li>
            <li> The bag has a slight smell that is not overwhelming in any way.</li>
            <li> wish the two small handled brushes were like the others, longer handles.</li>
            <li> Compare to expensive brands,  this set was build to last.</li>
            <li> They were hard and bristly and didn&#x27;t apply my makeup the way I wanted.</li>
            <li> The brushes shed heavily was not happy about that.</li>
            <li> I washed them due to the weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li> but you know what I mean).</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed!</li>
            <li> However once I used them for the first time it was awful.</li>
            <li> God bless the brain behind ETA brushes.</li>
            <li> maybe they need to be broken in who knows...</li>
            <li> Truth is,  I&#x27;ve been trying to find at least something not perfect about the set,  </li>
            <li> therefore i ended up paying almost 80 dollars for this set which sucks but its not too bad</li>
            <li> I am so sad about this, i was looking forward to try these brushes</li>
            <li> I am a brush obsessed.</li>
            <li> Still afraid to put them on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And looks very expensive and organic</li>
            <li> The cloth pouch they came in is what has the really bad chemical smell</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could return them.  :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> They distribute the base makeup uniformly and applies the desired makeup allowing for a profesional look.</li>
            <li> These brushes were terrible.</li>
            <li> Every brush sheds terribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wife says she loves it.  Good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes are still in good condition besides the foundation/kabooki brush it fell apart after 2 months of use</li>
            <li> I was super excited once I received the brushes. I washed them due to the weird chemical smell. However once I used them for the first time it was awful. The brushes shed heavily was not happy about that. They are really soft and I do like the carrying case.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it!...</li>
            <li> I love my brushes so much. I have tried some ULTA brushes and several other beauty brushes but these are very reasonably priced and I have been impressed with the quality and the service. I love them and I would recommend them to all my friends, family and even strangers. Several of my friends are makeup artists or cosmetologists who gave me several recommendations and when I showed them my brushes they were so impressed by them that they all wanted some more brushes and were jealous of the ones that I had. These brushes help create a flawless make-up look. The brushes are made from real hair and so they are easy to clean and maintain with a little bit of shampoo without falling apart or damaging them. When I have brushes that I can clean easily my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much and my make-up and face looks and feels better.  I LOVE MY BRUSHES THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes for the price. My new favorites!</li>
            <li> Purchased brush set.  I first have to say that it had a weird odor, but I washed brushes and the odor was gone.  This brush set is a steal for the price.  Look beyond the odor and you have a great set of brushes.  I went ahead and purchased this set and I did read from another purchaser about the odor but it was given a great review.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Thank you (( :</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. The brushes are high quality and are very soft. The only disadvantage is that the brushes are not labeled, and this us confusing for me as I am new to makeup.</li>
            <li> Soaks up all my make-up</li>
            <li> What can i say but wonderful!!!! so soft and i love them. VERY GOOD QUALITY.</li>
            <li> The bristles have been falling out constantly.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes! I will never buy another kind! They&#x27;re my GOLD!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The case and brushes are very nice for home or for traveling. Can&#x27;t wait to use them!!! Yay</li>
            <li> These replaced my long suffering Bare Essentials brushes. LOVE these ETA brushes. They are the softest brushes I have ever used, pick up color and brushes it on seamlessly and they clean easily. Haven&#x27;t seen a single bristle fall out either. I would definitely recommend these brushes</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife who loves them.  Normally she shops for brushes at Sephora and found the quality of these to be even better than what she had been paying much more money for.</li>
            <li> Did not include the box that told what each brush was for.</li>
            <li> Very soft, non-synthetic hair. Much softer than anticipated. Easy to wash the canvas case, which is a huge plus. The chemical smell dissipates once you wash it, which you should do anyway before using.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints. Very happy with product and price.</li>
            <li> wish the two small handled brushes were like the others, longer handles.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about ordering these because although good, this product only had 4 reviews. I tried to look them up elsewhere online and couldn&#x27;t find them. When I opened them up this afternoon I was pleasantly surprised to find these brushes are insanely soft and lovely! The 2 fluffier face brushes are smaller then I expected but still totally usable. There was also a bit of a chemically smell to them, but nothing a wash couldn&#x27;t fix. I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> I have used many professional brushes and popular brands like Sigma, Mac, Real Techniques, Sonia Kashuk, but I have found these brushes to be great quality and they even beat the quality of some high end brushes I use. I got these brushes within two days of my order. I highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for good quality brushes, but on budget.</li>
            <li> I washed them like three times and have had them airing our for a month. Still afraid to put them on my face. They smell like poisen. other than that they look and feel like the description says.</li>
            <li> The unique selection of brushes is great for travel. I&#x27;ve never seen a set like this. All the brushes are very useful for daily and intricate make-up application. My favorite is the flat kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first set of natural hair brushes so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. As soon as I opened the bag, there was a strong chemical smell which went away after I washed with gentle soap (Dove). The brushes came individually wrapped and one came with a plastic protector. All came in a neat little canvas roll up case which I think is very cute and matches with the wooden handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and neatly packed. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> These are my first natural hair makeup brushes, and I love them.  They are very soft.  There are a lot of bristles on each brush, so they are not floppy, which is great.  I have not had any of the bristles fall out of the brushes.  This set is a very good quality for the price, especially being natural goat hair.  The brushes are shipped nicely, each brush is individually wrapped and placed inside of the cloth brush carrier.  I like these so much, I will get brush cleaner to take care of them.  I think this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes right away after ordering them.  They are all in great condition and the brushes are soft and wonderful.  I cleaned them before using and they held their condition great.  I&#x27;m very excited to use these brushes!</li>
            <li> I have had this makeup brush set for almost a year. They are very high quality and I have had no issues with bristles falling out. The fabric bag that comes with it is nice for when I travel.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews of cosmetic brushes before purchasing these.  They arrived today and I love them, they are so soft and nicely made.  The carrying container will be perfect for transporting them along when traveling.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the brushes.soft and smooth feeling&lt;br /&gt;For its affordable price, I will highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set! It is really nice quality for the cheap price!</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes! They are very soft and they don&#x27;t hogg my products! I love that it comes with a travel case since I do travel a lot, all for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  There was Definately a funny smell from the packaging- I used brush shampoo and was fine afterwards.  Excellent quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> Upon recieving these brushes and unpackaging them, there will be a light smell. It almost smells like new shoes. Nothing a quick wash couldn&#x27;t fix. Now on to the brushes themselves, I went through each one and swirled them in my palm. They are the most softest brushes I could ever hope for. When reading other reviews, I assumed they&#x27;d be soft but not this soft! They seem to be durable brushes that will last quite a while with proper care. I&#x27;m so glad I bought these (even if it was on impulse!) :)</li>
            <li> So very soft!! The chemical smell upon opening was alarming, but after a quick washing with dr. bronners peppermint soap it faded right away. Dried fast too. I&#x27;ve just had them for a day now but my first impression is that these are high quality brushes. Do wish some of the face brushes were a bit bigger but overall am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Very nice set, I m happy!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, a makeup addict, but don&#x27;t want to spend 100s on brand name brushes, get these! I mainly only use tarte, benefit, urban decay, theBalm, and too faced, occasionally finding a nyx product i can dig. I research and read every review. Brushes i have a hard time with, i love a value, but i know the importance of quality. These are amazing, i am so happy with them. They give flawless application and are soft yet firm.</li>
            <li> I just received mine today, I was looking for a set of makeup brushes that I would actually use and that are soft. I looked around and read reviews but I wanted ACTUAL soft brushes and I found that Goat hair brushes are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a cute to go kaki roll away great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Soft bristles&lt;br /&gt;I love each tool it came with&lt;br /&gt;And looks very expensive and organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;Barely any shedding I pulled out like two hairs on just one of the brushes and that&#x27;s all!&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I 1st got it once I removed it from the plastic packaging it had a Very strong chemical smell but don&#x27;t worry clean it 1:1 tbsp dawn dish soap or babyshampoo mixed olive oil then dry with your brushes pointing down so water won&#x27; t drip down and loosing the stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product would recommend !!!!</li>
            <li> I received my brushes and I loved it. Every brush is made of the softest hairs. I have really sensitive skin and my blush brush from MAC always gave me an itching sensation. When I used new brush it glided softly on my cheeks with no itchy sensation.  This was a great buy, reasonable price, and excellent quality. The only thing I would have liked was a black holder verses an off white holder so the dirt won&#x27;t show. Other than that I truly recommend these brushes. Thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Such good quality and so $$$ cheap!</li>
            <li> These brushes were terrible. They were hard and bristly and didn&#x27;t apply my makeup the way I wanted. I&#x27;m most likely not going to buy from ETA again and won&#x27;t recommend it to my friends. Pretty disappointed!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It was indeed beyond my expectations. Very high quality goat hair serve to create a perfect, flawless makeup. The brushes are very compact, elegant and very well made, I.e. they do not lose hair, have no glue traces or unpleasant smell and are great for everyday use! For those who are fans of high quality cosmetic brushes, I would totally recommend this product! Love ETA!!!</li>
            <li> I love these! I just received this item but it already promises to be one of my favorites. The case seems like it will last awhile, it rolls up nicely and compactly to fit in luggage or a purse. The bristles are soft and there is a good combination of brush types. Overall, I am pleased and will definitely order other products by this brand!</li>
            <li> Largest brushes shed some brissels with use.</li>
            <li> ATTENTION ATTENTIONâ€¦..These are the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.. Ok so lets start from the beginning. I&#x27;ve always heard that the more expensive the brush the softer it is and the longer it last. This is so not true. I own both Mac and Bare Minerals brushes and the ETA brushes are the best. Ladies let me list all the PROS for You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Softer than any mixed or synthetic bush I&#x27;ve ever owned..ie just my opinion&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to Clean--Used baby shampoo and let air dry&lt;br /&gt;3. Hold shape after drying-- didn&#x27;t shrink or get bulk after washing like some brushes do&lt;br /&gt;4. Didn&#x27;t shed before or after washing at all.&lt;br /&gt;5. Did I mention they are softer than my Mac and Bare Minerals brushes and don&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;6. The price is reasonable of the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Con I have is that the brushes weren&#x27;t labeled, but this is an easy fix--- just look it up and match the shapes to the names of the brushes or go to images on google , Bing i,or just ask a friend. These ETA brushes are too good of a deal to pass up. If you want to feel luxury sweeping across your face the ETA brushes are  for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, hope this Helps :0)</li>
            <li> very good set of brushes for the price. hopefully they will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased with my brush set.. It showed up a week early, and had only a faint smell, like vinyl almost which washed away instantly.. As well no shedding of any of the brushes.. Everything I expected, with the bonus of arriving early.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes today &amp; I love them! They are a little smaller than I expected but they are still exactly I was looking for! I washed them real good with baby shampoo &amp; they didn&#x27;t shed at all! They give a flawless look especially the flat top kabuki when applying liquid foundation! I would definitely order from them in the future!!</li>
            <li> I love this procuct alot!!!!!  This is verry good</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but it&#x27;s too soft for me, to allow the definition I want. I was coming from MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this set of bushes, They are awesome. I would tell all my friends and family to purchase especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely these brushes!!! I try to steer clear of synthetic bristles simply because they are not delicate enough; no matter what the producer claims, I can always tell the differenceâ€¦ That&#x27;s why I purchased these, as they are made of natural hair. Such brushes can be pretty expensive, that&#x27;s why I was a bit hesitant to order these and I wash&#x27;t sure if they would be of good quality. They seem to be very well-made! I am not sure how they are going to perform in the long run, but as of today, I am very happy with my purchase! For the price, they are a great value.</li>
            <li> â€‹Im in love with these brushes....They are way prettier then the pictures shown. I ordered them on a Wednesday and they arrived by Friday. I will definitely be order more products from BeautyezShop.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!! they have a good weight and feel to them.  Bristles are soft and makeup comes on flawlessly.  easy to clean and minimal shedding.  excellent value for the price.  you can&#x27;t really lose with these</li>
            <li> A friend gave me as a gift and I must say............it&#x27;s the best. Am a Nigerian and a makeup artist. I have come across all sort and brands of brushes but I must say am glad I have this. So soft and perfect. God bless the brain behind ETA brushes.</li>
            <li> Very good, I love it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brushes. They did have a chemical smell, but washing the brushes and air drying them for a day elimimated that(which one should always wash brushs before use anyways). Best part they don&#x27;t shed. I have been using these brushes for about 4 months now, have washed them 3x and they are still like brand new. These will definitely last me a long time.</li>
            <li> By far, these are the most superior brushes I have ever used.  I highly recommend them for anyone who is into cosmetic art!!</li>
            <li> I not have words for describe my feelings about this, wonderful product, excellent cuality, thanks</li>
            <li> Great product, plus fast service, and excellent customer support!</li>
            <li> they are too stubby and short for my taste...maybe they need to be broken in who knows...besides that I have no clue what half of the brushes are used for....NO LABELS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell...I have no idea what they other folks are talking about...who smells brushes anyway? Just wash them with dove soap or baby wash and you will be fine. There was no scent that didn&#x27;t seem normal for new brushes.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes. No bristles detatch. High quality and super soft! So happy with them .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little wiggy about my brushes.  I&#x27;ve tried many,  but loved only a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant to believe that a really good quality set could come at such a reasonable price,  but the hesitancy was for naught.  These are truly the best value brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought,  and I&#x27;ve been experimenting with brushes for about 15 years (!).  They do have a bit of a chemical whiff when first opened but that disappeared completely after about 2 hours.  Truth is,  I&#x27;ve been trying to find at least something not perfect about the set,  but I can&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re soft where they should be soft,  they&#x27;re firm where they should be firm.  They wash well and more importantly,  dry well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are excellent,  excellent quality and now I have to remember to put 2 more sets on my wishlist,  because otherwise come the New Year my two adult daughters will suddenly have gorgeous brushes and I&#x27;ll have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to just buy them some of their own instead of wondering how mine ended up in their bathrooms!</li>
            <li> I feel I pay too much for this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> The Makeup Bamboo Brushes works well.  They are well made and it feels like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a month now and am really impressed!  They did have a smell when I first received them, however, after machine washing the bag and hand washing all the brushes, the smell seems to be gone.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any issues with bristles falling out either.  This is really a great set!  The only brushes that I don&#x27;t really use much are the smaller eye shadow brushes.  All the other brushes I use daily.  Excellent quality -- especially for the price.  The only thing I would change is to make the bag a darker color -- this would do a better job of hiding makeup that gets on the bag from the brushes.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes. What everyone said about them being super soft and not shedding is true! I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> excellent quality  prompt delivery  great gift idea</li>
            <li> Like mentioned by other reviews, you have to clean the brushes to get the chemical smell out.  Besides that these are great brushes!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality cosmetic brushes. They are soft, full, and don&#x27;t shed. Good investment.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing</li>
            <li> The brushes are great the only thing is we wished there was a bigger powder brush in the set</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!! I THE QUALITY OF THE BRUSHES ARE EXCELLENT, THEY LOOK VERY PROFESSIONAL!!!! I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> So sofffft! I bought these as a gift for my sister and she loved them! Make up application with this is luxurious. They feel great on the face and the brushes carry and let off the make up nicely (I just butchered that but you know what I mean). Anyway, I would know... I used them before my sister did, haha&lt;br /&gt;These are on my wishlist for sure.</li>
            <li> Omg for the price I love these brushes!!! They really make a difference when applying makeup&lt;br /&gt;I always use powders &amp; they are amazing!!! Really are professional</li>
            <li> Great Set for the Price. The brushes were soft. Not the softest I own but they do not irritate my sensitive skin. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet but they seem to be very well made and I think they will withstand.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok. Not that great.</li>
            <li> This brush set is phenomenal!!! Especially for the price. I do makeup professionally and this is the best set I&#x27;ve ordered yet. There is no shedding, the initial smell is not bad at all, and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Bought these brush set for my girl friend after reading all the good reviews.  And this is why she loves them. The set comes with all the brush that a profesional would use. They distribute the base makeup uniformly and applies the desired makeup allowing for a profesional look.</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed.  Used to buying MAC brushes.  Will probably stick with MAC, they last along time and are better quality!</li>
            <li> Used the brushes today...I am satisfied, they are well made bamboo handles and very soft bristles. Bought these because i was looking for goat hair and this had a lot of good reviews so happy I did. I do wish the face brushes had one larger more full coverage brush but overall a great product. And great customer service</li>
            <li> I really love my brushes.  It&#x27;s made from natural hair and bamboo.  I strongly recommend these.  I don&#x27;t have any problems at all.  Easy to wash them with shampoo or brush shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery but when i opened it the brushes smells like gas!! Or the smell of fresh dye!! I tried washing it with a brush soap but the smell didnt go!!! I am so sad about this, i was looking forward to try these brushes</li>
            <li> My wife enjoyed the gift and told me it was better than her old Mac Brushes. Whatever that means? lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to makeup, but I knew I wanted a set of non-synthetic brushes. So far, I&#x27;ve used about half of them, and they&#x27;re soft and seem to do a very good job. As other people have noted, they do have an initial chemically smell, but that does go away. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Great gift for a friend of mine. She&#x27;s really into the whole make up thing and always complained about her brushes. She loved how soft they were and how they spread her make up. Overall satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I use these for cleaning optical systems. I can&#x27;t speak to their use for makeup, but I can tell you they are very nicely made and don&#x27;t shed. The different brushes have differing stiffness, which I find convenient and may help with makeup application too.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Compare to expensive brands,  this set was build to last. In love with my new brush set.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brush set.  The brushes work very well, but what I am most pleased with is that they do not shed and that they are very plush.  There is nothing skimpy or cheap feeling about these brushes, and real hair DOES make a huge difference in how they feel and how polished the end result is.  They do have a strong chemical smell when first taken out of the package, but I used non alcohol wipes to clean them vigorously, then let them dry and air, and the next day the chemical smell was gone.  I highly recommend this set - would make a great gift too.</li>
            <li> I have bought many brush set in the past and this by far is my most favorite one. It is great quality and very soft. I still can&#x27;t believe that I can buy a whole set of natural hair brush for this price. I have 1 natural hair powder brush similar to this and it cost me $40 just for 1 piece, not a whole set. Definitely recommend this product to everyone that uses brush to apply their makeup. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of brushes on July 2nd, and received them in the mail today (July 8th)! I haven&#x27;t used them yet, however, I&#x27;m very pleased so far. The bristles are very soft to touch, and they look exactly like the picture. The only issue I have with these brushes are that I&#x27;m really not sure which is the bronzer brush, crease brush, etc... But I guess that&#x27;s really my issue not the brushes! Lol!... Very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> The white canvas case gets dirty very quickly and the brush second to the right started losing hairs a few months in. The other brushes are excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Impressive! I didn&#x27;t expect such nice brushes for that price. Love them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING!!! I ordered 2 additional the nxt week! Gives flawless look and great whn i do bookings.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very good quality, no shedding</li>
            <li> These are junk.  I was unimpressed by the quality.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes, but it think I expected to like them more based on other reviews. I have used other brushes that seem to provide better coverage. But the variety of brushes is great!</li>
            <li> I just got this set in the mail today, and at first impression I am really liking them.  They did have that chemical smell that other reviewers complain about, but it&#x27;s not as bad as you would be lead to believe and it left the brushes after one good cleaning.  The cloth pouch they came in is what has the really bad chemical smell so I wouldn&#x27;t keep the brushes in there until it was given a good washing on it&#x27;s own.  For someone who is learning what each brush is and what they do, it would be nice if it included a description of what each brush was (or at least an photo on the product page).  Once I am able to give them a test run (once my face calms down from hot wax), I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the positive reviews. They were delivered very fast. After opening the package I immediately noted that the set looks very high-end. I am a brush obsessed. I have couple high end sets. And these ones compare perfectly. The bristles are very good quality, they do the job just right. I took my time to write this review, as I wanted to make sure that the brushes won&#x27;t start shedding after couple washes. And they did not. At all!  I washed them many times and not a single hair fell out. Going to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just received these and haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they are very well made and soft. The bag has a slight smell that is not overwhelming in any way. All the brushes are great, the exact ones any makeup user would need. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Yep I like these a lot.  Feel Great, wash up nicely.  With a little care they will last a good long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Great for relieving rectal itch... WOOF :p</li>
            <li> They are soft, which is nice, but they shed so badly that it overshadows anything good that I may have had to say.  Every brush sheds terribly.  Very disappointing.  I was really excited about them.  I wish I could return them.  :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money,  the bristles come our and stick to your face when you use them. I&#x27;m returning them.</li>
            <li> I waited and waited for these to go on sale, having looked high and low for a makeup set that had natural/ethically sourced materials for the handles AND the brushes AND the case. I hesitated to pay $40, though.&lt;br /&gt;I finally found an unused set for $25, and I pounced as an early birthday present from my husband to me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderful. The brushes are soft. The hair has not come out once yet. I have flawless application, compared to a popular &amp;#34;eco&amp;#34; set with synthetic bristles that I had purchased for my daughter which sometimes catches a little on a cheek or on some moisture on her eyelid. Not so with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have them in hand and can see their quality and their gentle but effective application, I know they are well worth the $40 for someone who applies makeup regularly and wants natural materials in their cosmetic routine.</li>
            <li> Got these babies a week early and from what i can see and feel they are exceptional. some people were complaining about them smelling like gas .... i did not have that problem and i am really really impressed with this set. although i use these brushes as well as other larger headed brushes such as the all over the face brush just because i prefer face brushes to be bigger but everything else is perfect. Definitely professional make up brush quality. super soft and places make up on face flawlessly. unfortunately i live in Canada and ordered them off the amazon.com therefore i ended up paying almost 80 dollars for this set which sucks but its not too bad i really like many of the brushes!! One thing to point out is that these brushes are for sure synthetic (all have the duo fiber (works wonders with foundation and blending in general even powder products) and definitely not natural hair.</li>
            <li> Very high quality material. Soft bristles are easy to use. Would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great brush set! It comes with brushes that you will actually use not like other sets that come with brushes that never get used. The quality is great and perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  The person that received the brushes really likes them.  Says she likes the softness</li>
