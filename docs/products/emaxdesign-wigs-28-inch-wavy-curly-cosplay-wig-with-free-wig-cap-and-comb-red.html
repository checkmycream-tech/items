            <li>It laid nicely.</li>

            <li>With a vibrant stand out color and and and shake-and-go style, this wig is an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is a wig :) The best part is that it includes a cap to put over your hair, to help the wig fit better, and a very nice comb so that you can keep your wig looking new and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;For someone who doesn&#x27;t wear wigs, this was very easy to put on and adjust.</li>
            <li>My red wig fits perfectly and looks really nice for the price.</li>
            <li>It comes nicely packed in a mesh cover and has a free comb for maintaining the hair properly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the color and the feeling of it</li>

            <li>The wig was a lot better than I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li>(Well, I wore more than that, but this is a wig review).  </li>
            <li>and I am IN LOVE WITH IT.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It could certainly fit a child but if your head is a bit &amp;#34;larger you can count this one out!</li>

            <li>and I am really glad I gave it</li>
            <li>She has asked to use this wig to create one of her special and creative &#x27;looks&#x27; on her own youtube channel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is adjustable and should fit most heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not to mention they are super cute and sexy.</li>
            <li>Its easy to comb and maintain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a bag you can use to store the wig in, a wig comb/brush and a wigcap.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get tangled easy, but just comb through it softly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>--it was easy to style the wig.  </li>
            <li>This is great for detangling -- much better than a regular brush as you don&#x27;t pull out hairs from the wig when you use the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so soft and fits my head nicely and it looks so nice</li>
            <li>but it will be fine for my Ariel costume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear and is comfortable, not itchy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product received free for review.</li>
            <li>hairs seem secure in the wigs, even when detangling.</li>
            <li>Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of true scarlet red.</li>
            <li>Very nice wig and the extra quality comb too.</li>
            <li>So again the freebies was a very nice addition to the overall package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>color is nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>sizes- from a cap size SMALL to a XL by our best estimation.</li>
            <li>Ok, I am pretty fluent when it comes to extentions,weaves, wigs etc</li>
            <li>But at this price (under fifteen dollars as of the time I&#x27;m writing this review), this is excellent for Halloween or a theme party or just for a little fun on a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also comes with a special metal pinned comb and a wig cap.</li>
            <li>The wig is synthetic and full.</li>
            <li>super shiny Ariel red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that’s what makes it so fantastic in the first place.</li>
            <li>even if you just need a cheap wig for Halloween or for cos-play check around first, because this wig needs some improvements.</li>
            <li>even if you just need a cheap wig for Halloween or for cos-play check around first, because this wig needs some improvements.</li>
            <li>The wig cap is very stretchy and easy for you to apply.</li>
            <li>I put the wig on and the complete perimeter of my hair was exposed under those bangs,....not very secure at all.</li>
            <li>I put the wig on and the complete perimeter of my hair was exposed under those bangs,....not very secure at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is suitable for any fancy dress costume occasion, halloween or even if you just happen to like changing your hair and general appearance</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable and very well made.  </li>
            <li>These are stretchy (basically fishnet tights material) and fit my head very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really fun for cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Comes packaged nicely with a hair net thing and a comb.</li>
            <li>I have seen cheap wigs at my local dollar store that hold up better than this one.</li>
            <li>I have seen cheap wigs at my local dollar store that hold up better than this one.</li>
            <li>and I could not find a single one I liked.</li>
            <li>The colour is actually more of a vibrant red, as opposed to the orangey auburn red shown in the product images (the customer images show a more accurate colour.</li>
            <li>I felt it with my hands and felt very real when I comb through it using my fingers.</li>
            <li>Here comes another set of wigs that is pretty from EmaxDesign.</li>
            <li>I will try to add pictures to this later if I am able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig is so pretty.</li>
            <li>It was my first wig</li>
            <li>The actual wig looks much better on than in the picture.  </li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t too hot if you plan on wearing it all</li>
            <li>First, they come with a wig caps</li>
            <li>You will get sweaty when it&#x27;s hot out so be sure to wear a stocking cap over your actual hair or it won&#x27;t stay put (like with any wig).</li>
            <li>/&gt;So now, I’m really, really looking forward to Halloween, which is right around the corner!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks very real in high quality material.</li>
            <li>It covers the hairline well, and it is full enough, and made onto a nice enough foundation that you cannot see the hair or scalp underneath the wig at all.</li>
            <li>my opinion, just like other wigs from EmaxDesign, this set of wigs will be great for halloween, fashion show, promp, costome party, hollywood, acting, theater....</li>
            <li>It didn’t move around that much when it was on.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and feel of the product.</li>
            <li>very day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you move the hair too much</li>
            <li>It looks and feels better than expected.</li>
            <li>There was very minimum shedding even after I wore it for hours and combed it out afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the comb that&#x27;s included</li>
            <li>i will say i did enjoy the fact that this seller included some key things that you would need when wearing a wig.</li>
            <li>it states that the length is 70cm/28in which is absolutely correct...plus some.</li>
            <li>This wig doesn&#x27;t have any combs attached to keep it secure but there are adjustable straps in the back (which are not needed because the cap is already too</li>
            <li>guys i will keep it real with anyone who took the time to read this.....</li>

            <li>guys i will keep it real with anyone who took the time to read this.....</li>
            <li>But I really like this EmaxDesigns Cosplay wig.  </li>
            <li>I love the length, even though it&#x27;s the same length as my natural hair xD</li>
            <li>I still have to figure out the best way to put my real hair up -- a bun doesn&#x27;t work because it leads to a weird lump in the wig, since I have very long hair.</li>
            <li>It is not some thing you would want to wear every day out as it does have that fake glossiness but its of great quality with out doubt.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was the bangs are right in your face and it takes a bit to get them adjusted so that you can see.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is certainly striking, so people with definitely see you coming.&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough one of my youngest daughters has a friend (17/18), who is into the whole japanese manga and girl doll look.</li>
            <li>I do plan to buy the other available colors.</li>
            <li>With some improvements and a little work it has the potential to be a nice wig though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With some improvements and a little work it has the potential to be a nice wig though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other thing that&#x27;s cool is they come with wig combs.</li>
            <li>It’s really long, which is great for staying warm on the long cold (though fun) parade</li>
            <li>We used this for a Little Mermaid costume for Halloween and it was a huge hit.</li>
            <li>The wig cap is black mesh, and adjustable with a strap and hook- pretty typical for most wigs.</li>
            <li>But it seems like a synthetic material that’s both soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I chuckled a bit when I read in the description that this is “natural” looking.</li>
            <li>The wig is cute, but my order was late and I needed it for a costume, so I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li>I am not big on wearing wigs, just because I have so much hair, and never even thought to try them.  </li>
            <li>it is rather full, we thought it might be a bit heavy, so my son wore one just like it (in a different color) for 5 hours straight one night for testing.</li>
            <li>(My mannequin wears a small, I wear a Med, my son a XL, and it fit us all</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be styled- just use cool methods without any heat, which will destroy a synthetic wig like this.  </li>
            <li>(It would come up a bit higher on larger people, but this is a LONG wig.)&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>The comb that came along with the wig is a little small, and reminded me of a baby doll&#x27;s comb, but it was sturdy enough to comb through my natural hair as well as the wig without breaking or giving me any kind of issues.</li>
            <li>Pretty color and little funky smell but figure that will fade.</li>
            <li>Just use a little baby shampoo or mild shampoo and air dry the synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is about as thick as my real hair (only it feels more luxurious because it stays thick all the way out to the ends).</li>
            <li>I like that particular style of cap because it allows your hair to breathe while still holding down your hair underneath a wig</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I felt it with my hands and felt very real when I comb through it using my fingers.</li>
            <li> Here comes another set of wigs that is pretty from EmaxDesign.</li>
            <li> I will try to add pictures to this later if I am able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig is so pretty.</li>
            <li> It was my first wig</li>
            <li> The actual wig looks much better on than in the picture.  </li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t too hot if you plan on wearing it all</li>
            <li> First, they come with a wig caps</li>
            <li> You will get sweaty when it&#x27;s hot out so be sure to wear a stocking cap over your actual hair or it won&#x27;t stay put (like with any wig).</li>
            <li> /&gt;So now, I’m really, really looking forward to Halloween, which is right around the corner!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks very real in high quality material.</li>
            <li> It covers the hairline well, and it is full enough, and made onto a nice enough foundation that you cannot see the hair or scalp underneath the wig at all.</li>
            <li> my opinion, just like other wigs from EmaxDesign, this set of wigs will be great for halloween, fashion show, promp, costome party, hollywood, acting, theater....</li>
            <li> It didn’t move around that much when it was on.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and feel of the product.</li>
            <li> very day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you move the hair too much</li>
            <li> It looks and feels better than expected.</li>
            <li> There was very minimum shedding even after I wore it for hours and combed it out afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the comb that&#x27;s included</li>
            <li> i will say i did enjoy the fact that this seller included some key things that you would need when wearing a wig.</li>
            <li> it states that the length is 70cm/28in which is absolutely correct...plus some.</li>
            <li> This wig doesn&#x27;t have any combs attached to keep it secure but there are adjustable straps in the back (which are not needed because the cap is already too</li>
            <li> guys i will keep it real with anyone who took the time to read this.....</li>
            <li> This wig doesn&#x27;t have any combs attached to keep it secure but there are adjustable straps in the back (which are not needed because the cap is already too</li>
            <li> guys i will keep it real with anyone who took the time to read this.....</li>
            <li> But I really like this EmaxDesigns Cosplay wig.  </li>
            <li> I love the length, even though it&#x27;s the same length as my natural hair xD</li>
            <li> I still have to figure out the best way to put my real hair up -- a bun doesn&#x27;t work because it leads to a weird lump in the wig, since I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> It is not some thing you would want to wear every day out as it does have that fake glossiness but its of great quality with out doubt.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was the bangs are right in your face and it takes a bit to get them adjusted so that you can see.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is certainly striking, so people with definitely see you coming.&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough one of my youngest daughters has a friend (17/18), who is into the whole japanese manga and girl doll look.</li>
            <li> I do plan to buy the other available colors.</li>
            <li> With some improvements and a little work it has the potential to be a nice wig though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With some improvements and a little work it has the potential to be a nice wig though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other thing that&#x27;s cool is they come with wig combs.</li>
            <li> It’s really long, which is great for staying warm on the long cold (though fun) parade</li>
            <li> We used this for a Little Mermaid costume for Halloween and it was a huge hit.</li>
            <li> The wig cap is black mesh, and adjustable with a strap and hook- pretty typical for most wigs.</li>
            <li> But it seems like a synthetic material that’s both soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I chuckled a bit when I read in the description that this is “natural” looking.</li>
            <li> The wig is cute, but my order was late and I needed it for a costume, so I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I am not big on wearing wigs, just because I have so much hair, and never even thought to try them.  </li>
            <li> it is rather full, we thought it might be a bit heavy, so my son wore one just like it (in a different color) for 5 hours straight one night for testing.</li>
            <li> (My mannequin wears a small, I wear a Med, my son a XL, and it fit us all</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be styled- just use cool methods without any heat, which will destroy a synthetic wig like this.  </li>
            <li> (It would come up a bit higher on larger people, but this is a LONG wig.)&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> The comb that came along with the wig is a little small, and reminded me of a baby doll&#x27;s comb, but it was sturdy enough to comb through my natural hair as well as the wig without breaking or giving me any kind of issues.</li>
            <li> Pretty color and little funky smell but figure that will fade.</li>
            <li> Just use a little baby shampoo or mild shampoo and air dry the synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is about as thick as my real hair (only it feels more luxurious because it stays thick all the way out to the ends).</li>
            <li> I like that particular style of cap because it allows your hair to breathe while still holding down your hair underneath a wig</li>
            <li> The wig is very poorly constructed and the wig has a &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; at the top where the closure is.</li>
            <li> I would not wear this for an everyday wig, as the color is so vibrant it will be obvious</li>
            <li> I am not very experienced with wigs and this is the first one I got</li>
            <li> It’s not really natural looking</li>
            <li> According to the description this wig is supposed to have a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shine, i can agree with the shine but certainly not natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These have several advantages over some of the other cosplay wigs out there.</li>
            <li> and I have a mannequin head that I can dry it on when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no need to yet, but the instructions say to use mild shampoo and cold water so it seems simple enough</li>
            <li> The color is not as dark red as the picture</li>
            <li> then you see the netting soooo obvious because it&#x27;s black and the wig is</li>
            <li> I whipped out my ruler and measured this for myself and although this wig has some slight layering towards the bottom the longest layer is actually 74cm/29in!</li>
            <li> wig comes with a black hair net, a wide tooth comb, and the wing.</li>
            <li> serious cosplay enthusiasts might want to go in for something more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> I like funky hair colors, but I prefer them in wig form because purple or red hair is really not suitable for my day job (at a law</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that last Halloween, I went to Ricky’s looking for a wig to go with my Day of the Dead costume for the annual NYC Greenwich Village Halloween Parade</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s firmly attached to the cap, so you don&#x27;t leave a trail.  </li>
            <li> Also, you may need a few strategically-placed hairpins to keep this in place if you plan to move around a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It hangs about mid-back, or a few inches below the bra line on my size 7-8 size mannequin.</li>
            <li> The cap of the wig is extremely small.</li>
            <li> have an average sized head, I think, and this was a little on the loose side but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I tried &amp;#34;finger combing&amp;#34; and that was even worse.</li>
            <li> The hair was falling out and it was really fake looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I looked horrible with the bangs how they were xD way too little bangs</li>
            <li> The shedding is THE WORST!</li>

            <li> Here comes another set of wigs that is pretty from EmaxDesign. It looks very real in high quality material. I felt it with my hands and felt very real when I comb through it using my fingers. These wigs can be a good set for a fashionable change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, just like other wigs from EmaxDesign, this set of wigs will be great for halloween, fashion show, promp, costome party, hollywood, acting, theater....etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a volunteer reviewer for EmaxDesign. I received this sample item to test and share my experience with it&lt;br /&gt;Comment</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that last Halloween, I went to Ricky’s looking for a wig to go with my Day of the Dead costume for the annual NYC Greenwich Village Halloween Parade and I could not find a single one I liked. If only I’d had this one 10 months ago! I’ll be planning Halloween 2015 around this wig – I don’t know what yet, but it’ll be something good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the wig comes packaged well and neatly so that there isn’t any tangling or frizzing when you remove the safety hair net. It also comes with a special metal pinned comb and a wig cap. It’s made of something called Japanese Kanekalon fiber and I haven’t the slightest idea what that is. But it seems like a synthetic material that’s both soft and shiny. It’s really long, which is great for staying warm on the long cold (though fun) parade route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an average sized head, I think, and this was a little on the loose side but not too bad. It didn’t move around that much when it was on. They also sell a cobalt blue version that is to die for. I chuckled a bit when I read in the description that this is “natural” looking. It’s not really natural looking but that’s what makes it so fantastic in the first place. Also, I don&#x27;t know how this can be only $12.99 - this is a lot of wig for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cleaning, I haven’t washed it – no need to yet, but the instructions say to use mild shampoo and cold water so it seems simple enough and I have a mannequin head that I can dry it on when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, I’m really, really looking forward to Halloween, which is right around the corner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to post images but the review form is not giving me the option to add photos or video. I will try to add pictures to this later if I am able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The wig is cute, but my order was late and I needed it for a costume, so I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> This is a great pair of synthetic wig. I really like the texture and feel of the product. Its easy to comb and maintain. The size is pretty good. My height is 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and it comes till below my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is nice and vibrant. It is not some thing you would want to wear every day out as it does have that fake glossiness but its of great quality with out doubt. It comes nicely packed in a mesh cover and has a free comb for maintaining the hair properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig fits almost any head. It has a strap inside for securing it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The colour is actually more of a vibrant red, as opposed to the orangey auburn red shown in the product images (the customer images show a more accurate colour. I think the colour in the image should be updated to reflect the actual colour of the wig.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a bag you can use to store the wig in, a wig comb/brush and a wigcap.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to wash. Just use a little baby shampoo or mild shampoo and air dry the synthetic hair. It is adjustable and should fit most heads.&lt;br /&gt;Length is about midback.&lt;br /&gt;It is certainly striking, so people with definitely see you coming.&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough one of my youngest daughters has a friend (17/18), who is into the whole japanese manga and girl doll look. She has asked to use this wig to create one of her special and creative &#x27;looks&#x27; on her own youtube channel.&lt;br /&gt;It is suitable for any fancy dress costume occasion, halloween or even if you just happen to like changing your hair and general appearance very day.&lt;br /&gt;I received a copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.</li>
            <li> The wig is so pretty. I love the length, even though it&#x27;s the same length as my natural hair xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The wig is really nice and the comb works good.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color and the feeling of it is really soft and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was really careful and it was packaged nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I looked horrible with the bangs how they were xD way too little bangs so I had to cut some.&lt;br /&gt;If you move the hair too much then you see the netting soooo obvious because it&#x27;s black and the wig is super shiny Ariel red.&lt;br /&gt;It does get tangled easy, but just comb through it softly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend it. It was my first wig and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love wearing wigs. It&#x27;s such an effortless way to drastically switch up your look. Not to mention they are super cute and sexy. This wig is so nice. Really great quality. Looks gorgeous on. I love the way it looked. It laid nicely. Comes with a comb, and cap. Very pleased! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> The wig was a lot better than I was expecting for the price. It looks and feels better than expected. There was very minimum shedding even after I wore it for hours and combed it out afterwards. I also appreciate that it comes with a wig comb. I do plan to buy the other available colors.</li>
            <li> I recently attended a steampunk party, and wore this wig with goggles and boots. (Well, I wore more than that, but this is a wig review).  The wig was the perfect addition to my costume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable and very well made.  There&#x27;s plenty of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s firmly attached to the cap, so you don&#x27;t leave a trail.  I really appreciated the comb that&#x27;s included--it was easy to style the wig.  The actual wig looks much better on than in the picture.  I&#x27;m planning on a repeat performance just as soon as the opportunity presents itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review.</li>
            <li> With a vibrant stand out color and and and shake-and-go style, this wig is an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the red, and it&#x27;s a fire engine red. It comes with a wig cap and a wig styling comb, very handy if you don&#x27;t already have one. Because it is wavy, you have a lot of movement. The cap is mesh so it isn&#x27;t too hot if you plan on wearing it all day.&lt;br /&gt;Really fun for cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received to test, with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> This review is for the purple and red wigs (which were formerly on the same product page although that appears to have changed). I&#x27;ve tried several wigs from the same seller and they&#x27;re all of similar quality, so my reviews will be similar.  I like funky hair colors, but I prefer them in wig form because purple or red hair is really not suitable for my day job (at a law firm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have several advantages over some of the other cosplay wigs out there. First, they come with a wig caps so you can keep your hair out of the way. These are stretchy (basically fishnet tights material) and fit my head very well. I still have to figure out the best way to put my real hair up -- a bun doesn&#x27;t work because it leads to a weird lump in the wig, since I have very long hair. But I have no doubt I can look up a tutorial or video somewhere. The other thing that&#x27;s cool is they come with wig combs. This is great for detangling -- much better than a regular brush as you don&#x27;t pull out hairs from the wig when you use the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs seem secure in the wigs, even when detangling. I&#x27;d say the level of curl in the photo is representative of the level of curl in the actual product you get. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out my preferred placement of the bangs. Also, you may need a few strategically-placed hairpins to keep this in place if you plan to move around a lot. (Some adjustability is provided by hooks on straps inside the wig.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is about as thick as my real hair (only it feels more luxurious because it stays thick all the way out to the ends). It has a nice weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More serious cosplay enthusiasts might want to go in for something more expensive. But at this price (under fifteen dollars as of the time I&#x27;m writing this review), this is excellent for Halloween or a theme party or just for a little fun on a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> Returned it the day I got it. The hair was falling out and it was really fake looking.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear and is comfortable, not itchy. You will get sweaty when it&#x27;s hot out so be sure to wear a stocking cap over your actual hair or it won&#x27;t stay put (like with any wig). We used this for a Little Mermaid costume for Halloween and it was a huge hit.</li>
            <li> Very nice wig and the extra quality comb too. Pretty color and little funky smell but figure that will fade.</li>
            <li> My red wig fits perfectly and looks really nice for the price. Comes packaged nicely with a hair net thing and a comb. The color is not as dark red as the picture but it will be fine for my Ariel costume.</li>
            <li> I am not very experienced with wigs and this is the first one I got and I am IN LOVE WITH IT. It is so soft and fits my head nicely and it looks so nice I have gotten lots of comments on it.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig comes with a black hair net, a wide tooth comb, and the wing. It comes in a box, well wrapped and protected.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of true scarlet red. The wig is synthetic and full. It covers the hairline well, and it is full enough, and made onto a nice enough foundation that you cannot see the hair or scalp underneath the wig at all. The wig cap is black mesh, and adjustable with a strap and hook- pretty typical for most wigs. It is made so that if you need to, for a costume, you could sew extra hair or adornments into the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hangs about mid-back, or a few inches below the bra line on my size 7-8 size mannequin. (It would come up a bit higher on larger people, but this is a LONG wig.)&lt;br /&gt;Because it is rather full, we thought it might be a bit heavy, so my son wore one just like it (in a different color) for 5 hours straight one night for testing. He said it stayed comfortable and didn&#x27;t seem to heavy to him, though a smaller woman might find it heavy after a couple of hours. The wig cap is adjustable, so it fits a good range of head sizes- from a cap size SMALL to a XL by our best estimation. (My mannequin wears a small, I wear a Med, my son a XL, and it fit us all well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be styled- just use cool methods without any heat, which will destroy a synthetic wig like this.  It can also be washed if need be.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great price for this wig.  It&#x27;s an excellent wig for Cosplay.</li>
            <li> I always buy a wig to see if that color looks good on me before I do it to my own hair. This was delivered within 2 days of the order processing. It fits comfortably and looks amazing. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am pretty fluent when it comes to extentions,weaves, wigs etc and i am going to share my thoughts and experiences with this wig with you guys. So, lets start at the beginning................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Out Of Box Experience&lt;br /&gt;-The Wig&lt;br /&gt;-A Net Wig Cap&lt;br /&gt;-A Comb&lt;br /&gt;Now i will say i did enjoy the fact that this seller included some key things that you would need when wearing a wig. The wig cap is very stretchy and easy for you to apply. I like that particular style of cap because it allows your hair to breathe while still holding down your hair underneath a wig so that&#x27;s a PLUS! The comb that came along with the wig is a little small, and reminded me of a baby doll&#x27;s comb, but it was sturdy enough to comb through my natural hair as well as the wig without breaking or giving me any kind of issues. So again the freebies was a very nice addition to the overall package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the wig.....&lt;br /&gt;In the description of this wig it states that the length is 70cm/28in which is absolutely correct...plus some. I whipped out my ruler and measured this for myself and although this wig has some slight layering towards the bottom the longest layer is actually 74cm/29in! The layering of the wig is okay, but looks unrealistic to me....in my opinion. According to the description this wig is supposed to have a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shine, i can agree with the shine but certainly not natural. The wig is very poorly constructed and the wig has a &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; at the top where the closure is. The shedding is THE WORST! This thing started shedding the minute i removed it from the packaging. it sheds when you comb it (with the comb that came along) I tried &amp;#34;finger combing&amp;#34; and that was even worse. Even when i walked around my house with the wig on strands were all on my rug, so this thing is gonna shed whether you are manipulating it or not. The cap of the wig is extremely small. It could certainly fit a child but if your head is a bit &amp;#34;larger you can count this one out! I put the wig on and the complete perimeter of my hair was exposed under those bangs,....not very secure at all. This wig doesn&#x27;t have any combs attached to keep it secure but there are adjustable straps in the back (which are not needed because the cap is already too small)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look guys i will keep it real with anyone who took the time to read this.....Shop around before buying this....even if you just need a cheap wig for Halloween or for cos-play check around first, because this wig needs some improvements. I have seen cheap wigs at my local dollar store that hold up better than this one. With some improvements and a little work it has the potential to be a nice wig though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a picture of me wearing the wig all combed to one side and that was the best i could get this to look but the shedding was still horredous and the wig is actually sitting on the middle of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback and experiences. By no means is my opinions or experiences influenced by the seller or company.can count this one out!

            <li> I am not big on wearing wigs, just because I have so much hair, and never even thought to try them.  But I really like this EmaxDesigns Cosplay wig.  It is perfect for Halloween, which is just around the corner.  I would not wear this for an everyday wig, as the color is so vibrant it will be obvious it is a wig :) The best part is that it includes a cap to put over your hair, to help the wig fit better, and a very nice comb so that you can keep your wig looking new and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;For someone who doesn&#x27;t wear wigs, this was very easy to put on and adjust. The only issue I had was the bangs are right in your face and it takes a bit to get them adjusted so that you can see. But the wig itself is great quality and I am really glad I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.
