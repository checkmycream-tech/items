            <li>seriously amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still amazing!</li>
            <li>best color and easy even spray application ......</li>
            <li>Like the lotion, it is pleasant in smell and does a good shop of touch- up and fill in.  </li>
            <li>a light coat every night is best.</li>
            <li>but this is a good running up.</li>
            <li>if you do it correctly it sprays fairly well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good value</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really fair</li>
            <li>even know if the product was good or not</li>
            <li>I have found that using a makeup sponge is the best way to apply it, as it can quickly discolor the palms of your hands.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>Trust me I have tried tons of sunless tanners and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE TRIED EVERYTHING LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This product is very good for a quick bronze color.</li>
            <li>and it would look amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it come sprays spotty instead of a nice mist.</li>
            <li>one is the absolute best!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice if you want to look tan for a day, but as soon as you wash your face or body, it washes off.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>I love the lotion, so I figured the spray will be as good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very blendable and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I spray it on at night and wake up with a nice tan that lasts 4-6 days.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent self-tanner that provides a very healthy, natural looking tan for those with medium skin tones.</li>
            <li>I love this tanner - it is a great self tanner that is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Great., quick, no orange...</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to just spray myself.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Great natural colour even on fair skin.</li>
            <li>Great first tan</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>It is literally better than the mystic Tan or Versa.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite self tanner for years.  </li>
            <li>and I always keep a bottle stocked in my bathroom:)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and you have to use more.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning spray for 2 reasons.  </li>
            <li>I wear a rubber glove to rub it in and make sure it&#x27;s even</li>
            <li>; during the week would keep it up better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s part of my routine :)</li>
            <li>Applying on myself also wrks, just gotta be creative.  </li>
            <li>Love this tan spray.</li>
            <li>if you have someone who can do your back for you, it&#x27;s perfect!  </li>
            <li>so this gives me a beautiful natural looking color.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>It smells ok but it does come off easy in the shower and onto clothing.  </li>
            <li>i love the light texture of it :)</li>
            <li>and when I build it darker it will look even more fantastic.</li>
            <li>We needed a good spray tan fast.</li>
            <li>Easy to see application</li>
            <li>, it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply with the spray aerosol and goes on even.  </li>
            <li>I do tan easily</li>
            <li>No orange, no stickiness, easy to use spray.</li>
            <li>I find this combination is the most economical and keeps me moisturized.</li>
            <li>I use a mitt to help smooth it in.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>We had used Sun products in the past and been very happy.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the sweet smell when you apply it, could be a lotions smell.  </li>
            <li>like a wks worth of sun in Hawaii!</li>
            <li>I prefer the spray over the lotion as far as outcome, but lotion is more appealing to apply.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get used to it on your arms before spraying your hands :) make sure to mist them lightly as well as your face :) I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li>Its very effective and lasts a long time on my skin, about 8 days.</li>
            <li>It may sound like a lot to do but it is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>The lotion gives beautiful color but it smells funny and you will be greasy for a long time.</li>
            <li>This product is true to its name and its reviews.</li>
            <li>The bottle is full but will not spray no matter what I try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I really try I can find a way to even out the color</li>
            <li>This product was good, it didn&#x27;t streak and provided an instant color.</li>
            <li>Now this product, I absolutely love, dries fast,</li>
            <li>and it goes on pretty easily</li>
            <li>For a quick darker tan on your face.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m an avid \\&quot;self tanning spray\\&quot; user but my normal kind continutes to go up in price</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and looks incredibly natural.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Sun goes on easy and dries fast, for a quick tan before going out for the day or a quick tan before going out for the evening.</li>
            <li>Although I do not use it on my whole body as this bottle would be consumed very quickly but just on my face and neck in the winter time when I cannot go in the sun.</li>
            <li>Put it on at night and you will be nicely tanned the next day.</li>
            <li>(your toes will be lighter, but that&#x27;s more natural, like you&#x27;ve had your toes in the sand).</li>
            <li>By far my favorite tanning product is xen-tan</li>
            <li>The tan is the most natural looking that I have ever seen with a spray tan.</li>
            <li>The color is instant and leaves a nice bronze, suntanned color.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the price</li>
            <li>The spray goes on nice and even and the instant color is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>but totally worth</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite self tanning product.  </li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to when it comes to applying but so worth it</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and just the right color - not orange! - to look natural.</li>
            <li>and I am buying another bottle right now.</li>
            <li>I had to wipe off right away .</li>
            <li>use a 1/2 inch sponge paint roller right after you spray to even it out.  </li>
            <li>People ask me where I got such a good tan and when I tell them it&#x27;s sunless they are very surprised.</li>
            <li>my only issue with it is that i feel it washes off in the shower quite a bit unless if you don&#x27;t shower for a couple of days, which is sort of gross lol.</li>
            <li>Make sure you hold it kind of far from the face though as it could go on too dark.</li>
            <li>I am very very fare skinned.  </li>
            <li>I have taken to applying it by spraying it first on my hands then applying it to my body.  </li>
            <li>Put the spray on first then put the cream version (delivery system is a pump).  </li>
            <li>Never had a problem and probably shouldn&#x27;t have tried switching in the first place.</li>
            <li>At the end of the week, it definitely needs to be re-upped, but if I use it more</li>
            <li>Then open the shower and pat your feet throughly with the sponge, cleaning up ankles and the top and sides of your feet and patting</li>
            <li>I have used this several years and still love it.  </li>
            <li>great color, no smell, long lasting, and an even looking color!</li>
            <li>After you wash your face for the first time after using it, a lot of it comes off.</li>
            <li>First, is you don&#x27;t have to rub anything in and get your hands stained.</li>
            <li>Also love the spray, if there is someone that can help you, I DEFINITELY SUGGEST THE SPRAY.</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s even more amazing is that there is hardly a scent to it!</li>
            <li>It is a nice brown color, not so orange like some other brands.</li>
            <li>I used the flawless spray and mitt and then switched to the lotion as the spray just didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>Use it three days in a row and you will be nice and dark.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried all of them, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, if you need a quick fix, this is the way to go...</li>
            <li>For any drips or streaks pat area gently with a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than Infinity Sun Glow on the Go and</li>
            <li>If outside is not possible, I use the shower for easy clean up.</li>
            <li>If you feel like you sprayed too much just dap it with some tissue to even it out.</li>
            <li>I have no streaks, and because it dries fast I could put it on an hour before an event</li>
            <li>and I think that really helps.  </li>
            <li>Its very streaky.  </li>
            <li>Which is fine with me, I like a more subtle look.</li>
            <li>mean, maybe it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought thru other sellers and had a better experience</li>
            <li>Very smooth beautiful color, slightly less olive then Fake Bake</li>
            <li>Looks pretty natural once you get it going.</li>
            <li>Works well - kind of messy but was warned!</li>
            <li>and I think this looks natural and lasts pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Shake can well and spray legs quickly and evenly,moving can in a circular motion, twisting and turning to cover all areas, front, back and in between.</li>
            <li>Other positives are - - it is easy to use, sprays evenly and is streak-free.</li>
            <li>It does not last too long but maybe like a week at the most.</li>
            <li>First off, if you are pale with NO base tan at all then you should rethink buying this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that looks like a real tan and not orange like most other self tanning products.  </li>
            <li>The picture was taken right after I tanned so it does have instant color.</li>
            <li>I do have to use this in the shower, because the spray can get on walls and floor, but it easily washes off the walls and down the shower drain without staining.</li>
            <li>and I like to try the new ones that come out</li>
            <li>But I still live the product</li>
            <li>It does dry quickly and does not come off on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanners and for a long time I was satisfied with Fake Bake&#x27;s products, I love their color, slightly olive and very natural.</li>
            <li>The color is very natural looking</li>
            <li>it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>and you can get a shower in the morning safely with losing very little color.</li>
            <li>not sure how healthy that is....     </li>
            <li>You are able to go from pale and pasty to super dark and not orange.  </li>
            <li>Now check yourself in a full-length mirror and gently dab and pat streaks or drips with the sponge.</li>
            <li>Spray is sort of messy but cleans up easy.</li>
            <li>Ok, so this is my first time using Sun Products, I did 2 tests both on my left thigh, the first coat came out 2 shades darker then my reddish pale white skin, the second  </li>
            <li>And the other drawback is you really need to spray it either on top of a large dark towel or blanket or in a shower/bathtub or outside</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly, needs a little blending but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as natural looking.  </li>
            <li>and so far I like it</li>
            <li>She sprays it on the night before and is ready to go the next day.</li>
            <li>It does look natural.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this over their lotion, because I feel the lotion doesn&#x27;t look as natural.  </li>
            <li>Completely covers my vitaligo.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost completely gone, so a &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It gives off an orange color rather than the natural tan the lotion gives.</li>
            <li>I definately prefer the professional spray tan with this solution however.  </li>
            <li>The spray nozzle wouldnt work what a waste of money a whole bottle worth.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a decent amount of time and fades pretty evenly other than on the hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>Wash your hands thoroughy, using a nail brush; you should only have dark spots on the tips of your fingers where you held the sponge, and they come off easily, but if it bothers you wear gloves.  </li>
            <li>I wait a couple min &#x27;til its pretty dry</li>
            <li>If you have a decent base tan then you might be able to use it and it look ok.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone asked me if I just got back from the beach</li>
            <li>Once you dry, turn on the shower to clean up the spray tan in there and rinse out your rag, being careful not to splash yourself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been scrubbing my hands for the past couple hours to clean them.</li>
            <li>you can end up with demarcation lines around your arms just like your ankles if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>Sprays on evenly for natural color and would recommend to anyone especially to cover flaws and imperfections.</li>
            <li>It does not last long but does look a natural color</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED EVERYTHING LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> This product is very good for a quick bronze color.</li>
            <li> and it would look amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it come sprays spotty instead of a nice mist.</li>
            <li> one is the absolute best!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice if you want to look tan for a day, but as soon as you wash your face or body, it washes off.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love the lotion, so I figured the spray will be as good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very blendable and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I spray it on at night and wake up with a nice tan that lasts 4-6 days.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent self-tanner that provides a very healthy, natural looking tan for those with medium skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love this tanner - it is a great self tanner that is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Great., quick, no orange...</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to just spray myself.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Great natural colour even on fair skin.</li>
            <li> Great first tan</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> It is literally better than the mystic Tan or Versa.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite self tanner for years.  </li>
            <li> and I always keep a bottle stocked in my bathroom:)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and you have to use more.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning spray for 2 reasons.  </li>
            <li> I wear a rubber glove to rub it in and make sure it&#x27;s even</li>
            <li> ; during the week would keep it up better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of my routine :)</li>
            <li> Applying on myself also wrks, just gotta be creative.  </li>
            <li> Love this tan spray.</li>
            <li> if you have someone who can do your back for you, it&#x27;s perfect!  </li>
            <li> so this gives me a beautiful natural looking color.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> It smells ok but it does come off easy in the shower and onto clothing.  </li>
            <li> i love the light texture of it :)</li>
            <li> and when I build it darker it will look even more fantastic.</li>
            <li> We needed a good spray tan fast.</li>
            <li> Easy to see application</li>
            <li> , it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply with the spray aerosol and goes on even.  </li>
            <li> I do tan easily</li>
            <li> No orange, no stickiness, easy to use spray.</li>
            <li> I find this combination is the most economical and keeps me moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use a mitt to help smooth it in.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> We had used Sun products in the past and been very happy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the sweet smell when you apply it, could be a lotions smell.  </li>
            <li> like a wks worth of sun in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> I prefer the spray over the lotion as far as outcome, but lotion is more appealing to apply.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get used to it on your arms before spraying your hands :) make sure to mist them lightly as well as your face :) I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> Its very effective and lasts a long time on my skin, about 8 days.</li>
            <li> It may sound like a lot to do but it is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> The lotion gives beautiful color but it smells funny and you will be greasy for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is true to its name and its reviews.</li>
            <li> The bottle is full but will not spray no matter what I try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I really try I can find a way to even out the color</li>
            <li> This product was good, it didn&#x27;t streak and provided an instant color.</li>
            <li> Now this product, I absolutely love, dries fast,</li>
            <li> and it goes on pretty easily</li>
            <li> For a quick darker tan on your face.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m an avid \\&quot;self tanning spray\\&quot; user but my normal kind continutes to go up in price</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and looks incredibly natural.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Sun goes on easy and dries fast, for a quick tan before going out for the day or a quick tan before going out for the evening.</li>
            <li> Although I do not use it on my whole body as this bottle would be consumed very quickly but just on my face and neck in the winter time when I cannot go in the sun.</li>
            <li> Put it on at night and you will be nicely tanned the next day.</li>
            <li> (your toes will be lighter, but that&#x27;s more natural, like you&#x27;ve had your toes in the sand).</li>
            <li> By far my favorite tanning product is xen-tan</li>
            <li> The tan is the most natural looking that I have ever seen with a spray tan.</li>
            <li> The color is instant and leaves a nice bronze, suntanned color.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the price</li>
            <li> The spray goes on nice and even and the instant color is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> but totally worth</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite self tanning product.  </li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to when it comes to applying but so worth it</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and just the right color - not orange! - to look natural.</li>
            <li> and I am buying another bottle right now.</li>
            <li> I had to wipe off right away .</li>
            <li> use a 1/2 inch sponge paint roller right after you spray to even it out.  </li>
            <li> People ask me where I got such a good tan and when I tell them it&#x27;s sunless they are very surprised.</li>
            <li> my only issue with it is that i feel it washes off in the shower quite a bit unless if you don&#x27;t shower for a couple of days, which is sort of gross lol.</li>
            <li> Make sure you hold it kind of far from the face though as it could go on too dark.</li>
            <li> I am very very fare skinned.  </li>
            <li> I have taken to applying it by spraying it first on my hands then applying it to my body.  </li>
            <li> Put the spray on first then put the cream version (delivery system is a pump).  </li>
            <li> Never had a problem and probably shouldn&#x27;t have tried switching in the first place.</li>
            <li> At the end of the week, it definitely needs to be re-upped, but if I use it more</li>
            <li> Then open the shower and pat your feet throughly with the sponge, cleaning up ankles and the top and sides of your feet and patting</li>
            <li> I have used this several years and still love it.  </li>
            <li> great color, no smell, long lasting, and an even looking color!</li>
            <li> After you wash your face for the first time after using it, a lot of it comes off.</li>
            <li> First, is you don&#x27;t have to rub anything in and get your hands stained.</li>
            <li> Also love the spray, if there is someone that can help you, I DEFINITELY SUGGEST THE SPRAY.</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s even more amazing is that there is hardly a scent to it!</li>
            <li> It is a nice brown color, not so orange like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I used the flawless spray and mitt and then switched to the lotion as the spray just didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> Use it three days in a row and you will be nice and dark.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all of them, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, if you need a quick fix, this is the way to go...</li>
            <li> For any drips or streaks pat area gently with a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than Infinity Sun Glow on the Go and</li>
            <li> If outside is not possible, I use the shower for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> If you feel like you sprayed too much just dap it with some tissue to even it out.</li>
            <li> I have no streaks, and because it dries fast I could put it on an hour before an event</li>
            <li> and I think that really helps.  </li>
            <li> Its very streaky.  </li>
            <li> Which is fine with me, I like a more subtle look.</li>
            <li> mean, maybe it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought thru other sellers and had a better experience</li>
            <li> Very smooth beautiful color, slightly less olive then Fake Bake</li>
            <li> Looks pretty natural once you get it going.</li>
            <li> Works well - kind of messy but was warned!</li>
            <li> and I think this looks natural and lasts pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Shake can well and spray legs quickly and evenly,moving can in a circular motion, twisting and turning to cover all areas, front, back and in between.</li>
            <li> Other positives are - - it is easy to use, sprays evenly and is streak-free.</li>
            <li> It does not last too long but maybe like a week at the most.</li>
            <li> First off, if you are pale with NO base tan at all then you should rethink buying this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that looks like a real tan and not orange like most other self tanning products.  </li>
            <li> The picture was taken right after I tanned so it does have instant color.</li>
            <li> I do have to use this in the shower, because the spray can get on walls and floor, but it easily washes off the walls and down the shower drain without staining.</li>
            <li> and I like to try the new ones that come out</li>
            <li> But I still live the product</li>
            <li> It does dry quickly and does not come off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners and for a long time I was satisfied with Fake Bake&#x27;s products, I love their color, slightly olive and very natural.</li>
            <li> The color is very natural looking</li>
            <li> it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> and you can get a shower in the morning safely with losing very little color.</li>
            <li> not sure how healthy that is....     </li>
            <li> You are able to go from pale and pasty to super dark and not orange.  </li>
            <li> Now check yourself in a full-length mirror and gently dab and pat streaks or drips with the sponge.</li>
            <li> Spray is sort of messy but cleans up easy.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my first time using Sun Products, I did 2 tests both on my left thigh, the first coat came out 2 shades darker then my reddish pale white skin, the second  </li>
            <li> And the other drawback is you really need to spray it either on top of a large dark towel or blanket or in a shower/bathtub or outside</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly, needs a little blending but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as natural looking.  </li>
            <li> and so far I like it</li>
            <li> She sprays it on the night before and is ready to go the next day.</li>
            <li> It does look natural.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this over their lotion, because I feel the lotion doesn&#x27;t look as natural.  </li>
            <li> Completely covers my vitaligo.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost completely gone, so a &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It gives off an orange color rather than the natural tan the lotion gives.</li>
            <li> I definately prefer the professional spray tan with this solution however.  </li>
            <li> The spray nozzle wouldnt work what a waste of money a whole bottle worth.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a decent amount of time and fades pretty evenly other than on the hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> Wash your hands thoroughy, using a nail brush; you should only have dark spots on the tips of your fingers where you held the sponge, and they come off easily, but if it bothers you wear gloves.  </li>
            <li> I wait a couple min &#x27;til its pretty dry</li>
            <li> If you have a decent base tan then you might be able to use it and it look ok.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone asked me if I just got back from the beach</li>
            <li> Once you dry, turn on the shower to clean up the spray tan in there and rinse out your rag, being careful not to splash yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been scrubbing my hands for the past couple hours to clean them.</li>
            <li> you can end up with demarcation lines around your arms just like your ankles if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> Sprays on evenly for natural color and would recommend to anyone especially to cover flaws and imperfections.</li>
            <li> It does not last long but does look a natural color</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used the \\&quot;at home\\&quot; solution and my only complaint</li>
            <li> then try to stay naked as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> I really hope it doesn&#x27;t look streaky in a few hours!</li>
            <li> The spray tends to dry your skin over time so using the cream keeps it moist.</li>
            <li> Dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I keep checking for splatters I missed (on the back of legs, arms, back) and had to scrub a few out.</li>
            <li> lightened 1/2 a shade, but is still dark enough to satisfy what I wanted, will keep updating as the week goes on, on how long it lasts, before fadding and needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> especially if you&#x27;re trying to get dark before a photo shoot or something.</li>
            <li> As a side note, I would highly recommend applying the self-tanner while standing inside a tub/shower, as it is a little messy.</li>
            <li> costcoat came out 5 shades darker, and both coats turned me brown, not orange, like all of the other self tanners have in the past, so if you are a natural strawberry blonde, with reddish pale white skin, this is the correct product for you.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use it again because it&#x27;s just such a mess applying it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long and you have to reapply almost everyday but for the price</li>
            <li> Also, If you don&#x27;t hold the can at least 8-10 inches away from your body it will leave large spots of heavy color.</li>
            <li> i slop on the cream and and the streaking is minimal.  </li>
            <li> People always say I&#x27;m so tan, and I haven&#x27;t spent a moment in the sun...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other spray tan than this.</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to give you that orangy look like some of the other self tanning products.</li>
            <li> I use it just about every other night just before going to bed..</li>
            <li> Plus, I used to work at a tanning salon and this is the solution that we used, of course in a different form (not in a small can).  </li>
            <li> I have other at home sprays that I prefer to this one.</li>
            <li> Seems more orange than previous orders:(</li>
            <li> I find this a little harder to get even than the lotion.</li>
            <li> In between I use the Banana Boat Ultra Dark lotion.</li>
            <li> terrible spray...not a micro mist at all....came out more in clumps and the color was more dirty looking instead of being a &amp;#34;dark tan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not too dark.</li>
            <li> I spray in on in the shower and then rinse shower down to avoid staining my bathroom.</li>
            <li> When I sprayed to my body , black ink dripping over my body .  </li>
            <li> Stand in a closed shower on a small rag, wrapping the rag up to cover your toes.</li>
            <li> I am pale with dark hair</li>
            <li> Oh, and I wash my hands using a sponge and a little comet cleanser to keep them from getting brown.</li>
            <li> It can splatter sometimes while it sprays and give you a little freckly loon in places.</li>
            <li> Sephora self-tanning spray is much better, it doesn&#x27;t come out so awkwardly and weird</li>
            <li> You have a few minutes before it dries.</li>
            <li> This product has a green undertone so it gives a browner tan without the orange.  </li>
            <li> Kind of reminded me of the awful look of when &amp;#34;QT&amp;#34; came out over 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried every self tanner on the market, and wasted hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so messy</li>
            <li> and it comes out so uneven.</li>
            <li> Also, it can spray unevenly sometime, so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy, so do it in the bathtub,, with the water running, or your feet will end up black!  </li>
            <li> but I cannot stand the mess!</li>
            <li> hands down fav!!</li>
            <li> and I tried this only to find that it looked horribly fake and orange.  </li>
            <li> and when I wake up in the morning, I do notice a hint of smell, but I just shower as usual.  </li>
            <li> I usually spray it on and then blend it in.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, I found that the overspray from this isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as fake bakes.</li>
            <li> Very messy application though.</li>
            <li> Fake bake tended to get into pores and if you had any dry skin it would get in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them all and this looks the least orange on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I just use rubber gloves, I find that the it sucks up the color like a sponge sometimes</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than any other tanner I have used and instead of coming off in an uneven way it merely fades away without weird streaks or splotches</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d try a less expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Coats are very subtle and very little to no streaking.</li>
            <li> also i noticed it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes hardly at all!</li>
            <li> Oh, it lasts approximately 5 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used at home products before, such as Norvel, but this was just plain awful.</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to get it even and covered across all areas of your body.</li>
            <li> However, application is very difficult as it concentrates when you begin to spray and then drips.  </li>
            <li> Sunless deals sold me this product very unhappy how the product came</li>
            <li> was a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> I just hated this product.  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is crap!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE !</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever .  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best self tanning product on the market!!  Absolutely LOVE it!  I can go from being totally winter white,  to wearing shorts in 1 application.</li>
            <li> I like the micro spray and the color it gives. Looks pretty natural once you get it going. I have taken to applying it by spraying it first on my hands then applying it to my body.  Put it on at night and you will be nicely tanned the next day. Use it three days in a row and you will be nice and dark.  For a quick darker tan on your face. Put the spray on first then put the cream version (delivery system is a pump).  The spray tends to dry your skin over time so using the cream keeps it moist. Oh, and I wash my hands using a sponge and a little comet cleanser to keep them from getting brown. Then just wash with soap and water to get the comet smell out.  It may sound like a lot to do but it is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them all and this looks the least orange on my skin. a light coat every night is best.</li>
            <li> I found this in Bed Bath and Beyond and decided to give it a try.   DO NOT spray this in an open room. Go outside or in a shower stall. It splatters, A LOT and you have no choice but to rub it in. I had nothing around so I had to use my hands. I&#x27;ve been scrubbing my hands for the past couple hours to clean them. I keep checking for splatters I missed (on the back of legs, arms, back) and had to scrub a few out. I just touched up by spraying on a make up sponge and applying. I really hope it doesn&#x27;t look streaky in a few hours! I&#x27;m kinda sitting here panicking waiting to see what the end result will be. I probably won&#x27;t use it again because it&#x27;s just such a mess applying it. I have a back up can of Loreal&#x27;s airbrush and I&#x27;ll go back to that. Never had a problem and probably shouldn&#x27;t have tried switching in the first place.</li>
            <li> I often use this product after  tanning lotion applications.  Like the lotion, it is pleasant in smell and does a good shop of touch- up and fill in.  Easy to see application, it is easy to apply.  I saved several dollars by ordering online rather from a retailer.  I plan to shop again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent self-tanner that provides a very healthy, natural looking tan for those with medium skin tones. Other positives are - - it is easy to use, sprays evenly and is streak-free. Oh, it lasts approximately 5 days. As a side note, I would highly recommend applying the self-tanner while standing inside a tub/shower, as it is a little messy.</li>
            <li> seriously amazing! hands down fav!! now amazon lower the price please. got this for $10 last summer.</li>
            <li> First off, if you are pale with NO base tan at all then you should rethink buying this product.  I am pale with dark hair and I tried this only to find that it looked horribly fake and orange.  For starters, it doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle in an even spray.  It comes out in splotches and you end up having to rub it in.  It smells ok but it does come off easy in the shower and onto clothing.  I was so horrified at how orange I looked that I couldn&#x27;t leave my house until it was all gone.  I just hated this product.  If you have a decent base tan then you might be able to use it and it look ok.  I just didn&#x27;t like it at all and I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have used almost every self tanner out there and I like to try the new ones that come out but I keep going back to this one. Its very effective and lasts a long time on my skin, about 8 days.</li>
            <li> I use this spray tanner once a week and have been using it for years. In between I use the Banana Boat Ultra Dark lotion. I find this combination is the most economical and keeps me moisturized. At the end of the week, it definitely needs to be re-upped, but if I use it more it&#x27;s not as natural looking.  Here are my tips: Shower and exfoliate. Dry thoroughly. Stand in a closed shower on a small rag, wrapping the rag up to cover your toes. Shake can well and spray legs quickly and evenly,moving can in a circular motion, twisting and turning to cover all areas, front, back and in between. Do the same for your arms, chest, torso and upper back. Lift your arms and mist undersides including armpits...you can end up with demarcation lines around your arms just like your ankles if you&#x27;re not careful.  For any drips or streaks pat area gently with a makeup sponge. Then open the shower and pat your feet throughly with the sponge, cleaning up ankles and the top and sides of your feet and patting/smoothing over your toe area (your toes will be lighter, but that&#x27;s more natural, like you&#x27;ve had your toes in the sand). Now check yourself in a full-length mirror and gently dab and pat streaks or drips with the sponge. You have a few minutes before it dries. You can use any excess on the make-up sponge on your face, if you wish, but I find it doesn&#x27;t last on your face anyway and tends to create blackheads over time, so I just apply a dab of SPF cream mixed with a darker-than-skin-color creamy makeup to even that out. Once you dry, turn on the shower to clean up the spray tan in there and rinse out your rag, being careful not to splash yourself. Wash your hands thoroughy, using a nail brush; you should only have dark spots on the tips of your fingers where you held the sponge, and they come off easily, but if it bothers you wear gloves.  If I get a dud can that sprays dribbles (and you will get one if you buy it enough) just spray on and dab and pat with the makeup sponge as you go.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this product for over 5 years!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just use that and so far I like it the colors great and it goes on pretty easily but you definitely need a tanning mit. By far my favorite tanning product is xen-tan but this is a good running up. The picture was taken right after I tanned so it does have instant color.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Love it!!! So much cheaper than Infinity Sun Glow on the Go and much better color!! Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone asked me if I just got back from the beach I have a beautiful brown glow!</li>
            <li> Great! Just don&#x27;t spray with your contact lenses in....</li>
            <li> Sun goes on easy and dries fast, for a quick tan before going out for the day or a quick tan before going out for the evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing a lot of self tanners for a bodybuilding photoshoot and didn&#x27;t want the hassle of pro tan. This product is outstanding.  Great first tan and when I build it darker it will look even more fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  It gives a great glow to your skin. It&#x27;s truly the best!</li>
            <li> Works well - kind of messy but was warned! Like the color. I prefer the spray over the lotion as far as outcome, but lotion is more appealing to apply.</li>
            <li> I have used this several years and still love it.  It&#x27;s been my choice ever since. Price and product are great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!! The tan is the most natural looking that I have ever seen with a spray tan. My daughter uses it for Irish dance competitions. She sprays it on the night before and is ready to go the next day. No orange colors or streaking. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other spray tan than this. It is literally better than the mystic Tan or Versa. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems more orange than previous orders:(</li>
            <li> Worth the cost!! No streaks! no orange color</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly, needs a little blending but so does every self tanning product.  This product has a green undertone so it gives a browner tan without the orange.  When my &amp;#34;got too&amp;#34; Norvell changed they&#x27;re self tanners and left me orange I had to find an alternative and this it!</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my first time using Sun Products, I did 2 tests both on my left thigh, the first coat came out 2 shades darker then my reddish pale white skin, the second  costcoat came out 5 shades darker, and both coats turned me brown, not orange, like all of the other self tanners have in the past, so if you are a natural strawberry blonde, with reddish pale white skin, this is the correct product for you. See pictures of my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I washed the area were I applied the self tanner and the color lightened 1/2 a shade, but is still dark enough to satisfy what I wanted, will keep updating as the week goes on, on how long it lasts, before fadding and needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> The color is definitely instant and lasts several days.  It does look natural.  However, application is very difficult as it concentrates when you begin to spray and then drips.  It is also difficult to get it even and covered across all areas of your body.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite self tanner for years.  It is very easy to apply and looks incredibly natural. It lasts longer than any other tanner I have used and instead of coming off in an uneven way it merely fades away without weird streaks or splotches</li>
            <li> This product is true to its name and its reviews. The color is instant and leaves a nice bronze, suntanned color. However, the spray version of this product does present some issues. Sometimes it come sprays spotty instead of a nice mist. Also, If you don&#x27;t hold the can at least 8-10 inches away from your body it will leave large spots of heavy color. You may also want to cover your feet when spraying the rest of your body, and be prepared to mop the floor when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  It&#x27;s the only product that looks like a real tan and not orange like most other self tanning products.  It&#x27;s easy to apply with the spray aerosol and goes on even.  I would recommend this over their lotion, because I feel the lotion doesn&#x27;t look as natural.  Best product out there!</li>
            <li> if you do it correctly it sprays fairly well. my only issue with it is that i feel it washes off in the shower quite a bit unless if you don&#x27;t shower for a couple of days, which is sort of gross lol. other than that though the color really is great. especially if you&#x27;re trying to get dark before a photo shoot or something. also i noticed it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes hardly at all! i&#x27;m very impressed with that.</li>
            <li> best color and easy even spray application ......I have been using faux tan sprays for years.&lt;br /&gt;This one is the absolute best!!</li>
            <li> terrible spray...not a micro mist at all....came out more in clumps and the color was more dirty looking instead of being a &amp;#34;dark tan&amp;#34; color..I&#x27;ve used at home products before, such as Norvel, but this was just plain awful. I&#x27;ve worked in a tanning salon for 7 years and wanted to give my skin a break, but this product, never again. Kind of reminded me of the awful look of when &amp;#34;QT&amp;#34; came out over 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> Trust me I have tried tons of sunless tanners and this is my favorite! I do tan easily so this gives me a beautiful natural looking color. People ask me where I got such a good tan and when I tell them it&#x27;s sunless they are very surprised. This stuff is worth the price and I always keep a bottle stocked in my bathroom:)</li>
            <li> I love this tanner - it is a great self tanner that is easy to use.  Coats are very subtle and very little to no streaking.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the only product that I can have an instant tan for that day. It is a nice brown color, not so orange like some other brands. The trick is to spray on with a circular motion. I also spray it on outside. If outside is not possible, I use the shower for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried every self tanner on the market, and wasted hundreds of dollars. Not anymore.  This product is WONDERFUL! I have very fair skin, and this gives me a great sun kissed glow! And what&#x27;s even more amazing is that there is hardly a scent to it! I put in on before bed and when I wake up in the morning, I do notice a hint of smell, but I just shower as usual.  This stuff is amazing! I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> The spray goes on nice and even and the instant color is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all. It&#x27;s nice if you want to look tan for a day, but as soon as you wash your face or body, it washes off.  Now, I&#x27;m an avid \\&quot;self tanning spray\\&quot; user but my normal kind continutes to go up in price so I figured I&#x27;d try a less expensive brand. So, I know to exfoliate before-hand and to not scrub my skin if I want to keep the color on, but it just doesn&#x27;t last at all.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan. I&#x27;ll stick with my more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Sunless deals sold me this product very unhappy how the product came I&#x27;ve bought thru other sellers and had a better experience</li>
            <li> this is the only brand of tanning stuff i will use. great color, no smell, long lasting, and an even looking color! you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is so nice to be able to just spray myself. Although I do not use it on my whole body as this bottle would be consumed very quickly but just on my face and neck in the winter time when I cannot go in the sun. Make sure you hold it kind of far from the face though as it could go on too dark. It also gets darker once you leave it on for a while. If you feel like you sprayed too much just dap it with some tissue to even it out. It does not last too long but maybe like a week at the most. After you wash your face for the first time after using it, a lot of it comes off. Which is fine with me, I like a more subtle look.</li>
            <li> Great natural colour even on fair skin. Very messy application though. I spray in on in the shower and then rinse shower down to avoid staining my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great., quick, no orange...</li>
            <li> The bottle came and didn&#x27;t even spray.</li>
            <li> We had used Sun products in the past and been very happy. We needed a good spray tan fast. Sun Self Tanning was perfect. Easy to apply and just the right color - not orange! - to look natural. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Product came damaged! The bottle is full but will not spray no matter what I try.</li>
            <li> This is crap! I love the lotion, so I figured the spray will be as good but it&#x27;s so messy and it comes out so uneven. I had orange spots all over me the next day! I&#x27;m sure if I really try I can find a way to even out the color but I cannot stand the mess! I can&#x27;t imagine scrubbing my bathtub for 20 minutes after each application. Not worth it. I don&#x27;t even wanna give this product another try. I will stick with the lotion.</li>
            <li> This product was good, it didn&#x27;t streak and provided an instant color. It doesn&#x27;t last very long and you have to reapply almost everyday but for the price it&#x27;s a good value</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners and for a long time I was satisfied with Fake Bake&#x27;s products, I love their color, slightly olive and very natural. I used the flawless spray and mitt and then switched to the lotion as the spray just didn&#x27;t last long enough. The lotion gives beautiful color but it smells funny and you will be greasy for a long time. Which I didn&#x27;t like. Both products also stain clothes and bed sheets. Now this product, I absolutely love, dries fast, no smell after it dries whatsoever. Very smooth beautiful color, slightly less olive then Fake Bake but totally worth it&#x27;s benefits. It is easy to apply, I found that the overspray from this isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as fake bakes. I have no streaks, and because it dries fast I could put it on an hour before an event and it would look amazing. Some people say to use a mitt but I just use rubber gloves, I find that the it sucks up the color like a sponge sometimes and you have to use more. I also find that this looks better on my face then fake bake did. Fake bake tended to get into pores and if you had any dry skin it would get in it. It&#x27;s very blendable and beautiful! I enjoy the sweet smell when you apply it, could be a lotions smell.  I definitely recommend this and I am buying another bottle right now. Best I&#x27;ve used so far. Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> No orange, no stickiness, easy to use spray. I spray it on at night and wake up with a nice tan that lasts 4-6 days. It uses a color so you can see where it goes. I usually spray it on and then blend it in. I do have to use this in the shower, because the spray can get on walls and floor, but it easily washes off the walls and down the shower drain without staining.</li>
            <li> I love the sun lab tanning lotion but this!!!! HORRIBLE !&lt;br /&gt;I mean, maybe it&#x27;s good if you apply it then rub it in but I thought it was like&lt;br /&gt;easy as in - just spray it and leave it !!&lt;br /&gt;The Sephora self-tanning spray is much better, it doesn&#x27;t come out so awkwardly and weird&lt;br /&gt;n doesn&#x27;t require rubbing in at all.&lt;br /&gt;This was a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> This was received just as promised and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I will purchase product again. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Works great. Not too dark. Spray is sort of messy but cleans up easy. Will buy again. One bottle last awhile</li>
            <li> I find this a little harder to get even than the lotion. It does dry quickly and does not come off on your clothes. I use it in combination with the lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning spray for 2 reasons.  First, is you don&#x27;t have to rub anything in and get your hands stained. And second, it gives you an instant tan as well as a tan that develops over hours. There&#x27;s are a couple of drawbacks though with this. It can splatter sometimes while it sprays and give you a little freckly loon in places. And the other drawback is you really need to spray it either on top of a large dark towel or blanket or in a shower/bathtub or outside so you don&#x27;t stain your flooring.  But I still live the product and I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to give you that orangy look like some of the other self tanning products.</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever .  When I sprayed to my body , black ink dripping over my body .  I had to wipe off right away .</li>
            <li> Completely covers my vitaligo.  Sprays on evenly for natural color and would recommend to anyone especially to cover flaws and imperfections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really fair and I think this looks natural and lasts pretty well.  I wear a rubber glove to rub it in and make sure it&#x27;s even and I think that really helps.  I only do it once a week, but by the time I do it again it&#x27;s almost completely gone, so a &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; during the week would keep it up better.  Anyway, I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle wouldnt work what a waste of money a whole bottle worth. I will not buy agian.wouldnt even know if the product was good or not</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite self tanning product.  I have found that using a makeup sponge is the best way to apply it, as it can quickly discolor the palms of your hands.  That is the &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; downside to the product that I have found.  The color is very natural looking and I always get compliments.  It needs to be reapplied every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> Spray is nothing like the lotion. It gives off an orange color rather than the natural tan the lotion gives. Wouldnt recommend this product just buy the lotion form!</li>
            <li> Very impressed how well it works. I&#x27;m going to order more.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t turn yellow and doesn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li> l&lt;br /&gt;Looks like a wks worth of sun in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product! I use it just about every other night just before going to bed.. Make sure you get used to it on your arms before spraying your hands :) make sure to mist them lightly as well as your face :) I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I will probably never stop. It&#x27;s part of my routine :)</li>
            <li> Perfect color not at all orange. It takes some getting used to when it comes to applying but so worth it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! ALL OF THEM!! I am very very fare skinned.  Almost blue since u can see my veins... this product looks great! i slop on the cream and and the streaking is minimal.  The next day b4 going to bed i go back and touch up.  If you are neater the 1st time around you won&#x27;t need to fix the next day. but i like that i slop it on like a regular cream, takes 30 seconds.  I wait a couple min &#x27;til its pretty dry then try to stay naked as long as possible.  yes i do sleep in it, and some comes off but it&#x27;s still amazing! Also love the spray, if there is someone that can help you, I DEFINITELY SUGGEST THE SPRAY. I think it&#x27;s easier.  Applying on myself also wrks, just gotta be creative.  I put the spray in the shower, or ask my sister to spray me. NOTE I PUT LOTION ON THE BOTTM OF MY FEET AND HEELS AND I WEAR GLOVES. If i get it on spots that i don&#x27;t want i.e. palms or under feet i scrub off w. an exfoliant or ajax... yep ajax, i know. not sure how healthy that is....     I&#x27;VE TRIED EVERYTHING LOVE THIS!  AND THIS IS THE BRAND USED AT THE SALON I WENT TO WHERE I WAS PAYING $40 PER VISIT.</li>
            <li> Love this tan spray. The colour is beautiful not orage at all og i love the light texture of it :)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great color and lasts! Goes on great. I use a mitt to help smooth it in. Lasts about 5 days.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for a quick bronze color. It does not last long but does look a natural color</li>
            <li> I brought this product after hearing great reviews. Plus, I used to work at a tanning salon and this is the solution that we used, of course in a different form (not in a small can).  I like the color it looks very natural. You are able to go from pale and pasty to super dark and not orange.  This is the first time I used the \\&quot;at home\\&quot; solution and my only complaint is that it runs alot.  Its very streaky.  For best results, I noticed using it at night, and sleeping with it allows it to darken for up to 3 hours and you can get a shower in the morning safely with losing very little color. It lasts for a decent amount of time and fades pretty evenly other than on the hands and feet.  I definately prefer the professional spray tan with this solution however.  I have other at home sprays that I prefer to this one.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Hint: use a 1/2 inch sponge paint roller right after you spray to even it out.  Last about 6 days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all of them, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, if you need a quick fix, this is the way to go...People always say I&#x27;m so tan, and I haven&#x27;t spent a moment in the sun...Only one con: it&#x27;s messy, so do it in the bathtub,, with the water running, or your feet will end up black!  Also, it can spray unevenly sometime, so if you have someone who can do your back for you, it&#x27;s perfect!  Love it!!!</li>
