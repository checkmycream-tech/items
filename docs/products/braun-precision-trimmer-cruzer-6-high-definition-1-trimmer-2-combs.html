            <li>Purchased this a couple of years ago and had good luck with it for trimming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>How this product received some good reviews is beyond me.</li>
            <li>Braun is a good company.  </li>
            <li>this item is good for me  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Always there when needed with good battery life.  </li>
            <li>Recommend a good product to buy</li>
            <li>This is for folks who like to keep everything fairly close to the face and well manicured.  </li>
            <li>it is good for me ,from CN</li>
            <li>Braun has a good reputation for quality.</li>
            <li>The price is good but the replacement cycle isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Was good for a year</li>
            <li>Been searching for a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t listen to the good reviews about this trimmer and DON&#x27;T turn in your hard-earned cash for this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>keep the good work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and elegant and I can use it with ease and you can take ane waer</li>
            <li>The packaging and the hype on it would lead you to believe that this is the perfect tool for keeping perfectly trimmed and shaped facial hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight unit made a brand known for exceptional quality.</li>
            <li>I use this to keep things neat and tidy and it works great, better than the drug store brand trimmer I was using.  </li>
            <li>Excellent device for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this three stars for the non-hirsute, but four for those with more testosterone!</li>
            <li>That said, the design is amazing.</li>
            <li>you can get it real cheap, it&#x27;ll trim your &#x27;stache, etc, but don&#x27;t expect Braun-type quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased this to do eyebrows and found it amazing, the 2 included tips let you groom to your preferred length in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li>It gets close to under the nose and trims nicely along the lip line.</li>
            <li>Without the heads, it works nicely to trim hair off of ears and to neaten up the edges of his stache and beard, but won&#x27;t work for keeping his beard or mustache a uniform length.</li>
            <li>and it did help tidy my moustache and sideburns.</li>
            <li>The Braun Cruzer 6 is a nice grooming tool.</li>
            <li>and you can run the blade under the tap which is handy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of case to hold it or the guides.  </li>
            <li>If you know how to cut or trim your own hair.</li>
            <li>Nice, you get what you see...</li>
            <li>Nice and cheap,I like it.</li>
            <li>The guard is nicely designed to trim eyebows well without leaving you with no eyebrows, as some others I&#x27;ve tried have done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wipe off the excess hair from the blade with a paper towel or cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>The build quality is OK, but nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>But, it does do the job and allows for some&lt;br /&gt;really fine trimming!</li>
            <li>However, upon turning the Cruzer on the unit began to make the most horrendous noise.  </li>
            <li>With the guards on this trimmer is nothing more than a comb.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer it cuts fast</li>
            <li>and it is really safe for the skin</li>
            <li>Braun ain&#x27;t made in Germany any more, and boy does it show.</li>
            <li>on, Braun, you can do WAY better.</li>
            <li>It lasted just more than 2 months then died on me.</li>
            <li>It trims finer hair ok, but if you&#x27;re trimming thicker whiskers it may catch on the stubble.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to remove nose and ear hair without much hassle.  </li>
            <li>This means, for example, that I wasn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be able to use the guards at all.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this trimmer for some things.</li>
            <li>I had an oldef one tath worked better...</li>
            <li>I love that you can rinse this under the sink.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and brand name but cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>ok but not what I was looking for to trim around the ears.</li>
            <li>because I have bought this item from different sites many times &amp; Amazon had it for a great price!  </li>
            <li>Ok for trimming eyebrows</li>
            <li>in all i can&#x27;t really recommend it, not too happy with it, but not disgusted with it either :X</li>
            <li>OK, technicalities aside, I&#x27;ll give my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how well they work, but I can&#x27;t imagine any pen-type trimmer performing better than the rest.</li>
            <li>i believe your paying more for design and portability than the product itself</li>
            <li>I am hoping it fares better than this overpriced item.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had it for many months now.</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>If you grow bushy beards and stashes, it may work better for you then it did me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It handles pretty good</li>
            <li>You can very quickly remove more hair than you intend.  </li>
            <li>As I should have read the sizes before purchasing I gave this 4 stars, I am sure it will fit the bill if you are looking for a longer trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with how smoothly it runs.</li>
            <li>In that job, it performed magnificently: the blades were vibrating fast enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about catching and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks good and has the Braun name but quality wise its no different than the cheap trimmers you see on infomercials.</li>
            <li>I have had other Braun shavers and was always impressed.</li>
            <li>The trimmer guides for this unit are not quite as easy to use as say,</li>
            <li>The device is compact and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the size of a toothbrush and the battery is easily accessed; just pull the two sides of the trimmer apart.  </li>
            <li>You canclean it easily</li>
            <li>I ordered this with the hope it would make my sideburns easy to trim close to my face.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they can make this more powerful and the trimming more precise.    </li>
            <li>A good buy for a new user.  </li>
            <li>It worked perfectly fine the 1st time I used it.</li>
            <li>the price, I have to recommend owning one of these if you like to keep your beard and mustache finely groomed.</li>
            <li>I have tried many trimmers in the past &amp; this is the best in my opinion!!!</li>
            <li>so you can store it fine.  </li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and remove hairs precisely where I want it out.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>This thing worked fine for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, easy to hold, and easy to clean out.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping he could use this instead of dulling out his face razor or unpacking our huge hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap, made in crapland product that has none of the old-school Braun oomph I was once used to from their shavers, coffee makers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]), if you have light hair on your chest that you want to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a shame they couldn&#x27;t have gone with a more powerful charging solution.</li>
            <li>However, with the lowest setting on it you can get an absolutely close trim if you don&#x27;t happen to have your razor handy.</li>
            <li>product itself is inexpensive, but does not feel cheap in any way.</li>
            <li>used it for goatee and later for beard trimming and it always worked great.</li>
            <li>Bought this with the intention of using it to create an attractive facial hair line, and to trim up strays.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I loved my Braun 6500 which lasted nearly 15 years.</li>
            <li>How can a reputable company like Braun launch such a good for nothing toy?</li>
            <li>Despite the highly sculpted look of the model on the box, this trimmer will not do that kind of precise sculpting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought it, It&#x27;s really helpful and easy to use</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m familiar with razors, shavers, clippers, etc.    </li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Cruzer as I thought it would would fill the gap between the clippers and the pop-up razor on my shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is also  fine for quick trims.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be best if you go over your beard with your usual shaving tool, and use this to get at the stray hairs or line it up if you wish.  </li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as others that I have tried and did not seem to cut as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li>I use the HD to square my goatee or to give me a clean line under my nose.</li>
            <li>They do nothing to raise hair for a clean cut whether on your be beard / moustache or eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Really good product, life expentancy is not long.</li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about when it comes to something special.</li>
            <li>It did okay for small trimming jobs but not so great through think areas.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a good 2 for 1 deal to us facial hair consumers.</li>
            <li>This device is designed to trim eyebrows and body hair to keep it at an optimal length, not sculpt it into cool shapes.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have a full goatee and shave my head</li>
            <li>Looks cool</li>
            <li>And although that may be true for cars, it isn&#x27;t for Braun.</li>
            <li>i love it so much  </li>
            <li>so my beard isn&#x27;t all the way full</li>
            <li>Its not as loud as some trimmers are, which is nice.</li>
            <li>a full contact</li>
            <li>and so the trimmer does not always run&lt;br /&gt;at full speed.  </li>
            <li>Not bad to trim blades and beard</li>
            <li>The design is good, but there are much better choices out there for less money like the Wahl Lithium micro groomer.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean because you can rinse it directly with water</li>
            <li>Trimming is pretty close to the skin, and is relatively easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;high def precision\\&quot; trimmer is just a very cheap plastic trimmer that you can probably find at a dollar store or \\&quot;as seen on tv.\\</li>
            <li>I do find this great to take when I travel because it is so small and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Other than that one flaw, this item works great.  </li>
            <li>For facial beard hair, these guides work okay, but I find that taking them off gives a bit better control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do find that this trimmer is really nice for doing precise angles and designs with facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I have another electric razor that is bigger and comes with more attachments that I like better.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, the commercial was better then the product though.</li>
            <li>It was very good to trim small places, ear hair and nose hair (if you&#x27;re daring)</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the cheap feel of the plastic it was made of.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with my Braun and recommend it as a gift.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, love it for eyebrows, but for trimming hair around my goatee blades need to be sharper - need to go over the same spot repeatedly to get the job done</li>
            <li>The blade profile allows trimming of all areas of concern for me, though people who have very sensitive skin may be better off going with a model where the blades don&#x27;t contact the skin at all.</li>
            <li>After looking at it I am thinking its probably a better choice given its less precise but more durable-looking design.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer from the folks at Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer..</li>
            <li>Braun is a great brand, so you pretty much spend a bit more on the brand name, but quite frankly I do not see much difference between this one and any other trimmer like this.</li>
            <li>and I own several, but</li>
            <li>but they are a bit more challenging than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet too which is nice.  </li>
            <li>You can get a better face shave with a six-month old Bic razor.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most youre going to get out of a trimmer like this.</li>
            <li>The Cruzer has an awesome trimmer in it&#x27;s own right, but it&#x27;s still a little bulky for corners and using it for a few hairs here</li>
            <li>He uses it daily and has never complained, its a good buy.</li>
            <li>great for eye brows, outline of ears just about anywhere you need a small trimmer.</li>
            <li>about the good hand is it is very convince to cut a special shape of little part of hair and beards .</li>
            <li>I actually used the side trimmer on my Braun 6500 to trim my mustache over my top lip and the sides of my goatee (actually its called a Van Dye) because this trimmer can&#x27;t be used as a good straight edge for longer, straight trims like that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d bought a cheap trimmer prior to buying this, thinking it was a lot better since it was priced high.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also more gentle than a full sized groomer such as the ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not so good in tight places&lt;br /&gt;LOUD by your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>little trimmer does a good job trimming</li>
            <li>Does pull a little but does a fair job at trimming.</li>
            <li>It comes with two guides which work great at keeping the shrub evenly trimmed without worry of nicking in areas that are hard to navigate.  </li>
            <li>I have a stylized cut and this device works great for the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>If you test the device on some wispy leg hair, it can really cut!</li>
            <li>He tried it on his sideburns first.</li>
            <li>first one is alredy included in the package)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>trimmer does a stellar trimming job IMO.</li>
            <li>facial hair, if using the guides, it is okay to use the guides on beards or for longer hair</li>
            <li>Great trimmer , last a long time</li>
            <li>about the only thing I was able to employ it for was trimming my mustache (without the guards).</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to clean and comes with a simple elegant stand to keep the blade upright and ready for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Damage after first used</li>
            <li>first off cant cut my beard hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fancy for the type of low end trimmer that it is, but in my opinion, it is not meant to be used by itself as a trimmer because it has so many limitations.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant to be used as an everyday razor, rather for shaping and sculpting and for that it does a good job.</li>
            <li>This product, if you&#x27;re the right person, is really, really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the design had good intentions for precise trimming, but that&#x27;s the weak link.</li>
            <li>As I said, the one star removed is for the pain of some of the hairs catching due to power, but it wasn&#x27;t anything to cry about.</li>
            <li>It is small, has multiple comb sizes, making it easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really trim any hair, it was loud and it did not even go through the hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>It does a good job trimming in tiny areas and making lines, but when it comes to cut longer hair (beard, mustache)it doesn&#x27;t have enough power that it takes forever to cut to the desired length.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the low price tag for a portable and quite precise shaver.  </li>
            <li>Another great thing about this the settings securely click into place so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally come loose and mess up your beard or mustache!</li>
            <li>Also the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; are way too long for most beard styles.  </li>
            <li>The function and speed with with the trimmer works keeps that time so small, with superior results to a circular cut trimmer, that it is of no consequence to me.</li>
            <li>It also is excellent for extreme precision edging/trimming of facial hair, such as a Goatee, Van Dyke or Mustache.</li>
            <li>It is about the size of a large pen and is powered by one AAA battery.</li>
            <li>It comes with 2 plastic heads that are supposed to allow you to trim hair to a certain length.</li>
            <li>The HD alleviates me from having to whip out a razor to knick certain areas my shaver can&#x27;t handle quite so well.</li>
            <li>Next, since it mainly is a trimmer and not to act like a true razor, you can&#x27;t get a super close shave with this.</li>
            <li>The battery cover is too loose and it drops many times.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and not much power.</li>
            <li>Worked fine that last time I used it.</li>
            <li>Its a nice little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does come with a rather nice, little stand that keeps it upright when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, comes with a relatively nice little stand to keep it</li>
            <li>all, it&#x27;s a handy little device for precision trimming between trips to the barber.</li>
            <li>Handy little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Though this little tool is made of lightweight, cheap feeling plastic, which makes me question its long-term durability, so far it has worked flawlessly, even been dropped on a hard floor once from off a counter-top and didn&#x27;t even phase it.</li>
            <li>There are better trimmers out there for about the same price, or maybe a little more.</li>
            <li>You can try, but you won&#x27;t get a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will not be in my bathroom or travel bag much longer.</li>
            <li>Did not take up much room in trash can.</li>
            <li>I said, I really wanted to like this trimmer</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The Braun name is a very respected one in razors</li>
            <li>It makes cleaning up so much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yet, when I really want to do some trimming  </li>
            <li>With a name like Braun on this, I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have much use for the attachments.</li>
            <li>I could even try to do my whole beard with it</li>
            <li>They work really well for sideburns and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sufficient for some touch up grooming, but it&#x27;s not designed to do much</li>
            <li>Really wish there were something just like this, but built well.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it very well.</li>
            <li>It does not cut very well</li>
            <li>Of note: Mild force in the lengthwise direction easily separates the battery cover, so hold accordingly (especially when switching on), or it will slide open.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome little trimmer for every small area that needs to be trimmed ...</li>
            <li>You have to have some pretty bushy eyebrows or some such before those will be useful</li>
            <li>The blade is very fine and with only one AAA battery, it&#x27;s under powered and therefore takes some extra work to get the stubborn areas.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t intended to replace your current clippers of shavers, it was meant more for a younger audience who want to style their facial hair, perhaps, but can most certainly be used to line-up hairlines, sideburns, moustaches and beards, take off neck hair, anything really, except for doing a massive shave-job.  </li>
            <li>As with most of these shaver/trimmer units, they&#x27;ve kept the size down to a minumim, which in turn makes them use a AAA battery.</li>
            <li>The small size makes it convenient and safe for areas that might not be easy to get at with a larger razor.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works well and has a decent amount of power for its size.  </li>
            <li>This precision hair cutter is easy to hold and work, and comes with several different length clip ons to keep hair at a certain length.  </li>
            <li>I just  purchased the cruZer 6 high definition on 28 Aug 2011.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for the Braun Cruzer 6.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this device.</li>
            <li>It is highly portable and the blade guard helps eliminate a reason for a carry case.  </li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>I purchased the High Definition Trimmer off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>However, its light and plastic and small, so its really only good for minor detail trimming.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll take a really long time and won&#x27;t be all the way clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fine instrument, just be careful as it has the feel of brittleness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite loud, louder than my large rechargeable</li>
            <li>Very handy for keeping those ear and nose hairs under control, while chopping down those bushy eyebrows into something less barbaric looking.</li>
            <li>I am not not really a fan of all the attachments without really making sure the parts inside are durable enough to withstand the impact of anything but</li>
            <li>At about $10-$15, I don&#x27;t expect this trimmer to last long, but it does what it says and is ok for trimming mustaches, nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>far, I have only been able to use this micro shaver without the combs to get the stray mustache hairs that my regular groomer can&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what this is good for, not much, especially with the guides on.</li>
            <li>A few bucks more,but it works better that the cheapo ones at Walmart.</li>
            <li>It is nice and small and fits easily in the bathroom drawer or in its little stand without taking up counter space.  </li>
            <li>A little plastic head vibrates up and down, its supposed to fit between two plastic tabs in the head of the unit to make the blades move but its cheap and doesn&#x27;t fit snug enough.</li>
            <li>the other hand ,it doesn&#x27;t fit its explanation .what</li>
            <li>this point, I need a new electric razor too.</li>
            <li>i think i need a new blade now</li>
            <li>I thought a new battery would troubleshoot the problem.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think 4 out of 5 is fair considering it DOES shave well and quite close (slight stubble is left)</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t pack the kind of punch that you might be used to with the other Braun&#x27;s, But the intention of this was for precision rather than trimming a thick full beard.</li>
            <li>The trimmer does have a weak motor, but it doesn&#x27;t need to have a super strong motor because it shouldn&#x27;t used to cut lots of hair.</li>
            <li>As far as functionality the cruzer does have the ability to finely groom small areas, however it requires a lot of work and all the hair is not always cut on the first pass.    </li>
            <li>It is super sharp when it comes to knicking hairs and it cuts very close to the skin... about as close as you can get without yanking the hair completely out.</li>
            <li>First I tried to define my stubble; you have to move it back and forth a million times for it to have the slightest effect.</li>
            <li>This is his second one, the first died after a year.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty simple devices.</li>
            <li>I have not owned another product that does things similarly to the Braun Cruzer 6, so I can&#x27;t honestly compare it other facial hair trimmers in its class</li>
            <li>I did have a limited success on my eyebrows with the shorter attachment).</li>
            <li>For the Braun brand I expected better quality though, because it runs on a single AAA battery so it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for me for a few months</li>
            <li>It does feel a little cheap</li>
            <li>The easy-to-grip design and its light weight gives you plenty of control and it comes with a little plastic stand that lends it that executive toothbrush-like appearance.    </li>
            <li>problem is that the teeth are really too fine to trim my husband&#x27;s thick mustache or beard hair.</li>
            <li>This little thing is VERY powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is clearly a shaving accessory.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s held up so far.</li>
            <li>I, being a 50 year old man have hairs growing from places I never dreamed of as a kid</li>
            <li>The tines are spaced too far apart to align the hair of my beard, so nothing gets cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did use it to trim my 8 year old&#x27;s sideburns between haircuts and it worked well on his baby-fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this tiny trimmer.</li>
            <li>My final test was to try and trim one hair at a time to see how the cruzer is really functioning.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy duty product.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is really well -made and definitely stands up to the test of time.  </li>
            <li>Does it&#x27;s job and really makes your facial hair turn out to be like you got out of a barbershop...</li>
            <li>Battery has lasted over 2 months so far, using it twice a week,</li>
            <li>works very well initially.</li>
            <li>and then it completely died.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m not the right person: I&#x27;m not very hairy.</li>
            <li>It is small, easy to handle and cuts close.  </li>
            <li>This is a small, easy to use trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to brush clean and oil after every use to prolong blade cutting life and maintain blade sharpness (and prevent pulling).</li>
            <li>I thought wow, Braun finally is making a high quality micro</li>
            <li>It did work fine for a bit and could trim in small places and with precision.</li>
            <li>usually makes fine products</li>
            <li>Just stick to a decent battery brand to save yourself the pain of low power shaving with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For what this does you could get equal or better for far less (have used those with just as much success in the past).  </li>
            <li>Never mind that, from a distance, the Braun Cruzer 6 High Definition trimmer may resemble a small--if stylish--toothbrush, the fact is it&#x27;s actually a facial hair trimmer</li>
            <li>Then again, my Philips/Norelco has the same method of power, but the plastic is bigger and a little more durable.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the battery life, I can&#x27;t say how long it will last with one AAA since I only got it today, but in regards to my first shave, I had a thick beard and after using it for around 30 minutes to really shape up every nook and cranny, it was still running fine.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this Cruzer since I received, it is still in use, the same as new, and it does</li>
            <li>The attachments aren&#x27;t very varied, none short enough to use on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This does not cut very well for those with similar facial hair as mine.  </li>
            <li>Literally doesn&#x27;t trim the hair and it runs out of batteries quickly while not doing shit.</li>
            <li>My facial hair is more thick and course.  </li>
            <li>It does work well for finer and thinner hairs but don&#x27;t expect it to cut the thick stuff so easily.</li>
            <li>I really do not understand the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>This is not meant to do major sculpting of a beard.  </li>
            <li>only thing that I am not sold on is how quickly the battery runs down.  </li>
            <li>The design is fine, but cannot adjust the trimming size.&lt;br /&gt;The smallest size is too thick for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That eventually resulted in the plastic fins breaking as I guess there was little room for error because if you are not perfectly careful when putting the head back on, the can plastic get easily crushed or mashed by the much stronger (and far less unbreakable and far more dense) metal motor</li>
            <li>Powered by a single AAA battery, the Cruzer comes with two trimming combs (one 8mm and one 5mm) to enable neatly precise trimming of sideburns, mustaches, brows and other facial elements.    </li>
            <li>bare blade (</li>
            <li>I only judge them by how well the trimmer itself cuts hairs, and this one works flawlessly so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful, the battery compartment cover will come off.</li>
            <li>While it was okay for my eyebrows it was not great with my sideburns.    </li>
            <li>Very useful specially hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Battery power isn&#x27;t enough to drive this little clipper, perhaps if it was a rechargeable like the other clippers in this line it would be better.</li>
            <li>I use my other trimmers to trim the facial hair to the length I want) cuts quite close, and the reason I&#x27;ve subtracted a star from the rating is because the motor is powerful enough, but you may find that your hair will sometimes catch.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice little trimmer, its small, rubs on regular batteries so you don&#x27;t have to worry about plugging it in or recharging it.  </li>
            <li>It feels very light, but also fragile (having said that, it hasn&#x27;t broken yet).  </li>
            <li>This, on the other hand, not so much.</li>
            <li>I have other Braun&#x27;s and they work very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a particularly thick or tough beard but this razor makes no headway as a fine trimmer of corners or fine lines.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really do that with this due to the low power of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems exactly like a no-name item I bought a Walmart for about $10 a few years ago that was marketed as a bikini-line trimmer.</li>
            <li>Easy to use around the areas that are tough with a razor.  </li>
            <li>I was attracted to the pen/toothbrush-like design since it&#x27;s small enough to let you get into hard-to-reach places such as the philtrum or the area on your chin beneath your bottom lip, with better accuracy than other trimmers allow since the blade is much smaller.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s a nation-wide sale but may be worth checking your local store!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t struggle, but you will need to go over it a couple of times (again, more likely if you have thick, dark hair like me).  </li>
            <li>To get even closer, you can simply leave off both of those click-on combs and work with the extra-precise, extra small, sufficiently sharp metal trimming element which, like those plastic combs, cleans easily under running water.    </li>

            <li> this item is good for me  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product.</li>

            <li> it is good for me ,from CN</li>
            <li> Braun has a good reputation for quality.</li>
            <li> The price is good but the replacement cycle isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Was good for a year</li>
            <li> Been searching for a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the good reviews about this trimmer and DON&#x27;T turn in your hard-earned cash for this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> keep the good work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and elegant and I can use it with ease and you can take ane waer</li>
            <li> The packaging and the hype on it would lead you to believe that this is the perfect tool for keeping perfectly trimmed and shaped facial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight unit made a brand known for exceptional quality.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep things neat and tidy and it works great, better than the drug store brand trimmer I was using.  </li>
            <li> Excellent device for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this three stars for the non-hirsute, but four for those with more testosterone!</li>
            <li> That said, the design is amazing.</li>
            <li> you can get it real cheap, it&#x27;ll trim your &#x27;stache, etc, but don&#x27;t expect Braun-type quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased this to do eyebrows and found it amazing, the 2 included tips let you groom to your preferred length in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li> It gets close to under the nose and trims nicely along the lip line.</li>
            <li> Without the heads, it works nicely to trim hair off of ears and to neaten up the edges of his stache and beard, but won&#x27;t work for keeping his beard or mustache a uniform length.</li>
            <li> and it did help tidy my moustache and sideburns.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 is a nice grooming tool.</li>
            <li> and you can run the blade under the tap which is handy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of case to hold it or the guides.  </li>
            <li> If you know how to cut or trim your own hair.</li>
            <li> Nice, you get what you see...</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap,I like it.</li>
            <li> The guard is nicely designed to trim eyebows well without leaving you with no eyebrows, as some others I&#x27;ve tried have done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to wipe off the excess hair from the blade with a paper towel or cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> The build quality is OK, but nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li> But, it does do the job and allows for some&lt;br /&gt;really fine trimming!</li>
            <li> However, upon turning the Cruzer on the unit began to make the most horrendous noise.  </li>
            <li> With the guards on this trimmer is nothing more than a comb.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer it cuts fast</li>
            <li> and it is really safe for the skin</li>
            <li> Braun ain&#x27;t made in Germany any more, and boy does it show.</li>
            <li> on, Braun, you can do WAY better.</li>
            <li> It lasted just more than 2 months then died on me.</li>
            <li> It trims finer hair ok, but if you&#x27;re trimming thicker whiskers it may catch on the stubble.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to remove nose and ear hair without much hassle.  </li>
            <li> This means, for example, that I wasn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be able to use the guards at all.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this trimmer for some things.</li>
            <li> I had an oldef one tath worked better...</li>
            <li> I love that you can rinse this under the sink.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and brand name but cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> ok but not what I was looking for to trim around the ears.</li>
            <li> because I have bought this item from different sites many times &amp; Amazon had it for a great price!  </li>
            <li> Ok for trimming eyebrows</li>
            <li> in all i can&#x27;t really recommend it, not too happy with it, but not disgusted with it either :X</li>
            <li> OK, technicalities aside, I&#x27;ll give my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how well they work, but I can&#x27;t imagine any pen-type trimmer performing better than the rest.</li>
            <li> i believe your paying more for design and portability than the product itself</li>
            <li> I am hoping it fares better than this overpriced item.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had it for many months now.</li>
            <li> Okay.  </li>
            <li> If you grow bushy beards and stashes, it may work better for you then it did me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It handles pretty good</li>
            <li> You can very quickly remove more hair than you intend.  </li>
            <li> As I should have read the sizes before purchasing I gave this 4 stars, I am sure it will fit the bill if you are looking for a longer trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with how smoothly it runs.</li>
            <li> In that job, it performed magnificently: the blades were vibrating fast enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about catching and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks good and has the Braun name but quality wise its no different than the cheap trimmers you see on infomercials.</li>
            <li> I have had other Braun shavers and was always impressed.</li>
            <li> The trimmer guides for this unit are not quite as easy to use as say,</li>
            <li> The device is compact and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of a toothbrush and the battery is easily accessed; just pull the two sides of the trimmer apart.  </li>
            <li> You canclean it easily</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the hope it would make my sideburns easy to trim close to my face.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they can make this more powerful and the trimming more precise.    </li>
            <li> A good buy for a new user.  </li>
            <li> It worked perfectly fine the 1st time I used it.</li>
            <li> the price, I have to recommend owning one of these if you like to keep your beard and mustache finely groomed.</li>
            <li> I have tried many trimmers in the past &amp; this is the best in my opinion!!!</li>
            <li> so you can store it fine.  </li>
            <li> and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and remove hairs precisely where I want it out.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> This thing worked fine for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, easy to hold, and easy to clean out.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping he could use this instead of dulling out his face razor or unpacking our huge hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, made in crapland product that has none of the old-school Braun oomph I was once used to from their shavers, coffee makers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]), if you have light hair on your chest that you want to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame they couldn&#x27;t have gone with a more powerful charging solution.</li>
            <li> However, with the lowest setting on it you can get an absolutely close trim if you don&#x27;t happen to have your razor handy.</li>
            <li> product itself is inexpensive, but does not feel cheap in any way.</li>
            <li> used it for goatee and later for beard trimming and it always worked great.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the intention of using it to create an attractive facial hair line, and to trim up strays.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I loved my Braun 6500 which lasted nearly 15 years.</li>
            <li> How can a reputable company like Braun launch such a good for nothing toy?</li>
            <li> Despite the highly sculpted look of the model on the box, this trimmer will not do that kind of precise sculpting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought it, It&#x27;s really helpful and easy to use</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m familiar with razors, shavers, clippers, etc.    </li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Cruzer as I thought it would would fill the gap between the clippers and the pop-up razor on my shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is also  fine for quick trims.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be best if you go over your beard with your usual shaving tool, and use this to get at the stray hairs or line it up if you wish.  </li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as others that I have tried and did not seem to cut as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li> I use the HD to square my goatee or to give me a clean line under my nose.</li>
            <li> They do nothing to raise hair for a clean cut whether on your be beard / moustache or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Really good product, life expentancy is not long.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about when it comes to something special.</li>
            <li> It did okay for small trimming jobs but not so great through think areas.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a good 2 for 1 deal to us facial hair consumers.</li>
            <li> This device is designed to trim eyebrows and body hair to keep it at an optimal length, not sculpt it into cool shapes.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have a full goatee and shave my head</li>
            <li> Looks cool</li>
            <li> And although that may be true for cars, it isn&#x27;t for Braun.</li>
            <li> i love it so much  </li>
            <li> so my beard isn&#x27;t all the way full</li>
            <li> Its not as loud as some trimmers are, which is nice.</li>
            <li> a full contact</li>
            <li> and so the trimmer does not always run&lt;br /&gt;at full speed.  </li>
            <li> Not bad to trim blades and beard</li>
            <li> The design is good, but there are much better choices out there for less money like the Wahl Lithium micro groomer.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean because you can rinse it directly with water</li>
            <li> Trimming is pretty close to the skin, and is relatively easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;high def precision\\&quot; trimmer is just a very cheap plastic trimmer that you can probably find at a dollar store or \\&quot;as seen on tv.\\</li>
            <li> I do find this great to take when I travel because it is so small and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Other than that one flaw, this item works great.  </li>
            <li> For facial beard hair, these guides work okay, but I find that taking them off gives a bit better control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do find that this trimmer is really nice for doing precise angles and designs with facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I have another electric razor that is bigger and comes with more attachments that I like better.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, the commercial was better then the product though.</li>
            <li> It was very good to trim small places, ear hair and nose hair (if you&#x27;re daring)</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was the cheap feel of the plastic it was made of.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with my Braun and recommend it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, love it for eyebrows, but for trimming hair around my goatee blades need to be sharper - need to go over the same spot repeatedly to get the job done</li>
            <li> The blade profile allows trimming of all areas of concern for me, though people who have very sensitive skin may be better off going with a model where the blades don&#x27;t contact the skin at all.</li>
            <li> After looking at it I am thinking its probably a better choice given its less precise but more durable-looking design.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer from the folks at Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer..</li>
            <li> Braun is a great brand, so you pretty much spend a bit more on the brand name, but quite frankly I do not see much difference between this one and any other trimmer like this.</li>
            <li> and I own several, but</li>
            <li> but they are a bit more challenging than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet too which is nice.  </li>
            <li> You can get a better face shave with a six-month old Bic razor.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most youre going to get out of a trimmer like this.</li>
            <li> The Cruzer has an awesome trimmer in it&#x27;s own right, but it&#x27;s still a little bulky for corners and using it for a few hairs here</li>
            <li> He uses it daily and has never complained, its a good buy.</li>
            <li> great for eye brows, outline of ears just about anywhere you need a small trimmer.</li>
            <li> about the good hand is it is very convince to cut a special shape of little part of hair and beards .</li>
            <li> I actually used the side trimmer on my Braun 6500 to trim my mustache over my top lip and the sides of my goatee (actually its called a Van Dye) because this trimmer can&#x27;t be used as a good straight edge for longer, straight trims like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought a cheap trimmer prior to buying this, thinking it was a lot better since it was priced high.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also more gentle than a full sized groomer such as the ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not so good in tight places&lt;br /&gt;LOUD by your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little trimmer does a good job trimming</li>
            <li> Does pull a little but does a fair job at trimming.</li>
            <li> It comes with two guides which work great at keeping the shrub evenly trimmed without worry of nicking in areas that are hard to navigate.  </li>
            <li> I have a stylized cut and this device works great for the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> If you test the device on some wispy leg hair, it can really cut!</li>
            <li> He tried it on his sideburns first.</li>
            <li> first one is alredy included in the package)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> trimmer does a stellar trimming job IMO.</li>
            <li> facial hair, if using the guides, it is okay to use the guides on beards or for longer hair</li>
            <li> Great trimmer , last a long time</li>
            <li> about the only thing I was able to employ it for was trimming my mustache (without the guards).</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to clean and comes with a simple elegant stand to keep the blade upright and ready for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Damage after first used</li>
            <li> first off cant cut my beard hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fancy for the type of low end trimmer that it is, but in my opinion, it is not meant to be used by itself as a trimmer because it has so many limitations.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not meant to be used as an everyday razor, rather for shaping and sculpting and for that it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This product, if you&#x27;re the right person, is really, really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the design had good intentions for precise trimming, but that&#x27;s the weak link.</li>
            <li> As I said, the one star removed is for the pain of some of the hairs catching due to power, but it wasn&#x27;t anything to cry about.</li>
            <li> It is small, has multiple comb sizes, making it easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really trim any hair, it was loud and it did not even go through the hair smoothly.</li>
            <li> It does a good job trimming in tiny areas and making lines, but when it comes to cut longer hair (beard, mustache)it doesn&#x27;t have enough power that it takes forever to cut to the desired length.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth the low price tag for a portable and quite precise shaver.  </li>
            <li> Another great thing about this the settings securely click into place so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally come loose and mess up your beard or mustache!</li>
            <li> Also the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; are way too long for most beard styles.  </li>
            <li> The function and speed with with the trimmer works keeps that time so small, with superior results to a circular cut trimmer, that it is of no consequence to me.</li>
            <li> It also is excellent for extreme precision edging/trimming of facial hair, such as a Goatee, Van Dyke or Mustache.</li>
            <li> It is about the size of a large pen and is powered by one AAA battery.</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 plastic heads that are supposed to allow you to trim hair to a certain length.</li>
            <li> The HD alleviates me from having to whip out a razor to knick certain areas my shaver can&#x27;t handle quite so well.</li>
            <li> Next, since it mainly is a trimmer and not to act like a true razor, you can&#x27;t get a super close shave with this.</li>
            <li> The battery cover is too loose and it drops many times.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and not much power.</li>
            <li> Worked fine that last time I used it.</li>
            <li> Its a nice little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does come with a rather nice, little stand that keeps it upright when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, comes with a relatively nice little stand to keep it</li>
            <li> all, it&#x27;s a handy little device for precision trimming between trips to the barber.</li>
            <li> Handy little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Though this little tool is made of lightweight, cheap feeling plastic, which makes me question its long-term durability, so far it has worked flawlessly, even been dropped on a hard floor once from off a counter-top and didn&#x27;t even phase it.</li>
            <li> There are better trimmers out there for about the same price, or maybe a little more.</li>
            <li> You can try, but you won&#x27;t get a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will not be in my bathroom or travel bag much longer.</li>
            <li> Did not take up much room in trash can.</li>
            <li> I said, I really wanted to like this trimmer</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Braun name is a very respected one in razors</li>
            <li> It makes cleaning up so much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet, when I really want to do some trimming  </li>
            <li> With a name like Braun on this, I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have much use for the attachments.</li>
            <li> I could even try to do my whole beard with it</li>
            <li> They work really well for sideburns and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sufficient for some touch up grooming, but it&#x27;s not designed to do much</li>
            <li> Really wish there were something just like this, but built well.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it very well.</li>
            <li> It does not cut very well</li>
            <li> Of note: Mild force in the lengthwise direction easily separates the battery cover, so hold accordingly (especially when switching on), or it will slide open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome little trimmer for every small area that needs to be trimmed ...</li>
            <li> You have to have some pretty bushy eyebrows or some such before those will be useful</li>
            <li> The blade is very fine and with only one AAA battery, it&#x27;s under powered and therefore takes some extra work to get the stubborn areas.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t intended to replace your current clippers of shavers, it was meant more for a younger audience who want to style their facial hair, perhaps, but can most certainly be used to line-up hairlines, sideburns, moustaches and beards, take off neck hair, anything really, except for doing a massive shave-job.  </li>
            <li> As with most of these shaver/trimmer units, they&#x27;ve kept the size down to a minumim, which in turn makes them use a AAA battery.</li>
            <li> The small size makes it convenient and safe for areas that might not be easy to get at with a larger razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and has a decent amount of power for its size.  </li>
            <li> This precision hair cutter is easy to hold and work, and comes with several different length clip ons to keep hair at a certain length.  </li>
            <li> I just  purchased the cruZer 6 high definition on 28 Aug 2011.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the Braun Cruzer 6.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this device.</li>
            <li> It is highly portable and the blade guard helps eliminate a reason for a carry case.  </li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I purchased the High Definition Trimmer off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> However, its light and plastic and small, so its really only good for minor detail trimming.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll take a really long time and won&#x27;t be all the way clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fine instrument, just be careful as it has the feel of brittleness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite loud, louder than my large rechargeable</li>
            <li> Very handy for keeping those ear and nose hairs under control, while chopping down those bushy eyebrows into something less barbaric looking.</li>
            <li> I am not not really a fan of all the attachments without really making sure the parts inside are durable enough to withstand the impact of anything but</li>
            <li> At about $10-$15, I don&#x27;t expect this trimmer to last long, but it does what it says and is ok for trimming mustaches, nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> far, I have only been able to use this micro shaver without the combs to get the stray mustache hairs that my regular groomer can&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is good for, not much, especially with the guides on.</li>
            <li> A few bucks more,but it works better that the cheapo ones at Walmart.</li>
            <li> It is nice and small and fits easily in the bathroom drawer or in its little stand without taking up counter space.  </li>
            <li> A little plastic head vibrates up and down, its supposed to fit between two plastic tabs in the head of the unit to make the blades move but its cheap and doesn&#x27;t fit snug enough.</li>
            <li> the other hand ,it doesn&#x27;t fit its explanation .what</li>
            <li> this point, I need a new electric razor too.</li>
            <li> i think i need a new blade now</li>
            <li> I thought a new battery would troubleshoot the problem.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think 4 out of 5 is fair considering it DOES shave well and quite close (slight stubble is left)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t pack the kind of punch that you might be used to with the other Braun&#x27;s, But the intention of this was for precision rather than trimming a thick full beard.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does have a weak motor, but it doesn&#x27;t need to have a super strong motor because it shouldn&#x27;t used to cut lots of hair.</li>
            <li> As far as functionality the cruzer does have the ability to finely groom small areas, however it requires a lot of work and all the hair is not always cut on the first pass.    </li>
            <li> It is super sharp when it comes to knicking hairs and it cuts very close to the skin... about as close as you can get without yanking the hair completely out.</li>
            <li> First I tried to define my stubble; you have to move it back and forth a million times for it to have the slightest effect.</li>
            <li> This is his second one, the first died after a year.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty simple devices.</li>
            <li> I have not owned another product that does things similarly to the Braun Cruzer 6, so I can&#x27;t honestly compare it other facial hair trimmers in its class</li>
            <li> I did have a limited success on my eyebrows with the shorter attachment).</li>
            <li> For the Braun brand I expected better quality though, because it runs on a single AAA battery so it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for me for a few months</li>
            <li> It does feel a little cheap</li>
            <li> The easy-to-grip design and its light weight gives you plenty of control and it comes with a little plastic stand that lends it that executive toothbrush-like appearance.    </li>
            <li> problem is that the teeth are really too fine to trim my husband&#x27;s thick mustache or beard hair.</li>
            <li> This little thing is VERY powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is clearly a shaving accessory.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s held up so far.</li>
            <li> I, being a 50 year old man have hairs growing from places I never dreamed of as a kid</li>
            <li> The tines are spaced too far apart to align the hair of my beard, so nothing gets cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did use it to trim my 8 year old&#x27;s sideburns between haircuts and it worked well on his baby-fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this tiny trimmer.</li>
            <li> My final test was to try and trim one hair at a time to see how the cruzer is really functioning.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy duty product.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is really well -made and definitely stands up to the test of time.  </li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job and really makes your facial hair turn out to be like you got out of a barbershop...</li>
            <li> Battery has lasted over 2 months so far, using it twice a week,</li>
            <li> works very well initially.</li>
            <li> and then it completely died.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not the right person: I&#x27;m not very hairy.</li>
            <li> It is small, easy to handle and cuts close.  </li>
            <li> This is a small, easy to use trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to brush clean and oil after every use to prolong blade cutting life and maintain blade sharpness (and prevent pulling).</li>
            <li> I thought wow, Braun finally is making a high quality micro</li>
            <li> It did work fine for a bit and could trim in small places and with precision.</li>
            <li> usually makes fine products</li>
            <li> Just stick to a decent battery brand to save yourself the pain of low power shaving with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For what this does you could get equal or better for far less (have used those with just as much success in the past).  </li>
            <li> Never mind that, from a distance, the Braun Cruzer 6 High Definition trimmer may resemble a small--if stylish--toothbrush, the fact is it&#x27;s actually a facial hair trimmer</li>
            <li> Then again, my Philips/Norelco has the same method of power, but the plastic is bigger and a little more durable.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the battery life, I can&#x27;t say how long it will last with one AAA since I only got it today, but in regards to my first shave, I had a thick beard and after using it for around 30 minutes to really shape up every nook and cranny, it was still running fine.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Cruzer since I received, it is still in use, the same as new, and it does</li>
            <li> The attachments aren&#x27;t very varied, none short enough to use on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This does not cut very well for those with similar facial hair as mine.  </li>
            <li> Literally doesn&#x27;t trim the hair and it runs out of batteries quickly while not doing shit.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is more thick and course.  </li>
            <li> It does work well for finer and thinner hairs but don&#x27;t expect it to cut the thick stuff so easily.</li>
            <li> I really do not understand the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> This is not meant to do major sculpting of a beard.  </li>
            <li> only thing that I am not sold on is how quickly the battery runs down.  </li>
            <li> The design is fine, but cannot adjust the trimming size.&lt;br /&gt;The smallest size is too thick for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That eventually resulted in the plastic fins breaking as I guess there was little room for error because if you are not perfectly careful when putting the head back on, the can plastic get easily crushed or mashed by the much stronger (and far less unbreakable and far more dense) metal motor</li>
            <li> Powered by a single AAA battery, the Cruzer comes with two trimming combs (one 8mm and one 5mm) to enable neatly precise trimming of sideburns, mustaches, brows and other facial elements.    </li>
            <li> bare blade (</li>
            <li> I only judge them by how well the trimmer itself cuts hairs, and this one works flawlessly so far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful, the battery compartment cover will come off.</li>
            <li> While it was okay for my eyebrows it was not great with my sideburns.    </li>
            <li> Very useful specially hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Battery power isn&#x27;t enough to drive this little clipper, perhaps if it was a rechargeable like the other clippers in this line it would be better.</li>
            <li> I use my other trimmers to trim the facial hair to the length I want) cuts quite close, and the reason I&#x27;ve subtracted a star from the rating is because the motor is powerful enough, but you may find that your hair will sometimes catch.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer, its small, rubs on regular batteries so you don&#x27;t have to worry about plugging it in or recharging it.  </li>
            <li> It feels very light, but also fragile (having said that, it hasn&#x27;t broken yet).  </li>
            <li> This, on the other hand, not so much.</li>
            <li> I have other Braun&#x27;s and they work very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a particularly thick or tough beard but this razor makes no headway as a fine trimmer of corners or fine lines.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t really do that with this due to the low power of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems exactly like a no-name item I bought a Walmart for about $10 a few years ago that was marketed as a bikini-line trimmer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use around the areas that are tough with a razor.  </li>
            <li> I was attracted to the pen/toothbrush-like design since it&#x27;s small enough to let you get into hard-to-reach places such as the philtrum or the area on your chin beneath your bottom lip, with better accuracy than other trimmers allow since the blade is much smaller.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a nation-wide sale but may be worth checking your local store!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t struggle, but you will need to go over it a couple of times (again, more likely if you have thick, dark hair like me).  </li>
            <li> To get even closer, you can simply leave off both of those click-on combs and work with the extra-precise, extra small, sufficiently sharp metal trimming element which, like those plastic combs, cleans easily under running water.    </li>
            <li> The advantage of this design is that it can be used to directly trim ear and nose hair, as well as any other facial hair be it beard thickness or peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it on the inner part of my goatee; same thing with no apparent results, so I used a razor to do the job.</li>
            <li> The cutting blade is extremely fine, fine enough that it is really hard to cut yourself and the trimmer works if you have patience.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this item due to the design flaw of soft plastic to metal in the actuator/motor assembly.</li>
            <li> mm &amp; 8mm are too long for me as I don&#x27;t have such robust facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Half</li>
            <li> head on the cruzer is small, so you will have to cruze a lot for large body parts that you may want to shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the motor is far to weak, it works better for maybe eye brows or slight and tight cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small, compact and it trims very well.</li>
            <li> Packaging is nice, small and not overly dramatic</li>
            <li> It runs on one AAA battery, which seems to last a very long time before needing replaced.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not live up to product description.</li>
            <li> Why did the designers make the linkages so fragile and then slap a big, long warranty on the other parts??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite trimmer for all of the awkward to deal with hair.</li>
            <li> Minor trimming is about all</li>
            <li> Descent product for minor grooming.  </li>
            <li> It does an average job compared to my last trimmer, no better no worse.</li>
            <li> , skin stretched, so you can see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> This razor is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> These type of trimmers have been around for a long time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a detachable head, not unlike an electric tooth brush which means you can twist and pull to remove it for easy cleaning under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has two comb attachments for cutting to different lengths.</li>
            <li> means that I can&#x27;t recommend it for anything other than regular hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fussy and bought this because I like my beard properly lined-up with sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just wish they&#x27;d design one with a little bigger body to accept a AA battery, it itsn&#x27;t that much bigger</li>
            <li> (although it could probably handle that unless you&#x27;ve got a massively thick beard), this was advertised as a \\&quot;High Definition Precision\\&quot; trimmer.  </li>
            <li> About ¾ of an inch and takes one single AAA battery.  </li>
            <li> Operates on a single AAA battery.  </li>
            <li> it is too small for an adult to use on all of our body .on</li>
            <li> It has two \\&quot;combs\\&quot; for different lengths of hair, but sill not shave down close to the skin like a razor.</li>
            <li> It was never created to trim your entire beard down to a close shave</li>
            <li> This little plastic piece of junk won&#x27;t last you that long.  </li>
            <li> The Braun HD is NOT a high caliber product.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the battery that came with the trimmer with a brand new battery because the thing was running slow.  </li>
            <li> They can only be used for small areas and even then I have to run over it multiple times for it to cut.</li>
            <li> He likes it better than&lt;br /&gt;Holding his ears down and being afraid of the bigger&lt;br /&gt;Clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be a little apprehensive about trying to trim an entire beard with this device, though, as it&#x27;s powered by a single AAA battery.  </li>
            <li> Not many complaints about this trimmer as it does the job similarly to any other similar low-budget trimmer.  </li>
            <li> With the guards off it will trim if you are careful.</li>
            <li> much as it tries it isn&#x27;t a replacement for all in your trimming arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a total peice of shit.</li>
            <li> Did not really work as claimed.</li>
            <li> First, I will admit that since this is a low voltage trimmer, it does get a little slow around thick hairs (minus 1 star).  </li>
            <li> At least it isn&#x27;t too expensive, and it might work for you, probably fine without any attachments if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of neck hair or fine tune beard line, but ultimately disappointing from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is a complete piece of trash it has completely stopped cutting hair after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is useful half the time, has a difficult time trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> I consider the packaging extremely deceptive and misleading.    </li>
            <li> For such a small object the noise can literally be heard across the house.  </li>
            <li> For a single-purpose device I would say that the Cruzer falls short on cutting hair and in attempting to cut hair will annoy everyone in the house as it is simply way too loud.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my Husband to use on his sideburns, eyebrows and other manly stray hairs.</li>
            <li> will use this to trim around my lips, nose and other areas where I want it to a zero setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to agree with what a lot of the other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other trimmers to use for the peach fuzz I get on the sides of my face and on my neck.</li>
            <li> So all-in-all a pretty useless product.</li>
            <li> I feel that this trimmer is meant to be used in unison or combination with the Cruzer Face or maybe some other shaver or goatee shaper.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for, A close a sharp shave.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s made in China, Taiwan or whatever other third world country DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!</li>
            <li> Be VERY careful.  </li>
            <li> Is hard to use, does not trim properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t think it deserves some of the bad press I read on the reviews prior to purchasing is because I don&#x27;t think people have considered exactly what this tool is for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the scolding it has received.  </li>
            <li> This may be because my facial hair is about as thick as my head hair, if not thicker.  </li>
            <li> The two guards are completely useless too as they are too long and the teeth too far apart.</li>
            <li> So you would have to be very careful on sideburns or mustache; a little slip and you are Charlie Chaplain.     </li>
            <li> I suppose but its just another gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Update: stopped working after a half dozen uses.</li>
            <li> Bought it for less than two months and already it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> It is a typical trimmer with a couple attachments.</li>
            <li> This little device will outperform your average beard trimmer and add style to your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be my new go-to mustache trimmer, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Today, they were getting a little caterpillary</li>
            <li> It also comes with a little stand you can place it upright on your countertop to optimize space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nifty little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I just could not believe the quality this little trimmer gave out.</li>
            <li> The size of the cutting head may be too large for some to use for nose hair trimming, but it is not for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even really get a chance to complain about it&#x27;s lack of cutting power.</li>
            <li> I assumed the battery was dead</li>
            <li> I have harsh nose hairs and o use it to trim up some body hair too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found people are overly harsh on this product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I especially like the included base which allows users to keep the product standing straight up.</li>
            <li> One negative side of the Braun is that is lacks power for tough hair, but then again, it&#x27;s advisable to trim your beard and not other parts of your body.</li>
            <li> The motor is not incredibly strong.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t cut a lot of hair at once and it is not powerful, but to say that it&#x27;s useless would be a gross exaggeration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaped like a little electric toothbrush with a small trimmer head.</li>
            <li> For me, the purpose of this trimmer is to get to those hard to reach corners or areas where the larger trimmers may have a tough time carving out an edge.</li>
            <li> It gets the small stuff done with no problem..</li>
            <li> device also includes a small stand.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer is serious.  </li>
            <li> second it only works when i take off the bottom and have the batter popping out which is stupid.</li>
            <li> or it isn&#x27;t too thick, then you cannot expect to use something so small to get that job done.  </li>
            <li> use it to trim my eyebrows, nose and ears (those hard to reach spots!)&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way.  </li>
            <li> a as hard to find one</li>
            <li> Alone, this product sucks...</li>
            <li> Sometimes it may get stuck in midst of thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for men with thick beards but for people like me</li>
            <li> This Braun Cruzer 6 is weak, noisy and not very effective.</li>
            <li> Even with a new battery, the stupid trimmer STILL runs slow.  </li>
            <li> However, when faced with a beard (and mine&#x27;s not very tough) it is worthless.</li>
            <li> not really good for using it for your beard or sideburns&lt;</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this Braun trimmer is no better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few small trimmers like this and been disappointed every time by poor quality, lack of strength, attachments.</li>
            <li> However, the blade assembly is powered by two small plastic pieces that then close around the motor \\&quot;spindle\\&quot; which then actuates the cutting blades.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not the trimmer which will help me do that.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be contacting Braun to see if I can get my money back for this product since it&#x27;s a piece of crap!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two combs that attach to the head are useless for my beard.  </li>
            <li> It is ever so mildly uncomfortable against the inside of the nose, but neither pulls nor cuts the skin.</li>
            <li> Braun has  failed on this one though .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite awkward.</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG!</li>
            <li> Once again I WAS WRONG!</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Product is worthless.</li>
            <li> And a base stand to hold the trimmer upright for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can just use it on the defining edges, the combs are worthless.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try thinking I would have a horrible eyebrows from using it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> horrible, horrible.</li>
            <li> Pathetic product.</li>
            <li> this thing is awful when the worst ways.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband is in the Marine Corps and if he has a mustache, it has to be within regulations. This trimmer is perfect for precision trimming and works great!  It gets close to under the nose and trims nicely along the lip line.</li>
            <li> I loved my Braun 6500 which lasted nearly 15 years. This, on the other hand, not so much. It did work fine for a bit and could trim in small places and with precision. However, the blade assembly is powered by two small plastic pieces that then close around the motor \\&quot;spindle\\&quot; which then actuates the cutting blades. This is done when you snap the head back on to the mail body that houses the battery and motor. For some reason, mine would stop working intermittently requiring me to remove the head and twist it back on. That eventually resulted in the plastic fins breaking as I guess there was little room for error because if you are not perfectly careful when putting the head back on, the can plastic get easily crushed or mashed by the much stronger (and far less unbreakable and far more dense) metal motor arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the design had good intentions for precise trimming, but that&#x27;s the weak link. It was very good to trim small places, ear hair and nose hair (if you&#x27;re daring) but that&#x27;s it. I actually used the side trimmer on my Braun 6500 to trim my mustache over my top lip and the sides of my goatee (actually its called a Van Dye) because this trimmer can&#x27;t be used as a good straight edge for longer, straight trims like that. You can try, but you won&#x27;t get a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this item due to the design flaw of soft plastic to metal in the actuator/motor assembly. Then again, my Philips/Norelco has the same method of power, but the plastic is bigger and a little more durable. I am not not really a fan of all the attachments without really making sure the parts inside are durable enough to withstand the impact of anything but perfect alignment **when you can&#x27;t even see** if you are making a perfect alignment. Why did the designers make the linkages so fragile and then slap a big, long warranty on the other parts??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I need a new electric razor too. I see the Braun Series 5 now includes a Gillette ProGlide3-in-1 trimmer with both a blade and a similar trimming function. After looking at it I am thinking its probably a better choice given its less precise but more durable-looking design. Sounds like a good 2 for 1 deal to us facial hair consumers.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and has a decent amount of power for its size.  It&#x27;s compact, easy to hold, and easy to clean out.  It does feel a little cheap but it&#x27;s held up so far.</li>
            <li> I have a goatee and am constantly on the look out for things which will help me keep it trimmed with a minimum of fuss. Unfortunately, this is not the trimmer which will help me do that.    Despite the highly sculpted look of the model on the box, this trimmer will not do that kind of precise sculpting. It has two \\&quot;combs\\&quot; for different lengths of hair, but sill not shave down close to the skin like a razor. I consider the packaging extremely deceptive and misleading.    This device is designed to trim eyebrows and body hair to keep it at an optimal length, not sculpt it into cool shapes. If you need a device to keep eyebrows, mustaches, etc., at a specific length, the this will work quite well. Beyond that, if has no function.    It is rechargeable and is yet another plug-in wall wart to find plug space and keep track of.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have a full goatee and shave my head so I&#x27;m familiar with razors, shavers, clippers, etc.    I was excited to try the Cruzer as I thought it would would fill the gap between the clippers and the pop-up razor on my shaver.  Everything including the battery is included with the Cruzer.  However, upon turning the Cruzer on the unit began to make the most horrendous noise.  For such a small object the noise can literally be heard across the house.  As far as functionality the cruzer does have the ability to finely groom small areas, however it requires a lot of work and all the hair is not always cut on the first pass.    For a single-purpose device I would say that the Cruzer falls short on cutting hair and in attempting to cut hair will annoy everyone in the house as it is simply way too loud.  This will not be in my bathroom or travel bag much longer.</li>
            <li> If you test the device on some wispy leg hair, it can really cut! However, when faced with a beard (and mine&#x27;s not very tough) it is worthless. Also the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; are way too long for most beard styles.  That said, the design is amazing. Now if it only worked....</li>
            <li> This Product is worthless. With the guards on this trimmer is nothing more than a comb. Will not trim. With the guards off it will trim if you are careful. Definitely does not live up to product description.</li>
            <li> It is useful half the time, has a difficult time trimming my mustache. Looks cool I suppose but its just another gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Update: stopped working after a half dozen uses. Did not take up much room in trash can.</li>
            <li> The design is fine, but cannot adjust the trimming size.&lt;br /&gt;The smallest size is too thick for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer it cuts fast and it is really safe for the skin</li>
            <li> I just  purchased the cruZer 6 high definition on 28 Aug 2011. I have the cruZer 6 Face, which works awesome, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. It worked perfectly fine the 1st time I used it. I go to shave with it a 2nd time, and it wouldn&#x27;t cut at all and felt like it was trying to pull the hairs off instead of trim them. I&#x27;m going to be contacting Braun to see if I can get my money back for this product since it&#x27;s a piece of crap!!!</li>
            <li> This Braun Cruzer 6 is weak, noisy and not very effective. I got it for my Husband to use on his sideburns, eyebrows and other manly stray hairs. I was hoping he could use this instead of dulling out his face razor or unpacking our huge hair trimmer. He tried it on his sideburns first. The hair looked like it was verily even trimmed. He tried all of the attachments with similar results! It didn&#x27;t really trim any hair, it was loud and it did not even go through the hair smoothly. I can only imagine what it would be like on beards, goatees or mustaches. There are better trimmers out there for about the same price, or maybe a little more. Spend your money on those.</li>
            <li> I, being a 50 year old man have hairs growing from places I never dreamed of as a kid so I am always looking for products to keep the garden groomed.&lt;br /&gt;This little trimmer does a good job trimming but I found the length gauges cumbersome and had difficulty trimming my mustache close to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;It will also deafen you if it gets close to your ears.&lt;br /&gt;As much as it tries it isn&#x27;t a replacement for all in your trimming arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Tiny&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Good for travel&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;Not so good in tight places&lt;br /&gt;LOUD by your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out one of the Mangroomer products.&lt;br /&gt;Or Norelco.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;high def precision\\&quot; trimmer is just a very cheap plastic trimmer that you can probably find at a dollar store or \\&quot;as seen on tv.\\&quot;  (My motto:  If it&#x27;s seen on TV, leave it on TV!)  Having said this, I have to admit that this is the second one I&#x27;ve owned.  At about $10-$15, I don&#x27;t expect this trimmer to last long, but it does what it says and is ok for trimming mustaches, nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Braun ain&#x27;t made in Germany any more, and boy does it show. This is a cheap, made in crapland product that has none of the old-school Braun oomph I was once used to from their shavers, coffee makers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get it real cheap, it&#x27;ll trim your &#x27;stache, etc, but don&#x27;t expect Braun-type quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Braun, you can do WAY better.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the Braun Cruzer 6.  I thought wow, Braun finally is making a high quality micro shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it feels just as flimsy as those \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; micro shavers.  The only difference is that the body is a bit wider and easier to hold onto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two combs that attach to the head are useless for my beard.  The tines are spaced too far apart to align the hair of my beard, so nothing gets cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have only been able to use this micro shaver without the combs to get the stray mustache hairs that my regular groomer can&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also more gentle than a full sized groomer such as the ([[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]), if you have light hair on your chest that you want to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head on the cruzer is small, so you will have to cruze a lot for large body parts that you may want to shave.</li>
            <li> horrible, horrible. Not the quality I expect from Braun. Save your money, buy something else.</li>
            <li> Easy to use around the areas that are tough with a razor.  Battery operated which eliminates a charger, great portability.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer from the folks at Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to trim my eyebrows, nose and ears (those hard to reach spots!)&lt;br /&gt;It uses one AAA batttery for it&#x27;s power(the first one is alredy included in the package)&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer does a stellar trimming job IMO.</li>
            <li> Its a nice little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my son when giving him haircuts,&lt;br /&gt;Mostly around his ears. He likes it better than&lt;br /&gt;Holding his ears down and being afraid of the bigger&lt;br /&gt;Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It handles pretty good and I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> The packaging and the hype on it would lead you to believe that this is the perfect tool for keeping perfectly trimmed and shaped facial hair. I am underwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems exactly like a no-name item I bought a Walmart for about $10 a few years ago that was marketed as a bikini-line trimmer. It is about the size of a large pen and is powered by one AAA battery. It comes with 2 plastic heads that are supposed to allow you to trim hair to a certain length. Without the heads attached, it is a micro-head trimmer that lets you trim close to the skin. It does come with a rather nice, little stand that keeps it upright when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the teeth are really too fine to trim my husband&#x27;s thick mustache or beard hair. Without the heads, it works nicely to trim hair off of ears and to neaten up the edges of his stache and beard, but won&#x27;t work for keeping his beard or mustache a uniform length. I did use it to trim my 8 year old&#x27;s sideburns between haircuts and it worked well on his baby-fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun usually makes fine products and I own several, but I can&#x27;t say that I recommend this product for the purposes it seems to advertise.</li>
            <li> We have two people in our household that need to have trimming to their facial and body hair.  This precision hair cutter is easy to hold and work, and comes with several different length clip ons to keep hair at a certain length.  For facial beard hair, these guides work okay, but I find that taking them off gives a bit better control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is great for trimming chest hair and ear hair- used without the clip on length guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For facial hair, if using the guides, it is okay to use the guides on beards or for longer hair but they are a bit more challenging than I expected.  I am used to using hair clippers as I do a lot of hair.  The trimmer guides for this unit are not quite as easy to use as say, the peanut is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that this trimmer is really nice for doing precise angles and designs with facial hair.  Trimming is pretty close to the skin, and is relatively easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I am not sold on is how quickly the battery runs down.  I am seeing reduced performance after only four uses.  That is why I gave this four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a very excellent product It&#x27;s beautiful and elegant and I can use it with ease and you can take ane waer</li>
            <li> Really good product, life expentancy is not long. It lasted just more than 2 months then died on me.</li>
            <li> An excellent trimmer. The advantage of this design is that it can be used to directly trim ear and nose hair, as well as any other facial hair be it beard thickness or peach fuzz. The size of the cutting head may be too large for some to use for nose hair trimming, but it is not for me. This trimmer has never pulled a hair. The blade profile allows trimming of all areas of concern for me, though people who have very sensitive skin may be better off going with a model where the blades don&#x27;t contact the skin at all. It is ever so mildly uncomfortable against the inside of the nose, but neither pulls nor cuts the skin. The function and speed with with the trimmer works keeps that time so small, with superior results to a circular cut trimmer, that it is of no consequence to me. It also is excellent for extreme precision edging/trimming of facial hair, such as a Goatee, Van Dyke or Mustache. Of note: Mild force in the lengthwise direction easily separates the battery cover, so hold accordingly (especially when switching on), or it will slide open. Make sure to brush clean and oil after every use to prolong blade cutting life and maintain blade sharpness (and prevent pulling).</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this tiny trimmer. It&#x27;s shaped like a little electric toothbrush with a small trimmer head. About ¾ of an inch and takes one single AAA battery.  But I just couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the cheap feel of the plastic it was made of. It feels very light, but also fragile (having said that, it hasn&#x27;t broken yet).  It looks cheaply made.  It trims finer hair ok, but if you&#x27;re trimming thicker whiskers it may catch on the stubble. The blade is very fine and with only one AAA battery, it&#x27;s under powered and therefore takes some extra work to get the stubborn areas. The cutting blade is extremely fine, fine enough that it is really hard to cut yourself and the trimmer works if you have patience.  It&#x27;s also quite loud, louder than my large rechargeable trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame they couldn&#x27;t have gone with a more powerful charging solution. This trimmer has a detachable head, not unlike an electric tooth brush which means you can twist and pull to remove it for easy cleaning under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has two comb attachments for cutting to different lengths. And a base stand to hold the trimmer upright for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I really wanted to like this trimmer and it did help tidy my moustache and sideburns. But it&#x27;s underpowered and so the extra effort needed to really do a proper job of it means that I can&#x27;t recommend it for anything other than regular hair.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep things neat and tidy and it works great, better than the drug store brand trimmer I was using.  It comes with two guides which work great at keeping the shrub evenly trimmed without worry of nicking in areas that are hard to navigate.  It is very quiet too which is nice.  It is nice and small and fits easily in the bathroom drawer or in its little stand without taking up counter space.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not many complaints about this trimmer as it does the job similarly to any other similar low-budget trimmer.  Includes attachment settings for different styles.  Sometimes it may get stuck in midst of thick hair.  This is a great tool to remove nose and ear hair without much hassle.  Operates on a single AAA battery.  Braun is a great brand, so you pretty much spend a bit more on the brand name, but quite frankly I do not see much difference between this one and any other trimmer like this.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be my new go-to mustache trimmer, but I was wrong.  I&#x27;m not sure what this is good for, not much, especially with the guides on.</li>
            <li> This is not meant to do major sculpting of a beard.  Minor trimming is about all it&#x27;s really good for.</li>
            <li> Purchased this a couple of years ago and had good luck with it for trimming my eyebrows. Today, they were getting a little caterpillary so I went to use it and nothing. I assumed the battery was dead so I swapped it. Still nothing. Worked fine that last time I used it. I guess what do I expect for $12??</li>
            <li> The battery cover is too loose and it drops many times.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer , last a long time</li>
            <li> This is my second item that stops working.</li>
            <li> Not bad to trim blades and beard but it lacks some power, you have to pass it several times. Very handy though.</li>
            <li> How this product received some good reviews is beyond me. How can a reputable company like Braun launch such a good for nothing toy? First I tried to define my stubble; you have to move it back and forth a million times for it to have the slightest effect. I started getting red spots from the friction. Then I tried it on the inner part of my goatee; same thing with no apparent results, so I used a razor to do the job. My final test was to try and trim one hair at a time to see how the cruzer is really functioning. Couldn&#x27;t even remove one hair??? Is this a joke? I had to go over the same hair several times till it removed ONLY a part of it. No doubt, this is one of Braun&#x27;s biggest failures. Don&#x27;t they test their products before launching them?????</li>
            <li> I gave this to my hubby to trim his sideburns. It&#x27;s a tiny wee razor, so it doesn&#x27;t pack the kind of punch that you might be used to with the other Braun&#x27;s, But the intention of this was for precision rather than trimming a thick full beard. It&#x27;s great for that, it&#x27;s lightweight, you can take it in the shower, it has a stand, etc. It&#x27;s not meant to be used as an everyday razor, rather for shaping and sculpting and for that it does a good job.</li>
            <li> The Braun name is a very respected one in razors and I don&#x27;t find any reason to withhold that respect. This product, if you&#x27;re the right person, is really, really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not the right person: I&#x27;m not very hairy. This means, for example, that I wasn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be able to use the guards at all. You have to have some pretty bushy eyebrows or some such before those will be useful and I know I&#x27;m not going to be using the Cruzer on my head hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just about the only thing I was able to employ it for was trimming my mustache (without the guards). In that job, it performed magnificently: the blades were vibrating fast enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about catching and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine instrument, just be careful as it has the feel of brittleness. I&#x27;ll give this three stars for the non-hirsute, but four for those with more testosterone!</li>
            <li> I have not owned another product that does things similarly to the Braun Cruzer 6, so I can&#x27;t honestly compare it other facial hair trimmers in its class but I will highlight some pros and cons with this product. On the plus side, it has 3 different settings (one short setting and 2 attachments to give you different lengths). I find the longest setting is best for trimming my beard. Another great thing about this the settings securely click into place so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally come loose and mess up your beard or mustache! The battery life is very good. I&#x27;ve been using mine for several months and haven&#x27;t had to replace one yet. It also comes with a little stand you can place it upright on your countertop to optimize space. It is also very easy to clean because you can rinse it directly with water and it doesn&#x27;t affect the trimmer&#x27;s ability to perform. It&#x27;s very easy to wipe off the excess hair from the blade with a paper towel or cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the cons: There is no nose hair trimmer attachment, so this one is going to be strictly for beards, mustaches and sideburns...or...um...OTHER body hair should you choose to use it for that purpose! Next, since it mainly is a trimmer and not to act like a true razor, you can&#x27;t get a super close shave with this. However, with the lowest setting on it you can get an absolutely close trim if you don&#x27;t happen to have your razor handy. You could take a regular beard and make it look like about 3 o&#x27;clock shadow with this puppy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I have to recommend owning one of these if you like to keep your beard and mustache finely groomed. I only wish it had a nose hair trimmer attachment!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this trimmer for some things. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it would be helpful in trimming a beard or a mustache. The 2 attachments practically let no hair get through(although I did have a limited success on my eyebrows with the shorter attachment). So you would have to be very careful on sideburns or mustache; a little slip and you are Charlie Chaplain.     But I do like it for trimming body hair. The small size makes it convenient and safe for areas that might not be easy to get at with a larger razor.</li>
            <li> It does a good job trimming in tiny areas and making lines, but when it comes to cut longer hair (beard, mustache)it doesn&#x27;t have enough power that it takes forever to cut to the desired length.</li>
            <li> The shortest attachment does not provide a close trim, which is what I was looking for.  They should offer a different attachment so you can get a closer cut when needed.</li>
            <li> I have tried several beard trimmers and this one beats them all. It is small, easy to handle and cuts close.  It is not made to cut the beard, just to trim and that is what it is good at!</li>
            <li> I had an oldef one tath worked better...</li>
            <li> Descent product for minor grooming.  Includes 2 adapters so there are 3 different levels (length) for shaving.  Not a heavy duty product.  I especially like the included base which allows users to keep the product standing straight up.</li>
            <li> Is hard to use, does not trim properly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to trim my beard. I keep is short, about 3mm now. This really does not fit the bill, as the settings jump from 0, to 5mm and up. As I should have read the sizes before purchasing I gave this 4 stars, I am sure it will fit the bill if you are looking for a longer trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this to trim around my lips, nose and other areas where I want it to a zero setting. I love that you can rinse this under the sink. It makes cleaning up so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is inexpensive, but does not feel cheap in any way. I have other Braun&#x27;s and they work very well.</li>
            <li> Looks good and has the Braun name but quality wise its no different than the cheap trimmers you see on infomercials. They can only be used for small areas and even then I have to run over it multiple times for it to cut. Judging by the fragile quality, my guess is it will not last either. Nice packaging and brand name but cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> And although that may be true for cars, it isn&#x27;t for Braun. This little device will outperform your average beard trimmer and add style to your bathroom. I was quite pleased with how smoothly it runs. The device is compact and easy to handle. Try trimming your beard with head hear cutters. It&#x27;s quite awkward. One negative side of the Braun is that is lacks power for tough hair, but then again, it&#x27;s advisable to trim your beard and not other parts of your body. Overall, I am very pleased with my Braun and recommend it as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is wel made and not as flimsy as some others I have bought, A very nice item and would buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few small trimmers like this and been disappointed every time by poor quality, lack of strength, attachments. Unfortunately this Braun trimmer is no better. The attachments aren&#x27;t very varied, none short enough to use on the eyebrows. Battery power isn&#x27;t enough to drive this little clipper, perhaps if it was a rechargeable like the other clippers in this line it would be better. But then there&#x27;s the issue of the attachments, nothing will fix that problem. At least it isn&#x27;t too expensive, and it might work for you, probably fine without any attachments if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of neck hair or fine tune beard line, but ultimately disappointing from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> You can get a better face shave with a six-month old Bic razor. Pathetic product. I&#x27;ve already asked for my money back.</li>
            <li> ok but not what I was looking for to trim around the ears.</li>
            <li> This is a total peice of shit. Literally doesn&#x27;t trim the hair and it runs out of batteries quickly while not doing shit.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most youre going to get out of a trimmer like this. Its great and holds a charge for months. I have harsh nose hairs and o use it to trim up some body hair too. If this can withstand my pelt, it should last a lifetime in your cave.</li>
            <li> Small, compact and it trims very well.</li>
            <li> it is too small for an adult to use on all of our body .on the other hand ,it doesn&#x27;t fit its explanation .what about the good hand is it is very convince to cut a special shape of little part of hair and beards .</li>
            <li> Kudos Amazon because I have bought this item from different sites many times &amp; Amazon had it for a great price!  It&#x27;s an awesome little trimmer for every small area that needs to be trimmed ... bought these for my husband, son &amp; daughter &amp; I have one!!!  I have tried many trimmers in the past &amp; this is the best in my opinion!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for less than two months and already it&#x27;s not working. Tried to change batteries but still to no avail. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did its job but as its all plastic it will bend and lose the battery connection.</li>
            <li> The only reason I recently purchased the Norelco GoStyler is because after dropping this thing for the umpteenth time, the razor head assembly finally broke and I couldn&#x27;t put it back together... even still the motor was still working, 5-stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for goatee and later for beard trimming and it always worked great. I highly recommend this device.</li>
            <li> I have a stylized cut and this device works great for the hard to reach areas. It&#x27;s very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> does what it should do. simple as that. great for eye brows, outline of ears just about anywhere you need a small trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about when it comes to something special. It is a typical trimmer with a couple attachments. It does an average job compared to my last trimmer, no better no worse.</li>
            <li> Not enough power to trim hair.  Unit seizes up even when you try to trim one or two stray hairs.</li>
            <li> This is his second one, the first died after a year. He uses it daily and has never complained, its a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a small, easy to use trimmer.  It is not as powerful as others that I have tried and did not seem to cut as easily as I would like. While it was okay for my eyebrows it was not great with my sideburns.    I do find this great to take when I travel because it is so small and easy to clean.  It is also  fine for quick trims.  Yet, when I really want to do some trimming  I have another electric razor that is bigger and comes with more attachments that I like better.    Braun is a good company.  Hopefully they can make this more powerful and the trimming more precise.    This comes with two combs, a protective cap and a stand. The battery is also included.</li>
            <li> First, I will admit that since this is a low voltage trimmer, it does get a little slow around thick hairs (minus 1 star).  Other than that one flaw, this item works great.  It trims eyebrows when you&#x27;re in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to pluck or get threaded at the mall.  Lightweight, easy to clean and comes with a simple elegant stand to keep the blade upright and ready for daily use.  If you&#x27;re like me though and you keep the pile of different razors and trimmers in a pull out drawer, the stand is just another piece of plastic.  Also recommended for lightweight on-the-go travel.</li>
            <li> Struggles to trim my mo. Ok for trimming eyebrows</li>
            <li> السلعة جدا رائعة&lt;br /&gt;وعملها جدا دقيق&lt;br /&gt;وفعلا آداة مدهشة من براون&lt;br /&gt;وهي سهلة الاستخدام&lt;br /&gt;وسعرها مناسب جدا&lt;br /&gt;ووصلت بشكل سريع</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and not much power. The blade does not glide along your skin. The design is good, but there are much better choices out there for less money like the Wahl Lithium micro groomer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Cruzer since I received, it is still in use, the same as new, and it does it&#x27;s job well. Very useful specially hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 is a nice grooming tool. It is small, has multiple comb sizes, making it easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store. It runs on one AAA battery, which seems to last a very long time before needing replaced. It&#x27;s a lightweight unit made a brand known for exceptional quality. Though this little tool is made of lightweight, cheap feeling plastic, which makes me question its long-term durability, so far it has worked flawlessly, even been dropped on a hard floor once from off a counter-top and didn&#x27;t even phase it. Very handy for keeping those ear and nose hairs under control, while chopping down those bushy eyebrows into something less barbaric looking. A must have for any man&#x27;s grooming tool arsenal.</li>
            <li> not really good for using it for your beard or sideburns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the motor is far to weak, it works better for maybe eye brows or slight and tight cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got this to trim my beard but you can&#x27;t really do that with this due to the low power of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all i can&#x27;t really recommend it, not too happy with it, but not disgusted with it either :X</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to agree with what a lot of the other reviewers are saying. With a name like Braun on this, I expected a lot more. I didn&#x27;t really have much use for the attachments. I used it without them. It did okay for small trimming jobs but not so great through think areas. This just falls short of what I expect from Braun. I have had other Braun shavers and was always impressed. I have to say skip this one.</li>
            <li> Damage after first used</li>
            <li> this item is good for me  i love it so much  the price is suit for me  i lke it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found people are overly harsh on this product.  It&#x27;s not worth the scolding it has received.  I&#x27;ll be to-the-point.  It&#x27;s sturdy, comes with a relatively nice little stand to keep it on if you plan on decorating your bathroom counter with it, it comes with an AAA battery supplied, and with the two attachments promised.  Packaging is nice, small and not overly dramatic so you can store it fine.  It&#x27;s about the size of a toothbrush and the battery is easily accessed; just pull the two sides of the trimmer apart.  It also comes with a plastic guard for the blade too, I forgot to mention.  OK, technicalities aside, I&#x27;ll give my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t think it deserves some of the bad press I read on the reviews prior to purchasing is because I don&#x27;t think people have considered exactly what this tool is for.  It was never created to trim your entire beard down to a close shave (although it could probably handle that unless you&#x27;ve got a massively thick beard), this was advertised as a \\&quot;High Definition Precision\\&quot; trimmer.  And I review and criticise it as such.  It wasn&#x27;t intended to replace your current clippers of shavers, it was meant more for a younger audience who want to style their facial hair, perhaps, but can most certainly be used to line-up hairlines, sideburns, moustaches and beards, take off neck hair, anything really, except for doing a massive shave-job.  If you have not a lot of facial hair or it isn&#x27;t too thick, then you cannot expect to use something so small to get that job done.  This is clearly a shaving accessory.  I wanted it to shape-up my beard, cut some designs into it and so forth with a precision tool.  I was attracted to the pen/toothbrush-like design since it&#x27;s small enough to let you get into hard-to-reach places such as the philtrum or the area on your chin beneath your bottom lip, with better accuracy than other trimmers allow since the blade is much smaller.  And for this purpose, it has done a wonderful job.  You canclean it easily and you can run the blade under the tap which is handy.  I think it would be best if you go over your beard with your usual shaving tool, and use this to get at the stray hairs or line it up if you wish.  I&#x27;m fussy and bought this because I like my beard properly lined-up with sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the battery life, I can&#x27;t say how long it will last with one AAA since I only got it today, but in regards to my first shave, I had a thick beard and after using it for around 30 minutes to really shape up every nook and cranny, it was still running fine.  Just stick to a decent battery brand to save yourself the pain of low power shaving with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bare blade (which is what I used- I use my other trimmers to trim the facial hair to the length I want) cuts quite close, and the reason I&#x27;ve subtracted a star from the rating is because the motor is powerful enough, but you may find that your hair will sometimes catch.  This may be because my facial hair is about as thick as my head hair, if not thicker.  It didn&#x27;t struggle, but you will need to go over it a couple of times (again, more likely if you have thick, dark hair like me).  It is highly portable and the blade guard helps eliminate a reason for a carry case.  Overall, I think 4 out of 5 is fair considering it DOES shave well and quite close (slight stubble is left), it&#x27;s durable and it does what it&#x27;s made for: defining and precision shaving.  It will not replace your current shaver but it&#x27;s well worth the low price tag for a portable and quite precise shaver.  As I said, the one star removed is for the pain of some of the hairs catching due to power, but it wasn&#x27;t anything to cry about.</li>
            <li> I read some discouraging reviews about this product but went ahead and bought it anyway. I&#x27;m 18 so my beard isn&#x27;t all the way full but it&#x27;s there. I used this to shape my sideburns and mustache and it worked just fine. I could even try to do my whole beard with it but it&#x27;ll take a really long time and won&#x27;t be all the way clean. For the Braun brand I expected better quality though, because it runs on a single AAA battery so it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power. I don&#x27;t recommend this for men with thick beards but for people like me it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and remove hairs precisely where I want it out.  Always there when needed with good battery life.  A good buy for a new user.  Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer..It gets the small stuff done with no problem..A+ in my book. would def recemond to a friend</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realise that I couldn&#x27;t use the trimmer without the 2 combs.&lt;br /&gt;5mm &amp; 8mm are too long for me as I don&#x27;t have such robust facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Half my fault for not understanding the advertised text.</li>
            <li> Recommend a good product to buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Cruzer 6 for about a month now.  It&#x27;s a nifty little trimmer.  The two included guides let you choose a specific length at which the trimmer will cut your hair.  They work really well for sideburns and eyebrows.  I&#x27;d be a little apprehensive about trying to trim an entire beard with this device, though, as it&#x27;s powered by a single AAA battery.  The motor is not incredibly strong.  It&#x27;s sufficient for some touch up grooming, but it&#x27;s not designed to do much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device also includes a small stand.  It doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of case to hold it or the guides.  The build quality is OK, but nothing spectacular.  This isn&#x27;t solid like some of the Braun electric shavers I&#x27;ve had over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it&#x27;s a handy little device for precision trimming between trips to the barber.</li>
            <li> Never mind that, from a distance, the Braun Cruzer 6 High Definition trimmer may resemble a small--if stylish--toothbrush, the fact is it&#x27;s actually a facial hair trimmer that&#x27;s big on power and precision.    Powered by a single AAA battery, the Cruzer comes with two trimming combs (one 8mm and one 5mm) to enable neatly precise trimming of sideburns, mustaches, brows and other facial elements.    To get even closer, you can simply leave off both of those click-on combs and work with the extra-precise, extra small, sufficiently sharp metal trimming element which, like those plastic combs, cleans easily under running water.    This isn&#x27;t the trimmer you&#x27;d want for bushier facial hair.  This is for folks who like to keep everything fairly close to the face and well manicured.  It works especially well for cleaning up sideburns and eyebrows and going after those stray hairs that your regular razor may have missed.    The easy-to-grip design and its light weight gives you plenty of control and it comes with a little plastic stand that lends it that executive toothbrush-like appearance.    It also makes for an easy-to-pack travel companion.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other trimmers to use for the peach fuzz I get on the sides of my face and on my neck. They work for awhile, but then seem to fall apart.  This trimmer is really well -made and definitely stands up to the test of time.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job and really makes your facial hair turn out to be like you got out of a barbershop... If you know how to cut or trim your own hair.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is more thick and course.  This does not cut very well for those with similar facial hair as mine.  It does work well for finer and thinner hairs but don&#x27;t expect it to cut the thick stuff so easily.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the intention of using it to create an attractive facial hair line, and to trim up strays. Worked fine for me for a few months and I finally had to replace the battery. Well after that the blade just won&#x27;t move, it turns on, everything else is working except for the blade. So all-in-all a pretty useless product. Really wish there were something just like this, but built well.</li>
            <li> this thing is awful when the worst ways. first off cant cut my beard hair. second it only works when i take off the bottom and have the batter popping out which is stupid. not i only had this for about 3 weeks tops and i already have issues. save your money and dont buy this.</li>
            <li> I purchased the High Definition Trimmer off of Amazon. I also purchased the Cruzer Face 6 and Series 7:790. That said, albeit recent... I have relatively some experience with these Braun shavers. The Braun HD is NOT a high caliber product. It&#x27;s fancy for the type of low end trimmer that it is, but in my opinion, it is not meant to be used by itself as a trimmer because it has so many limitations. It can&#x27;t cut a lot of hair at once and it is not powerful, but to say that it&#x27;s useless would be a gross exaggeration. I feel that this trimmer is meant to be used in unison or combination with the Cruzer Face or maybe some other shaver or goatee shaper. The trimmer does have a weak motor, but it doesn&#x27;t need to have a super strong motor because it shouldn&#x27;t used to cut lots of hair. For me, the purpose of this trimmer is to get to those hard to reach corners or areas where the larger trimmers may have a tough time carving out an edge. I use the HD to square my goatee or to give me a clean line under my nose. I must warn you though, if not used correctly, this trimmer will nick your skin and draw blood. You need to be close in on the mirror, skin stretched, so you can see what you&#x27;re doing. I learned that the hard way.  It is super sharp when it comes to knicking hairs and it cuts very close to the skin... about as close as you can get without yanking the hair completely out. The HD seems to be a great compliment to my Cruzer Face 6. The Cruzer has an awesome trimmer in it&#x27;s own right, but it&#x27;s still a little bulky for corners and using it for a few hairs here and there seems cumbersome. The HD alleviates me from having to whip out a razor to knick certain areas my shaver can&#x27;t handle quite so well. An HD plus an electric shaver makes it such that you will never need to buy a razor ever again. Say goodbye to irritated skin.  Alone, this product sucks... but in combination with another shaver, this product is a dreamcatcher.</li>
            <li> Nice, you get what you see...</li>
            <li> it is good for me ,from CN</li>
            <li> Stop working properly after a while &amp; I could not find the heads</li>
            <li> This is a complete piece of trash it has completely stopped cutting hair after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it very well. Very handy to touch up beard edges and goatee areas...</li>
            <li> for the guy who knows what he&#x27;s doing or the guy who has no clue.... this fool proof trimmer is perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap,I like it.</li>
            <li> I actually got this at Walmart today on sale/clearance for $4.00. Not sure if it&#x27;s a nation-wide sale but may be worth checking your local store! Anyways, I only need this for trimming some hard-to-shave hairs around my eyebrows and on my ears. Works just fine. I have no use for the attachments so I can&#x27;t say how well they work, but I can&#x27;t imagine any pen-type trimmer performing better than the rest. They&#x27;re pretty simple devices. I only judge them by how well the trimmer itself cuts hairs, and this one works flawlessly so far.</li>
            <li> Braun has a good reputation for quality. Braun has  failed on this one though . It does not cut very well i believe your paying more for design and portability than the product itself</li>
            <li> Does nothing, shouldn&#x27;t be called a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;You can just use it on the defining edges, the combs are worthless.</li>
            <li> Trims eyebrow to the perfect length.  I was afraid to try thinking I would have a horrible eyebrows from using it.  It turned out great.  I use it on myself and my husband.</li>
            <li> I really do not understand the positive reviews here. This razor is a complete waste of money. I don&#x27;t have a particularly thick or tough beard but this razor makes no headway as a fine trimmer of corners or fine lines. It just tugs at the skin and causes pain. The two guards are completely useless too as they are too long and the teeth too far apart. They do nothing to raise hair for a clean cut whether on your be beard / moustache or eyebrows. You would almost be better with a comb and a pair of scissors!!</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t think its that great</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. If you&#x27;re not careful, the battery compartment cover will come off.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.  I wanted a one inch beard.  It a as hard to find one; UNTIL I CAME ACROSS thus one. Simply stated.  This beard trimmer has been perfect in every way.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the hope it would make my sideburns easy to trim close to my face. The guides are too big. For sideburns it is just not practical. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work, it turns on sometimes but the blades don&#x27;t move. I took it apart, inside its all plastic. A little plastic head vibrates up and down, its supposed to fit between two plastic tabs in the head of the unit to make the blades move but its cheap and doesn&#x27;t fit snug enough. If you&#x27;re planning to actually use this to cut through even the thinnest hair, you&#x27;ll have to buy something else because this is garbage.</li>
            <li> For what this does you could get equal or better for far less (have used those with just as much success in the past).  For eyebrows this needs a smaller guard ,the two that they provide are barely short enough to trim eye brows, thats just the bottom line.  I also bought a Braun Cruzer 6 face Shaver but have not used it yet.  I am hoping it fares better than this overpriced item.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer, its small, rubs on regular batteries so you don&#x27;t have to worry about plugging it in or recharging it.  However, its light and plastic and small, so its really only good for minor detail trimming.  It seems to work for its intended purpose, but don&#x27;t expect to get this and never need a regular beard trimmer again.  Its not as loud as some trimmers are, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t reach my eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> This little thing is VERY powerful.  Be VERY careful.  You can very quickly remove more hair than you intend.  I ran this through the hair on my arm, and it cleared it in seconds.  Battery has lasted over 2 months so far, using it twice a week,</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had it for many months now. works very well initially. i think i need a new blade now</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers I have used.  However in 3 years I am on my 3rd one.  The price is good but the replacement cycle isn&#x27;t.  The last one lasted just over a year and the blade fell out...</li>
            <li> This thing worked fine for about 3 weeks and then it completely died.  I didn&#x27;t even really get a chance to complain about it&#x27;s lack of cutting power.</li>
            <li> Was good for a year and then it broke.</li>
            <li> I just could not believe the quality this little trimmer gave out. This was just what I was looking for, A close a sharp shave.  This little trimmer is serious.  Well Done Braun. I would recommend to anybody....</li>
            <li> Been searching for a good trimmer. Works great and even in the shower. If your looking for something compared to the micro touch, this is the item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought it, It&#x27;s really helpful and easy to use so I recommended this product to anyone want to save time.</li>
            <li> Okay.  I bought the Braun Hi Definition trimmer a Wal-Mart.  I&#x27;d bought a cheap trimmer prior to buying this, thinking it was a lot better since it was priced high.  I WAS WRONG! This little plastic piece of junk won&#x27;t last you that long.  A couple of months maybe, but that&#x27;s it.  If it&#x27;s made in China, Taiwan or whatever other third world country DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! Anything you buy that&#x27;s made in China will not last.  I had to replace the battery that came with the trimmer with a brand new battery because the thing was running slow.  I thought a new battery would troubleshoot the problem.  Once again I WAS WRONG! Even with a new battery, the stupid trimmer STILL runs slow.  Sometimes it won&#x27;t run at all when I turn it on.  I smack it against the palm of my hand and it starts running.  PLEASE! I beg you! Don&#x27;t listen to the good reviews about this trimmer and DON&#x27;T turn in your hard-earned cash for this piece of junk.  You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, love it for eyebrows, but for trimming hair around my goatee blades need to be sharper - need to go over the same spot repeatedly to get the job done</li>
            <li> Handy little trimmer.  It operates on one AAA 1.5 volt battery.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it about a dozen times and it does the job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;One problem with mine is that the On-Off slide switch doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;make a full contact and so the trimmer does not always run&lt;br /&gt;at full speed.  If I were manufacturing it, I would use a more&lt;br /&gt;substantial switch.  But, it does do the job and allows for some&lt;br /&gt;really fine trimming!</li>
            <li> Did not really work as claimed. Would not purchase it again</li>
            <li> Excellent device for a very reasonable price.  I use all over.  will shop again.  my wife also uses it.  keep the good work.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to do eyebrows and found it amazing, the 2 included tips let you groom to your preferred length in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for eyebrows, nose and ears.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite trimmer for all of the awkward to deal with hair. The guard is nicely designed to trim eyebows well without leaving you with no eyebrows, as some others I&#x27;ve tried have done. Washable head is a bonus also.</li>
            <li> These type of trimmers have been around for a long time. I bought the Braun for the name, which it didn&#x27;t dissapoint me. A few bucks more,but it works better that the cheapo ones at Walmart. As with most of these shaver/trimmer units, they&#x27;ve kept the size down to a minumim, which in turn makes them use a AAA battery. Just wish they&#x27;d design one with a little bigger body to accept a AA battery, it itsn&#x27;t that much bigger but would make the unit run allot longer</li>
            <li> Works like intended and has been trimming my hair for over a month with no problems. Does pull a little but does a fair job at trimming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, the commercial was better then the product though. If you grow bushy beards and stashes, it may work better for you then it did me.</li>
