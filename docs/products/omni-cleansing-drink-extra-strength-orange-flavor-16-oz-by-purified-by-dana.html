            <li> used the drink the first time nasty as hell but it did work then started takin the omni pills and they worked better but I took pain pill on a tuesday(large amount) suboxone on Wednesday and had a DT on Thursday drank the drank an hour half b4 I went drank a 2liter of water and pissed abt 7 times and was clean</li>
            <li> Personal experience is all I have, 100% worked for me!  Toxin free for 11 days and all went well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times now in as many years.  Thank you Omni</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is IT WORKED.</li>
            <li> USUALLY, THIS PRODUCT HAS ALWAYS WORKED WONDERS FOR US............THIS TIME ONE OF THE BOTTLES HAD A SMALL MINUTE PIN PRICK AND BEING OLD LIKE I AM, LOL, TOOK ME AWHILE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE BOX WAS WET BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A SMALL MINUTE HOLE.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks of ingesting no toxins, and it worked for the dip-strip test used by a counseling center visited by someone who isn&#x27;t me. Unsure of how well it would hold up against a laboratory test, but drink this and refill twice with water to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not that bad, I wouldn&#x27;t choose to drink it for the flavor - but it&#x27;s certainly not going to induce vomiting.</li>
            <li> Lololololol :D :D the comments on here are just hilarious!!! good job guys lol</li>
            <li> Totally worked!  Get yourself some drug urine test strips so you&#x27;ll know before and after using this drink.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly to me, passed the urine test</li>
            <li> Was gross, didn&#x27;t work on Bupenipherine. Alot to drink too.</li>
            <li> A+++++++++  thankyou so  much ,,,,fast shippment even though there was a hurricane on the east coast,,,i  will recomend this drink to friends and family</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this product. Definitely saved me again. Followed the directions to the tee &amp; got the job I was hoping for. I&#x27;m a heavy smoker weigh about 200lbs 6&#x27;1. I quit smoking for about 2wks before because I had a heads up. I drank 16oz water before I drank omni. I also took the soft pill after I drank omni. Drank about 64oz water after &amp; it worked great.</li>
            <li> Did not wok as described, followed instructions perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my needs. I would buy more if my needs require it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this drink before and is very beneficial. I would recommend this drink for everyone with a cleansing situation.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I was looking to mask Nicotine which I was told this product will do that and it didn&#x27;t and I Followed the directions as noted. Maybe if a person is trying to mask something else it may work but not for Nicotine.</li>
            <li> Product did not work :-( it is just a nice source of vitamins..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be more blunt than that. Yes. It works. I hate that Amazon wants me to give you a detailed review, but what I can say without a doubt is that this stuff works. It tastes horrible. But if what you want it for is what I think you want it for, it&#x27;s worth it, it works, it does its job, just follow the directions there and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
