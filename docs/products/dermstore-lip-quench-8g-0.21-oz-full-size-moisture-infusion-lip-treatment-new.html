            <li>the worst dry, parched, chapped, peeling lips which sometimes would get so dry that my bottom lip would crack down the middle and bleed if I smiled or laughed without some kind of lip balm on! OUCH!</li>
            <li>I have to use it inside of my upper and lower lips, and it protects the skin very well.</li>

            <li> I did not purchase my Lip Quench here, but got it as a free gift in one of my Derm Store orders. What a stroke of luck!!! I am 55 yrs. old and for the past 10 years, I have had the worst dry, parched, chapped, peeling lips which sometimes would get so dry that my bottom lip would crack down the middle and bleed if I smiled or laughed without some kind of lip balm on! OUCH! I really have to use something at bed time *every* night or I will have problems.&lt;br /&gt; I have used VERY expensive balms such as La Mer ( crazy money and only worked fair for me). Once I got that tube as a free gift, I have never looked back. NOTHING works better for my dry lips and it seems to have a mild plumping effect as well, which was a nice surprise. Bottom line? At $12 a tube,( that&#x27;s The Derm Store price) there is no way you can go wrong. I would buy this even if it cost more. I use every night, it is still on when I get up in the morning, and my lips feel GREAT and look smooth!&lt;br /&gt; There is only one draw back I can even think to mention, which is that is does tend to stick heavily on drinking glasses or cups. But really when something works this well.. SO WHAT??? LOVE IT!!! Thank you Derm Store! You saved my lips!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and it&#x27;s great.  Gives just a slight pink shine and lasts a long time.  Very gentle and non-irritating which was important to me.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample and realized I almost used it all up so I searched on amazon.  I found out it was discontinued but I a seller still offered it. It feels like heaven on the lips with no obnoxious odor or sweet aftertaste.</li>
            <li> The product itself is &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; so that it does not disappear even when drinking water. I have to use it inside of my upper and lower lips, and it protects the skin very well. I consider it to be &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;.  The downside is the packaging. The tube is small and difficult to squeeze the product out of. Wish it was in a small pot. Now I cut the bottom off and scrape out All the product inside and transfer it to a Blistex pot. Waste not. A bit expensive but makes my lips look great and is the right consistency.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and can be used with lipstick as well.  I received a sample and about another but look for a better price than I received. Twenty dollars foe a tube is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I really like how long this lip balm last, and you only need a little bit. Normally, I&#x27;m putting lip stuff on constantly because it disappears so quick. With this, I didn&#x27;t and it would last over an hour or more each time. Works well with lipstick too</li>
            <li> I do belive it is worth the buy. I am a dude and my sister told me to use this because i get really bad chapped lips. Although it does have a lil bit of shimmer, you can just wear it when you are at home when no one is around so your lips can cure and get extremly mosturized. Very pleased with this thing!</li>
            <li> Coats well and stays on a long time.  Works for me!  I wish the Dermstore would get more in stock since it&#x27;s cheaper on their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would make this in more colors!!! It makes my lips look and feel great and has a nice pink tint. It isn&#x27;t too sticky. It doesn&#x27;t dry out too fast. It doesn&#x27;t run around the mouth. It just makes lips look smooth and pretty and almost natural :-)</li>
            <li> This is the best product I ever used</li>
            <li> This was not at all what I expected. The tube was basically empty. Hated it. I would love a new full tube.</li>
            <li> I received my first tube of Dermastore Lip Quencher as a free gift.  I have been ordering it every since!!  In fact I make sure I have one in my bathroom to use after every face washing, one in my car and one in my purse.  It does not cake on my lips and gives me just the hint of color I want not to mention I never have dry lips now!  Thanks to whomever came up with this formular---you got it right!!</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Dermstore when I placed an order. I was skeptical as it was \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; however this is by far the best lip moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It lasted all night long. I will be purchasing another from Amazon as it is cheaper and free shipping.</li>
            <li> just the best lip conditioner i have ever used. First time my lips havent been chapped the whole fall and winter... Impressed!</li>
            <li> I always have tried lips because I have a bad habit of licking my lips all the time. This is the only lip cover that works for me believe I have tried them all. I will never use anything else. Besides the four lip quench that I purchased through Amazon  I gave away as x-mas gifts in my friends bags. They know love your product.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I have been hooked on lip balm for &amp;#62;40 years.  This doesn&#x27;t taste good but that&#x27;s the trick!  I don&#x27;t lick my lips and therefore don&#x27;t need to keep reapplying.  Gotta try it.</li>
            <li> Changed formula but still good for protecting lips over a long period of time.  I use it mainly for overnight and it is still sticky enough to feel on your lips in the morning.  I just ordered one to see how Dermstore changed it since I read that it is not the same as it used to be.  It is not as sticky as it used to be.  Probably good for using outdoors especially this winter.</li>
