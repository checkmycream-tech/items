            <li>Sweet &amp; fruity.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re wanting something fruity &amp; sweet with a softness...</li>
            <li>If you like sweet fruity smells</li>
            <li>This perfume has an extremely sweet fruity smell (One of the sweetest I ever had).</li>
            <li>As I have noted before it is EXTREMELY sweet and and its a perfume...</li>
            <li>It is EXTREMELY sweet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you can get much sweeter than this stuff, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I try to avoid spraying it directly onto my clothes because I prefer the smell of it melded with the oils of my own skin.</li>
            <li>I am a full grown woman</li>
            <li>heavily sweet</li>
            <li>It reminds me of spun sugar so if you&#x27;re not into sweet smells</li>

            <li>It smells warm and fruity with just a tiny touch of floral.</li>
            <li>had come right on time</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments for the first hour or so, then it fades.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it last all day.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m very please at the price and for the same perfume I love wearing.</li>
            <li>Within half an hour the top notes are completely gone and the undertones are very mild.</li>
            <li>It smells like pure cotton candy to me.</li>
            <li>I personally also like to mix and match it sometimes with Lolita Lampicka&#x27;s original perfume.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that smelled very soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had gotten my first bottle in store and this will be my second bottle but from Amazon.</li>

            <li> I bought this perfume for the 1st time at the mall in Perfumania Store and got tons of compliments on the smell. Nice sweet smell and not alcohol smelling. my coworker bought it for his wife because it smelled so good. I couldn&#x27;t believe i found it on this site and for cheaper. Arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li> Sweet &amp; fruity. The smell lasted really good for about 2 hours... which is not bad, in my opinion. Wanted something soft- strawberry/raspberry type scent. And this was perfect for that. Very feminine smell- if you&#x27;re wanting something a little stronger- with a little harsher scent... you&#x27;re out of luck with this. But if you&#x27;re wanting something fruity &amp; sweet with a softness... this is the perfume for you!</li>
            <li> GRACIAS TODO PERFECTO</li>
            <li> Smells super good I&#x27;ve had gotten my first bottle in store and this will be my second bottle but from Amazon. I have to say I&#x27;m very please at the price and for the same perfume I love wearing.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites for some years now</li>
            <li> excellent product, Mom loves this fragrance</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice, but doesn&#x27;t have very good staying power. I get lots of compliments for the first hour or so, then it fades.</li>
            <li> If you like sweet fruity smells youll love this. I usually wear perfume like Britneys Fantasy and magnitisim.. This is just as yummy</li>
            <li> This has the same name as another perfume- so it wasn&#x27;t what they wanted&lt;br /&gt;smells nice just not the right one</li>
            <li> ONE of my favs get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Tremendo perfume... llego a tiempo (Venezuela)</li>
            <li> This perfume has an extremely sweet fruity smell (One of the sweetest I ever had). I think I tried most of the sweet perfumes on the market and I really enjoy this one. As I have noted before it is EXTREMELY sweet and and its a perfume... so you can use only one or two sprays that will last all day. I personally also like to mix and match it sometimes with Lolita Lampicka&#x27;s original perfume. It creates a very unique smell :).</li>
            <li> Smells sooooooooo good!</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is magical. It is almost intoxicating! It is EXTREMELY sweet. I don&#x27;t know if you can get much sweeter than this stuff, but I love it. I spray it while I&#x27;m still bare out of the shower and my whole body takes on the sweetest, most delicious scent all day and for days after. I try to avoid spraying it directly onto my clothes because I prefer the smell of it melded with the oils of my own skin. I am not a big fan of perfume whatsoever. Most of it gives me a headache and smells overly chemically and like it was made in a factory. This stuff just smells like SUGAR! It smells like pure cotton candy to me. I would put it in it&#x27;s own category of perfume. I am a full grown woman but before I found this perfume I would dream back to childhood days where my mom would buy me $3 cotton candy body spray at the grocery store. Of course I can&#x27;t wear that now, so I&#x27;m so glad I found this! It smells wonderful. People compliment me on my perfume all the time. I don&#x27;t know if I would suggest it to everyone, but if you&#x27;re looking for cotton candy/vanilla/heavily sweet definitely try this one out. I don&#x27;t care if I smell like a cotton candy kid- I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Amazon sold this scent.  I bought this while visiting Pittsburgh, Pa over the summer and my bottle is almost gone. So when I saw this I had to have it. It&#x27;s legit smells wonderful.  Thank you Amazon for having this on yor site. Love it, love it, love it. Shipped when it said and recieved it when said. It was packaged with care and that is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it is very sweet but not over-powering. My boyfriend isnt too fond of it, he likes it but it makes him crave cake. Id give it 4 stars but because im used to givenchy and esté lauder it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me.</li>
            <li> A very sexy scent  that&#x27;s not too sweet or strong. Not fruity or woodsy very easy to fond and reorder.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for my mother and had to get some for me!&lt;br /&gt;It had come right on time and I love the box that it comes in. It is so stylish!&lt;br /&gt;This perfume smells just like cotton candy. I have yet to wear it, but something tells me this is going to be my signature perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I had given it 4 stars because of the packaging. The perfume was taped up, and the heart on the box had come off :(.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that XOXO Mi Amore es mi amor!</li>
            <li> Great price, great smell &amp; I love it.  Who knew such an inexpensive perfume could smell so yummy?! Cute bottle</li>
            <li> Very subtle, sweet scent. Great for everyday use or even a formal evening out.</li>
            <li> Soft aroma and lasting</li>
            <li> Love!!!!!!! My new favorite perfume! Smells like sweetarts or some sugary candy...but in the best way. Walked into a small store and 3 ppl immediately said &amp;#34;who smells so delicious?!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful. I wear it all the time. It reminds me of spun sugar so if you&#x27;re not into sweet smells then this isn&#x27;t for you. I love it because its got a soft warm scent to it but unfortunately it does not last long. Within half an hour the top notes are completely gone and the undertones are very mild. Still a lovely perfume though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I use it everyday. I&#x27;m going to buy more because I&#x27;m almost out. I love the scent and it last all day. Great Buy!</li>
            <li> Loved this, great new scent at least for me. My new favorite!</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about what perfumes I purchase. I went into Sephora and I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smells, so I took a risk and purchased this perfume online after weeks of research (YES I&#x27;M THAT PICKY). I was looking for something that smelled very soft and feminine. I stay far away from granny-like smells, citrus, earthy woody smells. When I opened this I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it. It is just such a beautiful smell. It smells warm and fruity with just a tiny touch of floral. It didn&#x27;t make me sneeze at all. I just can&#x27;t get tired of this smell! I would even spray it on my pillow before bed, but I don&#x27;t want to waste it. If you are looking to buy a perfume online trust me when I say this is probably one of the best scents. I have gotten compliments. I love the smell of vanilla and that warm smell definitely sticks out. I think it lasts a while. If I spray it on behind my ears in the morning, you can still get a whiff of it at night, but I don&#x27;t mind reapplying here and there. I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase this for the rest of my life.</li>
