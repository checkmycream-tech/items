            <li>I love the glow</li>
            <li>/&gt;id really love someone&#x27;s help ...</li>
            <li>so many people selling this sheep placenta....</li>
            <li>/&gt;id love to have glowing skin without needing to put on a lotion as they dont seem to absorb into my skin</li>
            <li>I am going to try this product,after my hubby started taking it,his libido got noticeably better</li>
            <li>but I feel better when I take it</li>
            <li>and I feel I look better now than I did.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>but my steps are more springy, the wrinkles have smoothened out somewhat but more importantly</li>
            <li>easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Since I have using this product, my pores have shrunk tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that this had a positive effect on my skin</li>
            <li>My friends tried these, all of them said they felt energetic and their skin look tender and young</li>
            <li>Good product, very helpful with moods and hot flashes, especially night sweats.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it helps my joint pain and other hormone-related syndromes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a year and changed to a higher mg.</li>
            <li>I can feel my skin is a lot softer, feels like baby skin; hair is much softer as well...  </li>
            <li>I have been taking the vitiamins for about 3 weeks now and have noticed how much softer my skin is and how much softer and shiner</li>
            <li>my hair has become , my nails are much stronger then they have ever been.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.  </li>
            <li>The supplement was recommended by a friend when I visited New Zealand where they marketed it a lot.</li>
            <li>thank you for price i live</li>
            <li>Is this helping to stave off old age?  </li>
            <li>I am also not related to the supplier/seller in any way and will not be held responsible for any adverse effects the aforesaid supplement may have on anyone else.</li>
            <li>Nu Health&#x27;s 800mg-100 capsules is really worth the money spent compared to others.</li>
            <li>, I feel noticeably younger and vibrant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i had this kind of uncomfortable belching for hours afterwards&lt;</li>
            <li>but, it is hard to say how much of the positive effects were from this product or the placenta serum I used or just the fact that I combined the two.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re very good pills, you&#x27;ll notice the difference as soon as u start taking them. The fatigue and tiredness just goes away.</li>
            <li> Product description states 800 mg. Actual product is 200 mg.&lt;br /&gt; I am disappointed about this fail advertisement. But I am hoping this product brings good result .</li>
            <li> I love it!! My skin and hair is getting more healthy... I would recommend... Great!!!</li>
            <li> I notice a softer skin and bright complexion.  A daily supplement for me. I love the glow I get.&lt;br /&gt;I started to see a diff in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try something new; works great!</li>

            <li> I am pretty sure that this had a positive effect on my skin but, it is hard to say how much of the positive effects were from this product or the placenta serum I used or just the fact that I combined the two.</li>
            <li> I am going to try this product,after my hubby started taking it,his libido got noticeably better he says that it could be other things in combination that he takes too,i don&#x27;t know,you never know.</li>
            <li> very good for hair and skin</li>
            <li> Is this helping to stave off old age?  Well, I don&#x27;t know but I feel better when I take it and I feel I look better now than I did.  So, possibly it is.  I&#x27;ll keep taking it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and changed to a higher mg. My skin is beautiful Thanks</li>
            <li> Why pay $25 for a one month supply when these capsules work just as well.  Good product, very helpful with moods and hot flashes, especially night sweats.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this supplement for a year prior to buying from Amazon/Nu Health. Nu Health&#x27;s 800mg-100 capsules is really worth the money spent compared to others. The supplement was recommended by a friend when I visited New Zealand where they marketed it a lot. If asked to give one word on the supplement, I would say &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34;. There had been no adverse side effects after one year but my steps are more springy, the wrinkles have smoothened out somewhat but more importantly, I feel noticeably younger and vibrant. I am 67 years old.&lt;br /&gt;  That being said, perhaps I should add a disclaimer that not all supplements are suited or have the same desired effects on everyone all of the time. I am also not related to the supplier/seller in any way and will not be held responsible for any adverse effects the aforesaid supplement may have on anyone else.</li>
            <li> Great product, does its work , effective and good value for money. BUT YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE DETAILS from 800mg to 200mg. Item is really 200mg, STOP MISINFORMING PEOPLE , ideally i should give you 1 star. So HURRY AND CHANGE THIS!</li>
            <li> I take this supplement with vitamin, royal-jelly, collagen and my skin looks great! But not sure which ones is working and which ones is not doing anything.So, I guess Its good...</li>
            <li> love it i will keep buying them thank you for price i live it thank you i will reorder in 2 months</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.  Very good for your skin and to keep it looking healthy.  I get compliments all the time because no one believes I&#x27;m 50.</li>
            <li> I have used it for three weeks. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change with this product. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have only taken it the past few days, but it has helped with my energy.</li>
