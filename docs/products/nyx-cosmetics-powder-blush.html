            <li>Anyways, not too happy about the color of this blush.     </li>
            <li>Great price....excellent shipping.</li>
            <li>Looks great on my skin tone.  </li>

            <li>this works great--</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>For the price, the quality is great.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great quality blush.</li>

            <li>Very nice color...</li>
            <li>Very nice to use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this blush its a great quality and a really beautiful color!!</li>
            <li>This color is amazing!  </li>
            <li>This blush is perfect and I wish I could have gotten it in better condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall both are great options, NYX Pinched is a good blush, but I still prefer my NARS Orgasm over it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall both are great options, NYX Pinched is a good blush, but I still prefer my NARS Orgasm over it.</li>
            <li>The pigment is wonderful and goes on so smoothly and blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>Amazing and beautiful.</li>
            <li>and it looked way too bright.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with the M.A.C. bronzers and it looks amazing on every color skin great buy for the price.</li>
            <li>The reason i give 2 stars is because in the picture i thought this blush was not that bright</li>
            <li>but I tried muting it with some finishing powder and it is still too bright.  </li>
            <li>Color blends well and looks well with all clothing colors including bright clothes.</li>
            <li>but its really really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good color</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, but to be fair, I also ALWAYS set my make up with the NYX Make Up setting spray...</li>
            <li>Great daytime look, or you can add a contouring color underneath and it still looks nice.</li>
            <li>I count that as a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good pigmentation and dupe for nars orgasm.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>The color is perfect as I apply it lightly to my apples.</li>
            <li>Good pigmentation, the color does not look like the image.</li>
            <li>I really loved Mimosa as part of a Christmas set</li>
            <li>and I think it looks good on fair to medium skin tones</li>
            <li>this is a gorgeous blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved this color.</li>
            <li>Good seller.</li>
            <li>I feel like this blush would be best for light-</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks perfect!  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>I bought this hearing it would be a good orgasm dupe...not at all.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t look clownish with this blush because it blends very nicely, and I&#x27;ve gotten nice effects by blending with a touch of bronzer for an outdoor, tanned look.</li>
            <li>Nice color, easy to apply, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and silky, almost creamy, so it&#x27;s very pleasant to apply and not at all flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived so quickly and that made me very happy.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see this looking good unless it&#x27;s dusted on with a really light hand!!</li>
            <li>Love this product, great color for caucasian with medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>but peony was perfect and the color saturation of the product is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and swipe this on the apples of my cheeks after I use bronzer.</li>
            <li>Very pleased as this outperforms MAC brand in color, application and price.</li>
            <li>It blends out nicely on the skin to give a gorgeous flush to your cheeks.</li>
            <li>Bought it from their website a good 6 months ago, and i really liked it.</li>
            <li>Well, they must be right because it looks very beautiful on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on my eyelids with  bronze/brown on top of it with very nice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love NYX, cheap but awesome</li>
            <li>It has good staying power, I think the issue is more with the color not looking good on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I hesitated writing a review because this blush might be perfect for some people, but on me it&#x27;s much too bright.  </li>
            <li>It came very fast and perfect conditions.</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time purchasing an NYX blush, and l am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I love this blush!</li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  </li>
            <li>Love this blush!  </li>
            <li>The texture is amazing</li>
            <li>I was looking for a blush that looked amazing, but was still affordable.</li>
            <li>The blush itself is amazing</li>
            <li>It looks great on my skin, which I would consider a light ivory.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>Brings nice flush to face.</li>
            <li>Perfect color (very similar to NARS Orgasm, which is why l gave it a shot), great pigment and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This blush is the absolute perfect color from me.</li>
            <li>Nice color and compact.</li>
            <li>Nice pigmentation and color.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this to get a nice blendable color.</li>
            <li>It has a gorgeous glow to it that looks healthy.</li>
            <li>Nice color palette.</li>
            <li>Nice color palette.</li>
            <li>it is warm reddish with brown undertone and it is matte)</li>
            <li>Product came on time and was packaged nicely</li>
            <li>I have a fair skin tone and this looks too bright even when I use a light hand or try to blend it more.</li>
            <li>Very easy to transfer colour from pan to face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to overapply with this  blush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pretty - gave great color payoff.</li>
            <li>:) Love this color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more wearable look, in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Flattering on warm skin tones, probably better for us lighter skinned ladies.</li>
            <li>I also like the very fine gold colored flecks.  </li>
            <li>I love all of NYX Cosmetics Powder Blushes but this color is by far the best</li>
            <li>I would give this 3 stars, but I&#x27;ll add in another star for the great price and high pigmentation!!</li>
            <li>and it seems to be very lightly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heared so many praises about this blush and specially this shade and let me tell it worths every thing good things said about it.</li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly, great color... not too dark or light... just a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Great applied with a large brush.</li>
            <li>NYX cosmetics are top notch in my book.  </li>
            <li>The pigment blends evenly and holds up for most of my (often 9+ hour) work day.</li>
            <li>Really love the quality of NYX brand.  </li>
            <li>I totally love it &amp; have used it every day since I got it.  </li>
            <li>I love NYX but not this product.</li>
            <li>I would expect them to sell for A LOT more than they do.</li>
            <li>that cause my skin to react, but I tend to break out with most blushes.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with its staying power.</li>
            <li>Love these blushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I really love this blush.</li>
            <li>I like this blush, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love this blush.  </li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>The top plastic piece is broke, and falls into the blush when I close it.</li>
            <li>Reapplication required through the day,  as most of it will wear off unless you use a setting spray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that many of them would not use some of the products they are paid to advertise.</li>
            <li>I would say that fits to most of the skin types and shades.</li>
            <li>Color is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this blush and I love the color.</li>
            <li>Love this blush.</li>
            <li>goldy bronze flecks and the shimmer is a bit more subdued --but</li>
            <li>Use it every day, I love it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cheap and falls apart, often even before I receive it!</li>
            <li>so I have to go light when applying, but it looks good if applied with a light hand.  </li>
            <li>so I just set the top on it in the drawer.  </li>
            <li>Love the shimmer.</li>
            <li>But I love this for the color it gives my</li>
            <li>packaging is cute too.</li>
            <li>Pinker than I thought , but ok .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>However, so many reviewers had compared the \\&quot;Pinched\\&quot; color to Nars \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It works better on medium skin tones.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Love this blush.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I love NYX products though</li>
            <li>love this blush.</li>
            <li>I love love love this blush .</li>
            <li>:) buy this</li>
            <li>she love the corlour</li>
            <li>I love this blush.  </li>
            <li>I do wish that the packaging was a bit more sturdy, but I could say that about almost every blush or powder</li>
            <li>I love this blush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I guess &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; would have been a better choice.  </li>
            <li>love the color.</li>
            <li>Cheap and durable!</li>
            <li>I love the color, but it is brighter than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this powder blush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>I love that I dont have to use a ton of it.</li>
            <li>, wich i love because then I dont have to go out and buy more sooner.</li>
            <li>Lovely color.</li>
            <li>blushes better.</li>
            <li>Love, love love.</li>
            <li>Glisten, :).</li>
            <li>For the pigmentation itself, you actually get quite a good deal!!</li>
            <li>Just not in love with it yet.</li>
            <li>I very much love this color.</li>
            <li>I love this blush.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s mostly because of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Beautiful vivid colour.</li>
            <li>Nyx is a great line, the price of a drugstore product and the quality of a high end brand.</li>
            <li>The color is great without the high price.</li>
            <li>I would give this 3 stars, but I&#x27;ll add in another star for the great price and high pigmentation!!ion, and he chalkiness of the Pinched powder.</li>
            <li>So soft I feel just beautiful</li>
            <li>The perfect color for all year long.  </li>
            <li>I have a light to medium complexion, brown hair, blue eyes, and it works perfectly with my coloring.  </li>
            <li>nah.... the color is like old rose... nothing flattering for fair skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and is easily blend able.</li>
            <li>I truly believe Amazon should do something about it, so reviews ratings are more accurate.</li>
            <li>Orgasm is also much easier to control as it&#x27;s not as bright as Pinched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Orgasm is also much easier to control as it&#x27;s not as bright as Pinched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have medium to fair skin, so i look like a porcelain doll if I put on too much by accident.</li>
            <li>Loved this product and it arrived quite fast as well.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and gives a gorgeous glow.</li>
            <li>So, when I heard this NYX blush was a good dupe I went ahead and purchased it straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a good blush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This blush is SUPER cute and very worth it!</li>
            <li>very fast shipping, couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived, this is the color I have been looking for, love this blush and a great price and will buy again</li>
            <li>perfect shade of pink!</li>
            <li>I love love love Nyx so much!</li>
            <li>Easy to carry as it has small/compact packaging.</li>
            <li>I carry this cheaper version in my purse because the Nars powder compact breaks so easily.</li>
            <li>, so I have to go easy with it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the case, since it&#x27;s flimsy and feels as if it will break easily.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as great of a product for a fraction of the cost, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>does have a strong sheen or sparkle to</li>
            <li>True color, all-day wear, love it</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper at Target but the color is popular so this is probably the easiest place to get it fairly consistently.</li>
            <li>(the other one I own is the &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; shade and is great as well).</li>
            <li>The color (pinched) is beautiful, it stays on all day, and it lasts for well over a year, even with daily use.</li>
            <li>I also have it in peach, which is also beautiful, but more pink.</li>
            <li>My blush arrived fine with no damage in shipping.</li>
            <li>Super cute blush</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty knock – off of Nars&#x27;s iconic &amp;#34;Orgasm&amp;#34; powder blush.</li>
            <li>my wife love it very much!</li>
            <li>Very pretty blush!</li>
            <li>Very nice pigments, easy to blend, last all day.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s vegan and animal cruelty free.</li>
            <li>item to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free</li>
            <li>It is deeply tinted and looks great anytime.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the quality.</li>
            <li>I looks cheap when applied.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, shade light to medium (depends on the season) and this blush works thru all year.</li>
            <li>Use with a light hand, this deposits alot of pigment.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>The packaging could be better but the product itself alone is so worth</li>
            <li>so I just use it lightly and rub it in</li>
            <li>the shimmer is more like a golden sheen.</li>
            <li>Several friends have used it and it looks great on them too.  </li>
            <li>Great, Total dupe for NARS&#x27;s Orgasm and Tarte&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Colourful and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice bright pink color with goldish shimmer.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and the staying power is good, just not a great color on fair skin.</li>
            <li>I confidently recommend this product and think you should order it right away....</li>
            <li>More sparkly than expected; which I kind of like!</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday makeup, it´s a very cute color with a little bit of gold :) I heart it a lot!</li>
            <li>Rich pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>Though this blush is not an exact dupe like some suggested, it gives very, VERY similar color (so flattering!), a nice shimmer and packs a very satisfying pigment punch.</li>
            <li>You can put some on your brush and sweep it on for just a tiny hint of color or you can put more on for a more noticeable look!</li>
            <li>Great value for such a pretty blush!</li>
            <li>Cheap buy, very highly pigmented, matches most skin tones and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely color that looks great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>The shade of this blush is just amazing - kind of peachy pink.  </li>
            <li>and my brushes are always clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried Nars orgasm, but I ordered this product since it has great reviews and other reviewers said it is very much like Nars orgasm, which is Amazon&#x27;s top rated blush.  </li>
            <li>very long lasting and gives the perfect healthy blush</li>
            <li>I typically wear a more rose colored blush, but I absolutely love this peachy-pink shade.</li>
            <li>It looks SO natural and nice.</li>
            <li>It looks more warm and peachy in the photo, but applies more hot pink than peach on my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you go to makeupgeek.com there are several good reviews on NYX.</li>
            <li>Pan colour is true to colour you will see on your skin.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice believable pink if I swipe my blush brush lightly on it twice.</li>
            <li>I suppose I&#x27;m used to full size blushes.</li>
            <li>color of this blush was true to the shade in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The blush</li>
            <li>Used to replace some old peachy blush I liked to wear in summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a medium skin tone, NW30, and this looks really nice and natural on me.</li>
            <li>I could see how it would be great for other skin tones (perhaps fair/light tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t get a good balance on how much to use and ended up using too much.</li>
            <li>powder blush is the best brand I have ever used ,goes on smooth and last all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect, subtle with a pop of color.</li>
            <li>NYX is very pigmented makeup that what makes it so great especially for the price.</li>
            <li>price and arrived quickly from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase their blushes because they have great pigment and are really inexpensive, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>No glitter, just like I ran quickly through a forest</li>
            <li>it is super pigmented and I use it every day in the summer.</li>
            <li>NARS is much easier to blend in and looks quite effortless on its own without much blending.</li>
            <li>NARS is much easier to blend in and looks quite effortless on its own without much blending.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It looks very pretty on</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty too</li>
            <li>Very pretty blush, I ordered Pinched.  </li>
            <li>With or without the bronzer, the color looks just healthy and natural, but you can build it for something more intense.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li>It is pretty pigmented and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Good color, lasts a long time and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and very build able!</li>
            <li>I would for sure order from them again as I have already been looking for a new blush for the winter.</li>
            <li>However, with a light hand it&#x27;s a beautiful natural pink flush that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Specs of gold glitter that look really pretty during the day or night!</li>
            <li>I use less during the day and just a tad more for evenings and it gives me a nice flushed color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use this for daily wear alternating with Elf Candid Coral which is more true to my natural color.</li>
            <li>The color is much more of a hot pink than I was expecting, and I don&#x27;t think it compliments my fair skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>Its a good product, the packaging is okay hard case protects its content, and plastic that allows you to see through is helpful.</li>
            <li>the pigment is intense, so it must be applied with a light hand.</li>
            <li>Pinched is a bright pink</li>
            <li>but it is still worth it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I got this one thinking it would be a nice light pink (color pinched)</li>
            <li>I thought that I might not like this color, but I actually ended up loving it.</li>
            <li>I found the color to be pretty true to the picture.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the $5.</li>
            <li>The packaging is quite nice however, and is actually quite reflective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color I received is kind of a brick orange and goes on nearly red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a peachy coral tone with golden shimmer.</li>
            <li>I am a pale Caucasian with yellow-based skin tone, and this color looks absolutely wonderful and natural on me.</li>
            <li>This pinky peach is a great color for pale skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be careful while applying it, you can put on a lot without knowing since its a rich warm color</li>
            <li>goes on great, too bad no brush came with it,packed very well and sent quickly, stays on and looks great</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with my NARS blush, it looks so nice, effortless and natural, but is (unfortunately) really expensive, so I decided to buy a similar blush I could wear on a daily basis and keep my NARS for special occasions, and Pinched seemed like the perfect fill-in for my favorite blush.</li>
            <li>I love Nyx products in general and this blush is no exception.</li>
            <li>It definitely lasts much longer than my other blushes though, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>They are paid to used certain products!</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, and applies easily.</li>
            <li>The packaging was smaller than I was expecting but overall great colouring</li>
            <li>Very pretty color , must watch how much you put on .</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, I used just a little</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have pretty fare skin, a warmer shade I guess?</li>
            <li>Pinched is an exact dupe for Mimosa.</li>
            <li>I actually like the color better.</li>
            <li>Really pretty color.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty if you don&#x27;t mind that</li>
            <li>I wnt be buying blush &amp; eyeshadows on line unless I can try them first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pigment-heavy, a lovely thing for such a well-priced cosmetic.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of pigmentation, and is definitely build able.  </li>
            <li>I love the tiny gold flecks throughout.</li>
            <li>In the container, the color of the blush looks like what I would call rose gold, but on the skin, it is a brighter color between a light-but-bold pink and a peach.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately upon first use</li>
            <li>Most of the blushes I have used need to be applied several times to build up the color I wanted; not this one!</li>
            <li>First blush</li>
            <li>I Highly reccamend this product to anyone who is thinkig about trying it!!</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;ll be pretty.</li>
            <li>It seems like no matter how much of this blush I put on, it just will not visibly show up!  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again, and love the price point.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly as it appeared online</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, and this is my go to everyday blush.</li>
            <li>The blush is ok, a little strong on the color for me</li>
            <li>This makes it a bit more challenging to use, especially if you are used to blushes with a larger surface or use a particularly large brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This plush goes on smoothly, barely any is needed, and it is easily buildable.</li>
            <li>The price is inexpensive even if it were more I personally would still buy it, very compact ,will last along time ,Think this color would work on any ones skin tone however there are many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I actually do find this color very flattering and think it would be for many skin</li>
            <li>One positive thing I can report is that the color lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>So glad I spent the money, I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>While I usually really like NYX products, this was my first time using their blush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty potent pink.</li>
            <li>Pinched is a really pretty pinkish/coral, but I think more on the pink side.</li>
            <li>that is super sensitive, or</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what there is in certain blushes</li>
            <li>I was pretty disappointed as the color seems nice, almost coral and pretty bright in the pan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice slightly peach but most pink glow</li>
            <li>This is an amazing *little* blush.</li>
            <li>The color is a little more rosy that I like ( which is to be expected buying an item on the internet I&#x27;ve never seen in person), but I have found if I just use a little bit of it, the shade ends up being perfect!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it is or not, because I&#x27;d never pay that much for makeup, but I do know it really does give you that flushed look like you pinched your cheeks.  </li>
            <li>.  Very pigmented&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really stay in</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get a blush that is so pigmented and so affordable these NYX blushes really are a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much, and I feel like a clown when wearing it.</li>
            <li>this is not a swipe and go, if you are very</li>
            <li>i didnt pay too much attention to the detales)</li>
            <li>I really like this blush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re careful, it provides a lovely color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light blonde</li>
            <li>This blush is very pigmented and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Very buildable shade.</li>
            <li>Nyx, on the other-hand, is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>So, get ready to hear compliments about yourself from now on.</li>
            <li>So when I travel it doesnt take much room.</li>
            <li>However take care with the blending brush &amp; try not to get too much of it on your brush...</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t like spending a lot of money on blush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very close in color.</li>
            <li>I got peach which is actually more of a pink color</li>
            <li>Very pigmented color.  </li>
            <li>Definitely need to use a light hand when applying to avoid looking like a clown.  </li>
            <li>I really like them both.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented and blendable I ordered (</li>
            <li>is that this blush is well pigmented so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get color on your skin.</li>
            <li>price of the blush is reasonable.</li>
            <li>The shade is much deeper than the online image.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as much of the gold shimmer as Orgasm, but does still have the wanted shine.  </li>
            <li>I have to say it&#x27;s really close just to that blush</li>
            <li>That really blows...   </li>
            <li>the color in the pan looks much darker and pinkier than Orgasm.</li>
            <li>It also looks very matte, not shimmery like Orgasm AT ALL.</li>
            <li>This color is much darker than it appears on the site.</li>
            <li>Taking off one star because not liking it as much as my NARS cream stick.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a sub for Nars &amp;#34;orgasm&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s very rosy in color.</li>
            <li>and I really like how this blush looks.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and looks more natural then any blush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Nice neutral color that works well on my pale skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the positive thing about the blush is that it has high pigment.</li>
            <li>I find its a nice subtle pink that gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li>and I will buy other NYX blushes :)</li>
            <li>This really looks like it must be pretty on most pale women but for some reason it was not packed correctly for shipment.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much the color is vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I really like this blush and in a nice small container.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and the pigments are of nice quality.</li>
            <li>The packaging is compact but the color is very pigmented so less gives you more.</li>
            <li>It is so bright, but not really in a good way.</li>
            <li>Mine still looks like i havent used it yet, so i guess it lasts quite long, and the price is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what i was hoping it would, which is to leave a natural rosy look.</li>
            <li>I was worried about ordering a blush online, as the screen display is almost always different than the true color.</li>
            <li>I found I could put a little swipe of color or build it up for a more intense flush.</li>
            <li>and I live the color!</li>
            <li>which is not peach at all but matte hot pink, pinch which is orang-peach with shimmer and dusty rose from another store which is my favorite</li>
            <li>That said, the amount of blush you get is much less than with most blushes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular color, Pinched, for years now.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good to see a few different</li>
            <li>I purchased this blush shade after hearing it compared to the classic Nars shade &#x27;Orgasm&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I like softer, more natural pink  blushes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing it, but it is still a decent compact sized blush.</li>
            <li>I bought this blush to replace an older one...</li>
            <li>For reference, I have fair skin, blonde hair and green eyes.  </li>
            <li>be careful when applying as the color pay off is strong.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND looking Yahoo/Google searching for NYX blush swatches to help choose the color.</li>
            <li>It is highly pigmented and is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair complexion, so a little goes a long way, but it really makes my cheeks pop in a still very natural way.</li>
            <li>This product was much smaller than expected, but I suppose that&#x27;s okay since you don&#x27;t need to apply much.</li>
            <li>I was not hard on this at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a pale blue-eyed Euro chick who tends to try avoid the sun, and this colour gives me a wonderfully healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small (don&#x27;t be fooled by the great price) and won&#x27;t last more than a few months if you use it daily.</li>
            <li>this is a rich pigmented pink</li>
            <li>So much more brighter in person (hot pink) not what I expected</li>
            <li>Nice blush but a little brighter than I was expecting, would buy this brand again in a different color.</li>
            <li>you like to try new face products</li>
            <li>However, holding it up to my roomate&#x27;s NARS blush (shhhh!!) and swathing it, the NARS is more golden shimmery and decently less pink pigmented on the skin than this blush.</li>
            <li>I look for cheap blush as I have have purchased expensive blush many times</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>A little too pink for my fair skin to look natural</li>
            <li>color goes well with my dark hair and eyes and light skin.</li>
            <li>Looks natural!</li>
            <li>It is an easy way to get a pretty and pigmented blush and a little cheek bone highlight at the same time.</li>
            <li>and I expected it not to be so bold.  </li>
            <li>To make use of this blush and not let it go to waste, I have found that if I apply just a little to my cheekbones and then try my best to rub it in/blend well, it is a little better, but I usually have to wipe some of it off so that it&#x27;s not so overpowering.</li>
            <li>That said, you can still get a little color with a light touch of the brush or a lot of color, as you wish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging feels a little cheap</li>
            <li>I actually did a little more research into this product</li>
            <li>the color is a peachy pink but comes off more pink than peachy.</li>
            <li>Clear plastic square fell out of my Peach one</li>
            <li>Finally, because of the intense pigmentation, you must blend blend blend or you will look clown-ish.</li>
            <li>Overall I do really like this blush.</li>
            <li>really like these blushes, especially the Peach one.  </li>
            <li>I struggle to get a natural flushed look with this blush.  </li>
            <li>I had read that this was similar to Orgasm by Nars, but at a much much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Similar color to Nars Orgasm, but much cheaper product.</li>
            <li>I am a brown eyed blond and this product alone takes me from verge-of-death-palor to wow</li>
            <li>and it looks natural on my olive skin.</li>
            <li>Natural color for almost any skin tone.</li>
            <li>and it is classy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly different but not so much that it&#x27;s drastic.</li>
            <li>but when I&#x27;m rushing around in the morning trying to get ready, it&#x27;s an irritant trying to get the case open.</li>
            <li>I have to really mute the color by rubbing it on paper or the back of my hand to get the color I want.</li>
            <li>and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Pinched is nearly (I would say)</li>
            <li>On the skin, Pinched is a much heavier than Orgasm, especially for lighter gals -</li>
            <li>The color lasts all day long without changing, and it has a very nice bit of glow to it -- very subtle.</li>
            <li>Not too pink, just right.</li>
            <li>Compact is small and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something a bit more subtle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a dark reddish pink.</li>
            <li>This blush is highly pigmented and actually lasted for 10 hours with no fading!</li>
            <li>it everyday right now!</li>
            <li>Even the lightest application can look too hot pink for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected but pretty nonetheless.</li>
            <li>It is a really cute bubblegum pink, it reminds me of a little girl blush.  </li>
            <li>Although my friend with dry skin, shade medium tried and was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Pretty color and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very natural blush, goes on sheer and can be layered to build up the color a bit.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty, not at all harsh, but buildable to one&#x27;s liking.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s very pretty, I was surprised by how small the compact was.</li>
            <li>BUT, the reason i&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because theres something (generally in NYX products)</li>
            <li>My only qualm is that the clear part of the lid has a crack and popped out of the lid</li>
            <li>Brow skin barely showed up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented and brighter pink than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>I have olive skin (Indian descent) and this product barely shows up.</li>
            <li>it can give you a natural sheer flush.</li>
            <li>The surface of the blush itself (not including the container) is barely 1 1/4\\</li>
            <li>The color is nearly the same but Pinched shows up easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product then applied nicely to my cheeks with a flattering faint pinkish coral color.</li>
            <li>It took me a little while to figure out that with this blush, less is more.</li>
            <li>eager to try more NYX products.&lt;br /&gt;The container is very small, but a little bit goes along way with this blush, and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And unlike other blushes, I barely put any on and it really shows up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little dark for my white winter skin but will be lovely with makeup or a summer tan.  </li>
            <li>The problem with Pinched is that it is actually very pink and very pigmented, which shows up a lot on lighter skin.</li>
            <li>I sometimes layer this over the cream blush of the same colour for an extra natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my ivory complexion, this is a vibrant peachy pink.  </li>
            <li>Dusty Rose is a lot darker than I thought it would be, I expected it to be a lot paler than it is in person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Staying power is great but unless u used it before, u will probably be disappointed.</li>
            <li>This color is barely wearable..let alone universally wearable</li>
            <li>It also inspired me to try other NYX products, which are all high quality.</li>
            <li>IMHO, NYX is on the same level with Mac and other high end cosemetics.</li>
            <li>but the color is just a little dark for my pale white skin… Would be really nice on darker skin tones though.</li>
            <li>Very natural shade of pink that would likely compliment almost any skin</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of NYX, finding it to be just as good as products like Mac or Urban Decay, but much less expensive.</li>
            <li>In person it is a little darker than pictured here but very wearable.</li>
            <li>The golden speckles are hardly noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>the blush itself, it&#x27;s very pigmented (probably just as much as NARS if not more!!).</li>

            <li> This blush is perfect and I wish I could have gotten it in better condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall both are great options, NYX Pinched is a good blush, but I still prefer my NARS Orgasm over it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall both are great options, NYX Pinched is a good blush, but I still prefer my NARS Orgasm over it.</li>
            <li> The pigment is wonderful and goes on so smoothly and blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> Amazing and beautiful.</li>
            <li> and it looked way too bright.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with the M.A.C. bronzers and it looks amazing on every color skin great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> The reason i give 2 stars is because in the picture i thought this blush was not that bright</li>
            <li> but I tried muting it with some finishing powder and it is still too bright.  </li>
            <li> Color blends well and looks well with all clothing colors including bright clothes.</li>
            <li> but its really really good.</li>
            <li> This is a good color</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, but to be fair, I also ALWAYS set my make up with the NYX Make Up setting spray...</li>
            <li> Great daytime look, or you can add a contouring color underneath and it still looks nice.</li>
            <li> I count that as a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good pigmentation and dupe for nars orgasm.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> The color is perfect as I apply it lightly to my apples.</li>
            <li> Good pigmentation, the color does not look like the image.</li>
            <li> I really loved Mimosa as part of a Christmas set</li>
            <li> and I think it looks good on fair to medium skin tones</li>
            <li> this is a gorgeous blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved this color.</li>
            <li> Good seller.</li>
            <li> I feel like this blush would be best for light-</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and looks perfect!  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> I bought this hearing it would be a good orgasm dupe...not at all.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t look clownish with this blush because it blends very nicely, and I&#x27;ve gotten nice effects by blending with a touch of bronzer for an outdoor, tanned look.</li>
            <li> Nice color, easy to apply, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and silky, almost creamy, so it&#x27;s very pleasant to apply and not at all flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived so quickly and that made me very happy.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see this looking good unless it&#x27;s dusted on with a really light hand!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, great color for caucasian with medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> but peony was perfect and the color saturation of the product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and swipe this on the apples of my cheeks after I use bronzer.</li>
            <li> Very pleased as this outperforms MAC brand in color, application and price.</li>
            <li> It blends out nicely on the skin to give a gorgeous flush to your cheeks.</li>
            <li> Bought it from their website a good 6 months ago, and i really liked it.</li>
            <li> Well, they must be right because it looks very beautiful on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my eyelids with  bronze/brown on top of it with very nice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love NYX, cheap but awesome</li>
            <li> It has good staying power, I think the issue is more with the color not looking good on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I hesitated writing a review because this blush might be perfect for some people, but on me it&#x27;s much too bright.  </li>
            <li> It came very fast and perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time purchasing an NYX blush, and l am very happy with it!</li>

            <li> Love this blush!  </li>
            <li> The texture is amazing</li>
            <li> I was looking for a blush that looked amazing, but was still affordable.</li>
            <li> The blush itself is amazing</li>
            <li> It looks great on my skin, which I would consider a light ivory.</li>
            <li> Nice color.</li>
            <li> Brings nice flush to face.</li>
            <li> Perfect color (very similar to NARS Orgasm, which is why l gave it a shot), great pigment and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This blush is the absolute perfect color from me.</li>
            <li> Nice color and compact.</li>
            <li> Nice pigmentation and color.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this to get a nice blendable color.</li>
            <li> It has a gorgeous glow to it that looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Nice color palette.</li>
            <li> Nice color palette.</li>
            <li> it is warm reddish with brown undertone and it is matte)</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was packaged nicely</li>
            <li> I have a fair skin tone and this looks too bright even when I use a light hand or try to blend it more.</li>
            <li> Very easy to transfer colour from pan to face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to overapply with this  blush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very pretty - gave great color payoff.</li>
            <li> :) Love this color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more wearable look, in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Flattering on warm skin tones, probably better for us lighter skinned ladies.</li>
            <li> I also like the very fine gold colored flecks.  </li>
            <li> I love all of NYX Cosmetics Powder Blushes but this color is by far the best</li>
            <li> I would give this 3 stars, but I&#x27;ll add in another star for the great price and high pigmentation!!</li>
            <li> and it seems to be very lightly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heared so many praises about this blush and specially this shade and let me tell it worths every thing good things said about it.</li>
            <li> It goes on perfectly, great color... not too dark or light... just a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> Great applied with a large brush.</li>
            <li> NYX cosmetics are top notch in my book.  </li>
            <li> The pigment blends evenly and holds up for most of my (often 9+ hour) work day.</li>
            <li> Really love the quality of NYX brand.  </li>
            <li> I totally love it &amp; have used it every day since I got it.  </li>
            <li> I love NYX but not this product.</li>
            <li> I would expect them to sell for A LOT more than they do.</li>
            <li> that cause my skin to react, but I tend to break out with most blushes.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with its staying power.</li>
            <li> Love these blushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I really love this blush.</li>
            <li> I like this blush, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  </li>
            <li> I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> The top plastic piece is broke, and falls into the blush when I close it.</li>
            <li> Reapplication required through the day,  as most of it will wear off unless you use a setting spray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that many of them would not use some of the products they are paid to advertise.</li>
            <li> I would say that fits to most of the skin types and shades.</li>
            <li> Color is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this blush and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Love this blush.</li>
            <li> goldy bronze flecks and the shimmer is a bit more subdued --but</li>
            <li> Use it every day, I love it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cheap and falls apart, often even before I receive it!</li>
            <li> so I have to go light when applying, but it looks good if applied with a light hand.  </li>
            <li> so I just set the top on it in the drawer.  </li>
            <li> Love the shimmer.</li>
            <li> But I love this for the color it gives my</li>
            <li> packaging is cute too.</li>
            <li> Pinker than I thought , but ok .</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> However, so many reviewers had compared the \\&quot;Pinched\\&quot; color to Nars \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It works better on medium skin tones.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Love this blush.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I love NYX products though</li>
            <li> love this blush.</li>
            <li> I love love love this blush .</li>
            <li> :) buy this</li>
            <li> she love the corlour</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  </li>
            <li> I do wish that the packaging was a bit more sturdy, but I could say that about almost every blush or powder</li>
            <li> I love this blush.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I guess &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; would have been a better choice.  </li>
            <li> love the color.</li>
            <li> Cheap and durable!</li>
            <li> I love the color, but it is brighter than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this powder blush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I love that I dont have to use a ton of it.</li>
            <li> , wich i love because then I dont have to go out and buy more sooner.</li>
            <li> Lovely color.</li>
            <li> blushes better.</li>
            <li> Love, love love.</li>
            <li> Glisten, :).</li>
            <li> For the pigmentation itself, you actually get quite a good deal!!</li>
            <li> Just not in love with it yet.</li>
            <li> I very much love this color.</li>
            <li> I love this blush.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s mostly because of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful vivid colour.</li>
            <li> Nyx is a great line, the price of a drugstore product and the quality of a high end brand.</li>
            <li> The color is great without the high price.</li>
            <li> I would give this 3 stars, but I&#x27;ll add in another star for the great price and high pigmentation!!ion, and he chalkiness of the Pinched powder.</li>
            <li> So soft I feel just beautiful</li>
            <li> The perfect color for all year long.  </li>
            <li> I have a light to medium complexion, brown hair, blue eyes, and it works perfectly with my coloring.  </li>
            <li> nah.... the color is like old rose... nothing flattering for fair skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and is easily blend able.</li>
            <li> I truly believe Amazon should do something about it, so reviews ratings are more accurate.</li>
            <li> Orgasm is also much easier to control as it&#x27;s not as bright as Pinched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Orgasm is also much easier to control as it&#x27;s not as bright as Pinched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have medium to fair skin, so i look like a porcelain doll if I put on too much by accident.</li>
            <li> Loved this product and it arrived quite fast as well.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and gives a gorgeous glow.</li>
            <li> So, when I heard this NYX blush was a good dupe I went ahead and purchased it straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a good blush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This blush is SUPER cute and very worth it!</li>
            <li> very fast shipping, couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived, this is the color I have been looking for, love this blush and a great price and will buy again</li>
            <li> perfect shade of pink!</li>
            <li> I love love love Nyx so much!</li>
            <li> Easy to carry as it has small/compact packaging.</li>
            <li> I carry this cheaper version in my purse because the Nars powder compact breaks so easily.</li>
            <li> , so I have to go easy with it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the case, since it&#x27;s flimsy and feels as if it will break easily.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as great of a product for a fraction of the cost, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> does have a strong sheen or sparkle to</li>
            <li> True color, all-day wear, love it</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper at Target but the color is popular so this is probably the easiest place to get it fairly consistently.</li>
            <li> (the other one I own is the &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; shade and is great as well).</li>
            <li> The color (pinched) is beautiful, it stays on all day, and it lasts for well over a year, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> I also have it in peach, which is also beautiful, but more pink.</li>
            <li> My blush arrived fine with no damage in shipping.</li>
            <li> Super cute blush</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty knock – off of Nars&#x27;s iconic &amp;#34;Orgasm&amp;#34; powder blush.</li>
            <li> my wife love it very much!</li>
            <li> Very pretty blush!</li>
            <li> Very nice pigments, easy to blend, last all day.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s vegan and animal cruelty free.</li>
            <li> item to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free</li>
            <li> It is deeply tinted and looks great anytime.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy the quality.</li>
            <li> I looks cheap when applied.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, shade light to medium (depends on the season) and this blush works thru all year.</li>
            <li> Use with a light hand, this deposits alot of pigment.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The packaging could be better but the product itself alone is so worth</li>
            <li> so I just use it lightly and rub it in</li>
            <li> the shimmer is more like a golden sheen.</li>
            <li> Several friends have used it and it looks great on them too.  </li>
            <li> Great, Total dupe for NARS&#x27;s Orgasm and Tarte&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Colourful and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice bright pink color with goldish shimmer.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and the staying power is good, just not a great color on fair skin.</li>
            <li> I confidently recommend this product and think you should order it right away....</li>
            <li> More sparkly than expected; which I kind of like!</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday makeup, it´s a very cute color with a little bit of gold :) I heart it a lot!</li>
            <li> Rich pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> Though this blush is not an exact dupe like some suggested, it gives very, VERY similar color (so flattering!), a nice shimmer and packs a very satisfying pigment punch.</li>
            <li> You can put some on your brush and sweep it on for just a tiny hint of color or you can put more on for a more noticeable look!</li>
            <li> Great value for such a pretty blush!</li>
            <li> Cheap buy, very highly pigmented, matches most skin tones and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely color that looks great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> The shade of this blush is just amazing - kind of peachy pink.  </li>
            <li> and my brushes are always clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Nars orgasm, but I ordered this product since it has great reviews and other reviewers said it is very much like Nars orgasm, which is Amazon&#x27;s top rated blush.  </li>
            <li> very long lasting and gives the perfect healthy blush</li>
            <li> I typically wear a more rose colored blush, but I absolutely love this peachy-pink shade.</li>
            <li> It looks SO natural and nice.</li>
            <li> It looks more warm and peachy in the photo, but applies more hot pink than peach on my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you go to makeupgeek.com there are several good reviews on NYX.</li>
            <li> Pan colour is true to colour you will see on your skin.</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice believable pink if I swipe my blush brush lightly on it twice.</li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;m used to full size blushes.</li>
            <li> color of this blush was true to the shade in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The blush</li>
            <li> Used to replace some old peachy blush I liked to wear in summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium skin tone, NW30, and this looks really nice and natural on me.</li>
            <li> I could see how it would be great for other skin tones (perhaps fair/light tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t get a good balance on how much to use and ended up using too much.</li>
            <li> powder blush is the best brand I have ever used ,goes on smooth and last all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, subtle with a pop of color.</li>
            <li> NYX is very pigmented makeup that what makes it so great especially for the price.</li>
            <li> price and arrived quickly from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase their blushes because they have great pigment and are really inexpensive, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> No glitter, just like I ran quickly through a forest</li>
            <li> it is super pigmented and I use it every day in the summer.</li>
            <li> NARS is much easier to blend in and looks quite effortless on its own without much blending.</li>
            <li> NARS is much easier to blend in and looks quite effortless on its own without much blending.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It looks very pretty on</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty too</li>
            <li> Very pretty blush, I ordered Pinched.  </li>
            <li> With or without the bronzer, the color looks just healthy and natural, but you can build it for something more intense.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li> It is pretty pigmented and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Good color, lasts a long time and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and very build able!</li>
            <li> I would for sure order from them again as I have already been looking for a new blush for the winter.</li>
            <li> However, with a light hand it&#x27;s a beautiful natural pink flush that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Specs of gold glitter that look really pretty during the day or night!</li>
            <li> I use less during the day and just a tad more for evenings and it gives me a nice flushed color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use this for daily wear alternating with Elf Candid Coral which is more true to my natural color.</li>
            <li> The color is much more of a hot pink than I was expecting, and I don&#x27;t think it compliments my fair skin tone very well.</li>
            <li> Its a good product, the packaging is okay hard case protects its content, and plastic that allows you to see through is helpful.</li>
            <li> the pigment is intense, so it must be applied with a light hand.</li>
            <li> Pinched is a bright pink</li>
            <li> but it is still worth it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I got this one thinking it would be a nice light pink (color pinched)</li>
            <li> I thought that I might not like this color, but I actually ended up loving it.</li>
            <li> I found the color to be pretty true to the picture.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the $5.</li>
            <li> The packaging is quite nice however, and is actually quite reflective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color I received is kind of a brick orange and goes on nearly red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a peachy coral tone with golden shimmer.</li>
            <li> I am a pale Caucasian with yellow-based skin tone, and this color looks absolutely wonderful and natural on me.</li>
            <li> This pinky peach is a great color for pale skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful while applying it, you can put on a lot without knowing since its a rich warm color</li>
            <li> goes on great, too bad no brush came with it,packed very well and sent quickly, stays on and looks great</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with my NARS blush, it looks so nice, effortless and natural, but is (unfortunately) really expensive, so I decided to buy a similar blush I could wear on a daily basis and keep my NARS for special occasions, and Pinched seemed like the perfect fill-in for my favorite blush.</li>
            <li> I love Nyx products in general and this blush is no exception.</li>
            <li> It definitely lasts much longer than my other blushes though, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> They are paid to used certain products!</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, and applies easily.</li>
            <li> The packaging was smaller than I was expecting but overall great colouring</li>
            <li> Very pretty color , must watch how much you put on .</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, I used just a little</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have pretty fare skin, a warmer shade I guess?</li>
            <li> Pinched is an exact dupe for Mimosa.</li>
            <li> I actually like the color better.</li>
            <li> Really pretty color.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty if you don&#x27;t mind that</li>
            <li> I wnt be buying blush &amp; eyeshadows on line unless I can try them first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is pigment-heavy, a lovely thing for such a well-priced cosmetic.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of pigmentation, and is definitely build able.  </li>
            <li> I love the tiny gold flecks throughout.</li>
            <li> In the container, the color of the blush looks like what I would call rose gold, but on the skin, it is a brighter color between a light-but-bold pink and a peach.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately upon first use</li>
            <li> Most of the blushes I have used need to be applied several times to build up the color I wanted; not this one!</li>
            <li> First blush</li>
            <li> I Highly reccamend this product to anyone who is thinkig about trying it!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll be pretty.</li>
            <li> It seems like no matter how much of this blush I put on, it just will not visibly show up!  </li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again, and love the price point.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly as it appeared online</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and this is my go to everyday blush.</li>
            <li> The blush is ok, a little strong on the color for me</li>
            <li> This makes it a bit more challenging to use, especially if you are used to blushes with a larger surface or use a particularly large brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This plush goes on smoothly, barely any is needed, and it is easily buildable.</li>
            <li> The price is inexpensive even if it were more I personally would still buy it, very compact ,will last along time ,Think this color would work on any ones skin tone however there are many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I actually do find this color very flattering and think it would be for many skin</li>
            <li> One positive thing I can report is that the color lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> So glad I spent the money, I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> While I usually really like NYX products, this was my first time using their blush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty potent pink.</li>
            <li> Pinched is a really pretty pinkish/coral, but I think more on the pink side.</li>
            <li> that is super sensitive, or</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what there is in certain blushes</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed as the color seems nice, almost coral and pretty bright in the pan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice slightly peach but most pink glow</li>
            <li> This is an amazing *little* blush.</li>
            <li> The color is a little more rosy that I like ( which is to be expected buying an item on the internet I&#x27;ve never seen in person), but I have found if I just use a little bit of it, the shade ends up being perfect!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it is or not, because I&#x27;d never pay that much for makeup, but I do know it really does give you that flushed look like you pinched your cheeks.  </li>
            <li> .  Very pigmented&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really stay in</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get a blush that is so pigmented and so affordable these NYX blushes really are a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much, and I feel like a clown when wearing it.</li>
            <li> this is not a swipe and go, if you are very</li>
            <li> i didnt pay too much attention to the detales)</li>
            <li> I really like this blush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful, it provides a lovely color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light blonde</li>
            <li> This blush is very pigmented and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Very buildable shade.</li>
            <li> Nyx, on the other-hand, is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> So, get ready to hear compliments about yourself from now on.</li>
            <li> So when I travel it doesnt take much room.</li>
            <li> However take care with the blending brush &amp; try not to get too much of it on your brush...</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t like spending a lot of money on blush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very close in color.</li>
            <li> I got peach which is actually more of a pink color</li>
            <li> Very pigmented color.  </li>
            <li> Definitely need to use a light hand when applying to avoid looking like a clown.  </li>
            <li> I really like them both.  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented and blendable I ordered (</li>
            <li> is that this blush is well pigmented so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get color on your skin.</li>
            <li> price of the blush is reasonable.</li>
            <li> The shade is much deeper than the online image.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as much of the gold shimmer as Orgasm, but does still have the wanted shine.  </li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s really close just to that blush</li>
            <li> That really blows...   </li>
            <li> the color in the pan looks much darker and pinkier than Orgasm.</li>
            <li> It also looks very matte, not shimmery like Orgasm AT ALL.</li>
            <li> This color is much darker than it appears on the site.</li>
            <li> Taking off one star because not liking it as much as my NARS cream stick.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a sub for Nars &amp;#34;orgasm&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s very rosy in color.</li>
            <li> and I really like how this blush looks.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and looks more natural then any blush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral color that works well on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the positive thing about the blush is that it has high pigment.</li>
            <li> I find its a nice subtle pink that gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li> and I will buy other NYX blushes :)</li>
            <li> This really looks like it must be pretty on most pale women but for some reason it was not packed correctly for shipment.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much the color is vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I really like this blush and in a nice small container.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and the pigments are of nice quality.</li>
            <li> The packaging is compact but the color is very pigmented so less gives you more.</li>
            <li> It is so bright, but not really in a good way.</li>
            <li> Mine still looks like i havent used it yet, so i guess it lasts quite long, and the price is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what i was hoping it would, which is to leave a natural rosy look.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering a blush online, as the screen display is almost always different than the true color.</li>
            <li> I found I could put a little swipe of color or build it up for a more intense flush.</li>
            <li> and I live the color!</li>
            <li> which is not peach at all but matte hot pink, pinch which is orang-peach with shimmer and dusty rose from another store which is my favorite</li>
            <li> That said, the amount of blush you get is much less than with most blushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular color, Pinched, for years now.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s good to see a few different</li>
            <li> I purchased this blush shade after hearing it compared to the classic Nars shade &#x27;Orgasm&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I like softer, more natural pink  blushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing it, but it is still a decent compact sized blush.</li>
            <li> I bought this blush to replace an older one...</li>
            <li> For reference, I have fair skin, blonde hair and green eyes.  </li>
            <li> be careful when applying as the color pay off is strong.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND looking Yahoo/Google searching for NYX blush swatches to help choose the color.</li>
            <li> It is highly pigmented and is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair complexion, so a little goes a long way, but it really makes my cheeks pop in a still very natural way.</li>
            <li> This product was much smaller than expected, but I suppose that&#x27;s okay since you don&#x27;t need to apply much.</li>
            <li> I was not hard on this at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a pale blue-eyed Euro chick who tends to try avoid the sun, and this colour gives me a wonderfully healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small (don&#x27;t be fooled by the great price) and won&#x27;t last more than a few months if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> this is a rich pigmented pink</li>
            <li> So much more brighter in person (hot pink) not what I expected</li>
            <li> Nice blush but a little brighter than I was expecting, would buy this brand again in a different color.</li>
            <li> you like to try new face products</li>
            <li> However, holding it up to my roomate&#x27;s NARS blush (shhhh!!) and swathing it, the NARS is more golden shimmery and decently less pink pigmented on the skin than this blush.</li>
            <li> I look for cheap blush as I have have purchased expensive blush many times</li>
            <li> Looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> A little too pink for my fair skin to look natural</li>
            <li> color goes well with my dark hair and eyes and light skin.</li>
            <li> Looks natural!</li>
            <li> It is an easy way to get a pretty and pigmented blush and a little cheek bone highlight at the same time.</li>
            <li> and I expected it not to be so bold.  </li>
            <li> To make use of this blush and not let it go to waste, I have found that if I apply just a little to my cheekbones and then try my best to rub it in/blend well, it is a little better, but I usually have to wipe some of it off so that it&#x27;s not so overpowering.</li>
            <li> That said, you can still get a little color with a light touch of the brush or a lot of color, as you wish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging feels a little cheap</li>
            <li> I actually did a little more research into this product</li>
            <li> the color is a peachy pink but comes off more pink than peachy.</li>
            <li> Clear plastic square fell out of my Peach one</li>
            <li> Finally, because of the intense pigmentation, you must blend blend blend or you will look clown-ish.</li>
            <li> Overall I do really like this blush.</li>
            <li> really like these blushes, especially the Peach one.  </li>
            <li> I struggle to get a natural flushed look with this blush.  </li>
            <li> I had read that this was similar to Orgasm by Nars, but at a much much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Similar color to Nars Orgasm, but much cheaper product.</li>
            <li> I am a brown eyed blond and this product alone takes me from verge-of-death-palor to wow</li>
            <li> and it looks natural on my olive skin.</li>
            <li> Natural color for almost any skin tone.</li>
            <li> and it is classy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly different but not so much that it&#x27;s drastic.</li>
            <li> but when I&#x27;m rushing around in the morning trying to get ready, it&#x27;s an irritant trying to get the case open.</li>
            <li> I have to really mute the color by rubbing it on paper or the back of my hand to get the color I want.</li>
            <li> and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> Pinched is nearly (I would say)</li>
            <li> On the skin, Pinched is a much heavier than Orgasm, especially for lighter gals -</li>
            <li> The color lasts all day long without changing, and it has a very nice bit of glow to it -- very subtle.</li>
            <li> Not too pink, just right.</li>
            <li> Compact is small and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a bit more subtle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a dark reddish pink.</li>
            <li> This blush is highly pigmented and actually lasted for 10 hours with no fading!</li>
            <li> it everyday right now!</li>
            <li> Even the lightest application can look too hot pink for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected but pretty nonetheless.</li>
            <li> It is a really cute bubblegum pink, it reminds me of a little girl blush.  </li>
            <li> Although my friend with dry skin, shade medium tried and was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Pretty color and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very natural blush, goes on sheer and can be layered to build up the color a bit.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty, not at all harsh, but buildable to one&#x27;s liking.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s very pretty, I was surprised by how small the compact was.</li>
            <li> BUT, the reason i&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because theres something (generally in NYX products)</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that the clear part of the lid has a crack and popped out of the lid</li>
            <li> Brow skin barely showed up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented and brighter pink than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> I have olive skin (Indian descent) and this product barely shows up.</li>
            <li> it can give you a natural sheer flush.</li>
            <li> The surface of the blush itself (not including the container) is barely 1 1/4\\</li>
            <li> The color is nearly the same but Pinched shows up easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product then applied nicely to my cheeks with a flattering faint pinkish coral color.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out that with this blush, less is more.</li>
            <li> eager to try more NYX products.&lt;br /&gt;The container is very small, but a little bit goes along way with this blush, and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And unlike other blushes, I barely put any on and it really shows up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dark for my white winter skin but will be lovely with makeup or a summer tan.  </li>
            <li> The problem with Pinched is that it is actually very pink and very pigmented, which shows up a lot on lighter skin.</li>
            <li> I sometimes layer this over the cream blush of the same colour for an extra natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my ivory complexion, this is a vibrant peachy pink.  </li>
            <li> Dusty Rose is a lot darker than I thought it would be, I expected it to be a lot paler than it is in person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Staying power is great but unless u used it before, u will probably be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This color is barely wearable..let alone universally wearable</li>
            <li> It also inspired me to try other NYX products, which are all high quality.</li>
            <li> IMHO, NYX is on the same level with Mac and other high end cosemetics.</li>
            <li> but the color is just a little dark for my pale white skin… Would be really nice on darker skin tones though.</li>
            <li> Very natural shade of pink that would likely compliment almost any skin</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of NYX, finding it to be just as good as products like Mac or Urban Decay, but much less expensive.</li>
            <li> In person it is a little darker than pictured here but very wearable.</li>
            <li> The golden speckles are hardly noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> the blush itself, it&#x27;s very pigmented (probably just as much as NARS if not more!!).</li>
            <li> This is so pigmented on my pale skin, so I have to take care not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> It is about 2 inches, if this were another color and if I saw it sitting somewhere at my local drugstore I would have EASILY mistaken it for a single eyeshadow, because it&#x27;s quite small!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t glittery and only has a slight sheen which gives it a very natural look.</li>
            <li> Next I noticed that the upper case cracked and the little clear plastic cover fell out.  </li>
            <li> I only need the tiniest bit on a fluffy blush brush and it looks very natural on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This feels like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as say Mac</li>
            <li> Blends well and looks like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Because you won&#x27;t need a lot, it should also last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting color and doesn&#x27;t get all over.</li>
            <li> this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain the color is universally flattering, at least on fair-ish skin tones.</li>
            <li> One positive thing is that it isn&#x27;t glittery (at least not for me)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and subtle.</li>
            <li> ; O no theres no way i can wear this&amp;#34; it was wayyyy to bright pink for my medium beige skin tone :(</li>
            <li> It will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Multiple barely showed on my pale skin.  </li>
            <li> It is not to peachy for my pale complexion yet gives me a natural glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small, so don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> but I had to send it back to Ulta because other items in the kit didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s similar, but not exactly.</li>
            <li> So I recently purchased the blush &#x27;Pinched&#x27; by NYX, mostly due to all the hype around it and the comparison to NARS Orgasm.</li>
            <li> first impression of this blush is that it&#x27;s quite small!!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the limited edition Lady Gaga Viva Glam lipstick by MAC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I received it the clear plastic top was broken and it caved in (the powder wasn&#x27;t damaged, though).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I give it 3/5 because I am really pale, so its hard for me to apply this w/o going overboard, if it was not so strong I would have given 4/5.</li>
            <li> A little powdery but overall</li>
            <li> As expected..</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> and I have really pink cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> peachy pink.</li>
            <li> This is a brighter pink than the picture indicates.  </li>
            <li> It is not a coral color, but rather a brighter pink color.  </li>
            <li> This color is way darker than I expected -</li>
            <li> but peaches can be pink...</li>
            <li> Pinched has a much harder time blending in than Orgasm - both because of the color, the amount of pigmentation, and he chalkiness of the Pinched powder.</li>
            <li> Its a deep pink, definitely not as light as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> and I wear it daily, but it seems to be slightly darker and has less shimmer than Orgasm does.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way with this ladies</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this blush.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have to try other colours to compare the consistency of the quality though</li>
            <li> I am usually the lighter ivory shades in foundation, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> so me not willing to spend 30 bucks just on a blush I came looking for a dupe.</li>
            <li> This has never happened to me with my other blushes before</li>
            <li> learning a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> not peachy it&#x27;s actually very pink.</li>
            <li> I have to use it very minimally.</li>
            <li> While the NARS color has a lot of gold and is more peachy, this one is a prettier pink with not a lot of annoying shimmer.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this as it looked so PINK.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful and put it on a little at a time because it has a lot of color to it.</li>
            <li> could see through the thin clear plastic baggie that it was destroyed during shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not worth the aggravation through amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their blotting powder, matte primer, this blush, a dark shimmer eyeshadow, and a setting spray.</li>
            <li> I have pale yellow/olive skin and some peachy pink blushes</li>
            <li> No one,I mean no one can tell the difference &amp;I have friends wearing the same color.</li>
            <li> May not be dramatic enough for glamorous, night-out-on-the-town look, but it&#x27;s very pretty for everyday casual.</li>
            <li> but maybe a little too pink if you have a heavy hand</li>
            <li> It comes in a small container, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think this NYX blush is slightly too shimmery,</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a odd thing to say,</li>
            <li> I find it slightly pigmented, so you dont need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Color was a little too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real pity and was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> and I am pale with dark hair.  </li>
            <li> It goes in a little tray I keep in my makeup drawer.  </li>
            <li> so I was worried about it looking too harsh.</li>
            <li> Ive wasted a lot of money trying them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money tbh.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how firmly the case snaps shut.  </li>
            <li> and I have pale skin.</li>
            <li> The containers also a little small for a blush</li>
            <li> so a little dusting is all you need!</li>
            <li> was not satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting a dusty pink color.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I can&#x27;t say the same to my Jane Cosmetics matte eyeshadow in Verbena.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> This blush is not very good.</li>
            <li> The application is a bit dusty and can go on heavy if you don&#x27;t blow on the brush ahead of time.  </li>
            <li> and they work just as well if not better!</li>
            <li> May be operator error, not sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a very small amount, but I still look like a painted porcelain doll.  </li>
            <li> I heard this was the closest one could get to Nars&#x27; &amp;#34;Orgasm&amp;#34;, which by the way is ridiculously priced.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and, seriously, look at the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to add a subtle rosiness to their cheeks.</li>
            <li> and I really disappointed that this highly rated item is useless.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I was shocked to see that this was completely crushed.</li>
            <li> but when i received it i was not happy i tried it and said &amp;#34</li>
            <li> and I have replaced my expensive makeup brands with the NYX version</li>
            <li> I chose the wrong color-</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely color that looks great for everyday use.  May not be dramatic enough for glamorous, night-out-on-the-town look, but it&#x27;s very pretty for everyday casual.</li>
            <li> Rich pigmentation.  Silky texture.  NYX cosmetics are top notch in my book.  This specific color, Pinched, is often listed as a dupe for Nars Orgasm blush.  I can&#x27;t tell you if it is or not, because I&#x27;d never pay that much for makeup, but I do know it really does give you that flushed look like you pinched your cheeks.  I have a light to medium complexion, brown hair, blue eyes, and it works perfectly with my coloring.  I also like the very fine gold colored flecks.  Adds a glow to your face without being glittery and tacky.  Finally, because of the intense pigmentation, you must blend blend blend or you will look clown-ish. ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this blush because it is a &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; for NARS orgasm. However, holding it up to my roomate&#x27;s NARS blush (shhhh!!) and swathing it, the NARS is more golden shimmery and decently less pink pigmented on the skin than this blush. I do prefer this considering I think this NYX blush is slightly too shimmery, but I just do not use this NYX blush when I am wearing highlighter or sparkly bronzer on my face. Overall I do really like this blush. It is an easy way to get a pretty and pigmented blush and a little cheek bone highlight at the same time.</li>
            <li> As expected..Nice color.</li>
            <li> great colour, great value. very happy with the purchase, and would recommend. have to try other colours to compare the consistency of the quality though</li>
            <li> This (pinched) is a beautiful color that looks great on my fair/medium skintone. The pigment blends evenly and holds up for most of my (often 9+ hour) work day. I also have it in peach, which is also beautiful, but more pink.</li>
            <li> This feels like it will last a long time. Really love the quality of NYX brand.  Great product. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I love NYX, cheap but awesome and I have replaced my expensive makeup brands with the NYX version and they work just as well if not better! I replaced this with my Nars blush and it&#x27;s just as good and 1/8 of the price! Plus it&#x27;s vegan and animal cruelty free. Win-win-win!!</li>
            <li> The color Pinched is great! It&#x27;s so pretty and subtle. It&#x27;s deceiving when you see it because it looks very bright in the packaging but it looks great on!</li>
            <li> Only problem is the case comes apart later.</li>
            <li> This is Luis A&#x27;s wife: True color, all-day wear, love it</li>
            <li> The texture is amazing and I live the color!</li>
            <li> I bought this blush because mine I was using was almost out &amp; I needed a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; item to qualify for free shipping.  Basically, I got an ipad case ( from another seller) and this blush for cheaper than just buying the ipad case alone.  My thinking was that if I didn&#x27;t like it, I would pass it along to a friend or my niece.  I&#x27;m not giving it to anyone~ I totally love it &amp; have used it every day since I got it.  The color is a little more rosy that I like ( which is to be expected buying an item on the internet I&#x27;ve never seen in person), but I have found if I just use a little bit of it, the shade ends up being perfect!  I&#x27;m def. eager to try more NYX products.&lt;br /&gt;The container is very small, but a little bit goes along way with this blush, and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;If you like to try new face products, I recommend giving this one a try!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I chose the wrong color- my fault- but its really really good. Stays on all day. Light weight. I would get it again (lighter shade). I have medium to fair skin, so i look like a porcelain doll if I put on too much by accident.</li>
            <li> Great color pay off. The packaging is compact but the color is very pigmented so less gives you more. You don&#x27;t need a lot at all. Nyx is a great line, the price of a drugstore product and the quality of a high end brand. the color is a peachy pink but comes off more pink than peachy. This is a good color but maybe a little too pink if you have a heavy hand so a little dusting is all you need!</li>
            <li> Very nice blush. In person it is a little darker than pictured here but very wearable. The containers also a little small for a blush but it is still worth it.</li>
            <li> This blush is not very good. It makes me look like I have a fever. And it takes A LOT of makeup remover to get off. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest getting this. I love NYX but not this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE NYX Products!!!! I would expect them to sell for A LOT more than they do. I&#x27;ve been using this particular color, Pinched, for years now. I don&#x27;t know what there is in certain blushes that cause my skin to react, but I tend to break out with most blushes. Not this one!! It goes on perfectly, great color... not too dark or light... just a wonderful product.  :)  It lasts all day, but to be fair, I also ALWAYS set my make up with the NYX Make Up setting spray... the matte one... I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with its staying power. I am a lifetime NYX consumer!!</li>
            <li> Love these blushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Very pigmented&lt;br /&gt;2.  Cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;3.  Great price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Clear plastic square fell out of my Peach one and it doesn&#x27;t really stay in, I&#x27;ve just superglued it so hopefully it quits popping out.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Can be difficult to gauge color online.  Dusty Rose is a lot darker than I thought it would be, I expected it to be a lot paler than it is in person.&lt;br /&gt;- I HIGHLY RECOMMEND looking Yahoo/Google searching for NYX blush swatches to help choose the color. Everyone&#x27;s camera photos and skin tones are different so it&#x27;s good to see a few different swatches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these blushes, especially the Peach one.  It is a really cute bubblegum pink, it reminds me of a little girl blush.  It reminds me of the limited edition Lady Gaga Viva Glam lipstick by MAC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a blush that is so pigmented and so affordable these NYX blushes really are a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 5 days after order date</li>
            <li> Its a deep pink, definitely not as light as shown in the picture. It is deeply tinted and looks great anytime. I use less during the day and just a tad more for evenings and it gives me a nice flushed color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful while applying it, you can put on a lot without knowing since its a rich warm color</li>
            <li> Good color, lasts a long time and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fare skin, a warmer shade I guess? I am usually the lighter ivory shades in foundation, blonde hair. I ordered the &amp;#34;Pinched&amp;#34; shade of this blush. It looks SO natural and nice. I LOVE it. So glad I spent the money, I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Pinched is an exact dupe for Mimosa. Beautiful and I really enjoy the quality. Don&#x27;t pass this one up. Yay!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty color , must watch how much you put on .</li>
            <li> Brow skin barely showed up</li>
            <li> was not satisfied with the product not even the same color that  appears in the picture</li>
            <li> Love this!  It is small but I got 3 of them sent to me so I will share it with my daughter and a friend.  Great deal! You don&#x27;t need much the color is vibrant.  I got pinched.  It looks very pretty on and I am pale with dark hair.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is hailed on many beauty blogs as a dupe for the infamous NARS Orgasm -- I actually like the color better. While the NARS color has a lot of gold and is more peachy, this one is a prettier pink with not a lot of annoying shimmer. I really love this blush. I&#x27;m a fair complexion, so a little goes a long way, but it really makes my cheeks pop in a still very natural way.</li>
            <li> I like this blush, but I don&#x27;t love it.  It&#x27;s very pigmented and brighter pink than I thought it would be.  It looks more warm and peachy in the photo, but applies more hot pink than peach on my skin.  I struggle to get a natural flushed look with this blush.  Even the lightest application can look too hot pink for my tastes.  It definitely lasts much longer than my other blushes though, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> This product was much smaller than expected, but I suppose that&#x27;s okay since you don&#x27;t need to apply much. It is so bright, but not really in a good way. The color is much more of a hot pink than I was expecting, and I don&#x27;t think it compliments my fair skin tone very well. It&#x27;s just too much, and I feel like a clown when wearing it. To make use of this blush and not let it go to waste, I have found that if I apply just a little to my cheekbones and then try my best to rub it in/blend well, it is a little better, but I usually have to wipe some of it off so that it&#x27;s not so overpowering. It&#x27;s a pretty potent pink.</li>
            <li> its not peachy it&#x27;s actually very pink. The picture looks deceptive.</li>
            <li> NYX is very pigmented makeup that what makes it so great especially for the price. If you go to makeupgeek.com there are several good reviews on NYX.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out that with this blush, less is more. At first I couldn&#x27;t get a good balance on how much to use and ended up using too much. But now that I have it figured out, I like the flush and hint of color it gives my cheeks. Great daytime look, or you can add a contouring color underneath and it still looks nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the color shows up well on my skin, I have to use two or three coats for it to show up and I have pale skin.</li>
            <li> I had read that this was similar to Orgasm by Nars, but at a much much cheaper price. This plush goes on smoothly, barely any is needed, and it is easily buildable. Win!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter to use during dance competitions. Works great - she loves it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful vivid colour. Very easy to transfer colour from pan to face. Pan colour is true to colour you will see on your skin. Brings nice flush to face. No allergic reactions. Nyx has great colour selection. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is the first time purchasing an NYX blush, and l am very happy with it! Perfect color (very similar to NARS Orgasm, which is why l gave it a shot), great pigment and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I will buy this over and over again great stuff! It is not to peachy for my pale complexion yet gives me a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  It gives a sheer hint of color that doesn&#x27;t look too &#x27;made-up.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a bit more subtle this is a rich pigmented pink</li>
            <li> While I usually really like NYX products, this was my first time using their blush and it seems to be very lightly pigmented. I just couldn&#x27;t get it to show up on my skin.</li>
            <li> Loved this product and it arrived quite fast as well. I would for sure order from them again as I have already been looking for a new blush for the winter.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful color. I think it would be great for any skin tone. It is a pinky peach shade with glitter, but the glitter does not show up on my cheeks so don&#x27;t let that scare you away from it. So pigmented! a little goes a long way with this ladies so be careful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this blush its a great quality and a really beautiful color!! It shipped perfectly on time n in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Great deal for its price. I recommend it. It came very fast and perfect conditions. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> This blush is the absolute perfect color from me. It has shimmer, and fits with my medium toned skin. It is not heavy, and applies easily. It&#x27;s very small, so don&#x27;t expect too much. The packaging was my only problem, and the reason that I gave it a 3. The top plastic piece is broke, and falls into the blush when I close it. The side was also busted. This blush is perfect and I wish I could have gotten it in better condition.</li>
            <li> I like the pigment and color of this blush.  Reapplication required through the day,  as most of it will wear off unless you use a setting spray</li>
            <li> Just no. I looks cheap when applied. I heard about it on a youtube tutorial and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. In person, it just looks bad. Please know that many of the ladies on youtube are sponsored!!! They are paid to used certain products! I&#x27;m sure that many of them would not use some of the products they are paid to advertise.</li>
            <li> Like the blush.  It&#x27;s a little dark for my white winter skin but will be lovely with makeup or a summer tan.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice pigments, easy to blend, last all day. Easy to carry as it has small/compact packaging. I would say that fits to most of the skin types and shades. I have combination skin, shade light to medium (depends on the season) and this blush works thru all year. Although my friend with dry skin, shade medium tried and was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  Goes on great. Color is lovely. Looks very natural.  Compact is small and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I love this blush and I love the color. Amazing and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great color for caucasian with medium skin tone. It&#x27;s small (don&#x27;t be fooled by the great price) and won&#x27;t last more than a few months if you use it daily. My only qualm is that the clear part of the lid has a crack and popped out of the lid so the blush is exposed and not covered.</li>
            <li> Similar color to Nars Orgasm, but much cheaper product. Use with a light hand, this deposits alot of pigment. I am a brown eyed blond and this product alone takes me from verge-of-death-palor to wow-she-ran-a-mile- after-the-ice-cream-truck flushed. Be prepared to blend, blend blend-- this is not a swipe and go, if you are very pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you wear powder, I&#x27;d put this on after.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral color that works well on my pale skin. It&#x27;s cheaper at Target but the color is popular so this is probably the easiest place to get it fairly consistently.</li>
            <li> Bought in place of a very expensive brand of cosmetic. No one,I mean no one can tell the difference &amp;I have friends wearing the same color.</li>
            <li> i thought it was bigger (may be i didnt pay too much attention to the detales) but the color is beautiful just like in the picture</li>
            <li> Love this blush. The texture and pigmentation are ideal to work with. It blends out nicely on the skin to give a gorgeous flush to your cheeks. I have fair skin, and this is my go to everyday blush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blush shade after hearing it compared to the classic Nars shade &#x27;Orgasm&#x27;. Though this blush is not an exact dupe like some suggested, it gives very, VERY similar color (so flattering!), a nice shimmer and packs a very satisfying pigment punch. That said, if you&#x27;ve used Nars before, you&#x27;ll find that this shade doesn&#x27;t have the same amount goldy bronze flecks and the shimmer is a bit more subdued --but I count that as a good thing. It&#x27;s a more wearable look, in my honest opinion. While &#x27;Orgasm&#x27; is perfect for evening wear and runways, you can get away with &#x27;Pinched&#x27; at work, school and anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Use it every day, I love it. It gives a very natural blush, goes on sheer and can be layered to build up the color a bit. The packaging is cheap and falls apart, often even before I receive it! But the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great color and it looks natural on my olive skin. It just became my daily blush because it looks like a pink natural shimmer.</li>
            <li> The blush is ok, a little strong on the color for me so I have to go light when applying, but it looks good if applied with a light hand.  The problem I have is with the case.  In about two weeks the pinned hinge broke so I just set the top on it in the drawer.  Next I noticed that the upper case cracked and the little clear plastic cover fell out.  I was not hard on this at all.  It goes in a little tray I keep in my makeup drawer.  I have bought blush from a department store vendor and their cases never broke.  Pretty disappointed and I bought two of these.</li>
            <li> This looks beautiful on.  I&#x27;ve never tried Nars orgasm, but I ordered this product since it has great reviews and other reviewers said it is very much like Nars orgasm, which is Amazon&#x27;s top rated blush.  Well, they must be right because it looks very beautiful on and it has sparkles, which I do like.</li>
            <li> Super cute blush but it&#x27;s a little too dark for me. I like softer, more natural pink  blushes &amp; I got this one thinking it would be a nice light pink (color pinched) but the color is just a little dark for my pale white skin… Would be really nice on darker skin tones though. Love the shimmer.</li>
            <li> This has become my go to blush, replacing 3 shades from MAC.  On my ivory complexion, this is a vibrant peachy pink.  It also inspired me to try other NYX products, which are all high quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this in &amp;#34;pinched&amp;#34;. I have medium Asian skin with yellow undertones. A little goes a long way with this blush. It gives me a nice believable pink if I swipe my blush brush lightly on it twice. 3 swipes and I have really pink cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for daily wear alternating with Elf Candid Coral which is more true to my natural color. But I love this for the color it gives my face.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute too.</li>
            <li> You take a chance with ordering colors online but peony was perfect and the color saturation of the product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Natural color for almost any skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this color! And unlike other blushes, I barely put any on and it really shows up. It will go a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty knock – off of Nars&#x27;s iconic &amp;#34;Orgasm&amp;#34; powder blush. I carry this cheaper version in my purse because the Nars powder compact breaks so easily. I keep the Nars at home in the bathroom to protect it. Note: the pigment is intense, so it must be applied with a light hand.</li>
            <li> This is a NARS Orgasm dupe, and it is great! It is incredibly inexpensive, but no one will ever know!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type of the girl that buys a lot of blush but for the price I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I have very fair skin so I was worried about it looking too harsh. I only need the tiniest bit on a fluffy blush brush and it looks very natural on my cheeks. Once on, it is a good pink shade, I was afraid it might have an orangey undertone but it does not and it is classy. A little goes a long way, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love this blush! The price is great and the color, like one reviewer said, is like Nars orgasm. I love this brand!</li>
            <li> I have olive skin (Indian descent) and this product barely shows up. I tossed it after trying to get some use out of it.</li>
            <li> I love Nyx products in general and this blush is no exception. The only thing is, the color is redder than what is depicted in the picture. Not what I expected but pretty nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a blush that looked amazing, but was still affordable. This one fits the bill. Great value.</li>
            <li> nah.... the color is like old rose... nothing flattering for fair skin.</li>
            <li> Really pretty color. More sparkly than expected; which I kind of like! Great value for such a pretty blush!</li>
            <li> Pinker than I thought , but ok .</li>
            <li> I got this because I heard it was the dupe of nars orgasm blush. It is beautiful! I love it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as say Mac but it is pretty if you don&#x27;t mind that</li>
            <li> Very nice!!! Nice color, easy to apply, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> This blush is made in China.  I don&#x27;t know if I trust the ingredients.  The description should disclose that it is made in the P.R.C.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush. It goes on so smoothly and stays on all day. I thought that I might not like this color, but I actually ended up loving it. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this as it looked so PINK. However, so many reviewers had compared the \\&quot;Pinched\\&quot; color to Nars \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; that I decided to give it a try. It is wonderful. I am a pale Caucasian with yellow-based skin tone, and this color looks absolutely wonderful and natural on me. And the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Great blush! Good pigmentation and dupe for nars orgasm.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s very pretty, I was surprised by how small the compact was. I suppose I&#x27;m used to full size blushes.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for Nars Orgasm blush - I&#x27;m happy with it. It&#x27;s slightly different but not so much that it&#x27;s drastic.</li>
            <li> favorite blush! good pigment- just a tiny bit is all you need. very long lasting and gives the perfect healthy blush</li>
            <li> Nice color and compact.</li>
            <li> Nice pigmentation and color. I would recommend this blush</li>
            <li> They say Pinched is a dupe for Nars Orgasm. I&#x27;m not seeing it, but it is still a decent compact sized blush.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy face products that are made in China.</li>
            <li> Very nice color...peachy pink. Blends well and looks like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and arrived quickly from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Use it everyday right now!</li>
            <li> Ordered &#x27;Pinched&#x27; to use for a wedding. IMHO, NYX is on the same level with Mac and other high end cosemetics. This blush is highly pigmented and actually lasted for 10 hours with no fading! Pinched is a really pretty pinkish/coral, but I think more on the pink side. You have to be careful and put it on a little at a time because it has a lot of color to it. I loved it and was very happy to find it.</li>
            <li> I bought this blush to replace an older one...(one that should have been replaced several years ago.) The color is perfect as I apply it lightly to my apples. Great product and color.</li>
            <li> This is a brighter pink than the picture indicates.  It is not a coral color, but rather a brighter pink color.  The application is a bit dusty and can go on heavy if you don&#x27;t blow on the brush ahead of time.  If you&#x27;re careful, it provides a lovely color.</li>
            <li> Good pigmentation, the color does not look like the image. It works better on medium skin tones. I give it 3/5 because I am really pale, so its hard for me to apply this w/o going overboard, if it was not so strong I would have given 4/5. Its a good product, the packaging is okay hard case protects its content, and plastic that allows you to see through is helpful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blush in Pinched.  The color is very pretty, not at all harsh, but buildable to one&#x27;s liking.  And it lasts all day.  Great price too!  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Perfect peachy shade with great payoff. A little powdery but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> Color was a little too dark for me.  I&#x27;m a light blonde and I expected it not to be so bold.  I have to use it very minimally.</li>
            <li> Love this blush. Very pigmented and gives a gorgeous glow.</li>
            <li> Color is way different then shown. I have fair skin, I used just a little and it looked way too bright.  I wnt be buying blush &amp; eyeshadows on line unless I can try them first. All the nyx eyeshadows and blushes look different in the pic. Ive wasted a lot of money trying them. Staying power is great but unless u used it before, u will probably be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very pretty blush! Comparable to Nars &amp;#34;orgasm&amp;#34;. This blush is very pigmented and stays on all day. Very buildable shade. Love it!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this to get a nice blendable color. I found the color to be pretty true to the picture. I love that it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I heard on youtube (emilynoel83) that the NYX blush Pinched is a great dupe for Laura Gellars blush in Mimosa (which is quite pricey but beautiful). I really loved Mimosa as part of a Christmas set but I had to send it back to Ulta because other items in the kit didn&#x27;t work for me. So, when I heard this NYX blush was a good dupe I went ahead and purchased it straight from Amazon. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all. It is very beautiful and buildable. It has a gorgeous glow to it that looks healthy. I&#x27;m very pleased and swipe this on the apples of my cheeks after I use bronzer.</li>
            <li> The color is great without the high price. The packaging could be better but the product itself alone is so worth it compared to NARS Orgasm.... Will definitely buy it again!!! The powder lasts 6 months to me of twice a week of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blush in &amp;#34;pinched&amp;#34; after reading that it was a dupe for NARS Orgasm and I think it&#x27;s similar, but not exactly. It&#x27;s a great blush and I wear it daily, but it seems to be slightly darker and has less shimmer than Orgasm does. I love NYX products though and this is my second blush from them (the other one I own is the &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; shade and is great as well). I will continue to purchase their blushes because they have great pigment and are really inexpensive, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I heard this was the closest one could get to Nars&#x27; &amp;#34;Orgasm&amp;#34;, which by the way is ridiculously priced. Nyx, on the other-hand, is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pigment-heavy, a lovely thing for such a well-priced cosmetic. Dab your brush and shake off the excess: should be enough for both sides of your face! I sometimes layer this over the cream blush of the same colour for an extra natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a pale blue-eyed Euro chick who tends to try avoid the sun, and this colour gives me a wonderfully healthy appearance. No glitter, just like I ran quickly through a forest :-D .It&#x27;s incredible value for what you get. Go for it.</li>
            <li> I like this blush because it&#x27;s inexpensive! It is very soft and very build able! You can put some on your brush and sweep it on for just a tiny hint of color or you can put more on for a more noticeable look! Depending on what your going for! The color is very pretty too and I think it looks good on fair to medium skin tones it is probably not noticeable on darker skin tones!</li>
            <li> love this blush. color goes well with my dark hair and eyes and light skin. want to pick up some in fall shades.</li>
            <li> This blush isn&#x27;t the one I reach for in the morning, but it does the job when I can&#x27;t find mine which has been a couple times now. It has good staying power, I think the issue is more with the color not looking good on my skin tone. I have a fair skin tone and this looks too bright even when I use a light hand or try to blend it more. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I got the Pinched blush color and I absolutely love it! It comes in a small container, but a little goes a long way. Unfortunately, when I received it the clear plastic top was broken and it caved in (the powder wasn&#x27;t damaged, though). I had to tape it together. The blush itself is amazing and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> goes on great, too bad no brush came with it,packed very well and sent quickly, stays on and looks great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heared so many praises about this blush and specially this shade and let me tell it worths every thing good things said about it. Upon one application you&#x27;ll decide into repurchasing it again and again. As it doesn&#x27;t only colors your cheeks it highlights as well. So, get ready to hear compliments about yourself from now on.</li>
            <li> Watch the price:&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;add on\\&quot; product is listed at $5.99.  (Oct 24th, 2012)&lt;br /&gt;It was an \\&quot;add on\\&quot; item priced at $4.79 when I bought it, so keep an eye on the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping/condition upon arrival:&lt;br /&gt;I did not bother opening this product.&lt;br /&gt;I could see through the thin clear plastic baggie that it was destroyed during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The product was not protected at all.&lt;br /&gt;It should have been wrapped in bubble wrap or paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color:&lt;br /&gt;The color of this blush was true to the shade in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The blush does have a strong sheen or sparkle to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last note:&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase my cosmetic products in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Its not worth the aggravation through amazon.</li>
            <li> The color is just beautiful . I love love love this blush . So soft I feel just beautiful :) buy this</li>
            <li> The shade of this blush is just amazing - kind of peachy pink.  I just adore it!  It is highly pigmented and is inexpensive.  I confidently recommend this product and think you should order it right away....not something I say about every NYX blush color.  But you will NOT regret this purchase.  I&#x27;m certain the color is universally flattering, at least on fair-ish skin tones.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a back up for Nars Multiple in Orgasm.  I returned the Nars and use only this now.  No kidding - this is a gorgeous blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nars Multiple barely showed on my pale skin.  I am over 40, redhaired and fair-skinned.  I have eczema and redness from my Irish heritage.  I&#x27;ve read over and over not to use a powder blush pushing 50.  However, this color makes me look beautiful.  Give it a try - for the money, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> my wife love it very much! she love the corlour and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li> Perfect dupe for NARS Orgasm. Beautiful flushed color for my cheeks.</li>
            <li> So much more brighter in person (hot pink) not what I expected</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday makeup, it´s a very cute color with a little bit of gold :) I heart it a lot!</li>
            <li> I love this blush! I mix it with the M.A.C. bronzers and it looks amazing on every color skin great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush and in a nice small container. So when I travel it doesnt take much room.</li>
            <li> Very pretty blush, I ordered Pinched.  It has a lot of pigmentation, and is definitely build able.  The color reminds me of the color of your cheeks when granny pinched them, a flushed pinky red.  It goes on easily, and is easily blend able.</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  It blends well and I like the color.  However take care with the blending brush &amp; try not to get too much of it on your brush...it&#x27;s very easy to overapply with this  blush.</li>
            <li> Loved this color. I&#x27;m Latin and this color worked out great for me.</li>
            <li> I look for cheap blush as I have have purchased expensive blush many times and I just don&#x27;t see any advantage. I can&#x27;t seem to find a color I want to buy again so I really don&#x27;t like spending a lot of money on blush. This color is way darker than I expected - that keeps happening - you&#x27;d think I would learn. It does not break me out so I just use it lightly and rub it in so it smears instead of looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> This is a good blush at a reasonable price. The color lasts all day long without changing, and it has a very nice bit of glow to it -- very subtle. You won&#x27;t look clownish with this blush because it blends very nicely, and I&#x27;ve gotten nice effects by blending with a touch of bronzer for an outdoor, tanned look. With or without the bronzer, the color looks just healthy and natural, but you can build it for something more intense. I&#x27;ve also used it on my eyelids with  bronze/brown on top of it with very nice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten compliments when I wear NYX Blush -- from people who never seem to notice cosmetics. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I do wish that the packaging was a bit more sturdy, but I could say that about almost every blush or powder I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;d buy this again, and I definitely would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I like NYX brands. I got this because I heard it&#x27;s a dupe for the Orgasm blush and it&#x27;s very close in color. looks good!</li>
            <li> Peach. Nice bright pink color with goldish shimmer. Beautiful. I wear it daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money tbh.</li>
            <li> This NYX pinched powder blush is the best brand I have ever used ,goes on smooth and last all day long. The price is inexpensive even if it were more I personally would still buy it, very compact ,will last along time ,Think this color would work on any ones skin tone however there are many colors to choose from.If you decide to purchase this you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this blush. It has great pigment yet it can give you a natural sheer flush. I got peach which is actually more of a pink color but peaches can be pink... I would give it 5 but the packaging is so so. The plastic screen thingy fell in and it scratched the blush itself. But it was in my makeup bag so if you just keep it on your dresser it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented color.  Definitely need to use a light hand when applying to avoid looking like a clown.  Stays on well through out the day.  Gives a great glowing appearance.</li>
            <li> A little too pink for my fair skin to look natural, so I have to go easy with it.  I also don&#x27;t like how firmly the case snaps shut.  I know it&#x27;s a odd thing to say, but when I&#x27;m rushing around in the morning trying to get ready, it&#x27;s an irritant trying to get the case open.</li>
            <li> Luv it. Nice color palette. Just what I wanted. Just as described. Works  Luv it. Nice color palette. Just what I wanted. Just as described.  Good seller. Would buy product again.</li>
            <li> I just purchased tickled and pinched.  I really like them both.  The color pay off it so beautiful.  It has great staying power.  It leaves a great glow, and the color is great.  It arrived so quickly and that made me very happy.  The nyx range is great.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This blush came perfectly to my door it did not break at all. I find its a nice subtle pink that gives you a nice glow. I highly reccomend this</li>
            <li> Great color and awesome price!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and blendable I ordered ( peach: which is not peach at all but matte hot pink, pinch which is orang-peach with shimmer and dusty rose from another store which is my favorite it is warm reddish with brown undertone and it is matte)</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;) I Wore it today it&#x27;s very pretty - gave great color payoff.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color and it stays put all day. I love the tiny gold flecks throughout. This pinky peach is a great color for pale skin.</li>
            <li> Great applied with a large brush. Gives me great cheek color. It&#x27;s perfect for me. Not too overpowering either. Looks natural!</li>
            <li> In the container, the color of the blush looks like what I would call rose gold, but on the skin, it is a brighter color between a light-but-bold pink and a peach. It also has a gold-toned finish on it--almost like a highlighter--so there is color and also shimmer with it. The texture is smooth and silky, almost creamy, so it&#x27;s very pleasant to apply and not at all flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed immediately upon first use is that this blush is well pigmented so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get color on your skin. Most of the blushes I have used need to be applied several times to build up the color I wanted; not this one! That said, you can still get a little color with a light touch of the brush or a lot of color, as you wish. I feel like this blush would be best for light- to medium-toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the blush is reasonable. That said, the amount of blush you get is much less than with most blushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. The surface of the blush itself (not including the container) is barely 1 1/4\\&quot; inches square. This makes it a bit more challenging to use, especially if you are used to blushes with a larger surface or use a particularly large brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I recommended this blush and this line of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This is a great powder blush. I am a big fan of NYX, finding it to be just as good as products like Mac or Urban Decay, but much less expensive. This blush is no exception. The color (pinched) is beautiful, it stays on all day, and it lasts for well over a year, even with daily use. I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The reason i give 2 stars is because in the picture i thought this blush was not that bright but when i received it i was not happy i tried it and said &amp;#34; O no theres no way i can wear this&amp;#34; it was wayyyy to bright pink for my medium beige skin tone :( bummer!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it only based on amazon reviews and I really disappointed that this highly rated item is useless. It won&#x27;t blend at all leaving unequal stains. I didn&#x27;t have time to return it and now its lying as an unpleasant reminder on my bathroom counter. I truly believe Amazon should do something about it, so reviews ratings are more accurate.</li>
            <li> perfect shade of pink! doesnt look over done. i pair it with bronzer!</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Just need a pinch. Lasts a long time. Will buy again. DLT</li>
            <li> I love love love Nyx so much! This blush is SUPER cute and very worth it! I cannot wait to use it!</li>
            <li> Great color and formula!</li>
            <li> I hesitated writing a review because this blush might be perfect for some people, but on me it&#x27;s much too bright.  I&#x27;ve tried using a very small amount, but I still look like a painted porcelain doll.  For reference, I have fair skin, blonde hair and green eyes.  The shade is much deeper than the online image.  I guess &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; would have been a better choice.  One positive thing is that it isn&#x27;t glittery (at least not for me) but I tried muting it with some finishing powder and it is still too bright.  Of course every complexion will get a different result.  I don&#x27;t like the case, since it&#x27;s flimsy and feels as if it will break easily.  One positive thing I can report is that the color lasts for hours.  Because you won&#x27;t need a lot, it should also last for a long time.  So I&#x27;ll rate this 3 stars, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this blush in Pinched and I use it every day. The color is perfect and so is the texture of this blush. It is definitely worth the $5. A must have for makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> This is a great dupe for NARS Orgasm.  It doesn&#x27;t have as much of the gold shimmer as Orgasm, but does still have the wanted shine.  It is long lasting and the pigments are of nice quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s supposed to be a dupe of NARS Orgasm blush.. it is almost identical! love the color. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great color! Cheap and durable!</li>
            <li> Bought it from their website a good 6 months ago, and i really liked it. First blush, i gotta admit. I find it slightly pigmented, so you dont need to use a lot. Mine still looks like i havent used it yet, so i guess it lasts quite long, and the price is a huge bonus. BUT, the reason i&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because theres something (generally in NYX products) that i got an allergic reaction to - if it&#x27;s my skin that is super sensitive, or the product that is something wrong with, i cannot tell. I just know that when i removed NYX (this blush included) from my makeup routine, my face started to heal. I&#x27;ve used their blotting powder, matte primer, this blush, a dark shimmer eyeshadow, and a setting spray. Just look into the ingredients before you buy.</li>
            <li> Pinched is a bright pink and I was expecting a dusty pink color. I was not pleased. I have to really mute the color by rubbing it on paper or the back of my hand to get the color I want. And it sparkles? It is not what is pictured on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the positive thing about the blush is that it has high pigment. That&#x27;s a plus, I guess. I&#x27;m definitely getting another color IN A DRUGSTORE.</li>
            <li> The color is very bright, quite a bit brighter and deeper than the photo provided. However, with a light hand it&#x27;s a beautiful natural pink flush that lasts all day. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Nars&#x27; Orgasm Blush. It gives me a nice slightly peach but most pink glow and it looks great on my skin. I love all of NYX Cosmetics Powder Blushes but this color is by far the best and it looks so natural. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the color, but it is brighter than the picture shows. It blends well and lasts for hours - I only reapply if I have somewhere to go in the evening.</li>
            <li> Cheap buy, very highly pigmented, matches most skin tones and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation, great fix, great color. I&#x27;m in love with this powder blush.&lt;br /&gt;(I got the pinched color)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying it again.</li>
            <li> Well look no further than NYX powder blush in &amp;#34;Pinched!&amp;#34; It works well on lots of skin tones and the texture/longevity seem to compete with more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The packaging was smaller than I was expecting but overall great colouring and I will buy other NYX blushes :)</li>
            <li> Looking online for a blush, all I saw were people raving on about NARS orgasm blush...so me not willing to spend 30 bucks just on a blush I came looking for a dupe. I have to say it&#x27;s really close just to that blush and it&#x27;s cheap! This blush needs just a bit of application to give that perfect blushed look that I adore.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  I use this everyday! I love that I dont have to use a ton of it. Just a little goes a very long way, wich i love because then I dont have to go out and buy more sooner. I have Passed the word of this product to friends and family. I Highly reccamend this product to anyone who is thinkig about trying it!!</li>
            <li> The product I received in the mail isn&#x27;t the color is shows in the picture. It&#x27;s more of a dark reddish pink. The product did come intact and I&#x27;m happy about that. Sadly, I can&#x27;t say the same to my Jane Cosmetics matte eyeshadow in Verbena. It also looks nothing like the picture and it came in a chunky dust which should&#x27;ve been a solid. Anyways, not too happy about the color of this blush.     UPDATE  I actually did a little more research into this product and I did get an entirely different shade from this company. That really blows...   But once I use it, I&#x27;ll further comment on the product. Maybe it&#x27;ll be pretty.</li>
            <li> Long lasting color and doesn&#x27;t get all over.</li>
            <li> Love this blush!  Pretty color and long lasting.  Great price....excellent shipping.</li>
            <li> Lovely color. Not powdery. High quality.</li>
            <li> NYX Pinched is a beautiful color. It looks close to Orgasm, but the color isn&#x27;t as orangey and the shimmer is more like a golden sheen. So no, I would not say it is a dupe.&lt;br /&gt; Flattering on warm skin tones, probably better for us lighter skinned ladies. :) Love this color! I prefer this to Orgasm any day.</li>
            <li> I have an olive/medium tan skin tone. It seems like no matter how much of this blush I put on, it just will not visibly show up!  I was pretty disappointed as the color seems nice, almost coral and pretty bright in the pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does not work for me I could see how it would be great for other skin tones (perhaps fair/light tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I changed my review from 3 stars to 4 stars as I figured out what was causing the product to not show up on my skin. After using it only twice a weird film had gathered across the top. Perhaps my foundation had transfered onto the blush from my brush?  This has never happened to me with my other blushes before and my brushes are always clean. I used a razor (not a shaving razor a blade razor) to shave off the film. The product then applied nicely to my cheeks with a flattering faint pinkish coral color. I actually do find this color very flattering and think it would be for many skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I still prefer the texture and consistency of my Nars and MAC blushes better. However you can&#x27;t beat this blush for the price.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing!  The perfect color for all year long.  Looks great on my skin tone.  Several friends have used it and it looks great on them too.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now and it doesn&#x27;t looked used at all.  this will last a long time.  Goes on smooth and looks perfect!  Love, love love.</li>
            <li> Very pleased as this outperforms MAC brand in color, application and price.</li>
            <li> Great, Total dupe for NARS&#x27;s Orgasm and Tarte&#x27;s Glisten, :).</li>
            <li> This blush is great it is super pigmented and I use it every day in the summer.</li>
            <li> So I recently purchased the blush &#x27;Pinched&#x27; by NYX, mostly due to all the hype around it and the comparison to NARS Orgasm. I am absolutely in love with my NARS blush, it looks so nice, effortless and natural, but is (unfortunately) really expensive, so I decided to buy a similar blush I could wear on a daily basis and keep my NARS for special occasions, and Pinched seemed like the perfect fill-in for my favorite blush. PS. If you can find this nearby instores please do!! This retails for $6.00 on here, but retails for $5.00 on NYX&#x27;s website so consider that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of this blush is that it&#x27;s quite small!! It is about 2 inches, if this were another color and if I saw it sitting somewhere at my local drugstore I would have EASILY mistaken it for a single eyeshadow, because it&#x27;s quite small!! The packaging is quite nice however, and is actually quite reflective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE COMPARISON: Pinched is nearly (I would say) 3/4th&#x27;s the size of Orgasm. *Pictures Provided*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the blush itself, it&#x27;s very pigmented (probably just as much as NARS if not more!!). For the pigmentation itself, you actually get quite a good deal!! The problem with Pinched is that it is actually very pink and very pigmented, which shows up a lot on lighter skin. One sweep of color and the blush literally popped off my medium-toned cheeks!! Also, the powder tends towards chalkiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR COMPARISON: the color in the pan looks much darker and pinkier than Orgasm. *Pictures Provided* It also looks very matte, not shimmery like Orgasm AT ALL. The golden speckles are hardly noticeable at all. On the skin, Pinched is a much heavier than Orgasm, especially for lighter gals - I can&#x27;t see this looking good unless it&#x27;s dusted on with a really light hand!! The color is nearly the same but Pinched shows up easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEXTURE COMPARISON: Pinched has a much harder time blending in than Orgasm - both because of the color, the amount of pigmentation, and he chalkiness of the Pinched powder. NARS is much easier to blend in and looks quite effortless on its own without much blending. Orgasm is also much easier to control as it&#x27;s not as bright as Pinched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall both are great options, NYX Pinched is a good blush, but I still prefer my NARS Orgasm over it. I would not consider it a dupe, though it came close!! I would give this 3 stars, but I&#x27;ll add in another star for the great price and high pigmentation!!ion, and he chalkiness of the Pinched powder. NARS is much easier to blend in and looks quite effortless on its own without much blending. Orgasm is also much easier to control as it&#x27;s not as bright as Pinched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall both are great options, NYX Pinched is a good blush, but I still prefer my NARS Orgasm over it. I would not consider it a dupe, though it came close!! I would give this 3 stars, but I&#x27;ll add in another star for the great price and high pigmentation!!</li>
            <li> This color is much darker than it appears on the site. I coudlnt use it, so I&#x27;m returning.</li>
            <li> Used to replace some old peachy blush I liked to wear in summer. Great pigmentation, beautiful color. I have pale yellow/olive skin and some peachy pink blushes can look terrible but this works great--the gold toned shimmer helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging feels a little cheap but I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and, seriously, look at the price.</li>
            <li> This really looks like it must be pretty on most pale women but for some reason it was not packed correctly for shipment. When I opened the box, I was shocked to see that this was completely crushed. It&#x27;s a real pity and was a waste of money for me. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I got Pinched... learning a little goes a long way! Taking off one star because not liking it as much as my NARS cream stick. This is so pigmented on my pale skin, so I have to take care not to apply too much. I&#x27;m wearing it today and liking it. Just not in love with it yet. Also seems like it doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as the NARS. May be operator error, not sure!</li>
            <li> Goes on skin evenly  and evens out my skin. Color blends well and looks well with all clothing colors including bright clothes.</li>
            <li> Very natural shade of pink that would likely compliment almost any skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have med-fair skin with freckles and red hair. I typically wear a more rose colored blush, but I absolutely love this peachy-pink shade. It goes on easily and looks more natural then any blush I have used in the past. This will likely be my permanent blush. Great product. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I very much love this color. It looks great on my skin, which I would consider a light ivory. It isn&#x27;t glittery and only has a slight sheen which gives it a very natural look. My blush arrived fine with no damage in shipping. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a sub for Nars &amp;#34;orgasm&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s very rosy in color. The texture is nice and the staying power is good, just not a great color on fair skin.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping, couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived, this is the color I have been looking for, love this blush and a great price and will buy again</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and I really like how this blush looks. It does exactly what i was hoping it would, which is to leave a natural rosy look. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to add a subtle rosiness to their cheeks.</li>
            <li> I love this blush. It&#x27;s perfect, subtle with a pop of color. I would definitely recommend it to complement all skin tones.</li>
            <li> This blush stays on and looks great at the end of the day as it does when you put it on.</li>
            <li> this blush is very bright and pigmented not at all like the picture. The color I received is so contrasting to what I seen online I&#x27;m sort of wondering if it was mislabeled. The color I received is kind of a brick orange and goes on nearly red. I bought this hearing it would be a good orgasm dupe...not at all. This color is barely wearable..let alone universally wearable</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to NARS Orgasm. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as great of a product for a fraction of the cost, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours. I found myself back at Sephora purchasing my NARS blush....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium skin tone, NW30, and this looks really nice and natural on me.</li>
            <li> Had been using the Nars Orgasm for awhile, but this works just as well! Will definitely purchase again, and love the price point.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews, I decided to go with this color. For the price, the quality is great. It is pretty pigmented and goes on smoothly. I will buy blush from this company again.</li>
            <li> Colourful and smooth. Very nice to use.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Specs of gold glitter that look really pretty during the day or night! Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Nice blush but a little brighter than I was expecting, would buy this brand again in a different color.</li>
            <li> Never tried this before or ordering makeup on line.  The color is exactly as it appeared online and I coldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing *little* blush. The pigment is wonderful and goes on so smoothly and blends beautifully. I found I could put a little swipe of color or build it up for a more intense flush. I was worried about ordering a blush online, as the screen display is almost always different than the true color. In this case, it worked out and was a terrific buy.I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blush EVER!!!!  The color is perfection!!!</li>
            <li> Great price for a great quality blush. Not too pink, just right. A good buy! Don&#x27;t be afraid of this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a peachy coral tone with golden shimmer. be careful when applying as the color pay off is strong. A LITTLE goes a long way. It&#x27;s perfect for spring and summer. Maybe fall but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d wear it in the winter. But that&#x27;s mostly because of my skin tone.</li>
