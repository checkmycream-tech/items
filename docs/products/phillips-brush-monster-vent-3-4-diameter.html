            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>This brush is huge and took some time to get used to, but once you do it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The quality is nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>For starters it’s very easy to run through my hair</li>
            <li>This brush is huge and I love it!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a brush to blow dry my hair and this one looks great and does a great job -</li>
            <li>HUGE!  </li>
            <li>but I assume with more use, it will loosen up a bit.</li>
            <li>However, I really love the feel when I am brushing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m ordering two more in 3 1/2\\&quot; and 4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad I bit that bullet.  </li>
            <li>and I love it for some looks but not all.</li>
            <li>If your hair is shorter than shoulder length I also don’t think this brush would be great because it would just be too much brush for your hair.</li>
            <li>Love how it&#x27;s hallow</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush.  </li>
            <li>but with the plastic enforced bristles and that works better.  </li>
            <li>Better to use on damp hair for me.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It also gives my hair more bounce and body.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was much better than what I have found in beauty supply stores</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love this brush....pulls my curly hair</li>
            <li>Everyone remarks on how healthy it looks too.</li>
            <li>Additionally, many of the bristles looked filmsy like they were about to fall out.  </li>
            <li>delivery was quick and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty good quality</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>This brush has bristles a bit softer than I like so that I can really dig in and get good curls.  </li>
            <li>This is a good brush for fine hair if you want to do a straight look.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>so I need a strong bristle to go through it.  </li>
            <li>I have shorter hair and this works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I use this brush primarily for blow outs</li>
            <li>The brush did leave my hair feeling soft and shiny, and the size was good for my length of hair as well</li>
            <li>Love its design with open space inside so the hot hair coming from the blow drier dries my hair more effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I LOVE using this brush, dries my hair to a wonderful curl on my fine thin hair!</li>
            <li>it is exactly what the picture looks like!</li>
            <li>I have been using Phillips brushes for about ten years and love them!  </li>
            <li>The brush is large but light.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m officially pleased (almost pleasantly surprised) with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Additionally it’s not really the best at getting volume at your roots because it’s so big.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also important to note that my hair is in pretty healthy condition although I do have it colored and highlighted regularly.</li>
            <li>The handle feels just right.</li>
            <li>I really like how quickly I can blow out my hair with this brush.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s naturally porous and can get frizzy easily in humid conditions.</li>
            <li>The center of the brush is hollow, which is perfect for styling.  </li>
            <li>of all the sizes, brands, prices, this is officially my ultimate favorite.</li>
            <li>, I use it once when I first get out of the shower and it never pulls or rips my hair.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Love it, and would totally recommend</li>
            <li>It also dries my hair very quickly because the diameter of the brush is so big.</li>
            <li>This is really large</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and received it early!!</li>
            <li>says it dries her hair so much quicker.</li>
            <li>It is vented so really helps with drying the hair fast.  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough that I ordered another one an inch or so smaller.  </li>
            <li>I sent this brush back since it was literally falling apart and poorly made, and purchased an &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; which I am very happy with.</li>
            <li>The black band of rubber at the top of the handle really helps you keep your grip when you’re using this to blow out your hair and turning it.</li>
            <li>Wow, I used this brush for the first time today</li>
            <li>However if you have long hair and blow out your hair often, I highly recommend this for a shiny and smooth look.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>For this reason, I rather keep it straight with a natural wave to it using this brush, rather than curly.</li>
            <li>I would just mention that don&#x27;t put to much heat on them directly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say this is my favorite round straightening brush I have ever bought...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough for girls with long hair to be able twirl their hair in it without getting tangled!</li>
            <li>and I decided it was time for a new and ordered this brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first boar bristle brush that actually grips my hair.  </li>
            <li>and this brush surpasses it by far.  </li>
            <li>but it is really, really soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft &amp; shinning &#x27;  </li>
            <li>They grip and resist just enough to keep it straight while blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after my cousin fixed my hair with hers.</li>
            <li>I looked at my old brush again and realized I had</li>
            <li>the MV-3P, maybe the P means professional.  </li>
            <li>I have long, wavy and somewhat coarse hair and this brush left my hair smooth and shiny after blow drying.</li>
            <li>way to big (mainly use them to blowout my bangs)</li>
            <li>i get major frizz but not with this brush!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you want to get a long straight look.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended that I get a large round bristled brush to help keep my hair straight when blow drying.  </li>
            <li>The natural bristles make my hair shine like a teen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>straight while blow drying and gets the job done in a flash due to the vented body.</li>

            <li> straight while blow drying and gets the job done in a flash due to the vented body.</li>
            <li> But yeah, after trying this brush for a while and getting the hang of it (since every design can take some tweaking in the way you use it), after my last blow dry</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Definitely no soft curl.</li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant to purchase this brush after reading some of the other reviews about the bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> This brush is bigger than expected!</li>
            <li> As soon as I took it out of the packaging it looked and felt different than my other brush.  </li>
            <li> I used the brush once and several bristles did fall out, and the brush did not hold hair like my other brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every time I dry my hair</li>
            <li> blow dry brush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Being vented helps the hair to dry a lot faster too!</li>
            <li> so if you do not have long hair (past the shoulders) I would go with a smaller size.</li>
            <li> The bristles do not pull or drag in my hair.  </li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t go through if it is wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly large either, it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> I have a bob and my hair is dry in half the time (about 15 minutes).</li>
            <li> When I use this I notice my hair is shinier and smoother than when I use other brushes or no brush at all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it if my hair is very wet.</li>
            <li> The vents cut my hair drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I do have long hair (a few inches past the shoulders for reference).  </li>
            <li> All of the previous reviews assisted in my decision.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to maintain, being that I can&#x27;t afford washing it and blow drying it everyday.</li>
            <li> it also never gets stuck, pulls, or has trouble with tangles.</li>
            <li> and I received the shipment in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Whenever i round brush my hair</li>
            <li> you can see the shine as you round brush each part of hair.</li>
            <li> I usually air dry it since I have a very thick head of hair</li>

            <li> Wow, I used this brush for the first time today and I definitely noticed that my hair was a lot softer! I have long, wavy and somewhat coarse hair and this brush left my hair smooth and shiny after blow drying. It&#x27;s a bit tough to get through your hair but I assume with more use, it will loosen up a bit. It&#x27;s not terribly large either, it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> I hate when I have to buy a new hair brush....  I have long hair so I need a strong bristle to go through it.  This brush has bristles a bit softer than I like so that I can really dig in and get good curls.  However, I really love the feel when I am brushing my hair.  It makes me feel pampered.  I liked it enough that I ordered another one an inch or so smaller.  It will have shorter bristles so I think maybe it will be my stern brush.  Basically it is lovely and I am very happy with it.  Well made for a wooden/bamboo brush.    Atheena</li>
            <li> Good brush. The vents cut my hair drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my monster brush over 10 years.It&#x27;s the only one I use &amp; it&#x27;s been around the world w/me.My daughter uses mine when she visits- says it dries her hair so much quicker. Now I&#x27;m ordering two more in 3 1/2\\&quot; and 4\\&quot;. She can have her pick. I&#x27;d never thought to look it up on the web.Hooray, there it was!</li>
            <li> I do hair and love this brush!!!! Great for smoothing hair! Being vented helps the hair to dry a lot faster too!</li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant to purchase this brush after reading some of the other reviews about the bristles falling out. I decided to just bite the bullet and get it anyway, I would deal with the consequences later.  Well, I&#x27;m glad I bit that bullet.  This brush is great.  It&#x27;s the first boar bristle brush that actually grips my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t just slide through like others I&#x27;ve tried to use.  I do have long hair (a few inches past the shoulders for reference).  I really like how quickly I can blow out my hair with this brush.  I believe the vents help.  I&#x27;ve been using this every time I dry my hair and it turns out great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t experienced any bristles falling out.  This is a great brush for a great price.  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say this is my favorite round straightening brush I have ever bought...of all the sizes, brands, prices, this is officially my ultimate favorite. I love that it&#x27;s light. The handle feels just right. Love its design with open space inside so the hot hair coming from the blow drier dries my hair more effectively and efficiently. I must say, I&#x27;m truly impressed. Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brushes. This one seals the deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also important to note that my hair is in pretty healthy condition although I do have it colored and highlighted regularly. It&#x27;s naturaly curly...like medium curls. And it&#x27;s naturally porous and can get frizzy easily in humid conditions. For this reason, I rather keep it straight with a natural wave to it using this brush, rather than curly. It&#x27;s easier to maintain, being that I can&#x27;t afford washing it and blow drying it everyday. But yeah, after trying this brush for a while and getting the hang of it (since every design can take some tweaking in the way you use it), after my last blow dry, I&#x27;m officially pleased (almost pleasantly surprised) with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I use this brush primarily for blow outs and I love it for some looks but not all. For starters it’s very easy to run through my hair, I use it once when I first get out of the shower and it never pulls or rips my hair. When I’m using to blow out my hair it also never gets stuck, pulls, or has trouble with tangles. The black band of rubber at the top of the handle really helps you keep your grip when you’re using this to blow out your hair and turning it. When I use this I notice my hair is shinier and smoother than when I use other brushes or no brush at all. It also dries my hair very quickly because the diameter of the brush is so big. The size can also be a bit of a con. Even though this is a round brush, because it is so big you will not get rounded edges, when I use this my hair looks straight at the end. Additionally it’s not really the best at getting volume at your roots because it’s so big. If you’re looking lots of volume and rounded ends I would stay in the 1” size. If your hair is shorter than shoulder length I also don’t think this brush would be great because it would just be too much brush for your hair. However if you have long hair and blow out your hair often, I highly recommend this for a shiny and smooth look.</li>
            <li> This brush is huge and I love it! It&#x27;s big enough for girls with long hair to be able twirl their hair in it without getting tangled! Love how it&#x27;s hallow so you can point the blow dryer into the barrel of the brush. And it just feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a recommendation from my hair stylist. It&#x27;s great!!! The center of the brush is hollow, which is perfect for styling.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is bigger than expected! Difficult to use for blow drying</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  I have another that is all boars head and this brush surpasses it by far.  It is vented so really helps with drying the hair fast.  I have shorter hair and this works just fine.  No pulling your hair out and gets a good grip.  I have wavy hair and this brush does a great job in straightening it out.</li>
            <li> Like the brush, however, my husband had to glue the handle back into the hole. The brush does get a good workout tho cause I do use it sometimes twice a day. The brush arrived timely and was well packaged.    I would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Exactly what I was looking for and received it early!!</li>
            <li> The combination of nylon and boar bristles give the perfect pick up and hold for the blow dryer.  The brush is large but light.</li>
            <li> I love the brush.  I get the look I want using it just like my hairdresser. I would recommend this product if you want to get a long straight look.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to anyone looking for a sturdy brush. All of the previous reviews assisted in my decision.</li>
            <li> I like this brush but it is really, really soft.  I have a similar brush but with the plastic enforced bristles and that works better.  This is really large so if you do not have long hair (past the shoulders) I would go with a smaller size.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush to blow dry my hair and this one looks great and does a great job - what I like about it is that the brush get ventilation and you can spin the brush to give you that extra volume.  The bristles are pretty good quality I would just mention that don&#x27;t put to much heat on them directly.  The brush did leave my hair feeling soft and shiny, and the size was good for my length of hair as well -this is a good straighten blow dry brush - I would recommend it to others that are looking for something that will do a good job on your hair.</li>
            <li> Love the brush!  The brush work great on my hair. My hair is soft &amp; shinning &#x27;  Thank Phillips brush</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended that I get a large round bristled brush to help keep my hair straight when blow drying.  This one is easy to use.  The bristles do not pull or drag in my hair.  They grip and resist just enough to keep it straight while blow drying.  The quality is nice for the price.  I have been using it for over a month and it is working and holding up well.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for fine hair if you want to do a straight look. Can&#x27;t use it if my hair is very wet. I usually air dry it since I have a very thick head of hair it won&#x27;t go through if it is wet. Better to use on damp hair for me.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses this brush and I love it. I have a bob and my hair is dry in half the time (about 15 minutes). It also gives my hair more bounce and body. The price on Amazon was much better than what I have found in beauty supply stores and I received the shipment in just a few days.No complaints here!</li>
            <li> I bought this after my cousin fixed my hair with hers. She bought hers at a salon for 35$ and i got mine on here for around 15! Whenever i round brush my hair i get major frizz but not with this brush! you can see the shine as you round brush each part of hair. I LOVE IT. i will never use another round brush! very strong too!</li>
            <li> Great brush! Good price. When it first arrived I thought it would be way to big (mainly use them to blowout my bangs) but it&#x27;s perfect! LOVE!</li>
            <li> This brush is huge and took some time to get used to, but once you do it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> great brush. it is exactly what the picture looks like! delivery was quick and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great brush, works great</li>
            <li> Love this brush....pulls my curly hair straight while blow drying and gets the job done in a flash due to the vented body. The handle is easy to hold.  The natural bristles make my hair shine like a teen&#x27;s.  Everyone remarks on how healthy it looks too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE using this brush, dries my hair to a wonderful curl on my fine thin hair! Love it, and would totally recommend</li>
            <li> HUGE!  Too big, tried it for 2 weeks, bit my hair was just frizzy.  Definitely no soft curl.</li>
            <li> Just the brush I needed. My one was falling apart I looked all over for this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using Phillips brushes for about ten years and love them!  Sadly my monster started to die and I decided it was time for a new and ordered this brush.  As soon as I took it out of the packaging it looked and felt different than my other brush.  Additionally, many of the bristles looked filmsy like they were about to fall out.  I used the brush once and several bristles did fall out, and the brush did not hold hair like my other brush.  I looked at my old brush again and realized I had the MV-3P, maybe the P means professional.  I sent this brush back since it was literally falling apart and poorly made, and purchased an &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; which I am very happy with.</li>
