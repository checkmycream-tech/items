            <li>I still loved the colour!It</li>
            <li>Beautiful eyeshadow kit , has all the colors which I want , 7 shades of matte &amp;  7 shades of glitter , all in one can&#x27;t ask for more ...</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and I love that every shimmer color has a matching matte color.</li>
            <li>Love this palette!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love the choice of colors and the color lasts all day!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>If you like glittery shadows that sparkle in the light, get it!!.</li>
            <li>Yes I love the shadows!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a palette which is a pleasant surprise :-)</li>
            <li>but the matte colors are amazing.  </li>
            <li>The shimmery pigments with glitter in it the result looked nice too.</li>
            <li>I will stick with the matte shades mostly, which are earthy natural colours and wonderful!</li>
            <li>but she seemed pretty happy</li>
            <li>I use a very light hand with my eye makeup, I think someone who likes things darker will love the matte but be dissappointed in the shimmers.</li>
            <li>Great buy and the seller shipped it super fast!!!</li>
            <li>Love the colors</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the sample mascara that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this pallette thinking it was going to be awesome</li>
            <li>used better..</li>
            <li>I do wish they had a bit more pigment in the shadow</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.....</li>
            <li>Also love the fact that this ain&#x27;t just a nude/natural palette.  </li>
            <li>love the service and product</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>I love how for each color there is a matte and a sparkly one.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, the colors seemed to fade as the day progressed.</li>
            <li>The brush works much better than I brush</li>
            <li>love it , but needs better colors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not pay full price!</li>
            <li>The matte shades are wonderful, have lasting colour and the pigment is true colour on the skin.</li>
            <li>All I do know is a good eyeshadow should be a good, pigmented, long wearing eyeshadow regardless of what primer you use.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this is an awesome palette</li>
            <li>this is great quality and will buy more when I run low, a must have...</li>
            <li>I find they are amazingly pigmented and you do not need to use very much product at all.  </li>
            <li>I use the Too Faced Glitter Insurance Glue on my lids before applying the shimmery colors and they look beautiful and last all day.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the matte colors which are on the bottom row.  </li>
            <li>M3 is wonderful on my pale with olive undertone skin.</li>
            <li>I was thinking about getting the naked palette but liked this one much more.</li>
            <li>The shimmery colors (top row) require a bit of building if you want a real glittery look (and even then I&#x27;m not sure you would achieve it), but they&#x27;re perfect if you&#x27;re just looking for a hint of sparkle.</li>
            <li>The colors are great for women who want darker neutrals instead of a mix of dark and light.</li>
            <li>If you want a good eyeshadow, stick with urban decay, too faced, or the balm.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Use a primer, wet the brush, tap the color on your lid to build intensity - then you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>High quality and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and they are more mild and the pigment goes on much lesser than the matte ones beneath them</li>
            <li>She is usually particular about her makeup, mostly with her eye makeup, and her direct quote about the full exposure mascara was that &amp;#34;it has changed the whole eyelash and mascara game&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, the shadows do not show up very much at all.</li>
            <li>Amazing the colors show up so well every single one of them and its not a fake</li>
            <li>She has said that the palette contains all her favorite colors from all 3 of the naked palettes.  </li>
            <li>I wear my favorite three colors with a simple cat eye</li>
            <li>I love the colors, and they last all day.  </li>
            <li>and it was my first Smashbox product ever.</li>
            <li>You have to use more of the product to get the same pigmented effect from shimmery ones however.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know what to say about it.</li>
            <li>I feel like they are very chalky and even with the primer</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this palette I got initially as a sample.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>i really only use the light shimmer as highlight and one of the medium brown for the crease....</li>
            <li>I do have a problem with the shimmery colors because they do not apply to the eye very well.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t find that it makes much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the brush isn&#x27;t very useful.</li>
            <li>It applies amazingly and it last all day long.</li>
            <li>but overall I am pleased since it has all the colors I use for daily use.</li>
            <li>and the colors are beautiful but the consistency of the shadows is very poor.</li>
            <li>S7 goes on looking like a grey shadow full of silver glitter and not for all the time-(even for me&amp; I dress goth), I have tried S1-S4</li>
            <li>There is no FINE about it, there are GLITTERS in these eyeshadows which i love.</li>
            <li>Although expensive, it is a very nice collection of colors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised with Smashbox with  this pallette.  </li>
            <li>I even tried spraying my brush with toner water tor get more pigment and that hardly did thr trick.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day for both a natural every day look and for a fancier night look.</li>
            <li>Definitely didn&#x27;t feel like there was much color payoff.</li>
            <li>I have very oily lids, and expected this to be gone by noon also, but its not.</li>
            <li>Just not amazing enough to make it worth the whole palette.</li>
            <li>Scratch a top layer off of each pan and still dusty in consistency.</li>
            <li>M6&amp;M7 darker and more for dramatic looks.</li>
            <li>The pigments are less than good, water is needed for it to be dramatic.</li>

            <li> This came 4+ days earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> you need to use a primer with it &amp; the colors are not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I even tried to wet the brush and see if that will have a difference</li>
            <li> and I had to wipe it off, then replace makeup in that area due to it all, but</li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and I applied some color like I typically would.  </li>
            <li> From reviews I saw previously it was hesitant to purchase this palette, but when i swatched it at ultra</li>
            <li> M7 is almost black.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive and I was afraid I would be allergic since there are only a few select brands my eyes can handle.  </li>
            <li> It even came with a small mascara and binder.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time but not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I do not love the brush that came with it.</li>
            <li> Seriously this palette is not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Hard to explain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> But i was not willing to pay $50, then i found it on here for 30!!!!</li>
            <li> I typically use urban decay primer potion as a base</li>
            <li> its a subtle shine.  </li>
            <li> but the glitters are not great.</li>
            <li> the colors also are blochy when I swatched them, they also appear blochy when doing a dramatic look</li>
            <li> I am so upset with how the colors look and the glitters are the worse part of it!</li>
            <li> The one in the sephora store wasn&#x27;t as bad as the one I have.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing :(</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t horrible</li>

            <li> Love this palette! Been wanting it for months and finally ordered it. Love the colors</li>
            <li> Amazing the colors show up so well every single one of them and its not a fake</li>
            <li> Although expensive, it is a very nice collection of colors.  I get alot of compliments when wearing these eyeshadows. Love this product.  Worth every penny.  I would recommend.  It even came with a small mascara and binder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this product. The pigments are less than good, water is needed for it to be dramatic. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great colors. The description on amazon said it came with a bonus mascara, however it is eye primer. I like the kit though and it was cheaper than anywhere else</li>
            <li> Great eyeshadows with nice glimmer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know what to say about it. It was a gift but she seemed pretty happy</li>
            <li> High quality and easy to apply.  Love the sample mascara that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Great colors great products! Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the brush isn&#x27;t very useful. If you have your own brushes it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My sister loves the makeup</li>
            <li> Great find, Ulta didn&#x27;t have it each time I went looking for it.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time but not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this pallette thinking it was going to be awesome and the colors are beautiful but the consistency of the shadows is very poor. I feel like they are very chalky and even with the primer , the shadows do not show up very much at all. I do like a couple of the matte shadows but the glitters are not great. I even tried spraying my brush with toner water tor get more pigment and that hardly did thr trick.  I&#x27;m very surprised with Smashbox with  this pallette.  I&#x27;m glad I did not pay full price! Go with the Naked pallette 1 or 2 or the lorac pro which those shadows go on like butta baby!</li>
            <li> Im not a fan of the way the shimmer shadows go on and blend.. they aren&#x27;t horrible but I&#x27;ve deff. used better.. The Matte ones are great though.</li>
            <li> One of my faves. I do wish they had a bit more pigment in the shadow but overall I am pleased since it has all the colors I use for daily use.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.....</li>
            <li> This came 4+ days earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the haters. This palette is the bomb. Use a primer, wet the brush, tap the color on your lid to build intensity - then you&#x27;re good to go. If you do those simple fundamental things you will not experience the fallout and fade that everyone is whining about. Also love the fact that this ain&#x27;t just a nude/natural palette.  A woman needs to go out on a limb with a navy/plum smokey persona too, and this palette fits the bill. Listen honey, beauty takes patience and effort. Chin up and WERK it!</li>
            <li> These are only $49 on the sephora website. If you want to be ripped off go ahead and purchase it for the $63 amazon is charging. Other than that this is an awesome palette</li>
            <li> you need to use a primer with it &amp; the colors are not very pigmented. the colors also are blochy when I swatched them, they also appear blochy when doing a dramatic look</li>
            <li> I love this pallet !!! it&#x27;s perfect for beginners it has shimmers and matte neutral colors!! it&#x27;s just all around great</li>
            <li> this is very good eyeshadow and the pigment is very good along with the shimmer this is great quality and will buy more when I run low, a must have...</li>
            <li> Bought this as an option for my daughter who loves the urban decay nakeds.  She has said that the palette contains all her favorite colors from all 3 of the naked palettes.  She is usually particular about her makeup, mostly with her eye makeup, and her direct quote about the full exposure mascara was that &amp;#34;it has changed the whole eyelash and mascara game&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it!  My eyes are sensitive and I was afraid I would be allergic since there are only a few select brands my eyes can handle.  I love the choice of colors and the color lasts all day!</li>
            <li> love the service and product</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It just sucks how much it is. It applies amazingly and it last all day long. I wear my favorite three colors with a simple cat eye and I get complemented all day long. So buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. The colors blend so well together to make the perfect smokey eye. I love how for each color there is a matte and a sparkly one. I use this every day for both a natural every day look and for a fancier night look.</li>
            <li> Beautiful eyeshadow kit , has all the colors which I want , 7 shades of matte &amp;  7 shades of glitter , all in one can&#x27;t ask for more ... I recommend it .</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this palette I got initially as a sample.  I have not used the mascara that comes with it so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I do not love the brush that came with it. When trying to apply the shadow the brush basically pushes the shadow over off my eye. Hard to explain but just doesn&#x27;t apply well for me. It gets the shimmer and shadow all over my face. I use an actual eye shadow applicator I got with Mary Kay eye shadow. The shadow seems to stick in my creases, so I also use the LORAC primer under.  Each basic neutral in this palette has a corresponding shimmer neutral. The shimmer doesn&#x27;t seem as glittery as my sample but it still shimmers. I think it&#x27;s the perfect amount of shimmer without being too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; (I am 30 and shouldn&#x27;t be-bop around town with glitter make up)</li>
            <li> I just got the palette from Ulta (it was cheaper there- $49) and I LOVE it! I was thinking about getting the naked palette but liked this one much more. The colors are great for women who want darker neutrals instead of a mix of dark and light. Bottom line is if you&#x27;re thinking about getting a palette this one is great!</li>
            <li> been wanting this palette after i got a sample from sephora.  But i was not willing to pay $50, then i found it on here for 30!!!! I immediately got it.  I love the colors, and they last all day.  Dont be overwhelmed by the sparkly colors either, they dont look like clown makeup haha its a subtle shine.  Also arrived within a week!</li>
            <li> I bought this and returned it as soon as I could.  I am not a picky person when it comes to eye shadows, but I could not justify the price with the amount of color that DIDN&#x27;T show up when I applied this to my eyes.  I typically use urban decay primer potion as a base and I applied some color like I typically would.  Definitely didn&#x27;t feel like there was much color payoff. And to top it off, the colors seemed to fade as the day progressed. Maybe things could&#x27;ve been different if I used a smashbox primer? I don&#x27;t know.  All I do know is a good eyeshadow should be a good, pigmented, long wearing eyeshadow regardless of what primer you use.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this.  If you want a good eyeshadow, stick with urban decay, too faced, or the balm.</li>
            <li> i really only use the light shimmer as highlight and one of the medium brown for the crease....the colors arent great. id reccomend the chocolate bar from too faced.</li>
            <li> best neutral palette i have ever purchased. It has everything for a neutral or dark,smoky eye. I use an angled brush for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color palette! Great color pay off and is a great addition to any makeup collection. It has both neutrals in both shimmer and matte. The brush works much better than I brush I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a palette which is a pleasant surprise :-)</li>
            <li> Seriously this palette is not worth the money! I am so upset with how the colors look and the glitters are the worse part of it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the matte colors which are on the bottom row.  I find they are amazingly pigmented and you do not need to use very much product at all.  I do have a problem with the shimmery colors because they do not apply to the eye very well.  I find I am having to pick up a lot of the product for it to even show up.  I even tried to wet the brush and see if that will have a difference but I didn&#x27;t find that it makes much of a difference.  Overall, I do not think I would purchase this product again but the matte colors are amazing.  Just not amazing enough to make it worth the whole palette.</li>
            <li> If you lost glittery eyeshadows like me, then this product is for you. There is no FINE about it, there are GLITTERS in these eyeshadows which i love. I think the eyeshadows are pigmented and beautiful in texture. From reviews I saw previously it was hesitant to purchase this palette, but when i swatched it at ultra i KNEW i had to have it. If you like glittery shadows that sparkle in the light, get it!!.</li>
            <li> Great neutrals! The shimmery colors (top row) require a bit of building if you want a real glittery look (and even then I&#x27;m not sure you would achieve it), but they&#x27;re perfect if you&#x27;re just looking for a hint of sparkle.</li>
            <li> Chalky, not pigmented. I was disappointed. The one in the sephora store wasn&#x27;t as bad as the one I have. Scratch a top layer off of each pan and still dusty in consistency.</li>
            <li> this is Alana writing this review on Kevins acct. I bought this eyeshadow elsewhere for cheaper and it was my first Smashbox product ever. I really have trouble keeping eyeshadows on my skin I have very oily lids, and expected this to be gone by noon also, but its not.The matte shades are wonderful, have lasting colour and the pigment is true colour on the skin. The shimmery pigments with glitter in it the result looked nice too. You have to use more of the product to get the same pigmented effect from shimmery ones however. I really do not mind having to do so, but if you expect the shimmer ones to go as far they dont.I will stick with the matte shades mostly, which are earthy natural colours and wonderful! It comes with tips on how to best apply for your eye shape which is great. The M1-M5 are perfect. M6&amp;M7 darker and more for dramatic looks. M7 is almost black. S7 goes on looking like a grey shadow full of silver glitter and not for all the time-(even for me&amp; I dress goth), I have tried S1-S4 and they are more mild and the pigment goes on much lesser than the matte ones beneath them but they match together well. Matte stayed on and in place all day for me using a primer under it.Shimmer got glitter onto my face and cheeks after 2-3 hrs. It went to my undereye area and I had to wipe it off, then replace makeup in that area due to it all, but I still loved the colour!It still shows on my lids also, it just spread all over. I use a very light hand with my eye makeup, I think someone who likes things darker will love the matte but be dissappointed in the shimmers. I like both but prefer matte anyway.M3 is wonderful on my pale with olive undertone skin.</li>
            <li> Yes I love the shadows! However mine did NOT come with the mascara! Very disappointing :(</li>
            <li> love it , but needs better colors</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and I love that every shimmer color has a matching matte color. I use the Too Faced Glitter Insurance Glue on my lids before applying the shimmery colors and they look beautiful and last all day. Great buy and the seller shipped it super fast!!!</li>
