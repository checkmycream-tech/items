            <li>This unit seems to be a fluke - I had one exactly like this before, and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>So be sure to moisturize!</li>

            <li>very handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer, but I truly like the tweezers with light that came with it.  </li>
            <li>I use it for nose hair primarily and it works great.</li>
            <li>The tweezers with the light is great.</li>
            <li>The enlarging mirror is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The unit doesn&#x27;t trim effectively for longer than 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Its nice.</li>
            <li>Every women and man should own one of these.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut any kind of hair.</li>
            <li>I own another brand trimmer and decided to buy this one for the wife because of the color.</li>
            <li>I love the lighted tweezers and the tweezers of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the color was a great selling point, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>eyebrow trimming tool is nice.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the lighted tweezers came with so that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Nice product&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li>I do, however, liked that it came with tweezers.</li>
            <li>bonus lighted tweezers with mirror are nice too.</li>
            <li>I really liked the lighted tweezers that came with it.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;luxury tweezers&amp;#34; was a really nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and even came with free tweezers with a light.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s compact and discrete, it kind of looks like a pen when the cap is</li>
            <li>It is effective, but I am klutzy and prefer waxing at the salon.</li>
            <li>Gets all those hairs and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Pretty good razor!</li>
            <li>I think that is pretty good for the price!  </li>
            <li>There are some tools in the box that help me get my desired trimming outcome, and I also love the tweezers with the LED for better view!</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>It was on clearance and there were so many of them</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite of the 5 I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li>i love this.i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>but I thought it would trim more efficient.</li>
            <li>It is much better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love em&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer it is perfect for bikini area - razor always left me with razor burn</li>
            <li>It grabs at your hairs and leaves rashes instead of a nice clean trim...</li>
            <li>Nice smooth easy to use appliance.</li>
            <li>TRIM VERY CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and my hair is also very fair and thin.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is just right for a quick fix and great for travel.</li>
            <li>I never get irritated from it, it handles coarse and fine hair, is perfectly sized for the nose/eyebrow area and can go into the shower.</li>
            <li>easy to use and does a fabulous job!  </li>
            <li>I love that this is battery operated, because I can just throw in a rechargeable battery quite easily.</li>
            <li>This is a nice quick and handy piece to have for a quick groom between waxing.</li>
            <li>No only does the trimmer work wonderfully, it comes with lighted tweezers that are fabulous.</li>
            <li>So easy and quick, too, and the attachments and lighted tweezers are a nice bonus, as well.</li>
            <li>right when i need it the most!</li>
            <li>So far it works great and has not fallen apart.</li>
            <li>This one so far works great.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the fact that it comes with an additional tweezer with a light.</li>
            <li>So far this trimmer has been great.</li>
            <li>Works well, I just use it to trim the stray hairs, and, it really does a good job.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and so far it does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>It does a much better job more quickly</li>
            <li>It works well and is easily stored and operated.  </li>
            <li>This is realyl easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found the packaging to be incredibly easy to get into and have used it for storing all the pieces.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.. easy to carry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and also bought another as a gift.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use on eyesbrows too,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li>so it is easy to use around the nose and lips.  </li>
            <li>and now it is so easy and never leaves any marks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so versatile and strong -</li>
            <li>strong product.</li>
            <li>Does not come with batteries, which is fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me.</li>
            <li>It works well on trimming fine hair and saves me a trip to get threading or waxing done.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>but it  works fine</li>
            <li>Quick shipment also!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect for that little lady stash that I am now growing..</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean and light weight.</li>
            <li>products with cheap cases like this tend to let water inside when used in the shower and then battery corrosion and rust stains become a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great for facial hair on women</li>
            <li>The light up tweezer is a bonus item.</li>
            <li>I have light hair</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great value at $15.</li>
            <li>If I want a totally smooth I also use a electric razor with baby powder.</li>
            <li>It does the job and leaves the skin hairless and smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>This goes into your mu bag, it&#x27;s light as a feather.</li>
            <li>Nice price and very well made product.</li>
            <li>It did not give a smooth  trim.</li>
            <li>Last year they were a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>I just wanted a newer one, but couldn&#x27;t find one available.  </li>
            <li>The bonus tweezers with the light didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li>Wish someone could attach my Revlon tweezers to the light.</li>
            <li>Does what it should do and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Works great, and comes with multiple accessories.</li>
            <li>I think that this is a great trimmer, and it definitely serves all of my trimming needs.</li>
            <li>Uses a AAA battery for the trimmer and a watch battery (included) for the light on the tweezers.</li>
            <li>NOT only is the color a great pick me up and screams girly</li>
            <li>Also there is some whirring sound when we use it on the skin.</li>
            <li>Works great, the extra pieces are sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or weak.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This trimmer comes with a head attachment for length trimming, and an additional set of tweezers that light up.</li>
            <li>It was the most powerful precision trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>And I like the eyebrow trimming head, integrated light, mirror, and adjustable trimming comb as bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade can be removed and replaced but one would have to get a blade that size to fit  the trimmer.</li>
            <li>It comes with a pair of tweezers with a led light.</li>
            <li>i bought a couple to see if they fit.</li>
            <li>It did not pinch or pull my skin and was easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I had another trimmer before this that had a light on it.</li>
            <li>I made sure to clean it well after every use, but it seemed like the blades dulled quickly.</li>
            <li>:) comes with good accessories, one can use this product daily.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and the pink color is great!</li>
            <li>Ordered this to help tame my eyebrows and it works great!</li>
            <li>Trim it first though or it WILL pull and OUCH!!</li>
            <li>Cute color, and pretty easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>It is pink, pretty and works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely painless and I love the easy covenient size!</li>
            <li>This is a super trimmer, but honestly I would have paid this much just for the bonus tweezers that come with it.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, clean and works super well.</li>
            <li>Still in her original box</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>I love these kind of trimmers but have never found a brand that holds up to multiple uses.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts longer and is also easier to clean than the Finishing Touch.  </li>
            <li>This is for emergency clean up.</li>
            <li>They were right!  </li>
            <li>but I soon realized it works great on the face but not really anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I had intended to use this mostly on my bikini region, but this razor really struggles to trim anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is so good that I bought this one as a replacement for the one I am using at present.  </li>
            <li>A good temporary hair remover for those days and times where you just don&#x27;t have the means or energy to deal with facial hair!  </li>
            <li>I have had a ton of trimmers and electric shavers at one time or another, when my old one died I bought this one because I liked the color</li>
            <li>The only redeeming thing about this is the eyebrow tweezers with the light attached to it which I love.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a full grown man mustache</li>
            <li>Overall good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I would advise reading the instructions to get the full benefits.</li>
            <li>.....worth the price and seems to be very sturdy and well made :)</li>
            <li>I found this product to be superior to others of the same ilk I have purchased at the drugstore over the years.</li>
            <li>This one is better quality and works really well.</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s good on the bikini area, but it definitely is not.</li>
            <li>I am delighted that it stays sharp and cuts clean!</li>
            <li>This very small size is perfect to get around your eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair on my body which I was using this for.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best for smaller areas like facial hair</li>
            <li>but it works for quick touch ups on the bikini area.</li>
            <li>It is quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do as quick of a shave as I&#x27;d like on the eye brows</li>
            <li>It gets maybe one hair in each sweep, if you&#x27;re lucky.  </li>
            <li>A stray here and there are quickly taken care of and the attachments make shaping/grooming of the eyebrows a cinch.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with paying double the money to get a product that will last more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>Extremely functional, good looking, portable, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>This has a much sturdier feel than similar products (i.e., Finishing Touch or Revlon trimmers), and so far has worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Works great, have snagged hair but because I was using it the moving side down</li>
            <li>The light is great, but the tweezers themselves didn&#x27;t grasp any of the hairs, so for me it was pointless.</li>
            <li>Works, was a great replacement for my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>Probably because it was a pretty purple!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, does exactly what it needs to do, and the tweezers with the precision light that come with it were a great little bonus.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are magic - more effective than any other type I&#x27;ve used and especially so with the light.  </li>
            <li>The second time I was able to take 2 strokes without pain and then it happened!  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better would be a carrying case but a ziploc does the trick!</li>
            <li>For the price this little trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little bright light between the tweezers that highlights the area you&#x27;re plucking.  </li>
            <li>It works great for your mustache, eyebrows and any other hair on face!!</li>
            <li>This product is cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t really cut the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Precise bikini shaping and gentle bikini</li>
            <li>It comes with an attachment that makes the blade smaller for more precise eyebrow shaping too.</li>
            <li>For the money it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I purchased my husband a trimmer kind of like this from Ross and it worked so well on his coarse beard</li>
            <li>It is powerful and does the job well.  </li>
            <li>it is not even worth one star.</li>
            <li>It does come with lighted tweezers that are pretty cool, but that is not what I was purchasing.</li>
            <li>I have had several as I do my own eyebrows and use for that missed spot when I shave.  </li>
            <li>But this is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>#34;full power&amp;#34;, even with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li>but it is worth having in your arsenal.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful for its size and works very well.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect trimmer for eyebrows or other facial hair.  </li>
            <li>But that is fine as long as it is portable and does the job :)</li>
            <li>It is a good size and can be used for other grooming as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this due to the good reviews,however the plastic end holding the razor broke into 2 pieces within a month of using it.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this  bit it will be ok for what it is needed for  simple and convenient is about itok</li>
            <li>It looks nice,it has the right size and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right up until it falls apart in your hand.</li>
            <li>The price was right for the job it does</li>
            <li>Panasonic trimmers are sharp, yet gentle and very effective..</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used before, plus I love the eyebrow guide attachment and handy little brush to clean out after using.</li>
            <li>Lol, I&#x27;m not really sure how to rate this otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Works great ~ small end on it, which  is what I needed.</li>
            <li>Great for bikini trimming and small areas.</li>
            <li>I imagine this little trimmer will wear out pretty quick, but for the price, it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and last longer using battery and worth to buy it, u can use it in many different purposes( euebrow, sideburn, etc about grooming)</li>
            <li>/&gt;*only needs 1 AAA battery (i use rechargeable sanyo eneloop)&lt;br /&gt;*Free smart Tweezers with light making it very useful&lt;</li>
            <li>This little machine is cheap, and effective.  </li>
            <li>This little machine is cheap, and effective.</li>
            <li>The added bonus was the tweezer with the light and a nice little case to keep it in.  </li>
            <li>There is a light, a tweezer, and a mirror  in a separate case which is good for plucking hard to trim hairs.</li>
            <li>It also came with lighted tweezers, which I&#x27;m not especially interested in but was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap plastic and underpowered to really do any real trimming.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow trimmer is a waste but the actual razor works great!</li>
            <li>the free tweezer with light is a piece of junk as it doesn&#x27;t actually pluck anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product including shipping was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a fine job , doesn&#x27;t pinch and comes complete except for the AAA battery</li>
            <li>and it works good, for some reason I thought the trimmer head was going to be a little longer.</li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as my older one, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>Use this for wispy fine hairs or touching up \\&quot;down there.\\</li>
            <li>Although more solid than similar trimmers, it is easier to hold and operate and much more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Would have given higher star rating, but product did not come with tweezers as advertised though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s okay, better use for smaller areas.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE TV PRODUCT WHICH COSTS ALMOST THE SAME.</li>
            <li>I decided to search Amazon for a pretty, feminine looking one.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more so that I have a back up.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Great for delicate areas.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li>&amp; IT&#x27;S PRETTY TOO.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a lot though.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be built well and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>and I just got it and used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>First 5-star review</li>
            <li>Had this and used regularly over a year and still works fantastic!</li>
            <li>I find this trimmer OK, but I think it &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; more than others I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>very girlie girl!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this trimmer to any of my friends and I am glad it was only 10.00.</li>
            <li>For those who are looking to do a bikini trim and who are having issues with pain, pulling, etc., douse your skin in a bit of baby powder first.</li>
            <li>When it came time for the second use, it magically lost 90% of its power (to the point where its pulling the hairs).</li>
            <li>This trimmer does the job, however after the second use the top part of the trimmer needs to be held together</li>
            <li>After purchasing numerous trimmers in the past, this one works the best.  </li>
            <li>It broke after the first week.</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li>So I bought this because my $75 one I bought off of another site died on me (it wasn&#x27;t the first one to do so)</li>
            <li>The delivery was on time and packaged very well!</li>
            <li>It also does a better job in removing the hair from my face and upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First I grabbed it without even looking at the features.</li>
            <li>It works really well when it comes to trim my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>The last one I had was a guys one, and I should&#x27;ve gone for a guys one again as their stuff always works significantly better than products for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this unit to keep myself &amp;#34;maintained&amp;#34; without having to go through the pain or expense of more costly permanent methods of facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product when in a hurry and need a quick maintenance.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and my facial hair is light and fine.  </li>
            <li>This slender trimmer is perfect for shaving those delicate, private areas.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, it does a good job on the little areas!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this little gem.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and shaves very well</li>
            <li>its pretty much like a razor.</li>
            <li>You can use it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe other people werent using it right, and that I knew better.  </li>
            <li>hair grows back in 2 days again.&lt;br /&gt;small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>Largely ineffectual.</li>
            <li>I’d only get this if you’re planning on just trimming fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Bought this on sale at Target.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different ways of getting rid of those pesky fine hairs...waxing, bleaching, &amp; threading which needs to be done often.</li>
            <li>I have had other trimmers in the past, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>short, works fine for face.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my fine upper lip hair.</li>
            <li>Can be used on fine facial hair without irritation.</li>
            <li>I did however really like the \\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li>Amazing little trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The little brush was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The attachements didn&#x27;t really work and even without them it didn&#x27;t really cut any hair very well.</li>
            <li>I have blonde fuzz that shines in the sun but doesn&#x27;t really show in indoor light.  </li>
            <li>Also its LED lighted which makes it so much easier to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li>This razor removes excess chin/facial hair very well.  </li>
            <li>it does have extra stuff like tweezers with light and all.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li>Works very well for the price.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a two hundred dollar trimmer, but it works very well for the cost.</li>
            <li>and I shouldn&#x27;t really complain,</li>
            <li>Maybe she&#x27;s using too much pressure?  </li>
            <li>It trims very well, no snags or pulling.</li>
            <li>Note, that this product it only trims, it does not shave smooth.</li>
            <li>I expected a bit more from a Phillips which is why I selected this one.  </li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>The real selling point with this package is the tweezer.</li>
            <li>I tried to use this for my eyebrows even without the guard and it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this one</li>
            <li>It was what I wanted and performed very well.  </li>
            <li>but it really dosen&#x27;t function too well in that region.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use any attachments, except the trimming comb, but it works well.</li>
            <li>The add-ons of eyebrow comb attachments and tweezers with light are a second bonus for precision trimming.</li>
            <li>so i can carry it around, and really practical to use</li>
            <li>This trimmer comes with an adjustable guide and lighted tweezers which are very helpful.</li>
            <li>I find this to get close, but not irritating on the face.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it literally does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really notice it.  </li>
            <li>I like the tweezers that come it it very well</li>
            <li>But finally this seemed to fit the bill and my needs when I found it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer is much nicer than those trimmers that you find at Wal-Mart or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Never tried it but very neat and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to do it very often.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li>When we used it, the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t cut hair very well.  </li>
            <li>We had to run it over and over again to cut it, but even then it didn&#x27;t really cut it very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>But that was really it.</li>
            <li>and it was much cheaper than I paid for one from QVC.</li>
            <li>This little thing is good for quick, minor uses.</li>
            <li>The plain trimming head is great for trimming short hairs/peach fuzz on your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very powerful and acutually does trim facial</li>
            <li>no pain, works perfectly, easy to use, small and light</li>
            <li>I have bought other products locally but this one is superior in quality.</li>
            <li>Works great for occasional use, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for a long amount of time.</li>
            <li>I just received this the other day and have found that this is infinitely better than the Finishing Touch.  </li>
            <li>This one works better than the other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li>I have bought so many other brands</li>
            <li>Philips great quality is present in this small article.  </li>
            <li>or it dulls quickly, i like that it has many attachments for different results</li>
            <li>Nice little bonus!</li>
            <li>The battery casing does come loose from time to time but it can be easily tightened with a screwdriver.</li>
            <li>The price was good and delivery fast but didn&#x27;t find it to be better or worse than any of the other trimmers.</li>
            <li>It is addicting for me to just trim my eyebrows down because I love how they come out with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out, I have saved money (and skin) by being able to trim my circus show beard down to nothing.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers are super &amp;#34;fine-tipped?&amp;#34; at the ends which make it easy to grab small hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It had only been a couple of weeks since I last treated that area, so the hair was not terribly overgrown.</li>
            <li>The blades keep falling off the main trimmer head.</li>
            <li>So quick and simple to use.</li>
            <li>getting older does have its quirks</li>
            <li>It works ok, but you have to pass it over the same skin several times to get all the hairs trimmed.  </li>
            <li>This is priced decent and it works well for what its made</li>
            <li>I have the older version of this, in the silver/gray color.</li>
            <li>decent product for the money.</li>
            <li>The color is stunning and does not look obvious that it is a facial trimmer at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face and legs mainly.</li>
            <li>i thought it would be a good bikini trimmer, but it&#x27;s way too small to do much more than eyebrows, and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem sharp enough.</li>
            <li>The blade is my main issue because of its ragged edge, which has the tendency to pull the hair rather than a clean shave if used without  the  detachable head for long hairs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this trimmer for all your needs.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it was high hopes</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to women with unwanted hair in unwanted areas.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used three different brand new batteries (from different packages) in it, to be sure it&#x27;s not a problem with the battery.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the tweezers that come with it are pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Finishing Touch in the past, but I found this trimmer very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product is a little better quality than the one that was sold on tv and in stores, but if you are trying to trim anything but \\&quot;peach</li>
            <li>A little more substantial than the ones you buy in bed bath</li>
            <li>I am glad to have the little trimmer to use around my face.</li>
            <li>It was way better than I ever could have expected and works like a charm!!!</li>
            <li>To use, just have clean, dry skin, apply some powder (I use baby powder) and use this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t even powerful enough to trim my sideburns.</li>
            <li>This trimmer cost a few dollars more than a $6 trimmer I bought at the grocery store and it pulls on my face hair when I use it.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and it seems fragile, but my first one lasted me about a year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>time using a product like this, normally used scissors.&lt;br /&gt;fits</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s strong enough to get rid of my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Will let you know once I open it, if this is the right one or not.</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde facial hair along my jawline.  </li>
            <li>I had bought three of those in the past, and have found already that this is much better quality and gets a much closer and complete shave than the Finishing Touch.  </li>
            <li>When trimming, it&#x27;s not as smooth as the other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>When trimming, It&#x27;s not as smooth as the other trimmers and pulls hair.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are a nice little extra as well.</li>
            <li>Even with a brand new battery installed, this trimmer works as if the battery is dying.  </li>
            <li>You basically need a new battery each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>Oh, it was also a brand new battery I was using.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of years I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old electric razor that I&#x27;d enjoyed for a few years now.</li>
            <li>Though $14 is not much in the scheme of things I&#x27;ve had cheaper ones that work the same or better.  </li>
            <li>I love this little hair remover!</li>
            <li>For me, it caused no irritation, but I could see someone with very sensitive skin getting some redness or irritation after use.</li>
            <li>It works great for thick hair but not for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>If you can afford better, go for higher quality, but this is decent for a poor grad student like me.</li>
            <li>Wise up and make a quality precision trimmer like that for women that doesn&#x27;t use a silly AA battery and is strong enough to actually trim hairs instead of just tugging on them.</li>
            <li>Pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>So I opted for this trimmer and the first time I touched it to my upper lip area</li>
            <li>I have used two other trimmers prior to this one and this one is just okay.</li>
            <li>You cannot use it to actually make an area better, even if it is the tiny upper lip area.  </li>
            <li>Great little personal shaver for the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; hair that began popping up on my upper lip and cheeks in middle age.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mainly to trim the bikini area, but it works for eyebrows, facial hair, any unwanted hair really.</li>
            <li>Precise and sharp!  </li>
            <li>I really like this one better, it&#x27;s well made, slightly heaver then other ones I&#x27;ve used, and the blades work really well with no nipping or tugging.</li>
            <li>My eye brow hairs are pretty long and it trimmed it to the right spot where it&#x27;s not too long or too short.&lt;br /&gt;Mustache:</li>
            <li>I usually need to replace other brands about once a year; I suspect this one will outlast that by a good stretch.</li>
            <li>Has a little light.</li>
            <li>Even still, it chugged and slowed and nearly stopped working completely</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with rash or irritation.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer bot the dust</li>
            <li>Not the peach fuzz on my arm (which I&#x27;ve never cut before) to more delicate areas like my bikini line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok when it&#x27;s working well, but it sucks batteries up.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really gentle and quiet.</li>
            <li>This cut my skin and though my skin might be sensitive, I&#x27;ve used the cheaper drugstore trimmer and not had a problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I have been alive without it</li>
            <li>I have several trimmers, but really didn&#x27;t care for any of them, except for Emjoy which they don&#x27;t make anymore.  </li>
            <li>I wanted another one in case my old one breaks.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several trimmers and this one is by far the least effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the accessories very often, and I only use it on my face</li>
            <li>only downside to this kit is the tweezers really.</li>
            <li>Corded items are a hassle if you&#x27;re nowhere near a plug in, so this trimmer is quite portable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is how a trimmer is supposed to work - pretty powerful little trimmer that easily trims down to the skin, and lasts a LONG time (been using mine for two years now).</li>
            <li>It gets right down to almost bare skin and doesn&#x27;t clog up or stop working at any point because of too much hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is just that the blades aren&#x27;t super sharp, but I found myself going over and over the fine hairs on my face to get the hair-free look</li>
            <li>It easily gets at those small, but noticeable hairs between my eyebrows and at the corners of my lips.</li>
            <li>It just leaves behind several of the coarse hairs, it does fine on light soft hair though.</li>
            <li>You do get stubble after a few days as if you used a regular razor, but, again, my facial hair is very fine</li>
            <li>This shaver /trimmer works fine, however it is rather small.</li>
            <li>Most of the ones out there are too big for a small nose.</li>
            <li>Attachments for hair trimming (like for eyebrows) were a little less amazing than i anticipated</li>
            <li>Not a bad little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this personal trimmer.</li>
            <li>This got such a high rating and that was why I bought it,  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works better than most and I have had dozens of these that are so cheaply made they end up being worthless after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but this super little trimmer is really outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Not as smooth on the face as a previous brand I used,kind of a scratchy feeling,probably will be looking for a different brand</li>
            <li>Not sure if my hair is just too thick, but this hasn’t been very effective.</li>
            <li>I have to turn it on and off a few times before it&#x27;s humming away at full speed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is better to use the trimmer attachment to a men&#x27;s norelco shaver, but it is harder to control in tight regions.  </li>
            <li>but the blade becomes dull very quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty disappointed in that, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>the other one I had wasn&#x27;t this brand this one is better but the other on lasted for several years so we will see it this on holds up .</li>
            <li>I have owned other little trimmers that have worked better.  </li>
            <li>This is not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li>Well made, small enough to maneuver easily.</li>
            <li>Received this to replace an older one (different brand) that finally just wouldn&#x27;t work anymore (had it for 6 years).  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting such a high quality product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>For all these bad reviewers.. you must have excessive hair because this clearly is for basic trimming and I&#x27;m able to trim any facial hair very easily!</li>
            <li>no regrets here.</li>
            <li>It barely picked up peach fuzz</li>
            <li>She has no complaints when using the guards or using it without a guard on her bare skin.</li>
            <li>It barely removes any hair.</li>
            <li>I actually have terribly sensitive skin and this trimmer doesn&#x27;t irritate it in the slightest.</li>
            <li>It worked, but was not very sharp and would catch on my hair and hurt.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to other trimmers similar - not to mention any names - I would say to spend a little more money and get this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In regard to the similar product, it is not near as powerful and does not last too long before it dies and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li>It lasts a LONG time as far as the blade goes!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good option for any one like me who hate wasting too much time on eyebrow.</li>
            <li>I had a generic simple inexpensive model the first time that lasted me a long ,long time.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to see stray hairs as I pluck my eyebrows and to remove those black hairs that crop up on my chin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product twice because it worked so well the first few times but the same thing happened with both purchases</li>
            <li>Poor quality and barely works on fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li>As little as I need it, it should last my much longer than that.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I thought it would be a good fit since it came from a good brand and was a good price.</li>
            <li> This unit seems to be a fluke - I had one exactly like this before, and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> So be sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li> This is truly my favorite way!</li>

            <li> very handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, but I truly like the tweezers with light that came with it.  </li>
            <li> I use it for nose hair primarily and it works great.</li>
            <li> The tweezers with the light is great.</li>
            <li> The enlarging mirror is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The unit doesn&#x27;t trim effectively for longer than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Its nice.</li>
            <li> Every women and man should own one of these.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut any kind of hair.</li>
            <li> I own another brand trimmer and decided to buy this one for the wife because of the color.</li>
            <li> I love the lighted tweezers and the tweezers of good quality.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, the color was a great selling point, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> eyebrow trimming tool is nice.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the lighted tweezers came with so that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Nice product&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>

            <li> that it&#x27;s compact and discrete, it kind of looks like a pen when the cap is</li>
            <li> It is effective, but I am klutzy and prefer waxing at the salon.</li>
            <li> Gets all those hairs and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Pretty good razor!</li>
            <li> I think that is pretty good for the price!  </li>

            <li> It works well on trimming fine hair and saves me a trip to get threading or waxing done.</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> but it  works fine</li>
            <li> Quick shipment also!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for that little lady stash that I am now growing..</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean and light weight.</li>
            <li> products with cheap cases like this tend to let water inside when used in the shower and then battery corrosion and rust stains become a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great for facial hair on women</li>
            <li> The light up tweezer is a bonus item.</li>
            <li> I have light hair</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great value at $15.</li>
            <li> If I want a totally smooth I also use a electric razor with baby powder.</li>
            <li> It does the job and leaves the skin hairless and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> This goes into your mu bag, it&#x27;s light as a feather.</li>
            <li> Nice price and very well made product.</li>
            <li> It did not give a smooth  trim.</li>
            <li> Last year they were a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a newer one, but couldn&#x27;t find one available.  </li>
            <li> The bonus tweezers with the light didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> Wish someone could attach my Revlon tweezers to the light.</li>
            <li> Does what it should do and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Works great, and comes with multiple accessories.</li>
            <li> I think that this is a great trimmer, and it definitely serves all of my trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Uses a AAA battery for the trimmer and a watch battery (included) for the light on the tweezers.</li>
            <li> NOT only is the color a great pick me up and screams girly</li>
            <li> Also there is some whirring sound when we use it on the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great, the extra pieces are sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or weak.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This trimmer comes with a head attachment for length trimming, and an additional set of tweezers that light up.</li>
            <li> It was the most powerful precision trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> And I like the eyebrow trimming head, integrated light, mirror, and adjustable trimming comb as bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade can be removed and replaced but one would have to get a blade that size to fit  the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It comes with a pair of tweezers with a led light.</li>
            <li> i bought a couple to see if they fit.</li>
            <li> It did not pinch or pull my skin and was easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer before this that had a light on it.</li>
            <li> I made sure to clean it well after every use, but it seemed like the blades dulled quickly.</li>
            <li> :) comes with good accessories, one can use this product daily.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and the pink color is great!</li>
            <li> Ordered this to help tame my eyebrows and it works great!</li>
            <li> Trim it first though or it WILL pull and OUCH!!</li>
            <li> Cute color, and pretty easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> It is pink, pretty and works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely painless and I love the easy covenient size!</li>
            <li> This is a super trimmer, but honestly I would have paid this much just for the bonus tweezers that come with it.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, clean and works super well.</li>
            <li> Still in her original box</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> I love these kind of trimmers but have never found a brand that holds up to multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts longer and is also easier to clean than the Finishing Touch.  </li>
            <li> This is for emergency clean up.</li>
            <li> They were right!  </li>
            <li> but I soon realized it works great on the face but not really anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I had intended to use this mostly on my bikini region, but this razor really struggles to trim anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is so good that I bought this one as a replacement for the one I am using at present.  </li>
            <li> A good temporary hair remover for those days and times where you just don&#x27;t have the means or energy to deal with facial hair!  </li>
            <li> I have had a ton of trimmers and electric shavers at one time or another, when my old one died I bought this one because I liked the color</li>
            <li> The only redeeming thing about this is the eyebrow tweezers with the light attached to it which I love.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a full grown man mustache</li>
            <li> Overall good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I would advise reading the instructions to get the full benefits.</li>
            <li> .....worth the price and seems to be very sturdy and well made :)</li>
            <li> I found this product to be superior to others of the same ilk I have purchased at the drugstore over the years.</li>
            <li> This one is better quality and works really well.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s good on the bikini area, but it definitely is not.</li>
            <li> I am delighted that it stays sharp and cuts clean!</li>
            <li> This very small size is perfect to get around your eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine hair on my body which I was using this for.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best for smaller areas like facial hair</li>
            <li> but it works for quick touch ups on the bikini area.</li>
            <li> It is quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do as quick of a shave as I&#x27;d like on the eye brows</li>
            <li> It gets maybe one hair in each sweep, if you&#x27;re lucky.  </li>
            <li> A stray here and there are quickly taken care of and the attachments make shaping/grooming of the eyebrows a cinch.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with paying double the money to get a product that will last more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Extremely functional, good looking, portable, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> This has a much sturdier feel than similar products (i.e., Finishing Touch or Revlon trimmers), and so far has worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Works great, have snagged hair but because I was using it the moving side down</li>
            <li> The light is great, but the tweezers themselves didn&#x27;t grasp any of the hairs, so for me it was pointless.</li>
            <li> Works, was a great replacement for my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> Probably because it was a pretty purple!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, does exactly what it needs to do, and the tweezers with the precision light that come with it were a great little bonus.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are magic - more effective than any other type I&#x27;ve used and especially so with the light.  </li>
            <li> The second time I was able to take 2 strokes without pain and then it happened!  </li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better would be a carrying case but a ziploc does the trick!</li>
            <li> For the price this little trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little bright light between the tweezers that highlights the area you&#x27;re plucking.  </li>
            <li> It works great for your mustache, eyebrows and any other hair on face!!</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t really cut the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Precise bikini shaping and gentle bikini</li>
            <li> It comes with an attachment that makes the blade smaller for more precise eyebrow shaping too.</li>
            <li> For the money it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased my husband a trimmer kind of like this from Ross and it worked so well on his coarse beard</li>
            <li> It is powerful and does the job well.  </li>
            <li> it is not even worth one star.</li>
            <li> It does come with lighted tweezers that are pretty cool, but that is not what I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have had several as I do my own eyebrows and use for that missed spot when I shave.  </li>
            <li> But this is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;full power&amp;#34;, even with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> but it is worth having in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful for its size and works very well.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect trimmer for eyebrows or other facial hair.  </li>
            <li> But that is fine as long as it is portable and does the job :)</li>
            <li> It is a good size and can be used for other grooming as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the good reviews,however the plastic end holding the razor broke into 2 pieces within a month of using it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this  bit it will be ok for what it is needed for  simple and convenient is about itok</li>
            <li> It looks nice,it has the right size and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> right up until it falls apart in your hand.</li>
            <li> The price was right for the job it does</li>
            <li> Panasonic trimmers are sharp, yet gentle and very effective..</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used before, plus I love the eyebrow guide attachment and handy little brush to clean out after using.</li>
            <li> Lol, I&#x27;m not really sure how to rate this otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Works great ~ small end on it, which  is what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great for bikini trimming and small areas.</li>
            <li> I imagine this little trimmer will wear out pretty quick, but for the price, it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and last longer using battery and worth to buy it, u can use it in many different purposes( euebrow, sideburn, etc about grooming)</li>
            <li> /&gt;*only needs 1 AAA battery (i use rechargeable sanyo eneloop)&lt;br /&gt;*Free smart Tweezers with light making it very useful&lt;</li>
            <li> This little machine is cheap, and effective.  </li>
            <li> This little machine is cheap, and effective.</li>
            <li> The added bonus was the tweezer with the light and a nice little case to keep it in.  </li>
            <li> There is a light, a tweezer, and a mirror  in a separate case which is good for plucking hard to trim hairs.</li>
            <li> It also came with lighted tweezers, which I&#x27;m not especially interested in but was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap plastic and underpowered to really do any real trimming.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow trimmer is a waste but the actual razor works great!</li>
            <li> the free tweezer with light is a piece of junk as it doesn&#x27;t actually pluck anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product including shipping was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a fine job , doesn&#x27;t pinch and comes complete except for the AAA battery</li>
            <li> and it works good, for some reason I thought the trimmer head was going to be a little longer.</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as my older one, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Use this for wispy fine hairs or touching up \\&quot;down there.\\</li>
            <li> Although more solid than similar trimmers, it is easier to hold and operate and much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Would have given higher star rating, but product did not come with tweezers as advertised though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s okay, better use for smaller areas.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE TV PRODUCT WHICH COSTS ALMOST THE SAME.</li>
            <li> I decided to search Amazon for a pretty, feminine looking one.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more so that I have a back up.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Great for delicate areas.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> &amp; IT&#x27;S PRETTY TOO.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a lot though.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be built well and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> and I just got it and used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> First 5-star review</li>
            <li> Had this and used regularly over a year and still works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I find this trimmer OK, but I think it &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; more than others I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> very girlie girl!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this trimmer to any of my friends and I am glad it was only 10.00.</li>
            <li> For those who are looking to do a bikini trim and who are having issues with pain, pulling, etc., douse your skin in a bit of baby powder first.</li>
            <li> When it came time for the second use, it magically lost 90% of its power (to the point where its pulling the hairs).</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the job, however after the second use the top part of the trimmer needs to be held together</li>
            <li> After purchasing numerous trimmers in the past, this one works the best.  </li>
            <li> It broke after the first week.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li> So I bought this because my $75 one I bought off of another site died on me (it wasn&#x27;t the first one to do so)</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time and packaged very well!</li>
            <li> It also does a better job in removing the hair from my face and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First I grabbed it without even looking at the features.</li>
            <li> It works really well when it comes to trim my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> The last one I had was a guys one, and I should&#x27;ve gone for a guys one again as their stuff always works significantly better than products for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this unit to keep myself &amp;#34;maintained&amp;#34; without having to go through the pain or expense of more costly permanent methods of facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product when in a hurry and need a quick maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my facial hair is light and fine.  </li>
            <li> This slender trimmer is perfect for shaving those delicate, private areas.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, it does a good job on the little areas!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this little gem.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and shaves very well</li>
            <li> its pretty much like a razor.</li>
            <li> You can use it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe other people werent using it right, and that I knew better.  </li>
            <li> hair grows back in 2 days again.&lt;br /&gt;small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Largely ineffectual.</li>
            <li> I’d only get this if you’re planning on just trimming fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Bought this on sale at Target.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different ways of getting rid of those pesky fine hairs...waxing, bleaching, &amp; threading which needs to be done often.</li>
            <li> I have had other trimmers in the past, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li> short, works fine for face.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my fine upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> Can be used on fine facial hair without irritation.</li>
            <li> I did however really like the \\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li> Amazing little trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The little brush was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The attachements didn&#x27;t really work and even without them it didn&#x27;t really cut any hair very well.</li>
            <li> I have blonde fuzz that shines in the sun but doesn&#x27;t really show in indoor light.  </li>
            <li> Also its LED lighted which makes it so much easier to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> This razor removes excess chin/facial hair very well.  </li>
            <li> it does have extra stuff like tweezers with light and all.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li> Works very well for the price.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a two hundred dollar trimmer, but it works very well for the cost.</li>
            <li> and I shouldn&#x27;t really complain,</li>
            <li> Maybe she&#x27;s using too much pressure?  </li>
            <li> It trims very well, no snags or pulling.</li>
            <li> Note, that this product it only trims, it does not shave smooth.</li>
            <li> I expected a bit more from a Phillips which is why I selected this one.  </li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> The real selling point with this package is the tweezer.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this for my eyebrows even without the guard and it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this one</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted and performed very well.  </li>
            <li> but it really dosen&#x27;t function too well in that region.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use any attachments, except the trimming comb, but it works well.</li>
            <li> The add-ons of eyebrow comb attachments and tweezers with light are a second bonus for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> so i can carry it around, and really practical to use</li>
            <li> This trimmer comes with an adjustable guide and lighted tweezers which are very helpful.</li>
            <li> I find this to get close, but not irritating on the face.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it literally does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really notice it.  </li>
            <li> I like the tweezers that come it it very well</li>
            <li> But finally this seemed to fit the bill and my needs when I found it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much nicer than those trimmers that you find at Wal-Mart or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Never tried it but very neat and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to do it very often.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li> When we used it, the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t cut hair very well.  </li>
            <li> We had to run it over and over again to cut it, but even then it didn&#x27;t really cut it very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> But that was really it.</li>
            <li> and it was much cheaper than I paid for one from QVC.</li>
            <li> This little thing is good for quick, minor uses.</li>
            <li> The plain trimming head is great for trimming short hairs/peach fuzz on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very powerful and acutually does trim facial</li>
            <li> no pain, works perfectly, easy to use, small and light</li>
            <li> I have bought other products locally but this one is superior in quality.</li>
            <li> Works great for occasional use, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for a long amount of time.</li>
            <li> I just received this the other day and have found that this is infinitely better than the Finishing Touch.  </li>
            <li> This one works better than the other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have bought so many other brands</li>
            <li> Philips great quality is present in this small article.  </li>
            <li> or it dulls quickly, i like that it has many attachments for different results</li>
            <li> Nice little bonus!</li>
            <li> The battery casing does come loose from time to time but it can be easily tightened with a screwdriver.</li>
            <li> The price was good and delivery fast but didn&#x27;t find it to be better or worse than any of the other trimmers.</li>
            <li> It is addicting for me to just trim my eyebrows down because I love how they come out with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out, I have saved money (and skin) by being able to trim my circus show beard down to nothing.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are super &amp;#34;fine-tipped?&amp;#34; at the ends which make it easy to grab small hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It had only been a couple of weeks since I last treated that area, so the hair was not terribly overgrown.</li>
            <li> The blades keep falling off the main trimmer head.</li>
            <li> So quick and simple to use.</li>
            <li> getting older does have its quirks</li>
            <li> It works ok, but you have to pass it over the same skin several times to get all the hairs trimmed.  </li>
            <li> This is priced decent and it works well for what its made</li>
            <li> I have the older version of this, in the silver/gray color.</li>
            <li> decent product for the money.</li>
            <li> The color is stunning and does not look obvious that it is a facial trimmer at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face and legs mainly.</li>
            <li> i thought it would be a good bikini trimmer, but it&#x27;s way too small to do much more than eyebrows, and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem sharp enough.</li>
            <li> The blade is my main issue because of its ragged edge, which has the tendency to pull the hair rather than a clean shave if used without  the  detachable head for long hairs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this trimmer for all your needs.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it was high hopes</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to women with unwanted hair in unwanted areas.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used three different brand new batteries (from different packages) in it, to be sure it&#x27;s not a problem with the battery.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the tweezers that come with it are pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Finishing Touch in the past, but I found this trimmer very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This product is a little better quality than the one that was sold on tv and in stores, but if you are trying to trim anything but \\&quot;peach</li>
            <li> A little more substantial than the ones you buy in bed bath</li>
            <li> I am glad to have the little trimmer to use around my face.</li>
            <li> It was way better than I ever could have expected and works like a charm!!!</li>
            <li> To use, just have clean, dry skin, apply some powder (I use baby powder) and use this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t even powerful enough to trim my sideburns.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cost a few dollars more than a $6 trimmer I bought at the grocery store and it pulls on my face hair when I use it.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and it seems fragile, but my first one lasted me about a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> time using a product like this, normally used scissors.&lt;br /&gt;fits</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s strong enough to get rid of my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Will let you know once I open it, if this is the right one or not.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde facial hair along my jawline.  </li>
            <li> I had bought three of those in the past, and have found already that this is much better quality and gets a much closer and complete shave than the Finishing Touch.  </li>
            <li> When trimming, it&#x27;s not as smooth as the other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> When trimming, It&#x27;s not as smooth as the other trimmers and pulls hair.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are a nice little extra as well.</li>
            <li> Even with a brand new battery installed, this trimmer works as if the battery is dying.  </li>
            <li> You basically need a new battery each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> Oh, it was also a brand new battery I was using.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of years I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old electric razor that I&#x27;d enjoyed for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Though $14 is not much in the scheme of things I&#x27;ve had cheaper ones that work the same or better.  </li>
            <li> I love this little hair remover!</li>
            <li> For me, it caused no irritation, but I could see someone with very sensitive skin getting some redness or irritation after use.</li>
            <li> It works great for thick hair but not for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> If you can afford better, go for higher quality, but this is decent for a poor grad student like me.</li>
            <li> Wise up and make a quality precision trimmer like that for women that doesn&#x27;t use a silly AA battery and is strong enough to actually trim hairs instead of just tugging on them.</li>
            <li> Pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> So I opted for this trimmer and the first time I touched it to my upper lip area</li>
            <li> I have used two other trimmers prior to this one and this one is just okay.</li>
            <li> You cannot use it to actually make an area better, even if it is the tiny upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> Great little personal shaver for the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; hair that began popping up on my upper lip and cheeks in middle age.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to trim the bikini area, but it works for eyebrows, facial hair, any unwanted hair really.</li>
            <li> Precise and sharp!  </li>
            <li> I really like this one better, it&#x27;s well made, slightly heaver then other ones I&#x27;ve used, and the blades work really well with no nipping or tugging.</li>
            <li> My eye brow hairs are pretty long and it trimmed it to the right spot where it&#x27;s not too long or too short.&lt;br /&gt;Mustache:</li>
            <li> I usually need to replace other brands about once a year; I suspect this one will outlast that by a good stretch.</li>
            <li> Has a little light.</li>
            <li> Even still, it chugged and slowed and nearly stopped working completely</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with rash or irritation.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer bot the dust</li>
            <li> Not the peach fuzz on my arm (which I&#x27;ve never cut before) to more delicate areas like my bikini line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok when it&#x27;s working well, but it sucks batteries up.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really gentle and quiet.</li>
            <li> This cut my skin and though my skin might be sensitive, I&#x27;ve used the cheaper drugstore trimmer and not had a problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I have been alive without it</li>
            <li> I have several trimmers, but really didn&#x27;t care for any of them, except for Emjoy which they don&#x27;t make anymore.  </li>
            <li> I wanted another one in case my old one breaks.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several trimmers and this one is by far the least effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the accessories very often, and I only use it on my face</li>
            <li> only downside to this kit is the tweezers really.</li>
            <li> Corded items are a hassle if you&#x27;re nowhere near a plug in, so this trimmer is quite portable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is how a trimmer is supposed to work - pretty powerful little trimmer that easily trims down to the skin, and lasts a LONG time (been using mine for two years now).</li>
            <li> It gets right down to almost bare skin and doesn&#x27;t clog up or stop working at any point because of too much hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just that the blades aren&#x27;t super sharp, but I found myself going over and over the fine hairs on my face to get the hair-free look</li>
            <li> It easily gets at those small, but noticeable hairs between my eyebrows and at the corners of my lips.</li>
            <li> It just leaves behind several of the coarse hairs, it does fine on light soft hair though.</li>
            <li> You do get stubble after a few days as if you used a regular razor, but, again, my facial hair is very fine</li>
            <li> This shaver /trimmer works fine, however it is rather small.</li>
            <li> Most of the ones out there are too big for a small nose.</li>
            <li> Attachments for hair trimming (like for eyebrows) were a little less amazing than i anticipated</li>
            <li> Not a bad little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> This got such a high rating and that was why I bought it,  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works better than most and I have had dozens of these that are so cheaply made they end up being worthless after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this super little trimmer is really outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Not as smooth on the face as a previous brand I used,kind of a scratchy feeling,probably will be looking for a different brand</li>
            <li> Not sure if my hair is just too thick, but this hasn’t been very effective.</li>
            <li> I have to turn it on and off a few times before it&#x27;s humming away at full speed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is better to use the trimmer attachment to a men&#x27;s norelco shaver, but it is harder to control in tight regions.  </li>
            <li> but the blade becomes dull very quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed in that, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> the other one I had wasn&#x27;t this brand this one is better but the other on lasted for several years so we will see it this on holds up .</li>
            <li> I have owned other little trimmers that have worked better.  </li>
            <li> This is not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li> Well made, small enough to maneuver easily.</li>
            <li> Received this to replace an older one (different brand) that finally just wouldn&#x27;t work anymore (had it for 6 years).  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a high quality product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> For all these bad reviewers.. you must have excessive hair because this clearly is for basic trimming and I&#x27;m able to trim any facial hair very easily!</li>
            <li> no regrets here.</li>
            <li> It barely picked up peach fuzz</li>
            <li> She has no complaints when using the guards or using it without a guard on her bare skin.</li>
            <li> It barely removes any hair.</li>
            <li> I actually have terribly sensitive skin and this trimmer doesn&#x27;t irritate it in the slightest.</li>
            <li> It worked, but was not very sharp and would catch on my hair and hurt.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to other trimmers similar - not to mention any names - I would say to spend a little more money and get this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In regard to the similar product, it is not near as powerful and does not last too long before it dies and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It lasts a LONG time as far as the blade goes!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good option for any one like me who hate wasting too much time on eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I had a generic simple inexpensive model the first time that lasted me a long ,long time.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to see stray hairs as I pluck my eyebrows and to remove those black hairs that crop up on my chin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product twice because it worked so well the first few times but the same thing happened with both purchases</li>
            <li> Poor quality and barely works on fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li> As little as I need it, it should last my much longer than that.</li>
            <li> I have to say the trimmer itself almost never cuts well, pulls on the skin, and just in general was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t pay too much for this product; unfortunately, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> As a bonus the device also comes with a sleeve so you can trim back long eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Battery last for a long time too.</li>
            <li> only regret is waiting so long to buy one of these.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long but even if it only lasts 6 months</li>
            <li> I have used this product only once since I haven&#x27;t  had it that long</li>
            <li> The comb is some weird version that is a block style and does not pass over hair easily.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going back to my old dying razor and finished the job in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have only used the trimmer a few times but it works well so far.</li>
            <li> guide (makes the area to trim larger or smaller (be careful not to nick yourself when putting it on or taking it off)&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little noisey, but not as loud as others I have used.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small compact mirror, a tweezer with built in led light, and a few other attachments.</li>
            <li> but this little trimmer certainly helps make them less embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Havent owned it long, so no comments on reliability</li>
            <li> Even just a few coarse facial hairs leave a stubble like a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> For some reason it is hard to get a kit like this around where I live; I couldn&#x27;t find one in my local stores.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I lived without this for so long!</li>
            <li> This trimmer gives a closer shave and the unit last longer than other brands I have tried, like Remington.  </li>
            <li> Even if I use this for a few months and then shaver goes dull, it was well worth it</li>
            <li> --someone might think that you&#x27;re using a vibrator ;)&lt;br /&gt; also, if you press down hard it hurts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a powerful trimmer but it will do small areas very well.</li>
            <li> ; product - did not live up to my expectations based on review.</li>
            <li> However, I found that the only way it worked was by pulling the hair out (very unevenly I should add), it barely trimmed anything.</li>
            <li> maybe it will work on straggling single bikini hairs, but it will probably just grab the hair and pull it.</li>
            <li> hairs: hard to grab them therefore making it difficult for the rest of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself is smooth to hold and soft on skin.</li>
            <li> Instead it just pinched my skin and seized up.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I use it for my dark upper lip hairs and unibrow.</li>
            <li> : I use a regular saver for down there.</li>
            <li> I just use it for the hair that comes down pass my ear on my face, in between my eyebrows in between waxing and my upper lip.</li>
            <li> people without PCOS, waxing usually helps the hair come back lighter and less frequently, but for people with PCOS, waxing is a joke.  </li>
            <li> However, I will not be needing to buy the other one because this one works tons better than the expensive one I had!</li>
            <li> However, the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because personally, I felt a little pain while taking off the hair on my &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; area.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has a little bit of side facial hair around the bottom of her neck and ear...</li>
            <li> This works...a little bit...if you spend enough time on one area.</li>
            <li> Comes with a handy little bad, neat and well made.</li>
            <li> This thing was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> The product can be a bit painful, but you are removing your hair and buying a trimmer not a 103598032 dollar magical treatment, so no pain</li>
            <li> I usually use it to trim between my eyebrows, but have also used it on my ankles (when I want to wear capris without shaving my whole legs, lazy</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s harder to take them out.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that you buy an actual &amp;#34;hair trimmer&amp;#34; instead of this cutesy battery powered waste of money.</li>
            <li> Manly men, don&#x27;t be scared of the pink color - if you can handle it, it can handle your hair.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I expected that it would work well, being Philips.</li>
            <li> Just about as expected, cant go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;May</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected and described.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the biggest deal for me because I don&#x27;t use it that often, but it is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same part multiple times just to cut ONE hair, it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It also found it to be quite convenient for hard to get places when shaving or epilating, and will take this trimmer to my knees or even those gross long hairs along my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very precise and a lot less painful than plucking.</li>
            <li> The batteries last long for me at least.</li>
            <li> this is not a big device its small and compact for use in purse .. .</li>
            <li> I had to keep going over the same small patch over and over and over to make a dent in it.</li>
            <li> Small enough to get those strays around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I used it in personal areas, so its small head is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I think that it would stand-up against any other trimmer out there</li>
            <li> I had one similar to this in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as sharp but it does the trick</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sharp and works well.  </li>
            <li> Amazon not willing to replace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However contrary to reviews, this doesn&#x27;t work on any other body part as the blade is too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about how the trimmer &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; your hair instead of trimming.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so pink!</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend a lot of money to remove this hair and decided to try this one after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works on other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> and I figured it would be an alright replacement until I could afford the other one again.</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in purse.</li>
            <li> It is a little rough to &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Finally, I tried this little Philips Trimmer and it works!!  </li>
            <li> Just when I thought I could bend the head at least slightly back and forth.....</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that I use it for trimming my husband&#x27;s neck line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Change the batteries if it slows down over time.</li>
            <li> it was a very sharp pain that I felt.  </li>
            <li> I had previously (Remington)</li>
            <li> I think its a typical &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Like that cap fits tightly.</li>
            <li> I took the plunge and bought this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the other reviewer was getting nipped by her trimmer, I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
            <li> The product itself feels like it was well made - it has a little bit of heft to it.</li>
            <li> This little thing is a godsend.</li>
            <li> it also comes with a little cylinder container that has tweezers and a mirror...</li>
            <li> A little rougher than I would like, but will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> It pulls a little when you use it.</li>
            <li> not sure how one of the other reviewers got hurt.</li>
            <li> It trims off the eyebrow hair (the little blond ones)</li>
            <li> However, the product is the same as previous model, and is poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> The cutting blades are either too short or don&#x27;t operate properly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals on my skin and waxing</li>
            <li> So to trim hair, one has to roll this over a few times...</li>
            <li> You do have to do a few passes to get all the hair as well as keep the skin taught to fully remove hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Panasonic Cosmetic Groomer ES119 which I have had for a few years and always worked well.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or risk the pain.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it if you have used a different one before and are not happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a few of these on hand.  </li>
            <li> I looked at quite a few before settling for this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this trimmer lasts longer than my previous one did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less nervous shaving with a razor than I am with this trimmer!</li>
            <li> It got caught and did not trim - very poorly made - STAY CLEAR</li>
            <li> I suggest you just stick to using a normal shaver in the shower and forget these stupid trimmers - they don&#x27;t last at all!  </li>
            <li> I have thick, dark hair and have no problem removing any of it wherever I use this thing.</li>
            <li> I have very thick eyebrows that grow fast and are tedious to maintain.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer rocks!  </li>
            <li> Worthless, and although not expensive, it&#x27;s $12 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I tried the REM and it was much too painful.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - keep looking!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite small</li>
            <li> I did the spots where I usually tweeze</li>
            <li> comes with a small mirror and twizzer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She is anxiously awaiting it&#x27;s arrival.  </li>
            <li> SMALL HAIR</li>
            <li> I usually keep one of the shavers at all times.  </li>
            <li> No more dealing with a razor on my face.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy thE \\&quot;AS SEEN ON TV\\</li>
            <li> I have had a few that I&#x27;ve gone through in the past few years, all have either broken or just got lost.</li>
            <li> Cut is not very good.</li>
            <li> Very weak and only trims a very small area at a time.</li>
            <li> got so sick of it; I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> When this one eventually gets dull, I&#x27;ll just throw it away and get another.  </li>
            <li> not that it has shown signs of going dull, just saying).</li>
            <li> When this one eventually gets dull, I&#x27;ll just throw it away and get another.</li>
            <li> Has guard to protect hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> this trimmer would be dull and would pull and leave a rash.  </li>
            <li> My wife bought this, and it sucks.</li>
            <li> but I am clumsy so that isn&#x27;t the razors fault.</li>
            <li> and it sucks.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly at least.</li>
            <li> It absolutely sucks for bikini area trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on really thick patches of hair, but on your face and stuff</li>
            <li> And I couldn&#x27;t have broke it by trying to use it on thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I have gnarly thick hair or anything, either.</li>
            <li> No more plucking or waxing!</li>
            <li> Will make trimming those small hairs a lot easier!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to get all those &amp;#34;small spaces&amp;#34; you don&#x27;t want to harm yourself by trimming (ladies, you know what I mean)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and compact, have had it for months now</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace another type of hair trimmer I had purchased in the past b/c the charging port had broken.  </li>
            <li> The shaving head is very small</li>
            <li> head is very small, and so are the trimmers.</li>
            <li> but I do hate the little catfish hairs I grow on the sides of my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so painful that it was unbearable, but definitely not painless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is not good at all.</li>
            <li> the cutter is rough and snags hair instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contrary to the negative reviews, I have never experienced any &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; or pain when using the product.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!</li>
            <li> weak.</li>
            <li> Dull and the motor is very weak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The weird little plastic trimming heads are absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> maybe i just got a bad one, but be careful if you order.</li>
            <li> was doubtful about this product but for its low price</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of ripping my skin apart with waxing</li>
            <li> I picked one of these up at Target for $14.99 - cheaper on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for the annoying hairs (anywhere you may have them), this will definitely take care of them painlessly, efficiently, and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a replacement (I broke the last one), and I am highly disappointed in this. :(</li>
            <li> All others have failed to do their job.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have PCOS and can wax my face up to 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sad they&#x27;ve cheapened their product to the point of it being unusable.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it for eyebrows/upper lip/ random parts of my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at every weird angle  and didn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product from this seller, however, I bought it at Walmart for a mere $7.00.</li>
            <li> It tugs and pulls bikini hair even if you just look at the trimmer wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for another one, sadly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not expect it to get as close as a razor, but the hair that it leaves behind is very difficult to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Poor performance lacking in power and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I doubt anyone else even knows they are there, but they drive me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Pulls the hair instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I was in desperate need of a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was afraid for the cost</li>
            <li> It pulls the hairs instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> The product works in the sense that the motors run; however, it catches on the hair and pull on it rather than cutting it.</li>
            <li> The cutting part isn&#x27;t attached well it just pops off.</li>
            <li> Because it is underpowered, it gets caught and pulls which is very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to try it again, but I thought maybe I had it at a bad angle.  </li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed and would not recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever been this disappointed with a purchase before.</li>
            <li> and I have to throw it away &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> It is horrible and useless.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful about these things...</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s just a non working piece of crap -</li>
            <li> I have peachy fuzz on my chin and hate looking like a goat.  </li>
            <li> What an unpleasant experience!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful and miserable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  </li>
            <li> We are very disappointed that we have to replace this unit so soon.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all - very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this unit.</li>
            <li> That would be stupid!</li>
            <li> Terribly made.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> This one is HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> I think they include the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; mirror and lighted tweasers as an apology in advance for their terrible product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> crap!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great little trimer! I usually use it to trim between my eyebrows, but have also used it on my ankles (when I want to wear capris without shaving my whole legs, lazy I know). My sister has one and uses hers for bikini line trimming. The trimming guide is great and the head comes off for super easy cleaning. This is a super trimmer, but honestly I would have paid this much just for the bonus tweezers that come with it. The tweezers are super &amp;#34;fine-tipped?&amp;#34; at the ends which make it easy to grab small hairs. Also its LED lighted which makes it so much easier to see what you are doing. I love them and would buy again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it works well.  I think it needs something like a pivoting head.  Tie your hair back though.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and works like a tiny hair clipper.</li>
            <li> In between sessions of laser hair removal, this works perfect for trimming areas. Very effective, very good quality. never once bled/ safe. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and ehe loves it. The enlarging mirror is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This razor removes excess chin/facial hair very well.  I don&#x27;t have to use it as often as I did with a competitor&#x27;s brand.  I love the lighted tweezers that come with it.  It makes it so much easier to see stray hairs as I pluck my eyebrows and to remove those black hairs that crop up on my chin.  I use the razor about every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works well.  The eyebrow attatchment trims to perfect length.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this, and it sucks. It is cheap plastic and underpowered to really do any real trimming. Because it is underpowered, it gets caught and pulls which is very uncomfortable.  products with cheap cases like this tend to let water inside when used in the shower and then battery corrosion and rust stains become a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is better to use the trimmer attachment to a men&#x27;s norelco shaver, but it is harder to control in tight regions.  Phillips, you make the body groom product line for guys... Wise up and make a quality precision trimmer like that for women that doesn&#x27;t use a silly AA battery and is strong enough to actually trim hairs instead of just tugging on them.</li>
            <li> great for facial hair on women</li>
            <li> This is a very good gift for your loved ones especially females,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;*Good quality stylish Build.&lt;br /&gt;*very portable and compact&lt;br /&gt;*easy to use&lt;br /&gt;*only needs 1 AAA battery (i use rechargeable sanyo eneloop)&lt;br /&gt;*Free smart Tweezers with light making it very useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;*Cant think of any for now .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good buy this is not a big device its small and compact for use in purse .. .</li>
            <li> We had a similar trimmer for several years, used for eyebrows, mustaches and sideburns.  When it died we bought this Phillips trimmer.  I was happy with the color and the length guards.  However, in actual use it falls short.  The unit doesn&#x27;t trim effectively for longer than 6 months.  Changing the batteries doesn&#x27;t help.  The cutting blades are either too short or don&#x27;t operate properly.  We are very disappointed that we have to replace this unit so soon.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my hair is just too thick, but this hasn’t been very effective. When it does cut the hair, it’s not close to the root, so a lot of the hair is still left. I’d only get this if you’re planning on just trimming fine hairs.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t even powerful enough to trim my sideburns. I returned it immediately. I expect better of Philips.</li>
            <li> The chain was just what my pole trimmer needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old electric razor that I&#x27;d enjoyed for a few years now. I had intended to use this mostly on my bikini region, but this razor really struggles to trim anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had only been a couple of weeks since I last treated that area, so the hair was not terribly overgrown. Even still, it chugged and slowed and nearly stopped working completely, I thought the motor may overheat. I had to keep going over the same small patch over and over and over to make a dent in it. I ended up going back to my old dying razor and finished the job in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This item is easy to use and effective. Although more solid than similar trimmers, it is easier to hold and operate and much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Its nice. I guess I cant expect awesome for 11$. it does have extra stuff like tweezers with light and all.&lt;br /&gt;it does its job. its pretty much like a razor. hair grows back in 2 days again.&lt;br /&gt;small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Panasonic trimmers are sharp, yet gentle and very effective.. In my opinion, others can&#x27;t compare to this one</li>
            <li> Will let you know once I open it, if this is the right one or not. Still in her original box</li>
            <li> Best personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> This item is not only good for women but great for men to. Every women and man should own one of these.</li>
            <li> I love these kind of trimmers but have never found a brand that holds up to multiple uses. The price was good and delivery fast but didn&#x27;t find it to be better or worse than any of the other trimmers.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked one time and did not work again.  Replaced the batteries that came with it and it still did not work.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Lol, I&#x27;m not really sure how to rate this otherwise.  I power it on, it shaves, end of story.  I would purchase it again if and when this one dies.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  It took me over 20 minutes to get the battery secured because one of the contacts in the cap had bent.  This was after owning the product for 5 minutes.  Terribly made.</li>
            <li> Item snags hair quite often. Not that great. Will not recommend anyone to buy unless value is a choice. Happy buying.</li>
            <li> Product is so good that I bought this one as a replacement for the one I am using at present.  Philips great quality is present in this small article.  The best in its kind.  I recommend the supplier.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great, and it even came with a sweet pair of tweezers and a light.  Definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Works great! It comes with an attachment that makes the blade smaller for more precise eyebrow shaping too. Yes, you can use it as a nose hair trimmer as well. I saw someone asked about that. The light up tweezer is a bonus item. Not really necessary but you can&#x27;t beat the price if you get it at the big box store with the bullseye. I&#x27;m hoping this trimmer lasts longer than my previous one did!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It works well and is easily stored and operated.  It does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is great, works as needed. Would have given higher star rating, but product did not come with tweezers as advertised though. Pretty disappointed in that, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> I use it one my face and it works great. Small enough to get those strays around my eyebrows. Works really well so be careful around sensitive areas and getting to close to stuff you want to keep. A little noisey, but not as loud as others I have used. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut any kind of hair. Dull and the motor is very weak. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> This is realyl easy to use and works well. I have thick, dark hair and have no problem removing any of it wherever I use this thing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on really thick patches of hair, but on your face and stuff it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Well made, small enough to maneuver easily.</li>
            <li> I have bought several brands just like this razor but they all seem to break within several uses. As soon as I took it out of the box, I could tell it was made with better materials and worked better than the others too. I am happy with paying double the money to get a product that will last more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li> Great little personal shaver for the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; hair that began popping up on my upper lip and cheeks in middle age.  I showed it to my mother and a friend, who both ended up ordering one for themselves.  I have fairly sensitive skin, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with rash or irritation.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t really cut the hair. I am quite disappointed and would not recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> This item is very cheaply put together.  The blades keep falling off the main trimmer head.</li>
            <li> This product worked well in the beginning, but over time it ended up not working as well. I made sure to clean it well after every use, but it seemed like the blades dulled quickly. Works great for occasional use, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for a long amount of time.</li>
            <li> This works great and the lighted tweezers are a real help.  Highly recommend this trimmer for all your needs.  It trims all unwanted hair and even ones you can&#x27;t see!</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, but I truly like the tweezers with light that came with it.  Helps you see the hairs in very good light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good the first few times you use it. After that it starts losing its power and your hairs get thicker so it&#x27;s harder to take them out. I did however really like the \\&quot;Smart Tweezers\\&quot; it came with.</li>
            <li> Works great and much needed for those stray face hairs.  Arrived in good condition and I will enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this s*** is garbage</li>
            <li> Works very well for the price. This isn&#x27;t a two hundred dollar trimmer, but it works very well for the cost. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Just when I thought I could bend the head at least slightly back and forth..... It just stays in one place...</li>
            <li> My wife liked this product, this product is very efficient and of easy use!!! Best product!!! She recomend it the all buyers!!!</li>
            <li> A great multi-function device at a great price.  Very pleased with this little gem.  I have light hair and I shouldn&#x27;t really complain, but I do hate the little catfish hairs I grow on the sides of my upper lip.  I doubt anyone else even knows they are there, but they drive me crazy.  I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals on my skin and waxing hurts.  After doing some research online and learning that shaving wasn&#x27;t going to make the hairs grow in thicker or darker I took the plunge and bought this little trimmer.  It works great.  The hairs are gone in seconds and there is no pain.  I&#x27;m not sure why the other reviewer was getting nipped by her trimmer, I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  Maybe she&#x27;s using too much pressure?  It doesn&#x27;t require any.  As a bonus the device also comes with a sleeve so you can trim back long eyebrows.  I don&#x27;t need that, but my husband will soon turn guinea pig...&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is the lighted tweezer with travel case and mirror.  Very handy.  Overall this is a great value at $15.</li>
            <li> The tweezers alone are reason to buy this!  They are *so* awesome!  There&#x27;s a little bright light between the tweezers that highlights the area you&#x27;re plucking.  So beneficial!  I&#x27;ve also found the packaging to be incredibly easy to get into and have used it for storing all the pieces.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought it :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrianne</li>
            <li> This is a nice quick and handy piece to have for a quick groom between waxing. It is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cost a few dollars more than a $6 trimmer I bought at the grocery store and it pulls on my face hair when I use it. The product itself feels like it was well made - it has a little bit of heft to it. I&#x27;m not sure if it is just that the blades aren&#x27;t super sharp, but I found myself going over and over the fine hairs on my face to get the hair-free look I was going for. I would not purchase this produce again.</li>
            <li> It lacks power and precision. So to trim hair, one has to roll this over a few times... Eventually it would do the job but can be better.</li>
            <li> A good temporary hair remover for those days and times where you just don&#x27;t have the means or energy to deal with facial hair!  I love it!</li>
            <li> It gets it done. For the money it was worth it. I wasn&#x27;t about to pay $300 for NONO to keep some peach fuzz of my face.</li>
            <li> It works but snags here and there. Have to take your time using it. Overall it&#x27;s okay, better use for smaller areas. It&#x27;s cute and portable.</li>
            <li> I have had a ton of trimmers and electric shavers at one time or another, when my old one died I bought this one because I liked the color and I thought it would be a good fit since it came from a good brand and was a good price. I have to say the trimmer itself almost never cuts well, pulls on the skin, and just in general was a complete waste of money. The only redeeming thing about this is the eyebrow tweezers with the light attached to it which I love.</li>
            <li> It trims very well, no snags or pulling. Note, that this product it only trims, it does not shave smooth. Great for touch ups in between waxings.</li>
            <li> It handles the purpose for which I bought it. Good buy for the price also. Would recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with the quality of this product.  The comb is some weird version that is a block style and does not pass over hair easily.  The trimmer itself pulls and pinches.  Though $14 is not much in the scheme of things I&#x27;ve had cheaper ones that work the same or better.  I expected a bit more from a Phillips which is why I selected this one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money - keep looking!</li>
            <li> Did not work at all - very disappointed.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT! TRIM VERY CLEAN. VERY WELL MADE. SO MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE TV PRODUCT WHICH COSTS ALMOST THE SAME. NEVER HAD ANY PAIN. WILL RECOMMEND, DEFINITELY</li>
            <li> Works well once or twice but the blade becomes dull very quickly. I bought this product twice because it worked so well the first few times but the same thing happened with both purchases--you&#x27;d be better off investing in a better brand.</li>
            <li> I have only used the trimmer a few times but it works well so far. The real selling point with this package is the tweezer. It has a very bright LED light, so you won&#x27;t miss a thing. The battery casing does come loose from time to time but it can be easily tightened with a screwdriver. Over all, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Even with a brand new battery installed, this trimmer works as if the battery is dying.  I have used three different brand new batteries (from different packages) in it, to be sure it&#x27;s not a problem with the battery.  This unit seems to be a fluke - I had one exactly like this before, and it worked perfectly.  This is a replacement (I broke the last one), and I am highly disappointed in this. :(</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer.  Works great ~ small end on it, which  is what I needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased my husband a trimmer kind of like this from Ross and it worked so well on his coarse beard I decided to search Amazon for a pretty, feminine looking one. I dont know why I went with this one.  Probably because it was a pretty purple!  Anyways, this does NOT cut it.  I tried to use this for my eyebrows even without the guard and it does absolutely nothing.  The power is definitely not enough to cut anything.  I will continue to use my manual razors.</li>
            <li> Fell apart within a week.</li>
            <li> i really love this, i order a lot for me and friends, and all friends love my gifts,....and i have coupon 5 $ ...... i ll keep buying this is good for gifts ....</li>
            <li> This product is great for shaving my pubic area and it really gets close to the skin.  If I want a totally smooth I also use a electric razor with baby powder.</li>
            <li> Used it to trim my eyebrows and hair on my upper lip. So quick and simple to use. Very precise and a lot less painful than plucking. Looks really great too. Well done Philips!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister as a gift, she LOVED it...she said she is now feeling like a girl. YAY! Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> I love this little hair remover! It takes 1 AAA battery. I tried out the eyebrow trimmer, and I loved it. It has 2 settings for eyebrows. Then you can just it without an attachment to do your upper lip, bikini line, sides of your face, etc. For me, it caused no irritation, but I could see someone with very sensitive skin getting some redness or irritation after use. So be sure to moisturize! I would definitely recommend this to anyone, male or female!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s great for the price, considering it even brings a tweezer, which always comes in handy. It does the job and leaves the skin hairless and smooth. I used it with lotion just so I wouldn&#x27;t get a rash on my skin. However, the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because personally, I felt a little pain while taking off the hair on my &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; area. It felt as if it was being pulled. It wasn&#x27;t so painful that it was unbearable, but definitely not painless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful and easy to use. It&#x27;s a good option for any one like me who hate wasting too much time on eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I lost my Conair Finishing Touch and decided to replace it with this since the price was great, and I have to say- no regrets here. It&#x27;s powerful, does exactly what it needs to do, and the tweezers with the precision light that come with it were a great little bonus.</li>
            <li> I was surprise that it worked so well. For the price it does what it needs to do.  works well</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was so cheap I thought I might as well give it a try.  Didn&#x27;t even take it out of the package for a week.  I just started using it and it works so wonderfully I just ordered two more so that I have a back up.  I&#x27;m also going to order for my mom and sister.  Comes with a great set of tweezers that are worth the money alone.  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> It looks nice,it has the right size and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more and more and more...</li>
            <li> Everyone needs one of these! I have had a few that I&#x27;ve gone through in the past few years, all have either broken or just got lost. This one made by Philips is by far the best one yet. Got it at a great price, also!</li>
            <li> My old trimmer bot the dust and I took a chance ordering this brand. Good choice. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Broke 1 week after i got it</li>
            <li> This is how a trimmer is supposed to work - pretty powerful little trimmer that easily trims down to the skin, and lasts a LONG time (been using mine for two years now).</li>
            <li> Amazing little trimmer. Very powerful and perfectly compact. I own another brand trimmer and decided to buy this one for the wife because of the color. It is much better than mine. I proudly use this purple trimmer instead of mine! Love it, Can&#x27;t beat the price. Great seller and great shipping. Awesome purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> This little machine is cheap, and effective.  It does the job better than some trimmers that cost much more.  My first one lasted 5 years.  When this one eventually gets dull, I&#x27;ll just throw it away and get another.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This little thing is a godsend. I love it. Doesn&#x27;t catch hairs. Pretty quiet. You can use it pretty much anywhere. Battery last for a long time too.</li>
            <li> This thing was a huge disappointment. The attachements didn&#x27;t really work and even without them it didn&#x27;t really cut any hair very well. It kept getting stuck and pulling the hairs in my bikini area. I would suggest that you buy an actual &amp;#34;hair trimmer&amp;#34; instead of this cutesy battery powered waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Easy to use, clean and light weight.</li>
            <li> Bought this on sale at Target.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different ways of getting rid of those pesky fine hairs...waxing, bleaching, &amp; threading which needs to be done often. This is truly my favorite way! This very small size is perfect to get around your eyebrows as well. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have had other trimmers in the past, but this is the best.  I love the lighted tweezers and the tweezers of good quality.  The trimmer does an excelent job.  Does not come with a battery but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> This shaver /trimmer works fine, however it is rather small. The shaving head is about 3/4&amp;#34; .&lt;br /&gt;It does a fine job , doesn&#x27;t pinch and comes complete except for the AAA battery</li>
            <li> Honestly, the color was a great selling point, and it&#x27;s cheap. Even if I use this for a few months and then shaver goes dull, it was well worth it and I&#x27;d buy another (not that it has shown signs of going dull, just saying). It&#x27;s under $10 and there were times on the road I&#x27;d have paid $100 to get neatened up a bit. This goes into your mu bag, it&#x27;s light as a feather. Just have some spare triple A batteries.</li>
            <li> Perfect for that little lady stash that I am now growing..oy vey...yeah getting older does have its quirks but this little trimmer certainly helps make them less embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to trim the bikini area, but it works for eyebrows, facial hair, any unwanted hair really. It&#x27;s quite small so it&#x27;s best for smaller areas like facial hair but it works for quick touch ups on the bikini area. You do have to do a few passes to get all the hair as well as keep the skin taught to fully remove hair. I plan on keeping this in my bag or on my vanity for last minute touch ups to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and my hair is also very fair and thin. This &amp;#34;precision trimmer&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t cut any hair anywhere. Not the peach fuzz on my arm (which I&#x27;ve never cut before) to more delicate areas like my bikini line. Instead it just pinched my skin and seized up.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok when it&#x27;s working well, but it sucks batteries up. You basically need a new battery each time you use it.  It works ok, but you have to pass it over the same skin several times to get all the hairs trimmed.  I used it in personal areas, so its small head is a bonus. If it had sharper blades or a better motor, it&#x27;d be perfect or came with an estetician to do all this for me instead... LOL</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for the &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; MicroTouch.  I&#x27;ve been through 2 of those in a year and figured I&#x27;d get something different.  Basically, it doesn&#x27;t actual trim thicker hair.  At all.  Just processed a return and purchased another MicroTouch.</li>
            <li> Great for delicate areas. Trim it first though or it WILL pull and OUCH!!</li>
            <li> Not a bad little trimmer for the price. Works well to get the stray hairs, and I like all the different accessories.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has a little bit of side facial hair around the bottom of her neck and ear... she does not like it at all. It is pink, pretty and works great! it also comes with a little cylinder container that has tweezers and a mirror...</li>
            <li> Works best of any that I have tried and I have tried a lot of them. Does not cause any pain!!!</li>
            <li> This is priced decent and it works well for what its made for.&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this to any hairy monsters out there who need a lil grooming.</li>
            <li> I really like this one the other one I had wasn&#x27;t this brand this one is better but the other on lasted for several years so we will see it this on holds up .</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted and performed very well.  I think that it would stand-up against any other trimmer out there</li>
            <li> it broke after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> This little machine is cheap, and effective. It does the job better than some trimmers that cost much more. My first one lasted 5 years. When this one eventually gets dull, I&#x27;ll just throw it away and get another. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have been able to find anywhere.  It lasts a LONG time as far as the blade goes!  I have tried almost EVERY trimmer out there and swear by this one!</li>
            <li> I have tried several trimmers like this. All others have failed to do their job. This one is great. I have used it several times with no issues. The lighted tweezers are a plus.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of reviews for this product from men. No shame, because my girlfriend bought this and I steal it all the time. It&#x27;s so versatile and strong - I never get irritated from it, it handles coarse and fine hair, is perfectly sized for the nose/eyebrow area and can go into the shower. My girlfriend and I both love it - the best tiny lil baby trimmer that ever trimmed. Manly men, don&#x27;t be scared of the pink color - if you can handle it, it can handle your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these and they work great. I use it for nose hair primarily and it works great. Most of the ones out there are too big for a small nose. This one is not. It is a good size and can be used for other grooming as well.</li>
            <li> Nice price and very well made product. I expect it to last for a while because of the build quality.</li>
            <li> Pretty good razor! My only complain is that it isn&#x27;t shock proof but I am clumsy so that isn&#x27;t the razors fault.</li>
            <li> Good product - good value for the cost...also comes with an illuminated tweezer set.  Durable material and a very good brand.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. I absolutely love it. Doesn&#x27;t tug on the hair and it&#x27;s really gentle and quiet.</li>
            <li> Not a fan! Very weak and only trims a very small area at a time. Would only use this if you needed a emergency touchup/fix.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I expected that it would work well, being Philips. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  I bought my aunt one for Christmas then bought myself one</li>
            <li> I imagine this little trimmer will wear out pretty quick, but for the price, it does a good job.  I also like how compact it is.</li>
            <li> This cut my skin and though my skin might be sensitive, I&#x27;ve used the cheaper drugstore trimmer and not had a problem.</li>
            <li> Best stick rasor around. The tweezers with the light is great. Bought aa back up before it is discontued.  Best.</li>
            <li> two uses.  It works fines...right up until it falls apart in your hand. This is the third one of these type trimmers I&#x27;ve had and, while they work well, they always fall apart.  It&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re made to be disposable.</li>
            <li> It worked, but was not very sharp and would catch on my hair and hurt.  It did not give a smooth  trim.</li>
            <li> Recommended!! I love this trimmer!!! Great for bikini trimming and small areas. Has guard to protect hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Oh man I love this thing. I don&#x27;t know how I have been alive without it lol It is addicting for me to just trim my eyebrows down because I love how they come out with this trimmer. I actually didn&#x27;t even want it for my eyebrows (I wanted to see if I could use it for nose hairs) but in the end its multi-purpose :)</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer, it&#x27;s strong enough to get rid of my coarse hair. I even used it on my arms.</li>
            <li> It grabs at your hairs and leaves rashes instead of a nice clean trim...I&#x27;ve had cheaper ones that I wish I could find again that I was far more impressed with...</li>
            <li> I HAVE PURCHASED PROBABLY 10 DIFFERENT TRIMMERS TRYING TO FIND ONE THAT WILL TRIM HAIRS OVER MY LIP AND MY NOSE &amp; I FINALLY FOUND THIS ONE.  THIS ONE WORKS GREAT &amp; IT&#x27;S PRETTY TOO.  IT&#x27;S ALSO PRICED GREAT!</li>
            <li> Nice smooth easy to use appliance. Love that it also comes with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I got two of these.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those stray facial hairs and unruly eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect trimmer for eyebrows or other facial hair.  It is very lightweight and it seems fragile, but my first one lasted me about a year.  I think that is pretty good for the price!  When it conked out, I bought another.</li>
            <li> Perfect for facial hair. I use it for my dark upper lip hairs and unibrow. No more plucking or waxing! Last year they were a great stocking stuffer. One daughter said she didn&#x27;t know if she&#x27;d use it, then later said she wouldn&#x27;t be with out it! So easy and quick, too, and the attachments and lighted tweezers are a nice bonus, as well.</li>
            <li> It is not good at all. Does not work for me. If I can return it, I would love to do that...</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price! Just about as expected, cant go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;May be Battery might die soon, since it takes only 1 AAA. But that is fine as long as it is portable and does the job :)</li>
            <li> I had one similar to this in the past.  It just broke apart in my hand.  This one has a case so I&#x27;m hopeful that it will last longer.  Price was good.  I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a lot though.  So far it works great and has not fallen apart.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a replacement for my Remington brand and came across this one. It works pretty well. It&#x27;s not as sharp but it does the trick</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer.  I&#x27;ve had this about 6 months now and it&#x27;s still sharp and works well.  I would recommend this as a personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this product it doesn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t cut anything</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and compact, have had it for months now and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised and in excellent condition. It works perfect;y for all the purposes advertised. I have used it for several months now. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love this razor! The eyebrow trimmer is a waste but the actual razor works great!</li>
            <li> I got it for an all around shaver but I soon realized it works great on the face but not really anywhere else.  I intended to help with my bikini area but it really dosen&#x27;t function too well in that region.  Regardless, it does a good job on the little areas!</li>
            <li> I am perplexed by the good ratings on this product I think it&#x27;s horrible. It barely picked up peach fuzz and I had to go over the hair several times just to pick anything up at all. I had a finishing touch, and it just stopped working after about 2 years of use. I bought this thinking for the price and based on the reviews it would be better. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for sentitive skin at great price......you could it to shave eye brows.....bikini area....and under the arm...just need some batteries</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these trimmers (different brands) over the years but I can honestly say the Pkillips is the best.  It is powerful and does the job well.  The added bonus was the tweezer with the light and a nice little case to keep it in.  Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and last longer using battery and worth to buy it, u can use it in many different purposes( euebrow, sideburn, etc about grooming) i like it alot!</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Soma h personal care uses for this.</li>
            <li> Pulls the hair instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use any attachments, except the trimming comb, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I have blonde fuzz that shines in the sun but doesn&#x27;t really show in indoor light.  I will be heading to Texas and Colorado soon and this took care of all the pesky bits on my face that I don&#x27;t want people seeing.  The tweezers are magic - more effective than any other type I&#x27;ve used and especially so with the light.  Attachments for hair trimming (like for eyebrows) were a little less amazing than i anticipated but that&#x27;s okay, I got them to work.  All in all, this is a great package for the price.</li>
            <li> This little thing is good for quick, minor uses. If you want actual trimming or grooming then I&#x27;d try one of the larger ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Panasonic Cosmetic Groomer ES119 which I have had for a few years and always worked well.  I just wanted a newer one, but couldn&#x27;t find one available.  So I opted for this trimmer and the first time I touched it to my upper lip area it was a very sharp pain that I felt.  It didn&#x27;t cut me, but it felt like it.  I didn&#x27;t want to try it again, but I thought maybe I had it at a bad angle.  Not the case.  The second time I was able to take 2 strokes without pain and then it happened!  OUCH!  Don&#x27;t waste your money or risk the pain.  Oh, it was also a brand new battery I was using.  I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li> It was described as improved and updated. However, the product is the same as previous model, and is poorly constructed. The &amp;#34;on button&amp;#34; does not always function; it is an inferior design.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is just right for a quick fix and great for travel. The add-ons of eyebrow comb attachments and tweezers with light are a second bonus for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product every women can rely on. Easy to use.. easy to carry. :) comes with good accessories, one can use this product daily.</li>
            <li> I got this one after my Remington one broke after several months. I really like this one better, it&#x27;s well made, slightly heaver then other ones I&#x27;ve used, and the blades work really well with no nipping or tugging. It&#x27;s very smooth to use. And I like that it comes with an eyebrow trimmer attachment as well. The bonus tweezers with the light didn&#x27;t work out for me. The light is great, but the tweezers themselves didn&#x27;t grasp any of the hairs, so for me it was pointless. Wish someone could attach my Revlon tweezers to the light.</li>
            <li> I just received this the other day and have found that this is infinitely better than the Finishing Touch.  I had bought three of those in the past, and have found already that this is much better quality and gets a much closer and complete shave than the Finishing Touch.  I hope it lasts longer and is also easier to clean than the Finishing Touch.  I would highly recommend this personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> no pain, works perfectly, easy to use, small and light so i can carry it around, and really practical to use</li>
            <li> I have bought other products locally but this one is superior in quality. I am happy with this purchase. I recommend it if you have used a different one before and are not happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Broke after 6 months. Amazon not willing to replace. NO WARRANTY ON PHILIPS???Brutal company</li>
            <li> Does what it should do and comfortably. She has no complaints when using the guards or using it without a guard on her bare skin. Havent owned it long, so no comments on reliability but it seems to be built well and pretty sturdy. Shes dropped it on the floor twice and without consequence.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful about these things...&lt;br /&gt;Eye brows: I did the spots where I usually tweeze (what&#x27;s the point of going to the salon for what I could do myself?) and it worked well! On the us side, you can use it on your boyfriend! My eye brow hairs are pretty long and it trimmed it to the right spot where it&#x27;s not too long or too short.&lt;br /&gt;Mustache: I don&#x27;t get a full grown man mustache but I do get hair around that area. I&#x27;ve been using nair and it&#x27;s a pain! This got ride of it in no time at all...much appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;Bekini line: I use a regular saver for down there. BUT..there&#x27;s those hairs that still show no matter what&#x27;s and this took care of them!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m was doubtful about this product but for its low price, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> Good product- works well -seems like it will last awhile. Comes with a handy little bad, neat and well made. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Very interesting product! Glad I bought it. Will make trimming those small hairs a lot easier!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! I have been looking for something to get all those &amp;#34;small spaces&amp;#34; you don&#x27;t want to harm yourself by trimming (ladies, you know what I mean) and I just got it and used it for the first time tonight. It was way better than I ever could have expected and works like a charm!!! No cuts, no bleeding, and I even trimmed those blonde eyebrow hairs with it with ease. Buy this now! You won&#x27;t regret it. First 5-star review I have ever taken the time to post!</li>
            <li> Not as smooth on the face as a previous brand I used,kind of a scratchy feeling,probably will be looking for a different brand</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have PCOS and can wax my face up to 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people without PCOS, waxing usually helps the hair come back lighter and less frequently, but for people with PCOS, waxing is a joke.  I might as well just shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of ripping my skin apart with waxing so I started using this trimmer and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out, I have saved money (and skin) by being able to trim my circus show beard down to nothing.  I use a coil spring on my mustache, but have used the trimmer on the mustache, too, and it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow trimming tool is nice.  My spouse borrows the trimmer for this sometimes, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is waiting so long to buy one of these.  Best purchase of 2012.</li>
            <li> I have purchased multiple brands of trimmers and the Philips HP6390 Precision Perfect Trimmer seems to be the best in my opinion. This trimmer comes with an adjustable guide and lighted tweezers which are very helpful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a little better quality than the one that was sold on tv and in stores, but if you are trying to trim anything but \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot;, it leaves a stubble.  Even just a few coarse facial hairs leave a stubble like a regular razor. Okay for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Works great, and comes with multiple accessories. I was not expecting such a high quality product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I used to buy cheap trimmers, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very powerful and acutually does trim facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a small mirror and twizzer.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the good reviews,however the plastic end holding the razor broke into 2 pieces within a month of using it.I only used it a handful of times ,if even.This was only my 2nd experience with facial hair trimmers.I had a generic simple inexpensive model the first time that lasted me a long ,long time.But no such luck with this one!</li>
            <li> No only does the trimmer work wonderfully, it comes with lighted tweezers that are fabulous. I used another brand for years and this one is better. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this super little trimmer is really outstanding.  Easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> O.K.  I&#x27;m of Italian heritage and yes...I get facial hairs.  I have several trimmers, but really didn&#x27;t care for any of them, except for Emjoy which they don&#x27;t make anymore.  I find this to get close, but not irritating on the face.  And to get a great pair of lighted tweezers with it is awesome!  I can&#x27;t afford the pro hair removers, so to me, this is the next best thing.  My roommate also ordered this when she saw mine.  She is anxiously awaiting it&#x27;s arrival.  You CAN&#x27;T beat the price for all that you get.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have the older version of this, in the silver/gray color. I&#x27;ve had it for 15 yrs and it&#x27;s great. I wanted another one in case my old one breaks.  This one is HORRIBLE.  It&#x27;s so sad they&#x27;ve cheapened their product to the point of it being unusable. the cutter is rough and snags hair instead of cutting. It&#x27;s painful and miserable. I think they include the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; mirror and lighted tweasers as an apology in advance for their terrible product.</li>
            <li> this went back. would not cut hair, just pulled. it is not even worth one star. maybe i just got a bad one, but be careful if you order.</li>
            <li> Best facial hair remover I have ever used! It&#x27;s easy to use and also bought another as a gift. Love it.</li>
            <li> This Philips Perfect Trimmer is exactly what I have been looking for.  It works perfectly to remove unwanted hair from my face. I will not let my husband touch it....he has to get his own!</li>
            <li> Works great and is well with the price. I didn&#x27;t realize the lighted tweezers came with so that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I love this Trimmer. What a great deal for all that you get. This isn&#x27;t some dinky halfjob trimmer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> flawless eyebrows on the go!  highly recommend this product when in a hurry and need a quick maintenance.</li>
            <li> Had this and used regularly over a year and still works fantastic! Great item.</li>
            <li> Great Buy !! ......excellent quality product. i just love it ...&lt;br /&gt;its very handy and easy to use. However the tweezer is not that great</li>
            <li> This product sucks! I don&#x27;t think I have ever been this disappointed with a purchase before. I purchased this product instead of another because of all the great reviews it had, BUYER Beware. This product DOES NOT work in the bikini area, unless you count pulling out one or two hairs. It does come with lighted tweezers that are pretty cool, but that is not what I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> Nice product&lt;br /&gt;Bought if for my wife and she loved the ease with which this can be used. Also, attachments were good</li>
            <li> Bought this last year and just got around to opening it and trying it out.  What an unpleasant experience!  Tugged and pulled at hair and after 5 minutes, I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and back in the box it went!  Now I am shopping online to find something else!</li>
            <li> Works, was a great replacement for my previous trimmer. The tweazers a an abomination to tweazers I could not pluck the longest and thickest of eyebrow hairs with them.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use to trim eyebrows instead of using tweezers. Never hurts!</li>
            <li> I have used two other trimmers prior to this one and this one is just okay. When trimming, it&#x27;s not as smooth as the other trimmers I&#x27;ve had. I do, however, liked that it came with tweezers.</li>
            <li> This one lacks strength and sharpness? I have owned several trimmers and this one is by far the least effective. Not recommended</li>
            <li> I use this for my upper lip and side burns and it does the job and allows me to avoid messy/ineffective depilatory creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However contrary to reviews, this doesn&#x27;t work on any other body part as the blade is too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the free tweezer with light is a piece of junk as it doesn&#x27;t actually pluck anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, works fine for face.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a lot more energy than the one I had previously (Remington), so there was a learning curve.  It does a very good job and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> A little rougher than I would like, but will do in a pinch. Wouldn&#x27;t reorder.It pulls a little when you use it.</li>
            <li> Works well, I just use it to trim the stray hairs, and, it really does a good job.My son uses it to trim his brows. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> i thought it would be a good bikini trimmer, but it&#x27;s way too small to do much more than eyebrows, and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem sharp enough. maybe it will work on straggling single bikini hairs, but it will probably just grab the hair and pull it. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you want to trim your bikini area.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this  bit it will be ok for what it is needed for  simple and convenient is about itok</li>
            <li> I find this trimmer OK, but I think it &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; more than others I&#x27;ve had in the past.  It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about how the trimmer &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; your hair instead of trimming.  They were right!  I thought that maybe other people werent using it right, and that I knew better.  I was so wrong.  It pulls the hair and it takes so many passes to get the hair trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had several as I do my own eyebrows and use for that missed spot when I shave.  This is absolutely great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice. The first time it was great. After a couple of years I needed a new one. I purchased the same one. It&#x27;s terrible! It barely removes any hair. I won&#x27;t be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month now and it sucks. It pulls the hair out instead of shaving it off. It hurts! Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I was in desperate need of a trimmer. I think that this is a great trimmer, and it definitely serves all of my trimming needs. There are some tools in the box that help me get my desired trimming outcome, and I also love the tweezers with the LED for better view! Love this item! Recommend it to everybody who needs one!</li>
            <li> Cut is not very good.</li>
            <li> I dont understand how people said they like this product. I bought it was high hopes but it literally does absolutely nothing. I wanted it for eyebrows/upper lip/ random parts of my face and I just nothing happened when I run it through the area-still have all the hair I started with. I dont get it. It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> works wonders I don&#x27;t knowvwhy I disnt purchase before .. my triming expirence was wonderfull.&lt;br /&gt;....must buy for great result</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a powerful trimmer but it will do small areas very well. The price was right for the job it does and it&#x27;s so pink!</li>
            <li> this was working great up til now .. I went to go change the battery and suddenly it does not work at all. I needed the razor and now i have to go buy another one! This got such a high rating and that was why I bought it,  but now it&#x27;s just a non working piece of crap - and now I have to go find yet another razor --- right when i need it the most! I suggest you just stick to using a normal shaver in the shower and forget these stupid trimmers - they don&#x27;t last at all!  And I don&#x27;t trust the reviews on this site anymore! crap!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  I have fine blonde facial hair along my jawline.  You do get stubble after a few days as if you used a regular razor, but, again, my facial hair is very fine so I don&#x27;t really notice it.  I am hoy with it.</li>
            <li> Does not come with batteries, which is fine. But this is pretty cool. works excellent and I love the light that is connected to the tweezers! Perfect! Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Uses a AAA battery for the trimmer and a watch battery (included) for the light on the tweezers. Great product.</li>
            <li> Producto de excelente calidad, fácil manejo, corta con precisión sin irritar la piel, ademas que puedes llevarlo contigo a todas partes...</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. I have had this over a year now and it still works great. No pain, no fuss, no maintenance. I haven&#x27;t even had to change the batteries. I am definitely satisfied and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I am fair-skinned And have a very light colored \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; on my cheeks that probably no one notices but me.  However, it bothers me.  I did not want to spend a lot of money to remove this hair and decided to try this one after reading the other reviews.  I love it.  I haven&#x27;t had it long but even if it only lasts 6 months it&#x27;s worth it to me.  As little as I need it, it should last my much longer than that.</li>
            <li> i love it. Works fine for me. I onlymusemit on my under arms. So anywhere else i dont know how well it does</li>
            <li> A little more substantial than the ones you buy in bed bath and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;A decent product for the money.</li>
            <li> NOT only is the color a great pick me up and screams girly it does it&#x27;s job well. I just use it for the hair that comes down pass my ear on my face, in between my eyebrows in between waxing and my upper lip. No problems yet and it&#x27;s under $20</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HELP ME LOOK BETTER. SMALL HAIR ON MY FACE BE CUT WITHOUT HURT THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I think its a typical &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; product - did not live up to my expectations based on review. Also there is some whirring sound when we use it on the skin.</li>
            <li> Good for face &amp; nose. Gets all those hairs and is very easy to use. It also came with a tweezer.</li>
            <li> Works great. only complaint I have is that I use it for trimming my husband&#x27;s neck line. I wish it would have come in a more neutral color (or unisex color). Other than that, the tweezers that come with it are pretty cool. Has a little light. Nice little bonus!</li>
            <li> Received this to replace an older one (different brand) that finally just wouldn&#x27;t work anymore (had it for 6 years).  It came quickly and so far it does a very good job.  If it lasts as long as my older one, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  Poor quality and barely works on fine facial hair.  Also beware of the pulling when using it, it hurts.</li>
            <li> It works great for thick hair but not for fine thin hair. either that or it dulls quickly, i like that it has many attachments for different results</li>
            <li> easy to use and does a fabulous job!  fits perfect in travel bag and I love the color...very girlie girl!</li>
            <li> Works great, the extra pieces are sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or weak.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus lighted tweezers with mirror are nice too.</li>
            <li> I use this for my face, getting the hairs right between my eyebrows &amp; hair line on the side, it does the job perfectly. No stubble or anything manly, it&#x27;s like I plucked the hairs</li>
            <li> This works excellent. For all these bad reviewers.. you must have excessive hair because this clearly is for basic trimming and I&#x27;m able to trim any facial hair very easily! Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Precise and sharp!  I was afraid for the cost this trimmer would be dull and would pull and leave a rash.  I am delighted that it stays sharp and cuts clean!</li>
            <li> Although I do not need all the benefits of this  product I&#x27;m impressed with the versatility of it&lt;br /&gt;It does the shaving job for me and its made well, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer rocks!  It is very powerful for its size and works very well.  In comparison to other trimmers similar - not to mention any names - I would say to spend a little more money and get this trimmer.  It is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regard to the similar product, it is not near as powerful and does not last too long before it dies and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  Did not work as described which I didn&#x27;t find until I used it.  Now I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace another type of hair trimmer I had purchased in the past b/c the charging port had broken.  I was very disappointed with this unit. I felt like it pulled the hair more than trimmed it. I would not recommend this trimmer to any of my friends and I am glad it was only 10.00.</li>
            <li> This trimmer for women is okay. Not the best I have ever used but it gets the job done. I bought it to trim my bikini line and it works good, for some reason I thought the trimmer head was going to be a little longer. I really liked the lighted tweezers that came with it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for all the ladies!  The color is nice, works great for a variety of trimming jobs.  This comes with a lighted tweezer!  Great item.</li>
            <li> The product can be a bit painful, but you are removing your hair and buying a trimmer not a 103598032 dollar magical treatment, so no pain no gain? I actually have terribly sensitive skin and this trimmer doesn&#x27;t irritate it in the slightest. For those who are looking to do a bikini trim and who are having issues with pain, pulling, etc., douse your skin in a bit of baby powder first. It helps loads and makes the trimmer more effective.</li>
            <li> weak. pulls/pinches areas that should not be pulled or pinched. replaced it with something meatier from the men&#x27;s section. Don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but so far so good. It&#x27;s better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used before, plus I love the eyebrow guide attachment and handy little brush to clean out after using.</li>
            <li> I have very thick eyebrows that grow fast and are tedious to maintain. This trimmer comes with a head attachment for length trimming, and an additional set of tweezers that light up. They all work great!!! Would definitely recommend this for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I have owned other little trimmers that have worked better.  This is not sharp at all.  It pulls the hairs instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a few of these on hand.  A very necessary tool.</li>
            <li> bought for elderly lady and she could not use it successfully.</li>
            <li> I like this and recommend for anyone. You can carry this trimmer anywhere u go and it doesn&#x27;t cut like razors would, which is good. . My opinion good gift!</li>
            <li> As soon as I put the battery in, I fell in love. It was the most powerful precision trimmer I have ever used. When it came time for the second use, it magically lost 90% of its power (to the point where its pulling the hairs). This would be a 5 star rating, but it simply doesn&#x27;t cut anymore and I have to throw it away &#x3D;(. I even changed the battery. Maybe this is just a defective one? I don&#x27;t know. And I couldn&#x27;t have broke it by trying to use it on thick hair. I was using it for toe, stomach, etc.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works better than most and I have had dozens of these that are so cheaply made they end up being worthless after a few uses. This one so far works great.</li>
            <li> The plain trimming head is great for trimming short hairs/peach fuzz on your face. You can get some of your nose hairs too. :P I did not find it that great for eyebrow trimming or shaping (hence 4 stars). I don&#x27;t use the accessories very often, and I only use it on my face so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works on other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> It works great.  Like that cap fits tightly.</li>
            <li> My nose hair trimmer just stopped working.  I&#x27;m not going to replace it with the same trimmer.  That would be stupid!</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the job, however after the second use the top part of the trimmer needs to be held together so it doesn&#x27;t fall apart when it&#x27;s on.  It isn&#x27;t the biggest deal for me because I don&#x27;t use it that often, but it is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> i like this somewhat i tends to scratch my skin . and sometime it doesnt want to come on but it does the job when i need to use it wish it were better quality I like the tweezers that come it it very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and althouth this isn&#x27;t perfect it is easy to use.  Easy to use on eyesbrows too, always a plus.</li>
            <li> For some reason it is hard to get a kit like this around where I live; I couldn&#x27;t find one in my local stores. But finally this seemed to fit the bill and my needs when I found it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works really nice and smoothly. And I like the eyebrow trimming head, integrated light, mirror, and adjustable trimming comb as bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this kit is the tweezers really. It is a little rough to &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34; hairs: hard to grab them therefore making it difficult for the rest of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself is smooth to hold and soft on skin. The batteries last long for me at least.</li>
            <li> This slender trimmer is perfect for shaving those delicate, private areas.  It is quick and efficient.  This trimmer is much nicer than those trimmers that you find at Wal-Mart or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The blade is my main issue because of its ragged edge, which has the tendency to pull the hair rather than a clean shave if used without  the  detachable head for long hairs. The blade can be removed and replaced but one would have to get a blade that size to fit  the trimmer. There is a light, a tweezer, and a mirror  in a separate case which is good for plucking hard to trim hairs. Never tried it but very neat and well packaged.  It is battery operated  as  well. I give it a 4 star for it&#x27;s versatility.</li>
            <li> Poor performance lacking in power and disappointed. When trimming, It&#x27;s not as smooth as the other trimmers and pulls hair.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. The attachments are nice but most of the time I don&#x27;t need them. The tweezers are a nice little extra as well. Overall good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this little trimmer.  The aded attachments are impressive as well.  It is effective and a very good purchase. I bought one for my daughter as well.  She is also impressed with this trimmer. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well, it worked once. Worthless, and although not expensive, it&#x27;s $12 down the drain. Don&#x27;t bother; buy a trimmer from a local store, where you can return it if necessary - and stay away from Philips. Very low quality.</li>
            <li> After purchasing numerous trimmers in the past, this one works the best.  I would highly recommend to women with unwanted hair in unwanted areas.</li>
            <li> I picked one of these up at Target for $14.99 - cheaper on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for the annoying hairs (anywhere you may have them), this will definitely take care of them painlessly, efficiently, and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how one of the other reviewers got hurt. I&#x27;ve used it at every weird angle  and didn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. Well done Philips HP6390/50 Precision Perfect Trimmer!</li>
            <li> The trimmer has been great. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone. It does the job, no problems as of now.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It comes with a pair of tweezers with a led light. It doesn&#x27;t bite, and covers a lot of area in a short time. I received this item earlier than the estimated date, and it comes with a 2 year warranty. It also comes with a comb with 2 length sets.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the fact that it comes with an additional tweezer with a light. It works well on trimming fine hair and saves me a trip to get threading or waxing done.</li>
            <li> A bargain price for a quality product.. The product I had before cost a lot more and was not as well made.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer with useful accessories! Extremely functional, good looking, portable, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. The &amp;#34;luxury tweezers&amp;#34; was a really nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to the negative reviews, I have never experienced any &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; or pain when using the product. Easy to use, effective, and pain-free for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely preferred my Panasonic to this model.  It just leaves behind several of the coarse hairs, it does fine on light soft hair though.</li>
            <li> I usually keep one of the shavers at all times.  This one works better than the other brands I have used.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to figure out.  No more dealing with a razor on my face.  I use it weekly at least.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t pay too much for this product; unfortunately, it was a waste of money. The product works in the sense that the motors run; however, it catches on the hair and pull on it rather than cutting it. I didn&#x27;t even bother to give it another try and tossed it.</li>
            <li> Great product for removing the hair that grows around the mouth when you age.  Very gentle and shaves very well</li>
            <li> yes, it met the repuirement perfectly. it gave a good close shave. I have a problem with hair on my lip and the Phillps HP6390 did a great job.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for quick &#x27;clean ups&#x27; of hairy areas.  It works as expected and described.  I would buy it again</li>
            <li> It did not work as well as i had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she loves these, uses them weekly and no issues, good quality, they just eat batteries!</li>
            <li> it is very good but the issues i had was the batteries, i didnt know which type I need until i i bought a couple to see if they fit.</li>
            <li> It broke after the first week. The cutting part isn&#x27;t attached well it just pops off. It worked well till then.</li>
            <li> Love this! It works great for your mustache, eyebrows and any other hair on face!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and even came with free tweezers with a light. Don&#x27;t know how I lived without this for so long!</li>
            <li> Best one I have ever had.  It shaves close so I don&#x27;t have to do it very often.  I haven&#x27;t had it long so I am hoping it lasts.</li>
            <li> used it to shape up my eye brows love it .. stong blades. strong product. love it&lt;br /&gt;easy to use !</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer I have ever used so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but it&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s completely painless and I love the easy covenient size!</li>
            <li> I love this product, its the perfect little trimmer for eye brows, I even used it on my fiances beard and it worked great. It doesn&#x27;t do as quick of a shave as I&#x27;d like on the eye brows but the included tweezers gets the job done! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This trimmer gives a closer shave and the unit last longer than other brands I have tried, like Remington.  I will be buying this trimmer again when needed.</li>
            <li> When we used it, the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t cut hair very well.  We had to run it over and over again to cut it, but even then it didn&#x27;t really cut it very well.  It was like the blade didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> So I bought this because my $75 one I bought off of another site died on me (it wasn&#x27;t the first one to do so) and I figured it would be an alright replacement until I could afford the other one again. However, I will not be needing to buy the other one because this one works tons better than the expensive one I had! It gets right down to almost bare skin and doesn&#x27;t clog up or stop working at any point because of too much hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, have snagged hair but because I was using it the moving side down and I think thats why. flip t over so the guard is on your skin and it works great!</li>
            <li> I looked at quite a few before settling for this one. I am happy with my choice. well made .</li>
            <li> Item was as described....works well!! Glad I purchased item would recommend to anyone needing a shaver!! Great gift idea also!!</li>
            <li> This is ideal and works like it is supposed too.Small enough to carry in purse.Does not scratch or leave burn marks.</li>
            <li> This product does what it advertises. I had another trimmer like this one that somehow walked away... I am glad to have the little trimmer to use around my face. I would purchase this again if I needed another trimmer.</li>
            <li> works just as described, wanted this for facal hair removal,&lt;br /&gt;first time using a product like this, normally used scissors.&lt;br /&gt;fits perfectly in purse or pocket, just as expected.&lt;br /&gt;works great!</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time and packaged very well! I tried the product immediately it worked as advertised. It did not pinch or pull my skin and was easy to clean. I would advise reading the instructions to get the full benefits.</li>
            <li> Love this, works great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Finishing Touch in the past, but I found this trimmer very easy to use.  It also does a better job in removing the hair from my face and upper lip.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The wife is a big fan.  It didn&#x27;t get as close as we had hoped, but I am very happy with the purchase.  Quick shipment also!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine hair on my body which I was using this for.  It got caught and did not trim - very poorly made - STAY CLEAR</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer- it works great and came with a tweezer and mirror- gets the job done- great price- great delivery</li>
            <li> Ordered this to help tame my eyebrows and it works great! I also use it on my fine upper lip hair. Definitely worth the money and the pink color is great!</li>
            <li> Very handy and quick i like it alot.....worth the price and seems to be very sturdy and well made :)</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great! I bought it to take care of stray hairs when I dont have time to wax , and it gets the job done perfectly. Compact and fits in my purse.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my facial hair is light and fine.  Consequently, I cannot use laser hair removal.  I have tried creams, by Avon and Neet and they caused rashes.  I tried &amp;#34;No No&amp;#34; and it cut my skin!  I tried the REM and it was much too painful.  I tried the buffing products and they did nothing at all.  Finally, I tried this little Philips Trimmer and it works!!  There is no pain, no rash, no discomfort at all.  To use, just have clean, dry skin, apply some powder (I use baby powder) and use this trimmer.  The shaving head is very small so it is easy to use around the nose and lips.  There is a cleaning brush included and I use this 2 or 3 times during each session. I am so please to have found the facial hair removal item for me!</li>
            <li> My daughter has one and likes it. I got mine and having never used one before, am not too sure I want to again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best micro trimmer I have purchased to date . Will Order again.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be superior to others of the same ilk I have purchased at the drugstore over the years. It does a much better job more quickly and I plan to re-buy another just like it when this one wears out. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product from this seller, however, I bought it at Walmart for a mere $7.00. It was on clearance and there were so many of them I could not walk away from the awesome deal. First I grabbed it without even looking at the features. There&#x27;s a small compact mirror, a tweezer with built in led light, and a few other attachments. The color is stunning and does not look obvious that it is a facial trimmer at all. I tried it right away and was impressed with the results. I usually buy thE \\&quot;AS SEEN ON TV\\&quot; facial trimmer but got so sick of it; I wanted to try something new. If I cannot find this at Walmart again I will buy on Amazon. Amazing!</li>
            <li> This trimmer definitely gets the job done. I like that it&#x27;s compact and discrete, it kind of looks like a pen when the cap is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes have problems with it turning on and not being at &amp;#34;full power&amp;#34;, even with fresh batteries. I have to turn it on and off a few times before it&#x27;s humming away at full speed.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and item as listed.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, clean and works super well. Wouldn&#x27;t mind a different color but this is my favorite of the 5 I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li> i love this.i&#x27;ve been using it ever since i bought this and it&#x27;s still good. works good and prize is good for it too.if you want this you have to get it because it works good.i might get another one for someone as a gift.</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It gets maybe one hair in each sweep, if you&#x27;re lucky.  You cannot use it to actually make an area better, even if it is the tiny upper lip area.  It is horrible and useless.</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer before this that had a light on it. I wish this one had a light.&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise, it is great!</li>
            <li> It is effective, but I am klutzy and prefer waxing at the salon. This is for emergency clean up. up</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I had a remmington one for years and it finally broke.  This one is better quality and works really well.</li>
            <li> Works great, the best one I&#x27;ve bought so far. I would recommend it for use on the face. Good price.</li>
            <li> It was not as good as I hoped. It does the trick but I thought it would trim more efficient.</li>
            <li> Does its job just fine, and the tweezer/ mirror combo is great! Cute color, and pretty easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> pulled the hair on my face and hurt</li>
            <li> No pain at all!  Wonderful product.  The only thing that would make it better would be a carrying case but a ziploc does the trick!</li>
            <li> It works really well when it comes to trim my eyebrows! I haven&#x27;t tried on any place else yet. I even tried once on my hubby&#x27;s facial hair....works! lol</li>
            <li> I had a similar bikini area trimmer and had to replace it. This one here had the best reviews, so I went with it. It says it&#x27;s good on the bikini area, but it definitely is not. The last one I had was a guys one, and I should&#x27;ve gone for a guys one again as their stuff always works significantly better than products for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is very small, and so are the trimmers. It tugs and pulls bikini hair even if you just look at the trimmer wrong. I have to go over the same part multiple times just to cut ONE hair, it&#x27;s ridiculous. It&#x27;s not like I have gnarly thick hair or anything, either. It trims off the eyebrow hair (the little blond ones) just fine (I tried this as a test as I was eager to use it, but I don&#x27;t switch back and forth, just to be clear).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weird little plastic trimming heads are absolutely useless. The head doesn&#x27;t even poke out enough to trim anything. Is it just a comb? Doesn&#x27;t say so on the booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not trim well, at all. It hurts. I&#x27;ll be looking for another one, sadly. I don&#x27;t think I can return it now that it&#x27;s been used, since that would be unhygienic. The little brush was a nice touch. But that was really it. It absolutely sucks for bikini area trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Precise bikini shaping and gentle bikini trimming\\&quot; my butt. I&#x27;m less nervous shaving with a razor than I am with this trimmer!</li>
            <li> This has a much sturdier feel than similar products (i.e., Finishing Touch or Revlon trimmers), and so far has worked perfectly.  It also came with lighted tweezers, which I&#x27;m not especially interested in but was a nice touch.  I usually need to replace other brands about once a year; I suspect this one will outlast that by a good stretch.</li>
            <li> I have used this product only once since I haven&#x27;t  had it that long but it  works fine and it was much cheaper than I paid for one from QVC.</li>
            <li> I love that this is battery operated, because I can just throw in a rechargeable battery quite easily. Corded items are a hassle if you&#x27;re nowhere near a plug in, so this trimmer is quite portable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face and legs mainly. It easily gets at those small, but noticeable hairs between my eyebrows and at the corners of my lips. It also found it to be quite convenient for hard to get places when shaving or epilating, and will take this trimmer to my knees or even those gross long hairs along my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t run into any problems with it yet and hope that it continues to meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4/5 stars, because it doesn&#x27;t work as well with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> For the price this little trimmer is great.  I have peachy fuzz on my chin and hate looking like a goat.  This takes care of it and I didn&#x27;t have to pay a fortune.</li>
            <li> Use this for wispy fine hairs or touching up \\&quot;down there.\\&quot; Trim the hair short before using. This product does not do everything but it is worth having in your arsenal. Can be used on fine facial hair without irritation. If you can afford better, go for higher quality, but this is decent for a poor grad student like me. It is much better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect it to get as close as a razor, but the hair that it leaves behind is very difficult to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;positives:&lt;br /&gt;+small&lt;br /&gt;+adjustable guide (makes the area to trim larger or smaller (be careful not to nick yourself when putting it on or taking it off)&lt;br /&gt;+ smart tweezers with a light are perfect for cleaning up stray hairs--love em&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-loud--someone might think that you&#x27;re using a vibrator ;)&lt;br /&gt; also, if you press down hard it hurts. Just use it gently.&lt;br /&gt;- disposable with no replacement blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change the batteries if it slows down over time.</li>
            <li> So far this trimmer has been great. I have bought so many other brands and they last about 4 weeks and start falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;This product including shipping was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Largely ineffectual. You practically have to use it hair follicle-by-follicle, and only then if the hair has already been trimmed to a stub. Not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer it is perfect for bikini area - razor always left me with razor burn and now it is so easy and never leaves any marks</li>
            <li> I use this unit to keep myself &amp;#34;maintained&amp;#34; without having to go through the pain or expense of more costly permanent methods of facial hair removal.  A stray here and there are quickly taken care of and the attachments make shaping/grooming of the eyebrows a cinch.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This works...a little bit...if you spend enough time on one area. However, I found that the only way it worked was by pulling the hair out (very unevenly I should add), it barely trimmed anything. I ended up returning it.</li>
