            <li>I am very happy and will continue to use the drops and my husband is taking 1 drop a day as a preventative.  </li>
            <li>I immediately saw my superb ophthalmologist (summa cum laude from Mt. Sinai), and was relieved to be told that I had a cataract.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a Happy Camper!.........</li>
            <li>they work real good.</li>
            <li>Came with great instructions at a great price!</li>
            <li>I was using the Can-C brand which works great</li>
            <li>I am happy to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>I also take Vita Cost Eye bright.  </li>
            <li>Good luck and good night.</li>
            <li>After a bit of searching I found Vision Clarity Carnosine Drops, for a fair price and upon arrival, started using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for computer eyestrain also.</li>
            <li>Even I didn&#x27;t, after I was able to see again, I am embarrassed to say!</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>And the light flashes also greatly diminished until they too were gone.  </li>
            <li>seems to be a good product if it performs like it says it will remains to be seen form the money I will be sure to use all of it.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to report that, after using them for about 4 months, I was able to read again without hindrance.</li>
            <li>&quot; I laughed, saying I didn&#x27;t think most people had the motivation to be putting eyedrops in their eyes diligently.</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;ve been effective at delaying onset as when I&#x27;m skint, and use one drop a day instead of two, light halos and glare in my good eye</li>
            <li>I sure can see better!  </li>
            <li>Citric acid exists in greater than trace amounts in a variety of fruits and vegetables, most notably citrus fruits.</li>
            <li>This site explains it better than I can......</li>
            <li>At that point he was able to see them.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t know anything about the impact upon the cataracts for many months of course.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions to a tee......</li>
            <li>You are in control of puncturing the top to get the drops out of the bottles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing though.</li>
            <li>So I checked out as many sites as I could find.</li>
            <li>Not talking about overnight miracle, but a better result that what he got.  </li>
            <li>She said that the drops worked just OK.  </li>
            <li>but In my case I found them help ful, Plus I&#x27;m seeing better too ,</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE PRICE OF THIS PRODUCT IS LOWER THAN MOST AND</li>
            <li>UNLIKE MANY OTHERS</li>
            <li>wanted to make sure the product contains &#x27;carnosine&#x27;</li>
            <li>night seems better.</li>
            <li>The producer is very comunitative and does follow up with the product and give good insenitives to buy again from them</li>
            <li>If I would have know about this stuff, I would have used it first and been able to avoid surgery!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t claim that these descriptions are accurate, but they seem to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>The most exciting news however, is with my 15 yr.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel any significant improvement to my blurry eyes.</li>
            <li>He has been using this product for about 3 months and seen a significant reduction in the amount of floaters he sees.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>At first it burns on the first application, but then it is nice and cool.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say which works better</li>
            <li>I used them for a full year, and at this year&#x27;s check up I was told I had no sign of cataracts</li>
            <li>I said I have not noticed a difference for good or ill in my vision, however the &amp;#34;clarity&amp;#34; of my eye&#x27;s appearance has improved GREATLY.  </li>
            <li>We looked closely at her eyes and even the large cataract on her right eye has almost disappeared!!  </li>
            <li>I am very, very pleased with this product, the only drawback, as others have mentioned, sometimes the drops sting a bit.  </li>
            <li>it is effective or not, that will require examination by my eye doctor later on.</li>
            <li>Wow, thank you Vision Clarity and Amazon for such a great product.  </li>
            <li>but IMHO they&#x27;re worth a try.  </li>
            <li>REVIEWS\\&quot; -- WHEN THE FAULT IS THEIR OWN FOR NOT FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the cost, if it will prevent cataract surgery.</li>
            <li>It arrive on time and the price right.</li>
            <li>I had cataract surgery which made my eyes more cloudy and more black floaters</li>
            <li>deciding on which BRAND to use, I came up with the following research, which I have chosen to share with you readers :)</li>
            <li>If you feel a burning sensation when using these drops, this is more than likely a result of the ingredient Citric Acid</li>
            <li>But this stuff is worth the price - really.</li>
            <li>It is smaller and more translucent than before.</li>
            <li>I recommend these eyedrops HIGHLY!!</li>
            <li>i will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I experienced little or no burning so far.</li>
            <li>It has certainly stopped the cataracts frm developing</li>
            <li>clever!</li>
            <li>If the product works as advertised it will have been worth the price; but after three weeks&#x27; use, no noticeable results so far.</li>
            <li>I guess I really needed these eye drops.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to anyone who wants to preserve their eyesight.</li>
            <li>This was very concerning to me.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing, will order again.</li>
            <li>but when I have &amp;#34;dry eyes&amp;#34; from too much heat in the house...</li>
            <li>I feel that my cataracts are much improved</li>
            <li>Our family will continue to use and hopefully in the future, we will be cataract free.</li>
            <li>MOM IS 87 AND WANTS TO AVOID SURGERY.</li>
            <li>He was in much pain.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say it helped much, I had 4 refills, going to stop now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care why they work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care why they work.</li>
            <li>and i really like them,</li>
            <li>absolutely works for me.  </li>
            <li>I wear contacts during the day and you cant use this with contacts, so I use it at night as I am very restless.  </li>
            <li>It if very soothing to the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted these to work.  </li>
            <li>What I read in the literature says that they are extremely effective with \\&quot;young\\&quot; cataracts, increasing less so, the older the cataract.</li>
            <li>Potassium is a mineral that is found naturally in foods and is necessary for many normal functions of your body.</li>
            <li>My spouse used them as well, but those cataracts were pretty fully developed, so they didn&#x27;t really change.</li>
            <li>We have noticed a steady improvement in her eye clarity.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the eye drops long enough to rate the results, but they were very well packaged, and I feel confident using them.</li>
            <li>but I can say I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Vision Clarity Carnosine is new to me.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for a new product.</li>
            <li>The concentration of benzyl alcohol in its product is \\&quot;USUALLY\\&quot; 0.3%, and is sufficient only to preserve the solution for 21 days after the bottle is first opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is sold as a lubricant and as relief of discomfort due to minor irritations of the eyes and nothing more.</li>
            <li>There is just the merest hint of tan where there was once a large, white, blouchy scar</li>
            <li>Clear vision at all distances.  </li>
            <li>these cooling drops really clear up my vision and relax my eyes.</li>
            <li>YOU CLAIM THAT IT WILL HELP CLEAR UP A CATARAC IN A DOG&#x27;S EYE &#x3D;</li>
            <li>they clear his eye sight up.</li>
            <li>Found in most common eye wash and eye drop brands like Visine.</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my cataracts are too far gone for this to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of months it is too early to know it</li>
            <li>For a while, I was seeing like a big fingerprint in front of my eyes and no matter how much I blinked, it would not go away.  </li>
            <li>old Maltese.  </li>
            <li>They are priced nearly identically with the exception of the shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have young subcapsular cataracts and have been using NAC for four months.  </li>
            <li>Even though it offers two bottles..it is&lt;br /&gt;still</li>
            <li>Cools hot dry eyes and seems to clear up vision.</li>
            <li>She had a major cataract in one eye that covered almost all the brown and one not quite so large in her left eye.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible I did not use them long enough, but I didn&#x27;t see enough to try more.  </li>
            <li>, looks like all the competitors use the exact same ingredients, which leads me to think that they all use the same manufacturer, since the brand label is a sticker... not inked onto the box like the ingredients.</li>
            <li>doctor seemed annoyed with me, but I am overjoyed to be able to read and drive and live my life with freedom.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Hydroxypropymethycellulose: The ability of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose to absorb water is what has led to one of its most common uses -- as a substitute for human eye tear-film.</li>
            <li>He refused to give me the name and hang up on me.&lt;br /&gt;I have senile cataract, no diabetes, no other health conditions</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have cataracts that I know of and am just using them for general eye health.</li>
            <li>I cannot give it a 5 star because I have not used it long enough to see if it really helps my floaters or cataract.  </li>
            <li>At least when you use it on yourself, you&#x27;ll be aware of how much pain you are in.  </li>
            <li>He apparently could not see cataracts</li>
            <li>After several months my eyes frequently become irritated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;About two years ago, I developed shingles in my left</li>
            <li>Problems apparently solved.  </li>
            <li>He used them and they barely made any improvements to his vision.  </li>
            <li>So far, they have not deteriorated any further, and in fact, may even be improving, so there is something to this stuff.</li>
            <li>When this substance is added to eye drops or other ophthalmologic aids, it increases the amount of time the drops spend on the cornea by absorbing the water that is present and preventing early evaporation.</li>
            <li>I has helped my Shih Tzu tremendously with his juvenile cataracts.</li>
            <li>, Naturally you might want to run -long term- use of these past your Eye Doc first</li>
            <li>eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ailment was cured, however a very noticeable white scar was left in my very dark brown eye.  </li>

            <li> I wear contacts during the day and you cant use this with contacts, so I use it at night as I am very restless.  </li>
            <li> It if very soothing to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work.  </li>
            <li> What I read in the literature says that they are extremely effective with \\&quot;young\\&quot; cataracts, increasing less so, the older the cataract.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the eye drops long enough to rate the results, but they were very well packaged, and I feel confident using them.</li>
            <li> but I can say I highly recommend this product.  </li>

            <li> The concentration of benzyl alcohol in its product is \\&quot;USUALLY\\&quot; 0.3%, and is sufficient only to preserve the solution for 21 days after the bottle is first opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is sold as a lubricant and as relief of discomfort due to minor irritations of the eyes and nothing more.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m willing to give it a try for at least a year.</li>

            <li> My vision lacked clarity at long distances while driving.  </li>
            <li> This keeps the liquid from running out from the outside corners of the eyes which happens if the lids are firmly closed.</li>
            <li> Yet, for me this is a minor annoyance when compared to the scar.  </li>
            <li> As to long term healing I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> And the cataract was not completely gone.</li>
            <li> After doing much research on cataracts and other eye conditions, I bought these drops for my mom since she has small cataracts and severe dry eye.</li>
            <li> The other eye&#x27;s cataract was much smaller to begin with, and he could still see out of the eye, so his vision improved as the cataract diminished.</li>
            <li> This has not happened in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry eyes and also from floaters and a detached vitreous in one eye.</li>

            <li> You can buy cheaper drops for dry</li>
            <li> They clearly state that after applying a drop - which may initially burn - you need to slowly close your eye and leave in shut for 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Theoretically, the longer a lubricant substance stays on an eye, the less irritation suffered.</li>
            <li> (In small amounts), and as such is used by ophthalmologists and in some commercial eye drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is has only been 2 months, but the dryness cleared up (no more red).</li>
            <li> Because I had previously lost my driving vision owing to detached vitreous humors in both eyes that left blobs of floaters in the center of my field of vision, I asked him if the surgery would stir up the floaters.</li>

            <li> Obviously, these drops use a very small amount, however, if you feel a stinging sensation, it&#x27;s likely because of the Citric Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> &lt;&lt;As of date, I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product, but will return with an update in a couple of months.&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On deciding on which BRAND to use, I came up with the following research, which I have chosen to share with you readers :)&lt;br /&gt;As a Disclaimer, I&#x27;m not a professional and I don&#x27;t claim that these descriptions are accurate, but they seem to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, looks like all the competitors use the exact same ingredients, which leads me to think that they all use the same manufacturer, since the brand label is a sticker... not inked onto the box like the ingredients. I therefore chose this brand, because of the cost level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: If you feel a burning sensation when using these drops, this is more than likely a result of the ingredient Citric Acid (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are always concerned about the \\&quot;OTHER\\&quot; ingredients (as they should be!) and so I thought I might list them with a brief description (via google search).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin: stabilizer to maintain pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxypropymethycellulose: The ability of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose to absorb water is what has led to one of its most common uses -- as a substitute for human eye tear-film. When this substance is added to eye drops or other ophthalmologic aids, it increases the amount of time the drops spend on the cornea by absorbing the water that is present and preventing early evaporation. Theoretically, the longer a lubricant substance stays on an eye, the less irritation suffered. Solutions containing 2% hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose are typically used during orbital surgery to protect the corneas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*BORIC ACID: A buffering solution; has an anti-bacterial compound and used as a preservative. Found in most common eye wash and eye drop brands like Visine. Boric acid has the distinction of being the only known acid that is actually beneficial (rather than harmful) to the eyes (In small amounts), and as such is used by ophthalmologists and in some commercial eye drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*CITRIC ACID: A Buffering Solution. Citric acid is a weak organic acid, and it is a natural preservative. Also found in other products like Clear Eyes &amp; Genteal Liquid gel drops. Citric acid exists in greater than trace amounts in a variety of fruits and vegetables, most notably citrus fruits. Obviously, these drops use a very small amount, however, if you feel a stinging sensation, it&#x27;s likely because of the Citric Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N-acetyl-carnosine: This site explains it better than I can...... [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*POTASSIUM BICARBONATE: A Buffering agent and Acid neutralizer. Potassium is a mineral that is found naturally in foods and is necessary for many normal functions of your body. Potassium bicarbonate is used to prevent or to treat a potassium deficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PURIFIED BENZYL ALCOHOL: A preservative. The concentration of benzyl alcohol in its product is \\&quot;USUALLY\\&quot; 0.3%, and is sufficient only to preserve the solution for 21 days after the bottle is first opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterile Water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Buffer solutions are necessary to keep the correct pH balance. I this case, likely 6.8.</li>
            <li> No fuss no muss. Easiest way to buy.</li>
            <li> it did not work at all</li>
            <li> Excellent Product that produces results!</li>
            <li> One week and noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> It arrive on time and the price right. The producer is very comunitative and does follow up with the product and give good insenitives to buy again from them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say whether the product helps cure cataracts. I now have to decide whether to fork over another $25 for a second order. Each of the two vials is very small and after less than three weeks I am well into the second vial. I still wonder why drops containing N acetyl carnosine ingredient are so expensive. If the product works as advertised it will have been worth the price; but after three weeks&#x27; use, no noticeable results so far. Will report back after reordering.</li>
            <li> Excellent results. They seem to be clearing up beginning cataracts after 2 months. I&#x27;ll keep using them for 4 months and reevaluate them. Thank you God.🙏😊</li>
            <li> Not sure if all of the outrageous claims are true. It does bring some relief but my vision is not vastly improving.</li>
            <li> Vision Clarity Carnosine is new to me.  It is for my wife and she is not sure about it.</li>
            <li> It burns my eyes.  Not sure if it is my eyes or the drops.</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old.  Earlier this year my eye doctor observed that he could only correct my vision to 20/40.  He apparently could not see cataracts so he dialated my eyes.  At that point he was able to see them.  He told me that I should probably have surgery in the next year or so.  After several months my eyes frequently become irritated.  My vision lacked clarity at long distances while driving.  Watching television even became annoying after an hour or so.  The eye doctor told me that I do not have glaucoma, my maculas are 20/20, and I am not diabetic.  Also, he said that there is no evidence that I have ever had a stroke.  So, it was a perfect visit to the doctor except for the cataracts.  My Vision Clarity arrived in the mail yesterday morning.  I used it twice yesterday and once this morning.  Amazing!!!  I know that results from the medication are not obtained in 48 hours; but, I had immediate results.  No more eye strain.  No more eye fatigue. Clear vision at all distances.  I feel like I&#x27;m back at 20/20 or close to it. I guess I really needed these eye drops.  Regular eye drops did nothing for me.  I had tried them all.  I won&#x27;t know anything about the impact upon the cataracts for many months of course.  I sure can see better!  Immediate and observable effect.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the drops for a month and I do notice a difference.  I ordered another box.  I am going to give it 6 months and have another eye exam.</li>
            <li> seems to be a good product if it performs like it says it will remains to be seen form the money I will be sure to use all of it.</li>
            <li> It works. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked. I hope you have the same results. Good luck and good night.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my cataracts are too far gone for this to make a difference.  I could not see any benefit after four bottles of it other than keeping my eyes moistened.</li>
            <li> My dog has cataracts, and I have been using this on my dog every day.  I think it works.  It has certainly stopped the cataracts frm developing</li>
            <li> For months I have been using this eye drops but I don&#x27;t feel any significant improvement to my blurry eyes.</li>
            <li> These drops help the eyes stay moist and have ingredients that are beneficial for cataracts. I recommend them to anyone who wants to preserve their eyesight.</li>
            <li> Does not cure cataracts. Surgery is the only option</li>
            <li> Came with great instructions at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I can see a definite improvement in the cataracts on my eyes. I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product in order to try and limit the cataract growth in my eyes. After a couple of months it is too early to know it it is effective or not, that will require examination by my eye doctor later on. I did quite a bit of research into this and assuming the information is correct I&#x27;m willing to give it a try for at least a year. The key is getting the drops to stay in the eyes as long as possible to allow the medication to be absorbed, so I keep my eyelids almost closed but not squeezed shut, for at least a minute. This keeps the liquid from running out from the outside corners of the eyes which happens if the lids are firmly closed. I also roll my eyes to help spread the medication around. I use an inversion table for my lower back problem and have the eye drops administered while in a horizontal position, then tip over to the vertical position which also helps retain the liquid in the eyes. The vials are so small that I want to minimize the amount of wasted material.</li>
            <li> Having been told by my optomotrist, that the beginnings of glaucoma were present, I began looking for a remedy. I found one here. While I noticed nothing amiss with my vision, I took my doctors word on the glaucoma.  After a bit of searching I found Vision Clarity Carnosine Drops, for a fair price and upon arrival, started using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two years ago, I developed shingles in my left eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ailment was cured, however a very noticeable white scar was left in my very dark brown eye.  My vision was not affected, that I noticed, just the scarring. Well, after ten or so days of using these drops, the scar is all but gone!  There is just the merest hint of tan where there was once a large, white, blouchy scar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said I have not noticed a difference for good or ill in my vision, however the &amp;#34;clarity&amp;#34; of my eye&#x27;s appearance has improved GREATLY.  I am very, very pleased with this product, the only drawback, as others have mentioned, sometimes the drops sting a bit.  Yet, for me this is a minor annoyance when compared to the scar.  In a month or so I plan a return visit to my optomotrist to check the status of the glaucoma. I will amend this review with an update at that time.</li>
            <li> For a while, I was seeing like a big fingerprint in front of my eyes and no matter how much I blinked, it would not go away.  They I began seeing these &amp;#34;flashes of light&amp;#34; through the sides of my eyes.  This was very concerning to me.  I&#x27;m telling you, after I put these drops in my eyes and blinked a few times, when I opened my eyes the &amp;#34;finger prints&amp;#34; were completely GONE!!!  And the light flashes also greatly diminished until they too were gone.  All of these symptoms I believe were just from age.  I also take Vita Cost Eye bright.  Problems apparently solved.  But this stuff is worth the price - really.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t entirely remove cataracts, but it does lessen the severity of them. I also take lutein, astataxin, zeastaxin, and vitamins A and E.</li>
            <li> I cannot give it a 5 star because I have not used it long enough to see if it really helps my floaters or cataract.  However, I intend to keep using it for a 6 month period, to see the results.  Be sure to follow the directions to a tee......4 times a day, leaving in 60 seconds....otherwise, we might not get the results it has touted.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, will order again.</li>
            <li> I was using the Can-C brand which works great but, is a little pricy. I decided to try this. I really can&#x27;t say which works better bc., the Can-C cleared my eyes up like you couldn&#x27;t believe but, this is also clearing them too! I had cataract surgery which made my eyes more cloudy and more black floaters and I had this done at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. If I would have know about this stuff, I would have used it first and been able to avoid surgery! I hate doctors all they want is your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Just started using them. I experienced little or no burning so far. One must be patient with them.</li>
            <li> Great for dry eyes.  You are in control of puncturing the top to get the drops out of the bottles. Good for computer eyestrain also.</li>
            <li> this seems to be helping with my cataracts!</li>
            <li> Cools hot dry eyes and seems to clear up vision. As to long term healing I don&#x27;t know but when I have &amp;#34;dry eyes&amp;#34; from too much heat in the house...these cooling drops really clear up my vision and relax my eyes. As a reader I especially recommend this to book lovers.</li>
            <li> I purchased my drops from mfg. website before I knew Amazon carried them.  I have been using for less than a month and the \\&quot;floaters\\&quot; in my eyes that I have had for 20 years are gone.  I feel that my cataracts are much improved but I will know at my next vision appointment.  I am very happy and will continue to use the drops and my husband is taking 1 drop a day as a preventative.  The most exciting news however, is with my 15 yr. old Maltese.  She had a major cataract in one eye that covered almost all the brown and one not quite so large in her left eye.  I have been giving her the same drop 3-4 times a day just like me.  We have noticed a steady improvement in her eye clarity.  Today I noticed that instead of hanging her head and looking at the floor all the time, she had her head up and was watching me as I walked around the room and I was 15-20 feet away.  Also for the past 2 weeks, she has been walking around the house and following us everywhere.  This has not happened in a very long time.  We looked closely at her eyes and even the large cataract on her right eye has almost disappeared!!  It is smaller and more translucent than before. I am sorry the other reviewer had poor results but I can say I highly recommend this product.  All I can say is Wow, thank you Vision Clarity and Amazon for such a great product.  Our family will continue to use and hopefully in the future, we will be cataract free.</li>
            <li> YOU CLAIM THAT IT WILL HELP CLEAR UP A CATARAC IN A DOG&#x27;S EYE &#x3D;6 WEEK&#x27;S WAITING TO SEE SOME PROGRESS?</li>
            <li> PRODUCT COMPARISON:&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered both this product and also the Life Extension Brite Eyes III eye drops and they appear to be identical, manufactured by the same company, in the same bottle and packaging, with the only difference being the paper label on the box. They are priced nearly identically with the exception of the shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DID THEY FEEL:&lt;br /&gt;These drops are clear drops in small vials that last about a month per vial, depending upon use. They sting ever so slightly when applied. I also use sterile saline drops in addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID THEY HELP MY EYE PROBLEMS?  Not sure.  I suffer from dry eyes and also from floaters and a detached vitreous in one eye. I take all kinds of supplements, including Carnosine tablets. I have used these Carnosine eye drops for 10 months now (first, 4 bottles of the Brite Eyes, now 2 bottles of the Vision Clarity and can say that \\&quot;maybe\\&quot; I notice a slight improvement, but so slight I might be imagining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL I REORDER?&lt;br /&gt;Not sure.</li>
            <li> MOM USES THIS AND IT SEEMS TO BE MAKING HER EYES CLEARER.  MOM IS 87 AND WANTS TO AVOID SURGERY.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get anything from this product</li>
            <li> These may be therapeutic and are soothing to the eyes, but my cataract had no change at all and so I saw no healing benefits.  It&#x27;s possible I did not use them long enough, but I didn&#x27;t see enough to try more.  They are expensive so testing them longer on my nickel is not an option.  Not Recommended</li>
            <li> I got it for my dog&#x27;s cataracts.  I put them in his eyes once.  It burnt the pi$$ out of his eyes.  He was in much pain.  I took him to the vets and she prescribed some eye drops to treat his burnt eyes.  Nothing in the directions mention using it for cataracts either.  So, I tried it once and trashed it.  Use it on yourself, but please don&#x27;t torture your pets with it.  At least when you use it on yourself, you&#x27;ll be aware of how much pain you are in.  Spare you pet the pain.  He don&#x27;t deserve it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say it helped much, I had 4 refills, going to stop now.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was experiencing floaters and we read about l-carnosine helping to heal the eyes and get rid of problems like floaters.  He has been using this product for about 3 months and seen a significant reduction in the amount of floaters he sees.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any changes.  It is refreshing though.</li>
            <li> I was getting headaches when reading, and realized that I was not able to make out the letters on a page with my left eye no matter how close or far I held the page. I immediately saw my superb ophthalmologist (summa cum laude from Mt. Sinai), and was relieved to be told that I had a cataract. He said the surgery was 15-minutes, outpatient, no problem. Because I had previously lost my driving vision owing to detached vitreous humors in both eyes that left blobs of floaters in the center of my field of vision, I asked him if the surgery would stir up the floaters. He thought for a minute, and said,\\&quot;It might.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live beyond public transportation, and did not want to risk being held hostage in my home. So I checked out as many sites as I could find. I finally came upon these Vision Clarity l-Carnosine eyedrops, which I used as directed. Hallelujah! I am delighted to report that, after using them for about 4 months, I was able to read again without hindrance. At my yearly checkup, the ophthalmologist&#x27;s assistant noted that I had just read the eye chart to the 20/20 level [with corrective lenses]. She was puzzled, because the preceding year, I was unable to read even the first line on the eyechart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ophthalmologist came in, saying,\\&quot;So! What about these eyedrops that are going to put me out of business?\\&quot; I laughed, saying I didn&#x27;t think most people had the motivation to be putting eyedrops in their eyes diligently. Even I didn&#x27;t, after I was able to see again, I am embarrassed to say! And the cataract was not completely gone. But the cataracts do return, if you don&#x27;t keep up with the eyedrops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note: What I read in the literature says that they are extremely effective with \\&quot;young\\&quot; cataracts, increasing less so, the older the cataract. I noticed this with my dog&#x27;s cataracts. The 4-year-old cataract diminished, and the swelling disappeared, but, as he had already lost vision in that eye, he did not regain vision in it. The other eye&#x27;s cataract was much smaller to begin with, and he could still see out of the eye, so his vision improved as the cataract diminished. He didn&#x27;t seem to mind the eyedrops at all once he got used to it. I held his eye shut after I put the drops in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that it is the cross-linking of the proteins of the eye as the l-carnosine we are born with diminishes [or is used up?] that causes cataracts. If it is simply the replenishing of the l-carnosine that is doing the trick, then hurray! I don&#x27;t really care why they work. I am happy to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My doctor seemed annoyed with me, but I am overjoyed to be able to read and drive and live my life with freedom. I recommend these eyedrops HIGHLY!!e&#x27;s cataract was much smaller to begin with, and he could still see out of the eye, so his vision improved as the cataract diminished.

            <li> They burned, but my husband didn&#x27;t have a problem with that. He used them and they barely made any improvements to his vision.  Keep in mind, he only tried them for 2 months. I figured with the price of the drops, he would&#x27;ve wanted slightly faster results.  Not talking about overnight miracle, but a better result that what he got.  We opted to try another product instead.</li>
            <li> I used vision clarity eye drops for 1 year, following the instructions. I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my vision. Cataracts remains same. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Esther</li>
            <li> So i wanted to write these are a miracle cure, they&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;I have young subcapsular cataracts and have been using NAC for four months.  I know they&#x27;ve been effective at delaying onset as when I&#x27;m skint, and use one drop a day instead of two, light halos and glare in my good eye get worse.&lt;br /&gt;In my bad eye, there was slow but steady progress where for example fonts I could read got smaller.  But much to my disappointment, a few weeks ago it suddenly and overnight got much worse.&lt;br /&gt;Also disappointed that I don&#x27;t see much research as to how to make these drops work for individuals - I was really hopeful about that bad eye.&lt;br /&gt;So this is not medical advice but IMHO they&#x27;re worth a try.  And this is not political lobbying, but if everyone who read this review called the NIH and told them to study this already.....</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Mom who has a chronic and serious case of &amp;#34;dry eye&amp;#34;.  She said that the drops worked just OK.  They helped her a little.  She had wanted Vitamin E eye drops... couldn&#x27;t find any on Amazon...  :(</li>
            <li> Ive used these several weeks now and i really like them, For I&#x27;ve had no problems with them and they knocked Heck out of my floaters and the price of these are unbeatable, Naturally you might want to run -long term- use of these past your Eye Doc first but In my case I found them help ful, Plus I&#x27;m seeing better too , So I&#x27;m a Happy Camper!.........</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES IN FACT WORK... I HAVE OWNED WELLNESS CLINICS FOR OVER 20 YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS PRODUCT FOR MYSELF AND MY PETS... IT WORKS!  YOU MUST ... AS WITH ANYTHING... FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS&lt;br /&gt;USE THEM DAILY... RELIGOUSLY... AND YOU WILL GET RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THERE ARE ALSO SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN BE TAKEN SUCH AS BILBERRY ... ALONG WITH THE DROPS... [DURING WAR TIME THE MILITARY GAVE THE TROUPS BILBERRY SUPPLEMENTS SO THEY COULD SEE BETTER.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO MANY PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY WRITE \\&quot;DAMNING REVIEWS\\&quot; -- WHEN THE FAULT IS THEIR OWN FOR NOT FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE OF THIS PRODUCT IS LOWER THAN MOST AND UNLIKE MANY OTHERS IT DOES WORK!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I has helped my Shih Tzu tremendously with his juvenile cataracts.</li>
            <li> Yesterday&#x27;s appointment with eye doctor after 6 months use of carnosine eye drops: \\&quot;Cataracts are WAY WORSE than six months ago\\&quot;.  (They didn&#x27;t work for our dog either)</li>
            <li> Two years ago at my regular eye check up I was told I had the beginning signs of cataracts.  I had read about these drops in a health newsletter, and decided to give them a try.  I used them for a full year, and at this year&#x27;s check up I was told I had no sign of cataracts starting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that the person that had no luck with this product did not read the directions.  They clearly state that after applying a drop - which may initially burn - you need to slowly close your eye and leave in shut for 60 seconds.  No blinking.  Hard enough for a person to do, especially if there is a slight burning sensation, and just about impossible for a dog.</li>
            <li> absolutely works for me.  hope it continues to do so.  also, it&#x27;s less expensive than the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34;...always a plus.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the eye drops long enough to rate the results, but they were very well packaged, and I feel confident using them.</li>
            <li> just started using them helps the cataract from burning keeps my eye moist</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years to prevent further degradation of minor cataracts. So far, they have not deteriorated any further, and in fact, may even be improving, so there is something to this stuff. My spouse used them as well, but those cataracts were pretty fully developed, so they didn&#x27;t really change. The literature (and research) on n-carnosine suggest that developed cataracts are not really affected by this, but developing ones are. Well, we&#x27;re two guinea pigs and that seems to be the case. I think it is worth the cost, if it will prevent cataract surgery.</li>
            <li> It has not removed eye f;loaters</li>
            <li> Not sure because I have not not been consistant ...I plan to start doing this correct only I have had the flu so could not be bothered...when I get my act together I will review later.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts during the day and you cant use this with contacts, so I use it at night as I am very restless.  At first it burns on the first application, but then it is nice and cool.  I was diagnosed with a small cataract last year and I have used this every night since...4x plus each night,  At my check up this past month the cataract was still there.  I am looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> People are lying about the cataracts. Why? They expect to become famous?&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A SCAM! don&#x27;t buy them.&lt;br /&gt;In the instruction paper that comes with the drops it says: for the TEMPORARY relief (NOT CURE) of dry eyes and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t mention cataracts. You can buy cheaper drops for dry eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to David, the owner of the company and he told me I have to use them for 1 year to see a slight change.&lt;br /&gt;Very clever! He needs my business.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to make sure the product contains &#x27;carnosine&#x27; so, I asked David the name and phone of the pharmaceutical company that makes these drops. He refused to give me the name and hang up on me.&lt;br /&gt;I have senile cataract, no diabetes, no other health conditions and I have used them as instructed, several times a day, keep head up etc. etc.  No result!&lt;br /&gt;I saw the negative comments, but somehow I wanted to believe the positive ones, because, in my heart, I truly wanted them to work, to avoid surgery.  You will probably do the same.&lt;br /&gt;I had to chose 1 star, but I would give no stars, if I could.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time when my eyes are tired and before bed at night. I don&#x27;t have cataracts that I know of and am just using them for general eye health. They provide relief from the tired feeling I get when I have been up too long.</li>
            <li> After doing much research on cataracts and other eye conditions, I bought these drops for my mom since she has small cataracts and severe dry eye. It is has only been 2 months, but the dryness cleared up (no more red). Unfortunately, it has not done anything for her cataracts nor for the clarity of her vision.&lt;br /&gt;She is going to continue using and hopefully I can post an update.</li>
            <li> It if very soothing to the eyes.  I did buy it to see if it would break up catarats, but I am sorry to say that it did not.</li>
            <li> i ordered these for my husband. they work real good. they clear his eye sight up. i will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the drops will prevent a small cataract in one eye from growing. I&#x27;m hoping so!&lt;br /&gt;Results will tell me.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product for my dog. I am hoping it helps her cataracts.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worked on my dachshund&#x27;s cataracts.  I have been using these since July- 4 times per day in my dog&#x27;s eyes.  They have not reversed or kept the cataracts at bay.  I really wanted these to work.  I think surgery would be the only solution for cataracts.</li>
            <li> These eye drops were recommended to me by a friend. Have been using them for over a year now and find my eye sight&lt;br /&gt;At night seems better. The glare from the roadway signs don&#x27;t bother me as badly as before.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell any difference</li>
            <li> After 2.5 months using this product I detect no obvious improvement in my cataract(an eye chart was used to test improvement).  I have been using the product two times per day per eye.  I am starting my 4th vial and will update my review in approximately 1 month.  Note: The product does not claim to improve cataracts in the product literature.  Cataracts are not even mentioned.  N-acetyl-carnosine(NAC) is not listed as an active ingredient.  The product is sold as a lubricant and as relief of discomfort due to minor irritations of the eyes and nothing more.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this product does not compare with the last product I ordered. Even though it offers two bottles..it is&lt;br /&gt;still less than the one previously ordered product. I will not order again.</li>
