            <li>but it is nice.</li>
            <li>light smell, but very nice.  </li>
            <li>Locks in moisture and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Lightly moisturizing, a bit too light on the scent, but that&#x27;s a good thing, since you don&#x27;t want to conflict with your perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this product line I use this and their rosewater all the time.  </li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so refreshing and hydrating.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this and the rosewater one.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get the one with glycerin if you want it to act like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for use right after a shower or bath (after toweling off, of course), it helps to keep in moisture.</li>
            <li>The combination of the predominately Lavendar scent &amp; the refreshing mist enable me to more easily fall asleep.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent and feel of this product -- very light and cooling.  </li>
            <li>moisture and light scent.</li>
            <li>this is not perfume but a light glycerine fragrance water</li>
            <li>I use this spray to set my makeup for the day, and as a light moisturizer on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup.  </li>
            <li>Very nice facial mist, lightly scented, nothing overpowering, plus</li>
            <li>Love this pure and uplifting product!</li>
            <li>Super lightweight, immediately made my skin look plumper, works well as a combo with my avocado oil serum at night (was only using their rose water, but I love using this as a combo).</li>
            <li>So far, loving it.</li>
            <li>It is nice and lightweight unlike regular lotion and does not leave my hands oily.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and buy some almost every month because it is clean and refreshing and dose not have a heavy smell.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the spray definitely helps my makeup look more dewy and fresh and helps it stay in place throughout the day.</li>
            <li>On hot summer nights I spray this on my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a bargain.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I am loving it after only a few days.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is the sprayer -- it delivers a fine mist but also drips large drops of the liquid when spraying, so it seems like a bit of a waste.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No tight feeling on skin either.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily on the sheets and add some other fragrances to wear as a light mist of personal fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

It&#x27;s good for use right after a shower or bath (after toweling off, of course), it helps to keep in moisture. I know some use it to set their makeup, but I don&#x27;t use it that way. Overall, it was what I expected.</li>

            <li> Never used glycerin before. I am loving it after only a few days. Super lightweight, immediately made my skin look plumper, works well as a combo with my avocado oil serum at night (was only using their rose water, but I love using this as a combo). So far, loving it.</li>

            <li> A great lavender oil spray.  Has relaxing and calming effects, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue when dry/soaked in.</li>
            <li> I love this product and buy some almost every month because it is clean and refreshing and dose not have a heavy smell.

            <li> Love it.  It is nice and lightweight unlike regular lotion and does not leave my hands oily.  Therefore, I can use it every time I wash my hands.</li>

The only downside to this product is the sprayer -- it delivers a fine mist but also drips large drops of the liquid when spraying, so it seems like a bit of a waste.  Maybe I just got a defective bottle.  Either way, the product is great and I&#x27;d buy it again.
