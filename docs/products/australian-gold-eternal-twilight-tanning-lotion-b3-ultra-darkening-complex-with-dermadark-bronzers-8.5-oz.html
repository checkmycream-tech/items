            <li>Love the way this stuff smells!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>BUT the color i got was amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s appropriate for gals or guys (not floral or decidedly feminine, just kind of like a dessert -in the tropics).</li>
            <li>Australian Gold Eternal Twilight is one of the best bronzers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I had an even all around color, and my skin was looking shiny and healthy.    </li>
            <li>If you can handle the smell i think you will love it.</li>
            <li>This seems to help more than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I like the smell beforehand, don&#x27;t love it after, but I can deal with it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and definitely contributes to a nice tan.</li>
            <li>The bronzing is really great and very natural, not orange.</li>
            <li>I dont tan that easily.</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong</li>
            <li>but the is too strong of an odor.  </li>
            <li>When you can smell yourself, it&#x27;s too strong.  </li>
            <li>I STRONGLY suggest that you get a sample first!!</li>
            <li>the smell is fine at first but the after smell is very strong for my liking.  </li>
            <li>and it comes in a user friendly bottle and easy to put</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without streaking or turning orange .</li>
            <li>After tanning it leaves a gross smell, but this lotion smells great and you can still smell it after tanning.</li>
            <li>I love Australian Gold products, and the do a good job.  </li>
            <li>so far it has a nice smell to it</li>
            <li>The next day i had a great brown color to my skin, i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Shipping was great, recieved with in a few days.</li>
            <li>After using it twice, I have a nice color that doesn&#x27;t wash off in the shower the next morning!  </li>
            <li>Tanning lotions usually smell horrid and break me out(sensitive skin), but this doesnt break me out at all and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Ok so i got this as a free sample when i signed up at my tanning salon, and im not sure how to rate it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few lotions, but this one is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>and it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>I had gotten to a point where i couldnt seem to get any more color but was still fairly pale, and this really pushed my over the edge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally pale and don&#x27;t tan very easily, but this has given me some pretty terrific color in just seven sessions in a level three bed.</li>
            <li>Overall I would give this a 4 out of 5 just because I am sure that there are other tanning lotions that can work to give you a darker tan than Twilight, but it worked really well for me, at least at first. :)</li>
            <li>Twilight gives skin a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li>Its very natural.</li>
            <li>also you can use it when you do natural tanning!</li>
            <li>I have used this tanning lotion in the past, and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this on Amazon about four times now (as it&#x27;s roughly half the cost of inflated salon markups), and it works fabulously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the scent, I usually try to tan early</li>
            <li>It reminds me of old granny, dead flowers, and cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>an apparel major and streaky clothes upset me.</li>
            <li>I got pretty dark with this.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it is an accelerator and does just that - gets you dark with a minimum of sessions.</li>
            <li>IT IS OVER THREE WEEKS LATE VERY UPSET!!!.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product is was one of three on the same order i received the other two products from a different drop shipper very fast.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a pretty dark tan.</li>

            <li> it was half price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thicker of a lotion than I had previously used.  </li>

            <li> I have very pale skin</li>

            <li> Australian Gold Eternal Twilight is one of the best bronzers I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve always had a little trouble getting a base tan but this made it happen for me. It smells great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I hate the way people smell after tanning... sort of a burned skin smell. This product helps mask that, so if you have runnign around to do after tanning,  you don&#x27;t feel quite as gross lol</li>
            <li> Ok so i got this as a free sample when i signed up at my tanning salon, and im not sure how to rate it. As soon as i opened the packet the first thing i noticed was the HORRIBLE and very strong mens cologne mixed with pine tree scent. I couldnt wait to get home to get it of. The smell was so strong the hole ride home i had to leave the windows down.    BUT the color i got was amazing. I had gotten to a point where i couldnt seem to get any more color but was still fairly pale, and this really pushed my over the edge. Especially a few hours later. I had an even all around color, and my skin was looking shiny and healthy.    Sadly i couldnt handle the smell so i wont be using it again. I STRONGLY suggest that you get a sample first!! If you can handle the smell i think you will love it.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and it takes a lot to get a tan. This seems to help more than others that I have tried. The bronzing is really great and very natural, not orange. I like the smell beforehand, don&#x27;t love it after, but I can deal with it. Even though it&#x27;s a bronzer I haven&#x27;t noticed it getting on my clothes which is great because I&#x27;m an apparel major and streaky clothes upset me. Not super expensive for a tanning lotion but works better than the Designer Skin stuff that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell. It got me tan and I loved the bottle. It also lasted along time and alittle goes a long way. it didnt irritate my skin or break me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few lotions, but this one is my absolute favorite! I&#x27;m naturally pale and don&#x27;t tan very easily, but this has given me some pretty terrific color in just seven sessions in a level three bed. I&#x27;m in love with the scent, I usually try to tan early just so I can keep smelling it on myself all day!</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold products, but the smell that Eternal Twilight has is absolutely terrible. It reminds me of old granny, dead flowers, and cheap perfume. Yuck!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product at my tanning salon it was half price. It smells good and i was very dark after I came out of the tanning bed. The next day i had a great brown color to my skin, i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Tanning lotions usually smell horrid and break me out(sensitive skin), but this doesnt break me out at all and smells pretty good. I dont tan that easily. I burned badly the first two times in the tanning bed, but once I started using this I stopped burning and started tanning. The bronzer in it isnt orange and doesnt stain. Its very natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in 2010 when I first began seriously tanning. I used almost the entire bottle, and it was really good at getting my a base tan. It lasted me about a month tanning 3-4 times a week, and it smelled really good. I got pretty dark with this. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a pretty dark tan. It smells good and I didn&#x27;t experience any nasty \\&quot;after-tan\\&quot; smell with it either. Overall I would give this a 4 out of 5 just because I am sure that there are other tanning lotions that can work to give you a darker tan than Twilight, but it worked really well for me, at least at first. :)</li>
            <li> I have ordered this on Amazon about four times now (as it&#x27;s roughly half the cost of inflated salon markups), and it works fabulously. Firstly, it is an accelerator and does just that - gets you dark with a minimum of sessions. And it is a \\&quot;real\\&quot; tan tone, not fakey in any way. Secondly, the scent is intoxicating, like decadent tiramisu. It&#x27;s appropriate for gals or guys (not floral or decidedly feminine, just kind of like a dessert -in the tropics). Not only that, but it seems to moisturize skin too. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff smells! works great</li>
            <li> Seems to work great and provide wonderful moisture as well as help with the tan.  The thing I like the best is the scent!</li>
            <li> This lotion does not smell stinky like other tanning lotions at all.  It actually has a scent that I would just buy regularly not even in a tanning lotion!  It&#x27;s a bit thicker of a lotion than I had previously used.  After using it twice, I have a nice color that doesn&#x27;t wash off in the shower the next morning!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product is was one of three on the same order i received the other two products from a different drop shipper very fast. I sent an email to this shipper and have not received a response. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS PODUCT IT IS OVER THREE WEEKS LATE VERY UPSET!!!.</li>
            <li> its the best i used  so far it has a nice smell to it and it works great once i used it the bronsers in the lotion works days later its a darn gd product and it comes in a user friendly bottle and easy to put</li>
            <li> this bronzer is one of the best. smells good and doesnt leave you orange or streaky. also you can use it when you do natural tanning! amazing!</li>
            <li> I ordered this off the reviews it got on amazon.  I cant say I dislike it, but I dont think I would order it again.  the smell is fine at first but the after smell is very strong for my liking.  I love Australian Gold products, and the do a good job.  I like the fact that it dosent turn your hands orange after appling it.  If I could just get past the after smell.  Shipping was great, recieved with in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have used this tanning lotion in the past, and absolutely love it.  It has a great smell and definitely contributes to a nice tan.</li>
            <li> i decided to try this lotion in the hopes of getting shades darker like it says but i didnt and i use the best tanning beds they have to offer. i also didnt like the smell of the lotion and it makes you feel greasy after which i also didnt like, it was alright but i dont think i will be purchasing this lotion again</li>
            <li> Twilight gives skin a nice subtle glow. It goes on smoothly without streaking or turning orange . It has no disagreeable odor. Your skin feels moisturized .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many tanning lotions and this is one of the best ones! After tanning it leaves a gross smell, but this lotion smells great and you can still smell it after tanning. It also gives you a nice brown tan!</li>
            <li> I worked well but the is too strong of an odor.  When you can smell yourself, it&#x27;s too strong.  peee uuuu</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks back to use for an indoor tanning bed experience and I found this lotion to be a great lotion to allow for me to bronze up a bit more. I really like the scent and it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion and noticed that it smelled different then my last bottle. I also noticed that the label looked a little different. I asked the girls where I tan to compare it and sure enough it is FAKE!!!</li>
