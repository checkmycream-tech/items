            <li>Great seller.  </li>
            <li>cocker thinks they are great chew toys.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about ordering my cpap supplies online, I didn&#x27;t know if the quality would be good or if they would be damaged or irregulars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I threw caution to the wind and ordered this!</li>
            <li>Top notch products and amazing customer service!</li>
            <li>The first two nights weren&#x27;t great with a lot of air leakage.  </li>
            <li>very light, works well for me.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li>Once I tightened the headgear more</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>Once again  I do love this CPAP.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mask</li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>I have since ordered more supplies from this same vendor and I&#x27;ve been very happy.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed, great price quick delivery!  </li>
            <li>Generally it has a very good seal also</li>
            <li>you are considering this mask, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!!</li>
            <li>The best mask I&#x27;ve had -- I like this and the wide.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>However, if you do then this mask is quite comfortable.  </li>
            <li>but I was noticing it seemed to be pressing closer to my face and making a crinkling sound if I adjusted it at all...</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and use</li>
            <li>And honestly, it is so comfortable that I forget I have it on.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPER!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels very light on the face, too, and I can see pretty well around the frame which is nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice small mask that works well, happy with the mask and how quickly it was received and the price.</li>
            <li>If I had to wear a full face mask, I wouldn&#x27;t be compliant.  </li>
            <li>As described, quick shipping</li>
            <li>I am OK with paying $30 every 5 months for a new nose part of the mask...</li>
            <li>Right size, right fit, right price&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if I am asleep I rarely have any leaks that show on my machine in the morning...</li>
            <li>but it gets sweaty during the night, this one is just the right size</li>
            <li>This particular mask is so comfortable.  </li>
            <li>If you have a small nose and face this mask fits great.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>so ideal for replacing a broken mask when you still have viable headgear.  </li>
            <li>My next attempt will be the safe.</li>
            <li>first Mirage mask lasted exactly 5 months--I could probably use it longer</li>
            <li>this is the first that really fits.</li>
            <li>These are so comfortable, so less noisey than many others and &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; is true, fits a female face a little more securely.</li>
            <li>You get the whole mask fixture -- no hose, no headgear</li>
            <li>I really thought I had ended the problem.</li>
            <li>I am VERY thankful for this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really like the Resmed nasal pillows also,</li>
            <li>, These are nice masks -- have used for a few years and if I&#x27;ve had to change to anything else I miss it.</li>
            <li>so I tried a new one (Activa) that I had on hand last night and noticed a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>big problem, though, is that I can tell my top front teeth are being pushed back a bit and my bite is changing.  </li>
            <li>The new design eliminates the pressure points on your forhead.  </li>
            <li>Exact same item as you will get from the manufacturer</li>
            <li>buy the women&#x27;s model, exactly the same as men&#x27;s but cheaper..........</li>
            <li>I find I can adjust the mask to be VERY loose, and after the first few minutes, it seems to sort of cling to my face most of the time.  </li>
            <li>but I just find that it takes enough space in my nostrils that I end up breathing too fast when wearing</li>
            <li>I ordered the standard size and wonder if the small wouldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li>I tried all of the Resmed nasal masks and they all felt EXTREMELY heavy and clunky on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with the Mirage FX I can even wear my glasses--which is nice because since I can&#x27;t lie down at all without the mask, I can wear my glasses to watch TV when in bed, or read a book, etc.  </li>
            <li>No pinching or loud noise or air finding its way out of the mask when it is adjusted properly.</li>
            <li>I very seldom roll over at night due to another problem.</li>
            <li>However, I used the first one, on an average, 9 hours a day/night, every night, for 5 months, so it got a lot of use!  </li>

            <li> Well, obviously I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but again, any other nasal mask would probably be worse because they are heavier by far!&lt;br</li>
            <li> since I feel like I&#x27;m suffocating whenever I lie down (until I put on the CPAP mask)</li>
            <li> Very expensive chew toys.</li>

            <li> If you have a small nose and face this mask fits great.  I have gone though 5 masks and this is the first that really fits.</li>
            <li> very light, works well for me.</li>
            <li> Gave myself a week to get used to this mask as it is different from the one I had before.  The first two nights weren&#x27;t great with a lot of air leakage.  Once I tightened the headgear more it helped a lot and now I am sleeping well (into my second week).  I ordered the standard size and wonder if the small wouldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li> Needed this before I got insurance. You get the whole mask fixture -- no hose, no headgear but you get the rest of it -- so ideal for replacing a broken mask when you still have viable headgear.  Exact same item as you will get from the manufacturer, These are nice masks -- have used for a few years and if I&#x27;ve had to change to anything else I miss it. These are so comfortable, so less noisey than many others and &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; is true, fits a female face a little more securely.

            <li> This nasal mask is awesome!  If I had to wear a full face mask, I wouldn&#x27;t be compliant.  This particular mask is so comfortable.  Great seller.  Definitely will purchase from them in the future.  Very fast delivery.</li>

            <li> I love this mask. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to put on. I have ordered four in the past year or so. Not because I wanted to&lt;br /&gt;My cocker thinks they are great chew toys. Very expensive chew toys. I have tried different ways to keep him from getting them. I really thought I had ended the problem. Well, obviously I was wrong. My next attempt will be the safe. I don&#x27;t think he could handle&lt;br /&gt;the key. But then again I didn&#x27;t think he could open a drawer and take it out.either&lt;br /&gt;  Once again  I do love this CPAP. mask. I very seldom roll over at night due to another problem. When I do, the mask goes along for the ride. No pinching or loud noise or air finding its way out of the mask when it is adjusted properly.</li>
            <li> Right size, right fit, right price&lt;br /&gt;  Will buy this again when needed.</li>
            <li> buy the women&#x27;s model, exactly the same as men&#x27;s but cheaper..........</li>

            <li> Fits, face perfectly.  there is a wide version of this mask but it gets sweaty during the night, this one is just the right size</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask (well, it&#x27;s a LOVE/HATE relationship as I would prefer NOT to have to use a CPAP machine, but since I feel like I&#x27;m suffocating whenever I lie down (until I put on the CPAP mask) I am VERY thankful for this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Resmed nasal pillows also, but I just find that it takes enough space in my nostrils that I end up breathing too fast when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Resmed Mirage FX....I tried all of the Resmed nasal masks and they all felt EXTREMELY heavy and clunky on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with the Mirage FX I can even wear my glasses--which is nice because since I can&#x27;t lie down at all without the mask, I can wear my glasses to watch TV when in bed, or read a book, etc.  I find I can adjust the mask to be VERY loose, and after the first few minutes, it seems to sort of cling to my face most of the time.  Generally it has a very good seal also--occasionally I will feel/hear a small wisp of air coming out one side or the other, and usually if I just press a little on that side the mask seems to seal again.  Even if I am asleep I rarely have any leaks that show on my machine in the morning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light on the face, too, and I can see pretty well around the frame which is nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big problem, though, is that I can tell my top front teeth are being pushed back a bit and my bite is changing.  I think that just about any nasal mask would do this, so I&#x27;m going to have to find out what my options are...but again, any other nasal mask would probably be worse because they are heavier by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Mirage mask lasted exactly 5 months--I could probably use it longer but I was noticing it seemed to be pressing closer to my face and making a crinkling sound if I adjusted it at all...so I tried a new one (Activa) that I had on hand last night and noticed a significant difference.
