            <li>For this price, and the great results, I will be staying on it.</li>
            <li>As tony the tigers says great</li>
            <li>Their service and delivery is great.......</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>It felt great, but even with using sparingly to cover face, neck and décolleté, I finished the bottle after just over a week.  </li>
            <li>I found that this product is very effective when paired with a moisturizer that has calcium.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I am happily satisfied and would recommend it to others  for their best results.</li>
            <li>I have been reading a lot about the best products for skin and this has a lot of the ingredients that most articles talk about.</li>
            <li>I did have a problem with the packaging during shipment but the seller had excellent communication and responded very quickly.</li>
            <li>Feels good and tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but WHERE is it made?  </li>
            <li>I use good moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li>,I have read that this is good for skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good anti-aging/repair skin products.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product before and loved it,  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product that produces observable results.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and feels wonderful</li>
            <li>but I have heard some good comments about it from some friends.</li>
            <li>This was a recommendation I learned on-line, and it appears to be a good match for me.</li>
            <li>-I use a combination of serums and this one doesn&#x27;t interact and is good quality.</li>
            <li>that still gave good results.  </li>
            <li>I loved the serum.</li>
            <li>I have been using a tear drop size of this for a week or so and am fairly happy.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel really good.</li>
            <li>It works great, you just need to make sure that you follow the directions and apply the moisturizer, but it does work.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about two weeks now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great &amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li>I Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T ASK FOR MORE!  </li>
            <li>There are better buys out there!</li>
            <li>I think you will love it too!</li>
            <li>However, I watched a video of myself taken just yesterday, and I have to say--smugly--that my face looked smoother and slightly more plumped out than what I &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; in the mirror!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I really LOVE it!</li>
            <li>no weird smell goes on very nice and looks great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product for fine lines and aging skin.  </li>
            <li>The results are amazing, it smooths out wrinkles almost immediately...</li>
            <li>It looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>I applied it after my toner and my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Nice solution for face that plumps it up.</li>
            <li>However, after just a week&#x27;s use, It is pumping up nicely and</li>
            <li>It is highly effective.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>so kind.  </li>
            <li>This product seems effective but caused my face to peel almost immediately.</li>
            <li>It kept my skin well hydrated and gave my aging skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>feel as though the product itself is superior than the cheaper brand as it&#x27;s more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seller was great mailed the product quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff works GREAT!  </li>
            <li>From what I was able to use it worked nicely.</li>
            <li>There are competing serums in this price range right now on Amazon &amp; Baby Face is one that I ordered since they greatly lowered their prices and ship USPS priority.</li>
            <li>so keeping my skin looking good has become more important to me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised and great customer service.</li>
            <li>Very light watery serum</li>
            <li>on very smoothly, and has a luxurious feel.</li>
            <li>This product has good quick results.</li>
            <li>It is more moist and smoother.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and look on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love how this serum works for me.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like Loreal Youth Code with 30 Spf, and Neutrogena with Retinol better.  </li>
            <li>and she really needs a nice serum that would give her skin a good consistence.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for more than two weeks now.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many products through out the years from &#x27;high-line&#x27; products to drug store.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the product,smooth and you can feel it working</li>
            <li>firms skin, is anti-aging, and produces more youthful-looking skin.  </li>
            <li>the product contents seem ok</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see an overnight miracle but can report that my skin is softer and more plump.  </li>
            <li>BECAUSE AS SOON AS IT DRIES, MY SKIN LOOKS BETTER, FEELS SOFTER, AND GLOWS.  </li>

            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I will for sure order this product again.  </li>
            <li>For the money the content should be greater.</li>
            <li>I have been using for more than a month and have not seen any changes.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serum in combo with vitamin C is supposed to be phenomenal for your skin.</li>
            <li>I think it is an okay product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product a year ago and really wanted to try it having read the great reviews.</li>
            <li>do think my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>this was some what helpful :)</li>
            <li>I could not pump out any more.</li>
            <li>Seriously love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks already</li>
            <li>It is all glass and has a glass dropper that I love.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>(In my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try getting Hyaluronic Acid powder to see if that will be a better value.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Perfect for around mouth to plump those tiny lines and plump the lips.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this product after my first bottle!!!</li>
            <li>Smells great, easy to apply, and really moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>Beautiful packaging, great price, but not very effective.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth, pores are invisible and fine lines are reduced..</li>
            <li>, it is so wonderful on my skin, it keeps it moist thru the day,and I have very dry skin and use a lot of products.</li>
            <li>It costs a bit more, bit it has twice the active ingredient--hyaluronic acid, which is a girl&#x27;s best friend!</li>
            <li>The serum keeps my skin from becoming too irritated from the retinoid.</li>
            <li>so these type of repair/prevent products are becoming even more important to me.</li>
            <li>works great, makes my skin feel soft and smooths out the wrinkles</li>
            <li>Most important it has Vitamin C all</li>
            <li>This stuff works wonderfully in conjunction with my other products.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>At first the product had a very nice appeal however it has not been easy to get the right amount out of the drop bottle.</li>
            <li>Since Amazon is allowing easy return, I will return the purchase, though I almost feel as id</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>I have never used Hyaluronic Acid but have seen the name on so many products and in so many articles, it was worth a try for the price.  </li>
            <li>It also absorbs very quickly-</li>
            <li>This product from this vendor arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>One product that I wanted to add in was a strong Hylauronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>bottle is very nice although it is smaller than most serum bottles.</li>
            <li>Great for under the bare minerals I am using now, maes t not as chalky.</li>
            <li>has not had time to do what it said to do  will need more time to see if product claims are true</li>
            <li>My first thought, was this was some kind of knock off.</li>
            <li>super product and super strong and effective...</li>
            <li>It fills, plumps, or whatever it does to reduce fine lines/wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>all you need is ONE drop in the palm of your hand, then quickly rub it all over your face or you will have the softest palms in the world!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t a huge serum person before trying this product.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Wrinkles are faded with smooth skin tone</li>
            <li>I use it lightly at night as potions used nightly avail themselves of the body&#x27;s repair time in sleep.  </li>
            <li>That is important to me because I am 61 but still have oil-prone skin.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>AT ALL send me another one free</li>
            <li>I lightly mist my skin with water after a through cleansing and then apply your product to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to check back with the person of which this was purchased for, but in reading about the product I believe that they will be happy with what it is for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i ordered some from a different company and it works great</li>
            <li>Great and will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>second time using this serum..love it...makes my face look and feel great</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product to use if you are looking for something to bring your skin back to life.</li>
            <li>3/4 filled.</li>
            <li>It helped to smooth out my skin</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>It really feels good on the skin, is not one of those products that you feel everytime you smile or frown.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply because it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This product was not the original packaging.</li>
            <li>This is the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I tried, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I thought &#x27;OK&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>serum is nothing like the original version</li>
            <li>OK I have tried a lot of products similar to this, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I am on my first order but have just ordered two more as I don&#x27;t want to run out.  </li>
            <li>and right before I go to bed, and it make my face feel clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smoother and is absorbed very quickly</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel good, not dry or sticky and am looking forward to it improving my skin condition again.  </li>
            <li>I am positive they will love it too.</li>
            <li>The second one I used (am currently using) seems much more concentrated, or potent and worked great under make</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>This bottle was full????</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely happy with it so far, and will most likely reorder.</li>
            <li>I had a severe case of Rosacea &amp; this Serum really calmed it down up to 75% which is SUPER impressive.</li>
            <li>This product is a decent product, but since they changed the bottle to a very cheap bottle</li>
            <li>arrived on time, packaged very nicely and was as expected.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and hydrates.</li>
            <li>It seemed that the bottle was consumed rather quickly, so</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a gel consistency, and smells better than most acid like serums, which is an obvious plus.</li>
            <li>like that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
            <li>While no such products are perfect, this one appears to be a step above its competitors.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and without any tacky residue.  </li>
            <li>Quickly absorbs into the skin/ Non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good news I didn&#x27;t spend a lot for this product and enjoyed a few minutes of &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; skin which is why I gave it 2 stars.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other products on Amazon that I liked better than this one.</li>
            <li>There is a difference from the very first application.</li>
            <li>It seems to woks great but not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would be a bigger bottle, the bottle wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top, I did try it out and it went on smoothly , I like how it made my skin feel !  </li>
            <li>This product absorbed into my skin quickly and did not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>I actually think it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says, and is certainly worth the money!</li>
            <li>I definitely like this product, easy to use and will purchase more.</li>
            <li>It has really helped fill out my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It only takes moments after using this product to feel and see the amazing difference.  </li>
            <li>The product does not get easily absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>I like the way it is so quickly absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>The old bottle was much more sturdy.</li>
            <li>I find that suddenly people are telling me how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I  have used, and tried many skin care products, and my 56 year old skin is evidence of all the research and effort I put into it.</li>
            <li>I find it useful to use this first-thing in the morning, and then argan oil afterwards.</li>
            <li>no response a month later get another email to see how i liked it ?????????</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and works wonder.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are from my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>It is very light and feels much better than other anti-aging moisturizers on my prone to oily skin.</li>
            <li>high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
            <li>I have used the serum only for a week, it seems very good, hopefully I can see results in the long run.</li>
            <li>once it has &#x27;dried&#x27; in the skin I can use my own moisturizer and put make up on!  </li>
            <li>Use this for 2 week, great help with the skin&#x27;s hydration and texture, but not sure about the brown spot yet.</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey, but is definitely a useful ally in the battle against skin damage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO, I think in writing this review, I just realized that while the product itself is good, it&#x27;s not worth the price</li>
            <li>Only used it a few days but it feels wonderful on my face.</li>
            <li>After about three weeks of consistent application I have not seen any beneficial effects.</li>
            <li>This was the first product with hyaluronic acid that I tried.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This product actually works better than most similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several months mostly twice a day</li>
            <li>the first month of using it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look and feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to order a couple more bottles.</li>
            <li>results have been as expected, nice to have vitamin c serum combined with hyaluronic acid.two products in one</li>
            <li>what I received was ok but didn&#x27;t have enough Serum to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see how it was working for me first.  </li>
            <li>I like the way my skin feels soft and smooth after I apply this product.  </li>
            <li>Only OK.  </li>
            <li>Will give it more time and report back.</li>
            <li>This is not the first hyaluronic acid serum I have used.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is water followed by hyaluronic Acid Serum and</li>
            <li>The first product was in a bottle like I have this as shown.  </li>
            <li>Last evening I spilled this  bottle, I was able to rescue some of the serum but lost quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years and have loved it.</li>
            <li>Should get a new full bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>Ultima ll 180 Pure Swiss Serum really works!</li>
            <li>,I haven&#x27;t found anything better,&amp; I  have been around a long time.</li>
            <li>Thai product is good, it reduce small lines and minimize pores.&lt;br /&gt;Size</li>
            <li>It is a little strong for me, but might be fine for someone else.</li>
            <li>I typically use this kind of stuff before bed</li>
            <li>Received without any packing slip, bottle didn&#x27;t have any kind of seal to ensure that it hadn&#x27;t been opened previously, it had oily fingerprints, bottle cap and stopper</li>
            <li>One drop spreads easily to cover my entire face and part of my neck.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m really getting something of high quality when I use this right before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>How could one be certain of what&#x27;s inside it?</li>
            <li>I have been using Ultima Pure Swiss for about a month.  </li>
            <li>so I could reorder the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss serum again.  </li>
            <li>180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a glass opaque bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li>The results I have been getting from it are truly impressive because it diminished the annoying fine lines on the side of my nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light weight and my skin just drinks it right up, looking instantly firmer and younger.</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle from one vendor and got the real deal in a sealed bottle in a sealed box.  </li>
            <li>even indentation on each side of my nose along with the lines above and in corners of my mouth have filled in.  </li>
            <li>Although not as costly, drugstore products usually only help go smooth the skin and sometimes brighten.  </li>
            <li>my skin with vitamin C and hyrulonic acid to keep it younger and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated serum .</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 4 weeks and have seen my pores reducing in size, since I am 72, I am very grateful to see this happening.</li>
            <li>From what I read, primers are important, so I invested in this as the price was deeply discounted.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, and I am considering purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>AND MY SKIN REALLY LIKES IT,</li>
            <li>Very affordable price compared to dept. store brands but works as well.</li>
            <li>My complexion has really improved.</li>
            <li>your skin  is very elsctic  </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and I put it on after I get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It has practically no odor and really does the job.  </li>
            <li>About dealer, very responsable and reliable.</li>
            <li>Absolutely will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>this is a very honorable company, because I have never had a response so fast and</li>
            <li>I have ordered the BF serum to compare and will update when I use if anyone has any interest for a real comparison.</li>
            <li>My skin is much improved since I started using it</li>
            <li>Thanks,  Shirley Coffey</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t say how well it works at this time.</li>
            <li>I have been using thsi along with a microneede roller, and also before I use my NuFace wrinkle remover light attachment, and I see a difference already after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell but I have noted a smoother look to my skin</li>
            <li>This product along with the microneedle therapy has really given me a results that I was seeking.  </li>
            <li>It helped keep my skin from drying out on a day to day basis, but it really did not cause any real improvements over time.  </li>
            <li>Problem is I go thru&#x27; the bottle much too fast,but I can&#x27;t do without it now</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t know it work</li>
            <li>I really like your products</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is thicker than many serums and if you have sensitive skin, I definitely would not recommend.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>My skin actually does look better, and feels so soft to touch.</li>
            <li>Put under eyes and it acts like glue, does not help long term, peels off easily and doesn&#x27;t do well when put cream over it.</li>
            <li>Just not as consumer friendly as a similar product from watts beauty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have had  great success with their other face products for Mature, Dry sensitive skin, Rosacea flare-ups.</li>
            <li>I am 41, healthy, active and fighting the aging process every step.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the product,however,the product does not last long at all.</li>
            <li>Live it!</li>
            <li>The product felt good to the skin, but it didn&#x27;t last long enough to know if it really made any difference.</li>
            <li>This product is easier to apply: it goes on smoothly, spreads easily, and takes less product  than others to cover the same area.  </li>
            <li>As I got older, my face slid downward.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Had a lot of sun damage over the years, and it makes me look older.  </li>
            <li>It plumped and hydrated my main problem area, my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is a clear, thick (almost gel) and unscented serum that goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product for nay age.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>PURE, ORGANIC, NATURAL.  </li>
            <li>Pure luxury for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I am excited for my winter dry skin to become rehydrated.</li>
            <li>I wish the design of the dropper/bottle were better because the dropper refuses to bring heavy serum into the dropper to release the drops you need to apply.</li>
            <li>My crows feet and smile lines are only noticeable when I use them now.</li>
            <li>Absorbed well and left no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I have used the regular strength version from Ultra Pure Swiss in the past and liked it, but because I am in my 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li>However, the new bottle is not an improvement.</li>
            <li>Also the box labelled as new but the glass container inside is not sealed.</li>
            <li>I feel like in the month I have been using it there is a new plumpness to my skin.</li>
            <li>but I will look for a new product that I can handle..</li>
            <li>My original blue bottle left my skin super soft the second I rubbed it on.</li>
            <li>The ingredient stack lists hyaluronic acid right at the top, which means that a little will go a long way!</li>
            <li>After using the product for a few days, she said she could feel the difference and is satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li>But there is no tingling on my skin when I apply it, which suggests that the Vit C in the serum is not (super strong) like it is advertised.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin felt so very soft after using&lt;br</li>
            <li>I perceive a noticeable difference after consistent use in only 1 week.</li>
            <li>The instructions are to use several drops morning and night - and that&#x27;s exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to be making my fine lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>When I received my product I was a bit surprised on the size of the bottle !</li>
            <li>The first night I used a serum prep which is think is essential to using any serum; to prepare the skin to accept any serum.</li>
            <li>I seem to have less noticable fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>After I wash my face, I massage it deeply with special attn to areas such as neck, jaw line, &amp; underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>With only two weeks use two times a day the dry skin around my eyes have diminished, I have fewer fine lines and my eyelids aren&#x27;t are wrinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little drop will do your whole face and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I used this product a few months ago and even though I was very satisfied, seeing an improvement in my skin, I tried a different product the following month.  </li>
            <li>Since getting Ultima Pure Swiss, I only need it and make up</li>
            <li>I was surprised how smoothly it applies, and how little is needed to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I ordered 2 bottles &amp; still using the other one that I hold onto dearly now.</li>
            <li>I have skin that can become sensitive to retinol-based products, so after some research decided to try an hyaluronic-based product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Ultima Pure Swiss brand for several weeks now, morning and night, and I think it has been working well so far.</li>
            <li>so I doubt it&#x27;ll go very far...which makes it kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>I just started using it 3 days ago so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found products that I can used at Amazon to mix up my compounds utilizing my pharmacist training and old apothecary books.</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old</li>
            <li>but the way the bottle looks, it appears old and worn.</li>
            <li>I have used this product just one week, so far it has met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I like the product so far.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so soft</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old, &amp; have no wrinkles @ all, 😁</li>
            <li>Despite its viscosity, this serum absorbs completely into the skin without a hint of oiliness.</li>
            <li>Have been using for about 3 weeks now and have really seen a difference in the texture of my skin, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>this process leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and well hydrated..</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and taunt.</li>
            <li>Imagine never having acne your whole life, turn 55, have acne and red patches on your face!</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much risk in buying it, given the low price, so I did.  </li>
            <li>Oh, btw, I am 44 years old</li>
            <li>It is soft and looks youthful.</li>
            <li>I like this so far.</li>
            <li>Purchased 2 bottles; surprised bottles were not sealed.</li>
            <li>I only tried this a few times so far, but it really leaves the skin so smooth and soft without an oily feel.  </li>
            <li>easily popped off, not sure what could be in this bottle, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li>Pretty much wasted most of it and as you only get .5 ounce that makes this much more expensive than thought.</li>
            <li>Bottle was less than 80% full.</li>
            <li>bottle was half full when I received it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The description of this product states that it is the same product with a new look, well the product itself must be new too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only issue I see with this product is it needs a longer eye dropper and also bigger bottle, as it doesn&#x27;t really last a full month.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, I am telling all my friends about the new miracle I have found!</li>
            <li>Would be cool if it was the serum and a little weight loss.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I save not using commercial products that don&#x27;t fulfill their promises, especially the televised sellers.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Ive noticed that the fine lines on my face are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>was half full and open ----</li>
            <li>told them bottle was open and half full</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much packaging was used for such a small amount of product I can buy the same type of product and get much more for less money.</li>
            <li>I started out dull and now have hydrated, smooth and glowing</li>
            <li>I had some lines on my upper lip that are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>but the product barely lasted a 2 weeks</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft &amp; moist after applying this daily.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, that product&#x27;s performance is nowhere near as effective as this one is, and I now have a larger bottle to use.  </li>
            <li>I am using it - seems like a nice serum - poor dropper as it is too long for the bottle</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid should hydrate the skin not dry it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the new clear bottle several times and each time my skin is immediately dry and tight ... not the good tight, but an overly dry tight.</li>
            <li>But looks like it really works may be due to sort of thicker fluid.</li>
            <li>Still too early to determine if this is something I want to use long term.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a few weeks and have noticed only a small change, but that could be due to being older and having more damage than others.</li>
            <li>I have been using a different brand of hyaluronic acid for the past few months now, also purchased from Amazon, and it has been just ok.  </li>
            <li>Use just a little bit in certain spots of your face to make it last longer.</li>

            <li> Their service and delivery is great.......</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li> It felt great, but even with using sparingly to cover face, neck and décolleté, I finished the bottle after just over a week.  </li>
            <li> I found that this product is very effective when paired with a moisturizer that has calcium.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am happily satisfied and would recommend it to others  for their best results.</li>
            <li> I have been reading a lot about the best products for skin and this has a lot of the ingredients that most articles talk about.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem with the packaging during shipment but the seller had excellent communication and responded very quickly.</li>
            <li> Feels good and tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li> Good product, but WHERE is it made?  </li>
            <li> I use good moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> ,I have read that this is good for skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good anti-aging/repair skin products.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and loved it,  </li>
            <li> This is a really good product that produces observable results.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and feels wonderful</li>
            <li> but I have heard some good comments about it from some friends.</li>
            <li> This was a recommendation I learned on-line, and it appears to be a good match for me.</li>
            <li> -I use a combination of serums and this one doesn&#x27;t interact and is good quality.</li>
            <li> that still gave good results.  </li>
            <li> I loved the serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using a tear drop size of this for a week or so and am fairly happy.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel really good.</li>
            <li> It works great, you just need to make sure that you follow the directions and apply the moisturizer, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about two weeks now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great &amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li> I Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T ASK FOR MORE!  </li>
            <li> There are better buys out there!</li>
            <li> I think you will love it too!</li>
            <li> However, I watched a video of myself taken just yesterday, and I have to say--smugly--that my face looked smoother and slightly more plumped out than what I &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; in the mirror!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I really LOVE it!</li>
            <li> no weird smell goes on very nice and looks great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine lines and aging skin.  </li>
            <li> The results are amazing, it smooths out wrinkles almost immediately...</li>
            <li> It looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> I applied it after my toner and my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Nice solution for face that plumps it up.</li>
            <li> However, after just a week&#x27;s use, It is pumping up nicely and</li>
            <li> It is highly effective.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> so kind.  </li>
            <li> This product seems effective but caused my face to peel almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It kept my skin well hydrated and gave my aging skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> feel as though the product itself is superior than the cheaper brand as it&#x27;s more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seller was great mailed the product quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff works GREAT!  </li>
            <li> From what I was able to use it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> There are competing serums in this price range right now on Amazon &amp; Baby Face is one that I ordered since they greatly lowered their prices and ship USPS priority.</li>
            <li> so keeping my skin looking good has become more important to me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Very light watery serum</li>
            <li> on very smoothly, and has a luxurious feel.</li>

            <li> I love how this serum works for me.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like Loreal Youth Code with 30 Spf, and Neutrogena with Retinol better.  </li>
            <li> and she really needs a nice serum that would give her skin a good consistence.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for more than two weeks now.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many products through out the years from &#x27;high-line&#x27; products to drug store.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t see an overnight miracle but can report that my skin is softer and more plump.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE AS SOON AS IT DRIES, MY SKIN LOOKS BETTER, FEELS SOFTER, AND GLOWS.  </li>

            <li> skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> then they sent email to see if everything was okay</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I will for sure order this product again.  </li>
            <li> For the money the content should be greater.</li>
            <li> I have been using for more than a month and have not seen any changes.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum in combo with vitamin C is supposed to be phenomenal for your skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is an okay product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a year ago and really wanted to try it having read the great reviews.</li>
            <li> do think my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> this was some what helpful :)</li>
            <li> I could not pump out any more.</li>
            <li> Seriously love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks already</li>
            <li> It is all glass and has a glass dropper that I love.</li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> (In my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try getting Hyaluronic Acid powder to see if that will be a better value.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Perfect for around mouth to plump those tiny lines and plump the lips.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this product after my first bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, easy to apply, and really moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging, great price, but not very effective.</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth, pores are invisible and fine lines are reduced..</li>
            <li> , it is so wonderful on my skin, it keeps it moist thru the day,and I have very dry skin and use a lot of products.</li>
            <li> It costs a bit more, bit it has twice the active ingredient--hyaluronic acid, which is a girl&#x27;s best friend!</li>
            <li> The serum keeps my skin from becoming too irritated from the retinoid.</li>
            <li> so these type of repair/prevent products are becoming even more important to me.</li>
            <li> works great, makes my skin feel soft and smooths out the wrinkles</li>
            <li> Most important it has Vitamin C all</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonderfully in conjunction with my other products.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> At first the product had a very nice appeal however it has not been easy to get the right amount out of the drop bottle.</li>
            <li> Since Amazon is allowing easy return, I will return the purchase, though I almost feel as id</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li> I have never used Hyaluronic Acid but have seen the name on so many products and in so many articles, it was worth a try for the price.  </li>
            <li> It also absorbs very quickly-</li>
            <li> This product from this vendor arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> One product that I wanted to add in was a strong Hylauronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> bottle is very nice although it is smaller than most serum bottles.</li>
            <li> Great for under the bare minerals I am using now, maes t not as chalky.</li>
            <li> has not had time to do what it said to do  will need more time to see if product claims are true</li>
            <li> My first thought, was this was some kind of knock off.</li>
            <li> super product and super strong and effective...</li>
            <li> It fills, plumps, or whatever it does to reduce fine lines/wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> all you need is ONE drop in the palm of your hand, then quickly rub it all over your face or you will have the softest palms in the world!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t a huge serum person before trying this product.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are faded with smooth skin tone</li>
            <li> I use it lightly at night as potions used nightly avail themselves of the body&#x27;s repair time in sleep.  </li>
            <li> That is important to me because I am 61 but still have oil-prone skin.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> AT ALL send me another one free</li>
            <li> I lightly mist my skin with water after a through cleansing and then apply your product to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to check back with the person of which this was purchased for, but in reading about the product I believe that they will be happy with what it is for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i ordered some from a different company and it works great</li>
            <li> Great and will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li> second time using this serum..love it...makes my face look and feel great</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product to use if you are looking for something to bring your skin back to life.</li>
            <li> 3/4 filled.</li>
            <li> It helped to smooth out my skin</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> It really feels good on the skin, is not one of those products that you feel everytime you smile or frown.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply because it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product was not the original packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I tried, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I thought &#x27;OK&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> serum is nothing like the original version</li>
            <li> OK I have tried a lot of products similar to this, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I am on my first order but have just ordered two more as I don&#x27;t want to run out.  </li>
            <li> and right before I go to bed, and it make my face feel clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smoother and is absorbed very quickly</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel good, not dry or sticky and am looking forward to it improving my skin condition again.  </li>
            <li> I am positive they will love it too.</li>
            <li> The second one I used (am currently using) seems much more concentrated, or potent and worked great under make</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> This bottle was full????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely happy with it so far, and will most likely reorder.</li>
            <li> I had a severe case of Rosacea &amp; this Serum really calmed it down up to 75% which is SUPER impressive.</li>
            <li> This product is a decent product, but since they changed the bottle to a very cheap bottle</li>
            <li> arrived on time, packaged very nicely and was as expected.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and hydrates.</li>
            <li> It seemed that the bottle was consumed rather quickly, so</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a gel consistency, and smells better than most acid like serums, which is an obvious plus.</li>
            <li> like that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
            <li> While no such products are perfect, this one appears to be a step above its competitors.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and without any tacky residue.  </li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs into the skin/ Non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good news I didn&#x27;t spend a lot for this product and enjoyed a few minutes of &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; skin which is why I gave it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other products on Amazon that I liked better than this one.</li>
            <li> There is a difference from the very first application.</li>
            <li> It seems to woks great but not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would be a bigger bottle, the bottle wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top, I did try it out and it went on smoothly , I like how it made my skin feel !  </li>
            <li> This product absorbed into my skin quickly and did not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> I actually think it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says, and is certainly worth the money!</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product, easy to use and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> It has really helped fill out my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It only takes moments after using this product to feel and see the amazing difference.  </li>
            <li> The product does not get easily absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way it is so quickly absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> The old bottle was much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I find that suddenly people are telling me how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I  have used, and tried many skin care products, and my 56 year old skin is evidence of all the research and effort I put into it.</li>
            <li> I find it useful to use this first-thing in the morning, and then argan oil afterwards.</li>
            <li> no response a month later get another email to see how i liked it ?????????</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and works wonder.  </li>
            <li> All opinions are from my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> It is very light and feels much better than other anti-aging moisturizers on my prone to oily skin.</li>
            <li> high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
            <li> I have used the serum only for a week, it seems very good, hopefully I can see results in the long run.</li>
            <li> once it has &#x27;dried&#x27; in the skin I can use my own moisturizer and put make up on!  </li>
            <li> Use this for 2 week, great help with the skin&#x27;s hydration and texture, but not sure about the brown spot yet.</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey, but is definitely a useful ally in the battle against skin damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO, I think in writing this review, I just realized that while the product itself is good, it&#x27;s not worth the price</li>
            <li> Only used it a few days but it feels wonderful on my face.</li>
            <li> After about three weeks of consistent application I have not seen any beneficial effects.</li>
            <li> This was the first product with hyaluronic acid that I tried.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This product actually works better than most similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months mostly twice a day</li>
            <li> the first month of using it.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to order a couple more bottles.</li>
            <li> results have been as expected, nice to have vitamin c serum combined with hyaluronic acid.two products in one</li>
            <li> what I received was ok but didn&#x27;t have enough Serum to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how it was working for me first.  </li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels soft and smooth after I apply this product.  </li>
            <li> Only OK.  </li>
            <li> Will give it more time and report back.</li>
            <li> This is not the first hyaluronic acid serum I have used.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is water followed by hyaluronic Acid Serum and</li>
            <li> The first product was in a bottle like I have this as shown.  </li>
            <li> Last evening I spilled this  bottle, I was able to rescue some of the serum but lost quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and have loved it.</li>
            <li> Should get a new full bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Ultima ll 180 Pure Swiss Serum really works!</li>
            <li> ,I haven&#x27;t found anything better,&amp; I  have been around a long time.</li>
            <li> Thai product is good, it reduce small lines and minimize pores.&lt;br /&gt;Size</li>
            <li> It is a little strong for me, but might be fine for someone else.</li>
            <li> I typically use this kind of stuff before bed</li>
            <li> Received without any packing slip, bottle didn&#x27;t have any kind of seal to ensure that it hadn&#x27;t been opened previously, it had oily fingerprints, bottle cap and stopper</li>
            <li> One drop spreads easily to cover my entire face and part of my neck.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m really getting something of high quality when I use this right before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> How could one be certain of what&#x27;s inside it?</li>
            <li> I have been using Ultima Pure Swiss for about a month.  </li>
            <li> so I could reorder the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss serum again.  </li>
            <li> 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a glass opaque bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> The results I have been getting from it are truly impressive because it diminished the annoying fine lines on the side of my nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light weight and my skin just drinks it right up, looking instantly firmer and younger.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle from one vendor and got the real deal in a sealed bottle in a sealed box.  </li>
            <li> even indentation on each side of my nose along with the lines above and in corners of my mouth have filled in.  </li>
            <li> Although not as costly, drugstore products usually only help go smooth the skin and sometimes brighten.  </li>
            <li> my skin with vitamin C and hyrulonic acid to keep it younger and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated serum .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks and have seen my pores reducing in size, since I am 72, I am very grateful to see this happening.</li>
            <li> From what I read, primers are important, so I invested in this as the price was deeply discounted.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, and I am considering purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> AND MY SKIN REALLY LIKES IT,</li>
            <li> Very affordable price compared to dept. store brands but works as well.</li>
            <li> My complexion has really improved.</li>
            <li> your skin  is very elsctic  </li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I put it on after I get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It has practically no odor and really does the job.  </li>
            <li> About dealer, very responsable and reliable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> this is a very honorable company, because I have never had a response so fast and</li>
            <li> I have ordered the BF serum to compare and will update when I use if anyone has any interest for a real comparison.</li>
            <li> My skin is much improved since I started using it</li>
            <li> Thanks,  Shirley Coffey</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t say how well it works at this time.</li>
            <li> I have been using thsi along with a microneede roller, and also before I use my NuFace wrinkle remover light attachment, and I see a difference already after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell but I have noted a smoother look to my skin</li>
            <li> This product along with the microneedle therapy has really given me a results that I was seeking.  </li>
            <li> It helped keep my skin from drying out on a day to day basis, but it really did not cause any real improvements over time.  </li>
            <li> Problem is I go thru&#x27; the bottle much too fast,but I can&#x27;t do without it now</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t know it work</li>
            <li> I really like your products</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is thicker than many serums and if you have sensitive skin, I definitely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> My skin actually does look better, and feels so soft to touch.</li>
            <li> Put under eyes and it acts like glue, does not help long term, peels off easily and doesn&#x27;t do well when put cream over it.</li>
            <li> Just not as consumer friendly as a similar product from watts beauty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have had  great success with their other face products for Mature, Dry sensitive skin, Rosacea flare-ups.</li>
            <li> I am 41, healthy, active and fighting the aging process every step.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the product,however,the product does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Live it!</li>
            <li> The product felt good to the skin, but it didn&#x27;t last long enough to know if it really made any difference.</li>
            <li> This product is easier to apply: it goes on smoothly, spreads easily, and takes less product  than others to cover the same area.  </li>
            <li> As I got older, my face slid downward.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Had a lot of sun damage over the years, and it makes me look older.  </li>
            <li> It plumped and hydrated my main problem area, my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a clear, thick (almost gel) and unscented serum that goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product for nay age.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> PURE, ORGANIC, NATURAL.  </li>
            <li> Pure luxury for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I am excited for my winter dry skin to become rehydrated.</li>
            <li> I wish the design of the dropper/bottle were better because the dropper refuses to bring heavy serum into the dropper to release the drops you need to apply.</li>
            <li> My crows feet and smile lines are only noticeable when I use them now.</li>
            <li> Absorbed well and left no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I have used the regular strength version from Ultra Pure Swiss in the past and liked it, but because I am in my 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> However, the new bottle is not an improvement.</li>
            <li> Also the box labelled as new but the glass container inside is not sealed.</li>
            <li> I feel like in the month I have been using it there is a new plumpness to my skin.</li>
            <li> but I will look for a new product that I can handle..</li>
            <li> My original blue bottle left my skin super soft the second I rubbed it on.</li>
            <li> The ingredient stack lists hyaluronic acid right at the top, which means that a little will go a long way!</li>
            <li> After using the product for a few days, she said she could feel the difference and is satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> But there is no tingling on my skin when I apply it, which suggests that the Vit C in the serum is not (super strong) like it is advertised.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin felt so very soft after using&lt;br</li>
            <li> I perceive a noticeable difference after consistent use in only 1 week.</li>
            <li> The instructions are to use several drops morning and night - and that&#x27;s exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to be making my fine lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> When I received my product I was a bit surprised on the size of the bottle !</li>
            <li> The first night I used a serum prep which is think is essential to using any serum; to prepare the skin to accept any serum.</li>
            <li> I seem to have less noticable fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> After I wash my face, I massage it deeply with special attn to areas such as neck, jaw line, &amp; underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> With only two weeks use two times a day the dry skin around my eyes have diminished, I have fewer fine lines and my eyelids aren&#x27;t are wrinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little drop will do your whole face and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few months ago and even though I was very satisfied, seeing an improvement in my skin, I tried a different product the following month.  </li>
            <li> Since getting Ultima Pure Swiss, I only need it and make up</li>
            <li> I was surprised how smoothly it applies, and how little is needed to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I ordered 2 bottles &amp; still using the other one that I hold onto dearly now.</li>
            <li> I have skin that can become sensitive to retinol-based products, so after some research decided to try an hyaluronic-based product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Ultima Pure Swiss brand for several weeks now, morning and night, and I think it has been working well so far.</li>
            <li> so I doubt it&#x27;ll go very far...which makes it kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> I just started using it 3 days ago so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found products that I can used at Amazon to mix up my compounds utilizing my pharmacist training and old apothecary books.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old</li>
            <li> but the way the bottle looks, it appears old and worn.</li>
            <li> I have used this product just one week, so far it has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I like the product so far.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so soft</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old, &amp; have no wrinkles @ all, 😁</li>
            <li> Despite its viscosity, this serum absorbs completely into the skin without a hint of oiliness.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks now and have really seen a difference in the texture of my skin, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> this process leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and well hydrated..</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and taunt.</li>
            <li> Imagine never having acne your whole life, turn 55, have acne and red patches on your face!</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much risk in buying it, given the low price, so I did.  </li>
            <li> Oh, btw, I am 44 years old</li>
            <li> It is soft and looks youthful.</li>
            <li> I like this so far.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 bottles; surprised bottles were not sealed.</li>
            <li> I only tried this a few times so far, but it really leaves the skin so smooth and soft without an oily feel.  </li>
            <li> easily popped off, not sure what could be in this bottle, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Pretty much wasted most of it and as you only get .5 ounce that makes this much more expensive than thought.</li>
            <li> Bottle was less than 80% full.</li>
            <li> bottle was half full when I received it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The description of this product states that it is the same product with a new look, well the product itself must be new too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I see with this product is it needs a longer eye dropper and also bigger bottle, as it doesn&#x27;t really last a full month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, I am telling all my friends about the new miracle I have found!</li>
            <li> Would be cool if it was the serum and a little weight loss.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I save not using commercial products that don&#x27;t fulfill their promises, especially the televised sellers.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Ive noticed that the fine lines on my face are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> was half full and open ----</li>
            <li> told them bottle was open and half full</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much packaging was used for such a small amount of product I can buy the same type of product and get much more for less money.</li>
            <li> I started out dull and now have hydrated, smooth and glowing</li>
            <li> I had some lines on my upper lip that are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> but the product barely lasted a 2 weeks</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft &amp; moist after applying this daily.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that product&#x27;s performance is nowhere near as effective as this one is, and I now have a larger bottle to use.  </li>
            <li> I am using it - seems like a nice serum - poor dropper as it is too long for the bottle</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid should hydrate the skin not dry it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the new clear bottle several times and each time my skin is immediately dry and tight ... not the good tight, but an overly dry tight.</li>
            <li> But looks like it really works may be due to sort of thicker fluid.</li>
            <li> Still too early to determine if this is something I want to use long term.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few weeks and have noticed only a small change, but that could be due to being older and having more damage than others.</li>
            <li> I have been using a different brand of hyaluronic acid for the past few months now, also purchased from Amazon, and it has been just ok.  </li>
            <li> Use just a little bit in certain spots of your face to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time being consistent in use</li>
            <li> Still deciding  Haven&#x27;t used long enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to determine whether it is working or not.</li>
            <li> have dry skin with occasional pimples in my t-zone when it becomes oilier than usual at certain times of the month</li>
            <li> really have not tried any other product to compare to, but i like the tight feeling it leaves the forehead and under the eyes, wish the tubes were larger.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried it all and very few if any products did much to really improve the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried it all and very few if any products did much to really improve the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and trying hard to stay young.  </li>
            <li> my country those thing are not available, (I live in the country Georgia) and it takes almost week to ship the product.</li>
            <li> and my skin was extra dry</li>
            <li> It tightens without making my skin feel dry and it seems to be improving the texture of my skin, which is helping my overall complexion.</li>
            <li> I see a marked improvement on the look of my face---cheek wrinkles are less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel silky soft and after only a few weeks use I&#x27;m already getting compliments on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of other more expensive products, but this is the one I&#x27;ll keep buying.</li>
            <li> It was strange.</li>
            <li> for as long as it lasts.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was almost empty, I used only for a wk.</li>
            <li> I never expected to see results after just a week; guess I&#x27;m so used to looking at the same face everyday.</li>
            <li> It tightened only while it was wet to dry, But did nothing for my lines on my face...???  </li>
            <li> Although my lines are not totally gone in two months, they are getting softer and less deep.  </li>
            <li> It was totally resealed and refilled with some other product.</li>
            <li> Bottles of serum were different colors from each other</li>
            <li> compared to other products with same ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back, too small for my taste, you have to order constantly or several at one time.</li>
            <li> My order arrived within a few days and I&#x27;m using it on a  regular basis because it makes my skin look so much younger.</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS</li>
            <li> Besides the small size of the product, she didn&#x27;t notice any difference so far.</li>
            <li> But I will not buy this again, tiny amount becomes even less as eyedropper cannot reach the portion in the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a slight reduction in wrinkles but that is probably because I only use it once a day in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Second half was a pain to try to get.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a similar product but switched to this after watching &amp;#34; The Doctors&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m going to go through this entire bottle in two weeks or less</li>
            <li> I simply thought it was odd for this type of product to be sold un-sealed.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old,and decided instead of using expensive creams to use pure hyaluronic acid with some regular face cream,and my choice was just rendom.</li>
            <li> So many other products of this nature are impossible to apply makeup over.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Really am not seeing any results.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my skin feel velvety and have a pink healthiness to it.</li>
            <li> BUT there&#x27;s not much of it</li>
            <li> I think this is hype with no real results.</li>
            <li> Made absolutely no changes in my face.</li>
            <li> WOW....goes on wet and sticky and feels like baby skin in just moments.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and regret every penny I spent on it</li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars as I would like to see a bigger bottle and due to the fact that it was rather hard to get it opened initially.</li>
            <li> Product really hasn&#x27;t had time to show measurable results, however I doubt I will reorder this, due to it being quite expensive (one bottle lasting about 2 weeks, maybe).</li>
            <li> I also got the other formula of this stuff and that bottle was almost empty.</li>
            <li> This serum is rather thick in substance, so it won&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO complaints of how well it works Only a little complaint I wish it was a larger size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> No longer need lotions and other serums.  </li>
            <li> You can feel it working only a few seconds, which is what you want from a product like this!</li>
            <li> threw the other one away.</li>
            <li> The size is not specified because it is such a small amount.  </li>
            <li> First off the wording on the bottle just smeared off - so I was unable to read the instructions.</li>
            <li> Only thing I do not like is the amount of product in the bottle seems to be small</li>
            <li> and you only need a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> It also works on dry heels!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a half empty bottle or not</li>
            <li> twice daily, I stared using this product on 6/25, there is approximately 1/4 of the bottle left.  </li>
            <li> This seemed to be good, but only a .5 ounce, which is why it was cheaper, but the worst part is the dropper only dipped half way into the bottle, making it very hard to get the other half out.</li>
            <li> hardly there.(I frown a lot and have always had tiny lines there.)</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad but the packing is deceiving as far as the amount you get and the dropper doesn&#x27;t get the last of it from the bottom, at this price I want every last drop.</li>
            <li> I vaguely felt my skin tingling after the first few times of use</li>
            <li> The whole thing looks like a fake.</li>
            <li> It reduces frown lines and fades dark spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but remember when using it that just one small drop goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The serum it self is clear and thin with no scent.</li>
            <li> brand almost seems watered down in comparison.</li>
            <li> It seems to slightly tighten my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have just used it for less than a week</li>
            <li> I faithfully used as directed and found the product to be less than reliable.</li>
            <li> After a few days I looked into the mirror closely and was really surprised of the dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I had to turn the bottle over and hit it off of the palm of my hand to get what little product there was out.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working but would like a little faster results.</li>
            <li> Did notice that when it dried on my face, it felt tight.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, the dropper on this bottle is ridiculously long, it goes all the way into the actual dropper part, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to squeeze the dropper because half of it has the hard dropper-part thing stuck in it.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days, I noticed a lessening of the few wrinkles I do have around my eyes.</li>
            <li> skin did breakout for a few days</li>
            <li> FaceTime the recommendation of using a few drops</li>
            <li> The .5 oz bottle lasted a little over one week!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small bottle deceive you...</li>
            <li> not sure what happened to it</li>
            <li> so I find it difficult to believe they are one in the same.  </li>
            <li> Not sure the purpose of this</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the volume is so small.  </li>
            <li> I usually feel that I have to use a moisturizer after applying the serum.</li>
            <li> pretty bottle but terrible dropper,  only 1/4 the size of the bottle, does not work.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount before moisturizer in areas with deepest wrinkles</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid/Vitamin C products made without parabens are hard to find from mainstream retailers, I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s hard to use.they should improve it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell.</li>
            <li> the label/wring on the bottle is almost completely gone/peeled off so bad that you cannot read what the product is.</li>
            <li> (and weird/faulty dropper), at least for me.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that were really expensive and didn&#x27;t get the results I get from this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I believe that it&#x27;s contains very little amount of vitamin C and the results after use it all is poor.</li>
            <li> is very small need to purchase 3 or 4 bottles at once.</li>
            <li> (Sorry, not very articulate today).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is, it is crazy expensive compared to the other brand I used.  </li>
            <li> I am on the second bottle and nothing has happened yet , too bad.</li>
            <li> Like water, not a good item for me.  </li>
            <li> Meant to return and never got around to it, and afraid to use due to the unsealed box and uneffective seal on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I only used it once because I received a cracked bottle:(</li>
            <li> At least one knows it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> at the very least, the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> This has a very thick texture and it dries out your skin.</li>
            <li> The bottles had caps that were not sealed (plastic was broken), and the consistency of the serum was very thick, like aloe gel.  </li>
            <li> Not a great product for the price.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for small amount, but this product works!.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping for dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything dramatic after using this prodcut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jan Marini products for years, but it is just so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it wasn&#x27;t expensive product and my bottle came</li>
            <li> Unable to determine effectiveness of the product at this time.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed and to make matters worse, I purchased two bottles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I dropped the glass bottle on my ceramic  tiled bathroom floor and was a mes!</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I feel very bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Nice product.  Absorbs quickly and hydrates.</li>
            <li> I just started using it 3 days ago so far I like the product.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff! I apply it twice a day and it has been making a difference in my skin. It is more moist and smoother.</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS</li>
            <li> This product was not the original packaging. It was totally resealed and refilled with some other product. shame on you</li>
            <li> Expensive for small amount, but this product works!.  Love the feel and look on my skin.  I perceive a noticeable difference after consistent use in only 1 week.</li>
            <li> I typically use this kind of stuff before bed but one day I woke up and my skin was extra dry so I thought I&#x27;d use it in the morning. Bad idea. I vaguely felt my skin tingling after the first few times of use but when I used it in the morning, I saw the effects. Within 5 minutes my skin was tingling and I had red patches on both cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is thicker than many serums and if you have sensitive skin, I definitely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle from one vendor and got the real deal in a sealed bottle in a sealed box.  Very light watery serum, tiny drops spread readily to entire face.  No longer need lotions and other serums.  I liked it so much I ordered a four bottle deal from another vendor.  The bottles had caps that were not sealed (plastic was broken), and the consistency of the serum was very thick, like aloe gel.  Since Amazon is allowing easy return, I will return the purchase, though I almost feel as id I should send the bottles to ULTA as well as the Feds to check out for tampering instead.</li>
            <li> I purchased product for my wife based on her friend&#x27;s recommendation.  After using the product for a few days, she said she could feel the difference and is satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and this is by far the best.  Works exactly as promised and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this. Wrinkles are faded with smooth skin tone</li>
            <li> This product was like putting on a facial mask.. It tightened only while it was wet to dry, But did nothing for my lines on my face...???  You decide..</li>
            <li> At first the product had a very nice appeal however it has not been easy to get the right amount out of the drop bottle. The product does not get easily absorbed by my skin. After about three weeks of consistent application I have not seen any beneficial effects. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really am not seeing any results.</li>
            <li> This was the first product with hyaluronic acid that I tried.  It seemed that the bottle was consumed rather quickly, so the next time I went to a different brand that had a larger bottle.  Unfortunately, that product&#x27;s performance is nowhere near as effective as this one is, and I now have a larger bottle to use.  This product is easier to apply: it goes on smoothly, spreads easily, and takes less product  than others to cover the same area.  Also, my skin is not irritated by this product, as it sometimes gets with others even when I immediately apply a moisturizer.  I found that this product is very effective when paired with a moisturizer that has calcium.  My next purchase of a hyaluronic acid product will be this one.</li>
            <li> I only used it once because I received a cracked bottle:(</li>
            <li> Not a great product for the price.  I have purchased other products on Amazon that I liked better than this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my skin feel velvety and have a pink healthiness to it. Worked for me and i use it with reserveage tablets</li>
            <li> Still deciding  Haven&#x27;t used long enough.</li>
            <li> Nice solution for face that plumps it up. As I got older, my face slid downward.  However, after just a week&#x27;s use, It is pumping up nicely and even indentation on each side of my nose along with the lines above and in corners of my mouth have filled in.  I use it lightly at night as potions used nightly avail themselves of the body&#x27;s repair time in sleep.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I save not using commercial products that don&#x27;t fulfill their promises, especially the televised sellers. Although not as costly, drugstore products usually only help go smooth the skin and sometimes brighten.  I&#x27;ve found products that I can used at Amazon to mix up my compounds utilizing my pharmacist training and old apothecary books.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three months.  Feels good and tightens my skin.  I have reordered it several times. I believe it is nourishig my skin with vitamin C and hyrulonic acid to keep it younger and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> great serum! not sticky, great under makeup and at night, skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Ladies, at my age (63) I’ve tried it all and very few if any products did much to really improve the way my skin looks. This hyaluronic serum has worked wonders. My wrinkles aren’t as visible, my skin feels tighter. Try it, you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Dropped 1st one and had to buy again</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a hydrating skin serum.  I am on my second bottle and will continue to use it.  I have very sensitive skin and this one does not break me out.  I mix my retinoid gel with this serum and use it nightly.  The serum keeps my skin from becoming too irritated from the retinoid.</li>
            <li> Good product, but WHERE is it made?  Switzerland, India, China??&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, there is nothing on the bottle that indicates ingredients or origin. Why is that?  None of this is printed; neither on box nor on bottle.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic acid works about the same as others I have tried. I was surprised at how much packaging was used for such a small amount of product I can buy the same type of product and get much more for less money. Pay attention to the amount of HA in the bottle and not just the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vit C serum for sometime but this one is the best I have tried. My skin is very smooth, pores are invisible and fine lines are reduced..</li>
            <li> I love how this serum works for me. It is a great \\&quot;stand alone\\&quot; product and works great as an anti aging aagent and in retaining moisture on my skin as well. I have been using it with an SPF Moisturizer in the mornings and layered with a repair cream before I hit the bed at night. The results I have been getting from it are truly impressive because it diminished the annoying fine lines on the side of my nose. It has also given me a clearer complexion - and I cannot be happier! This is a very impressive skin care product. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I&#x27;m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated serum .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks and have seen my pores reducing in size, since I am 72, I am very grateful to see this happening. I hope they continue to diminish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for nay age.</li>
            <li> Not the fountain of youth but skin feels temporarily tighter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, and a great price too! I have used the regular strength version from Ultra Pure Swiss in the past and liked it, but because I am in my 50&#x27;s I thought I would try their stronger &amp;#34;Forte&amp;#34; version. And I&#x27;m glad I did! It costs a bit more, bit it has twice the active ingredient--hyaluronic acid, which is a girl&#x27;s best friend! It&#x27;s super light weight and my skin just drinks it right up, looking instantly firmer and younger. I&#x27;ve used plenty of other more expensive products, but this is the one I&#x27;ll keep buying. It does the job, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> It works great, you just need to make sure that you follow the directions and apply the moisturizer, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I like Loreal Youth Code with 30 Spf, and Neutrogena with Retinol better.  Also it&#x27;s not a cream so you still need cream in addition. I didn&#x27;t see any results that would make me continue with the Ultima Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> From what I read, primers are important, so I invested in this as the price was deeply discounted.  I use good moisturizer over it.  Hopefully it&#x27;s helping!  But I will not buy this again, tiny amount becomes even less as eyedropper cannot reach the portion in the bottom of the bottle.  Has a wonderful smell, though.</li>
            <li> I recently got this serum for my mom. She is 59 and she really needs a nice serum that would give her skin a good consistence. Besides the small size of the product, she didn&#x27;t notice any difference so far. She has been using it for more than two weeks now.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and I have tried so many products through out the years from &#x27;high-line&#x27; products to drug store. This product is incredible and my skin looks the best it has ever looked. There is a difference from the very first application. It plumps your skin and wrinkles are noticeably diminished. It lifts and tightens. I have taken to using it on my hands and elbows, quite by accident; I would just rub in the excess left if my hand after applying on my face. What a surprise!  And you can apply makeup over it. So many other products of this nature are impossible to apply makeup over. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy a larger bottle. I am a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I tried, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I thought &#x27;OK&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;The second time around I tried a different brand, there was a big difference.  The second one I used (am currently using) seems much more concentrated, or potent and worked great under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;This brand almost seems watered down in comparison.</li>
            <li> Received without any packing slip, bottle didn&#x27;t have any kind of seal to ensure that it hadn&#x27;t been opened previously, it had oily fingerprints, bottle cap and stopper easily popped off, not sure what could be in this bottle, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Does as advertised. I definitely like this product, easy to use and will purchase more. I have suggested it to friends.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and I am considering purchasing it again. In my case, the contents were only enough for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Product arrived without a packing slip, looked like somebody just threw the bottle into the box, and the bottle was NOT sealed. How could one be certain of what&#x27;s inside it? The whole thing looks like a fake. I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Don&#x27;t let the small bottle deceive you...a little goes a very long way.  It makes my skin feel silky soft and after only a few weeks use I&#x27;m already getting compliments on my complexion.  This is definitely a must have product!</li>
            <li> It came with the plastic seal intact, but it did not prevent me from opening the bottle.  Bottle opened and seal still intact.  Meant to return and never got around to it, and afraid to use due to the unsealed box and uneffective seal on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This really works.  Use it everyday.  It has improved the look and feel of my skin, even on my neck area.</li>
            <li> Hope it works well,I have read that this is good for skin. I Will keep on using it as suggested</li>
            <li> The product felt good to the skin, but it didn&#x27;t last long enough to know if it really made any difference.</li>
            <li> This 180 Acid serum is great! I use it on my face in the morning and right before I go to bed, and it make my face feel clean and refreshed! You can feel it working only a few seconds, which is what you want from a product like this! It&#x27;s like a gel consistency, and smells better than most acid like serums, which is an obvious plus. This product does exactly what it says, and is certainly worth the money! *I was given this product to review*</li>
            <li> Nice product, smells good!!</li>
            <li> I love the product,smooth and you can feel it working BUT there&#x27;s not much of it so I doubt it&#x27;ll go very far...which makes it kind of expensive.If you can afford it,it&#x27;s a great product...</li>
            <li> I just placed my third order for this product because it does what the ad says it does:  firms skin, is anti-aging, and produces more youthful-looking skin.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I do wish the bottles were larger so I wouldn&#x27;t have to place orders as often as I do, but that&#x27;s the only thing I can think of that might make me feel compelled to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few days but it feels wonderful on my face. I used it to replace a much more expensive product by Obagi and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for wrinkles.  Bottles of serum were different colors from each other and I noticed no wrinkle reduction.  I think this is hype with no real results.</li>
            <li> I thought all was well but I just opened the box. the label/wring on the bottle is almost completely gone/peeled off so bad that you cannot read what the product is. the product contents seem ok but the way the bottle looks, it appears old and worn. not sure what happened to it</li>
            <li> I like the product and have ordered it 3 times.  I didn&#x27;t see an overnight miracle but can report that my skin is softer and more plump.  I have eczema so the product is perfect for my problematic skin.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> has not had time to do what it said to do  will need more time to see if product claims are true</li>
            <li> THIS IS A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT!  PURE, ORGANIC, NATURAL.  AND MY SKIN REALLY LIKES IT, BECAUSE AS SOON AS IT DRIES, MY SKIN LOOKS BETTER, FEELS SOFTER, AND GLOWS.  CAN&#x27;T ASK FOR MORE!  I&#x27;LL REMAIN A CUSTOMER!</li>
            <li> This serum is rather thick in substance, so it won&#x27;t last for long. But looks like it really works may be due to sort of thicker fluid. The skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> I am used to using a different brand for my face and I seen no difference using this product at all.</li>
            <li> Thai product is good, it reduce small lines and minimize pores.&lt;br /&gt;Size is very small need to purchase 3 or 4 bottles at once.</li>
            <li> This serum is just like magic ...when I awake in the morning I look like I am 10..firm wrinkleless skin...just love it.  I would drink it if I could</li>
            <li> This is the greatest anti-aging product I have ever used. It tightens facial skin&lt;br /&gt;lessening the depth of wrinkles.  It also seals in moisture leaving the skin&lt;br /&gt;soft and supple.  It reduces frown lines and fades dark spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
            <li> Bottle was less than 80% full. I don&#x27;t know if it was a used return or what. Should get a new full bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product just one week, so far it has met my expectations. I can recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine lines and aging skin.  Very affordable price compared to dept. store brands but works as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good anti-aging/repair skin products. I&#x27;m 40 so these type of repair/prevent products are becoming even more important to me. I have skin that can become sensitive to retinol-based products, so after some research decided to try an hyaluronic-based product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Ultima Pure Swiss brand for several weeks now, morning and night, and I think it has been working well so far. It tightens without making my skin feel dry and it seems to be improving the texture of my skin, which is helping my overall complexion. I plan on continuing to use this and hope to see continued improvements to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. A little bit goes a long way too!&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin with occasional pimples in my t-zone when it becomes oilier than usual at certain times of the month and I&#x27;m still able to use this serum all over my face and throat.</li>
            <li> Like water, not a good item for me.  Sent back!  Order 2 sent 1 back threw the other one away.</li>
            <li> Great product! I was surprised how smoothly it applies, and how little is needed to cover my face and neck. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and see/feel a noticeable difference.. Was also very happy with Expederm; shipping was timely, no complaints. Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in good shape.  This product actually works better than most similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  While no such products are perfect, this one appears to be a step above its competitors.</li>
            <li> The description of this product states that it is the same product with a new look, well the product itself must be new too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is nothing like the original version so I find it difficult to believe they are one in the same.  My original blue bottle left my skin super soft the second I rubbed it on. I&#x27;ve used the new clear bottle several times and each time my skin is immediately dry and tight ... not the good tight, but an overly dry tight. I am so disappointed and to make matters worse, I purchased two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this serum daily to see if there is any change in my skin. If things improve, I will provide an updated review.</li>
            <li> It seems to woks great but not worth the price.  The size is not specified because it is such a small amount.  There are better buys out there!</li>
            <li> I am choosing this rating as I have only been using the product for a short time.  I like the product so far.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;And I also like that once it has &#x27;dried&#x27; in the skin I can use my own moisturizer and put make up on!  The price is&lt;br /&gt;reasonable compared to other products with same ingredients.  Linda Hudgel  Tucson, AZ</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It was strange. I also got the other formula of this stuff and that bottle was almost empty. This bottle was full????</li>
            <li> This is the only serum I found that has all of the ingredients I like such as Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid that has a smell that doesn&#x27;t disturb me.  I recommend this product.  It is highly effective.</li>
            <li> i LOVE THE 180 SERUM.  IT ACTUALLY LIVES UP TO ITS REPUTATION.&lt;br /&gt;VICKI SMITH</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have purchased it before and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so soft</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product. I like the way it is so quickly absorbed into my skin. I notice some plumpness where I have applied the serum and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months mostly twice a day but sometimes I skip a day.  I did not skip any days (twice per da) the first month of using it.  I had some lines on my upper lip that are almost completely gone.  It makes my skin look and feel soft and smooth.  I do wish it came it a larger size bottle but remember when using it that just one small drop goes a long way.  I use it on my neck also.&lt;br /&gt;Try it I think you will love it too!</li>
            <li> I would and did recommend the product to my friends and daughter. everyone was asking what I was using. That&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My complexion has really improved. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product has good quick results. I am happily satisfied and would recommend it to others  for their best results.</li>
            <li> execelent  you feel  refresh  and your skin  is very elsctic  I belive  buy theis product I make very good choice</li>
            <li> After being on my second bottle of this serum I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.  I have hopes that it will make a difference on my wrinkled face.</li>
            <li> good price. I have a hard time being consistent in use so I am not the best to say anything</li>
            <li> OK I have tried a lot of products similar to this, but this one is my favorite! It has the best consistency, not sticky no weird smell goes on very nice and looks great on my skin. I will definitely buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to determine whether it is working or not. But I can tell you that when I pulled the bottle out of the box, all the writing was smeared on the blue bottle. My first thought, was this was some kind of knock off. My second thought was maybe I shouldn&#x27;t put this on my face.</li>
            <li> First off the wording on the bottle just smeared off - so I was unable to read the instructions. I didn&#x27;t save the box.  Second I don&#x27;t know if I received a half empty bottle or not but the product barely lasted a 2 weeks and I wasn&#x27;t using it on a daily basis.  I struggled with getting the product up into the dropper - I had to turn the bottle over and hit it off of the palm of my hand to get what little product there was out.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and trying hard to stay young.  This serum seems to help my skin a lot and it&#x27;s so easy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and have loved it. However, the new bottle is not an improvement. Drop it once and it breaks. The old bottle was much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> super product and super strong and effective...for as long as it lasts.  The instructions are to use several drops morning and night - and that&#x27;s exactly what I did.  The .5 oz bottle lasted a little over one week!  That&#x27;s the reason for 3 stars, and I don&#x27;t think I will reorder.  I want value, not to have to buy the product again and again.  So, I would say that for the amount that is in the bottle, this product is overpriced.</li>
            <li> Ladies, at my age (63) I’ve tried it all and very few if any products did much to really improve the way my skin looks. This hyaluronic serum has worked wonders. My wrinkles aren’t as visible, my skin feels tighter. Try it, you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product after application.  It seems to slightly tighten my skin.  I have been using the product for about month and my skin feels softer.  I have seen a slight reduction in wrinkles but that is probably because I only use it once a day in the morning.  It is recommended to use it morning and night.  I will continue to purchase and use this product.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be making my fine lines less noticeable.  It is easy to apply because it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> saw no results from this at all.  I guess it just depends on what you are looking for. May work for others</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and loved it,  My order arrived within a few days and I&#x27;m using it on a  regular basis because it makes my skin look so much younger.</li>
            <li> I tried others brands but not hydrate as well as this one</li>
            <li> I use this nightly and it feels great to put on and I follow it with argan oil and night cream mixture as this doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize. So will see how this works longer term.</li>
            <li> This product is a decent product, but since they changed the bottle to a very cheap bottle it&#x27;s quality is lacking. I received 2 bottles&lt;br /&gt;broken in transit, and the last bottle,( and it will be the last )  it leaked most of it&#x27;s contents out, if you travel you do not want this in&lt;br /&gt;you personal bag or you lose your money &amp; your product. I did not contact the seller because I an sooooooooo pissed !</li>
            <li> Directions state use several drops (3) twice daily, I stared using this product on 6/25, there is approximately 1/4 of the bottle left.  This will not last a month.  Product really hasn&#x27;t had time to show measurable results, however I doubt I will reorder this, due to it being quite expensive (one bottle lasting about 2 weeks, maybe).</li>
            <li> The product is Okay. I have just used it for less than a week and I don&#x27;t see a different. Also the box labelled as new but the glass container inside is not sealed.</li>
            <li> did not receive with this order.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few weeks and have noticed only a small change, but that could be due to being older and having more damage than others.</li>
            <li> Ultima ll 180 Pure Swiss Serum really works! After I wash my face, I massage it deeply with special attn to areas such as neck, jaw line, &amp; underneath my eyes. The results are amazing, it smooths out wrinkles almost immediately... IT REALLY WORKS! I am 61 years old, &amp; have no wrinkles @ all, 😁</li>
            <li> Not sure the purpose of this</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve been only using this product a short time,  I&#x27;m completely happy with it so far, and will most likely reorder. Hyaluronic acid/Vitamin C products made without parabens are hard to find from mainstream retailers, I&#x27;ve discovered. The ingredient stack lists hyaluronic acid right at the top, which means that a little will go a long way! One drop spreads easily to cover my entire face and part of my neck. Despite its viscosity, this serum absorbs completely into the skin without a hint of oiliness. That is important to me because I am 61 but still have oil-prone skin. I never expected to see results after just a week; guess I&#x27;m so used to looking at the same face everyday. However, I watched a video of myself taken just yesterday, and I have to say--smugly--that my face looked smoother and slightly more plumped out than what I &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; in the mirror!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. It was a gift for my mom. She used it before and ran out so I got her another bottle. She seems to be very happy with the product or else why ask for another one.</li>
            <li> I do love this product</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My face feels so soft &amp; moist after applying this daily.  The price is fantastic.  I have used other products that were really expensive and didn&#x27;t get the results I get from this moisturizer.  I am definitely going to order a couple more bottles.</li>
            <li> I think women of all ages could benefit from using this product.  My skin actually does look better, and feels so soft to touch. I love this product and recommend it to women of any age, that want to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> I did not notice and changes in my skin AT ALL send me another one free maybe i can tell the difference then!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It has really helped fill out my fine lines and wrinkles. All you need is a tiny bit every couple days and it really works. This is my second bottle, I am telling all my friends about the new miracle I have found!</li>
            <li> I have never used Hyaluronic Acid but have seen the name on so many products and in so many articles, it was worth a try for the price.  I am 41, healthy, active and fighting the aging process every step.  This has been a great product to use after a summer in the Florida sun and as an after treatment for my derma roller.  It is very light and feels much better than other anti-aging moisturizers on my prone to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I find that suddenly people are telling me how nice my skin looks.  This is a really good product that produces observable results.</li>
            <li> Delightful product.  Goes on smoothly and feels wonderful</li>
            <li> works great, makes my skin feel soft and smooths out the wrinkles</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does what it claims!  This stuff is the real deal.  It fills, plumps, or whatever it does to reduce fine lines/wrinkles.  I&#x27;m a guy, and I put it on after I get ready in the morning.  It has practically no odor and really does the job.  I&#x27;ve bought it before and will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> arrived on time, packaged very nicely and was as expected. results have been as expected, nice to have vitamin c serum combined with hyaluronic acid.two products in one</li>
            <li> I bought this product to gift it to my mother. I did not know this product but I have heard some good comments about it from some friends. When my mother received it, She was really happy. She knew this product.. About dealer, very responsable and reliable.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks now and have really seen a difference in the texture of my skin, especially around my eyes.  The lines have definitely &amp;#34;softened&amp;#34; in that area.  Absolutely will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best I have tried!  I feel it working immediately upon use. I have used it for about two weeks now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product absorbed into my skin quickly and did not leave a residue. I applied it in the morning, before using my regular moisturizer. Within a few days, I noticed a lessening of the few wrinkles I do have around my eyes. I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff works GREAT!  Absolutely NO complaints of how well it works Only a little complaint I wish it was a larger size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I only tried this a few times so far, but it really leaves the skin so smooth and soft without an oily feel.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I  have used, and tried many skin care products, and my 56 year old skin is evidence of all the research and effort I put into it. It looks amazing., even my dermatologist wanted to know my regimen. One product that I wanted to add in was a strong Hylauronic Acid Serum. First I went to my usual companies, Philosophy, Dr Denese, Dr Perricone, then I did a Google search for the &amp;#34;Best Hylauronic Acids&amp;#34;. This product was mentioned, and after comparing prices and ingredients, there was no comparison. I feel like in the month I have been using it there is a new plumpness to my skin. I have used Retinol for quite a while, so no wrinkles, but this just made the areas that are prone fill in and get softer. It also absorbs very quickly- oh-I almost forgot: all you need is ONE drop in the palm of your hand, then quickly rub it all over your face or you will have the softest palms in the world! For this price, and the great results, I will be staying on it.</li>
            <li> I like this and will continue using it as the evidence supports using Vit C and hyaluric acid for the skin and this product has both. It makes my skin feel smoother and is absorbed very quickly</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonderfully in conjunction with my other products.</li>
            <li> When I received my product I was a bit surprised on the size of the bottle ! I really thought it would be a bigger bottle, the bottle wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top, I did try it out and it went on smoothly , I like how it made my skin feel !  I could see resulte and feel how my skin has plumed up,  I bought the 180 serum so I will continue to use it , I will update if I see any resulted ,I don&#x27;t know if I can continue to buy it unless I see great results! Keep you posted!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I lightly mist my skin with water after a through cleansing and then apply your product to my skin.  It absorbs quickly and without any tacky residue.  I then follow up with my regular moisturizer this process leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and well hydrated.. Fell in love with this product after my first bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Made absolutely no changes in my face. I faithfully used as directed and found the product to be less than reliable. Would advise against spending your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This company contacted me immediately and are replacing the product, I love this, it is so wonderful on my skin, it keeps it moist thru the day,and I have very dry skin and use a lot of products. Since getting Ultima Pure Swiss, I only need it and make up and I am on my way, I just hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.lol....this is a very honorable company, because I have never had a response so fast and so kind.  I would and have recommended this product to all my friends and co workers...I am positive they will love it too.</li>
            <li> I use it for sometime and till now, considering the preice, I&#x60;m quite satisfied. We have to be carefull and use only the necessary serum, since it&#x60;s quite viscous and we can spend the bottle too soon.</li>
            <li> It only takes moments after using this product to feel and see the amazing difference.  Skin feels soft and taunt. And look smoother as well,</li>
            <li> The Swiss have always offered quality, and this product is above the rest. I find it useful to use this first-thing in the morning, and then argan oil afterwards. This was a recommendation I learned on-line, and it appears to be a good match for me. The way to know, is to try it yourself. My face always feels uplifted with an application of hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I am using it - seems like a nice serum - poor dropper as it is too long for the bottle so it doesnn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> WOW....goes on wet and sticky and feels like baby skin in just moments. Unfortunately I dropped the glass bottle on my ceramic  tiled bathroom floor and was a mes! Luckily, I ordered 2 bottles &amp; still using the other one that I hold onto dearly now. The first night I used a serum prep which is think is essential to using any serum; to prepare the skin to accept any serum. After a few days I looked into the mirror closely and was really surprised of the dramatic results. I had a severe case of Rosacea &amp; this Serum really calmed it down up to 75% which is SUPER impressive. Use just a little bit in certain spots of your face to make it last longer. I wish the design of the dropper/bottle were better because the dropper refuses to bring heavy serum into the dropper to release the drops you need to apply. The user needs to use a finger on the side of the glass dropper to get the serum onto you finger, then to your face. I definitely see why there are RAVE reviews, because I would continue to buy &amp; use. There are competing serums in this price range right now on Amazon &amp; Baby Face is one that I ordered since they greatly lowered their prices and ship USPS priority. Their packaging is much better I I&#x27;ve have had  great success with their other face products for Mature, Dry sensitive skin, Rosacea flare-ups. Imagine never having acne your whole life, turn 55, have acne and red patches on your face! I was so overwhelmed that I cried like a teenager. I have ordered the BF serum to compare and will update when I use if anyone has any interest for a real comparison. JUST FIX THE PACKAGING &amp; I might buy more. We&#x27;ll see, as I am not the only buyer here that hates the design of the dropper/bottle.</li>
            <li> This was my second go around with this product.  It is everything it says it is.  My skin is much improved since I started using it</li>
            <li> Very good customer service. I had a problem and it was corrected</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Gals over 45plus this is a wonderful,soothing firming serum.  I only wish it was a larger size.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  Does everything as advertised with no sticky residue.  Have passed on info to all of my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; friends.  Thanks,  Shirley Coffey</li>
            <li> Product was as described, I have just started using product so I really can&#x27;t say how well it works at this time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ultima Pure Swiss for about a month.  My skin has noticeably improved and people have been noticing.  I am enjoying the compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on very smoothly, and has a luxurious feel.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to check back with the person of which this was purchased for, but in reading about the product I believe that they will be happy with what it is for.</li>
            <li> I thought that the serum would be stronger. I just started it, so I cannot say anything about end results. But there is no tingling on my skin when I apply it, which suggests that the Vit C in the serum is not (super strong) like it is advertised.</li>
            <li> Works well according to my wife!</li>
            <li> I really liked the product,however,the product does not last long at all. From what I was able to use it worked nicely. I would order again if the product came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> As tony the tigers says great</li>
            <li> Given the age of the skin the serum is applied to,it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> Love this product have used about three bottles.  I seem to have less noticable fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE it! Even in couple days I saw results. I am 50 years old,and decided instead of using expensive creams to use pure hyaluronic acid with some regular face cream,and my choice was just rendom. I am so happy that it worked !!!!!!!!!! Will reorder!&lt;br /&gt;In my country those thing are not available, (I live in the country Georgia) and it takes almost week to ship the product. So I definitely will take care in advance and reorder.</li>
            <li> Tiny bottle with a punch.  I have been using thsi along with a microneede roller, and also before I use my NuFace wrinkle remover light attachment, and I see a difference already after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell but I have noted a smoother look to my skin and I hasve only used product for 6 days!</li>
            <li> use it morning and night as instructed and you will see the difference.  skin looks and feels better.  love it</li>
            <li> bottle was half full when I received it from Amazon. what I received was ok but didn&#x27;t have enough Serum to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I researched this before buying.  It is an ingredient that is used for a lot of medical issues.  This product along with the microneedle therapy has really given me a results that I was seeking.  Although my lines are not totally gone in two months, they are getting softer and less deep.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months now, and I have to say that I&#x27;m neutral on it. There wasn&#x27;t much risk in buying it, given the low price, so I did.  It helped keep my skin from drying out on a day to day basis, but it really did not cause any real improvements over time.  Beautiful packaging, great price, but not very effective.</li>
            <li> was half full and open ---- then they sent email to see if everything was okay told them bottle was open and half full no response a month later get another email to see how i liked it ?????????/&lt;br /&gt;i ordered some from a different company and it works great</li>
            <li> This seemed to be good, but only a .5 ounce, which is why it was cheaper, but the worst part is the dropper only dipped half way into the bottle, making it very hard to get the other half out. Second half was a pain to try to get. Pretty much wasted most of it and as you only get .5 ounce that makes this much more expensive than thought.</li>
            <li> This has a very thick texture and it dries out your skin. Hyaluronic acid should hydrate the skin not dry it out. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.I can feel it working as soon as I apply it.Problem is I go thru&#x27; the bottle much too fast,but I can&#x27;t do without it now,I haven&#x27;t found anything better,&amp; I  have been around a long time.</li>
            <li> This product seems effective but caused my face to peel almost immediately. It is a little strong for me, but might be fine for someone else. At least one knows it&#x27;s working! I can use it only once per week.</li>
            <li> Excellent.It lives up to the ad. People think I look 15 years younger,. I am 67.</li>
            <li> I am hoping for dramatic results.  I will continue use until finished but may not order again.</li>
            <li> its just as descripted</li>
            <li> I used this product a few months ago and even though I was very satisfied, seeing an improvement in my skin, I tried a different product the following month.  I couldn&#x27;t wait for that product to be used up so I could reorder the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss serum again.  It goes on easy, a little goes a long way.  It makes my skin feel good, not dry or sticky and am looking forward to it improving my skin condition again.  I will for sure order this product again.  It was recommended by a good friend of mine who was also very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Very nice product-I use a combination of serums and this one doesn&#x27;t interact and is good quality.I can squish them in the palm of my hand and they slip-slide wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have used the serum only for a week, it seems very good, hopefully I can see results in the long run. Their service and delivery is great.......</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review.  I wanted to see how it was working for me first.  I used a bottle and am on my second.  I see a marked improvement on the look of my face---cheek wrinkles are less pronounced.  I like the way it feels as it tightens my skin.  I&#x27;ve Had a lot of sun damage over the years, and it makes me look older.  I was looking for a product that doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg, that still gave good results.  This seems to do just that .  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad but the packing is deceiving as far as the amount you get and the dropper doesn&#x27;t get the last of it from the bottom, at this price I want every last drop. Just not as consumer friendly as a similar product from watts beauty.</li>
            <li> I actually put this on a mask sheet and use it as a mask.  It&#x27;s powerful and works wonder.  This is the second time I&#x27;m buying it and I will continue to buy it!!</li>
            <li> Put under eyes and it acts like glue, does not help long term, peels off easily and doesn&#x27;t do well when put cream over it.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels soft and smooth after I apply this product.  Only thing I do not like is the amount of product in the bottle seems to be small and I run out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great mailed the product quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Pure luxury for mature skin. I loved the serum. Most important it has Vitamin C all faces need it. Thank you,180 Cosmetics.Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t notice any changes so I only gave it 3 stars.  No rashes either.  Did notice that when it dried on my face, it felt tight.  Like a egg white mask.  Only OK.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the volume is so small.  For the money the content should be greater. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The bottle was almost empty, I used only for a wk. because the bottle was 1/2 full&lt;br /&gt;So really don&#x27;t know it work</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it, it does absolutely nothing. I have been using it for 2 weeks and regret every penny I spent on it</li>
            <li> Seems to be working but would like a little faster results. But then again, who wouldn&#x27;t in this age of want it now.</li>
            <li> This product from this vendor arrived very quickly. I have been using for more than a month and have not seen any changes. Will give it more time and report back.</li>
            <li> This is not the first hyaluronic acid serum I have used. I am very pleased with it, especially for the price. It kept my skin well hydrated and gave my aging skin a nice glow. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Still too early to determine if this is something I want to use long term.</li>
            <li> I have been reading a lot about the best products for skin and this has a lot of the ingredients that most articles talk about.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broke when it arrived . However I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loretta</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;This 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a glass opaque bottle with a dropper. It is recommended for ages 40+. The serum it self is clear and thin with no scent. The first ingredient is water followed by hyaluronic Acid Serum and then vitamin C. A little drop will do your whole face and it absorbs quickly. Hyaluronic Acid Serum in combo with vitamin C is supposed to be phenomenal for your skin. I am excited for my winter dry skin to become rehydrated. I did have a problem with the packaging during shipment but the seller had excellent communication and responded very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a similar product but switched to this after watching &amp;#34; The Doctors&amp;#34;.  I have noticed my deep wrinkles are definitely looker softer.  I am on my first order but have just ordered two more as I don&#x27;t want to run out.  The only issue I see with this product is it needs a longer eye dropper and also bigger bottle, as it doesn&#x27;t really last a full month.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product and I plan on buying it forever!</li>
            <li> I think it is an okay product. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again. I have not noticed any results.</li>
            <li> high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
            <li> I have to say at 67 I don&#x27;t have a lot of hope ,but I saw the reviews and figured what the heck and gave it a try. I am on the second bottle and nothing has happened yet , too bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a year ago and really wanted to try it having read the great reviews. However, the bottle arrived unsealed with the writing on the blue bottle smeared and some crustiness around the cap. I wasn&#x27;t about to use it on my face! For the cost I didn&#x27;t bother returning it but I may try to reorder through a different site.</li>
            <li> I feel very bad but maybe I just have too deep wrinkles...of course I was hoping for a miracle but...it did not do anything...I only have wrinkles above my lip and I concentrated on that but.....do you have any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Great and will definitely order again.  Already recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> This serum seems to be a bit drying. I usually feel that I have to use a moisturizer after applying the serum.</li>
            <li> pretty bottle but terrible dropper,  only 1/4 the size of the bottle, does not work.  serum seems to do nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very diassapointed</li>
            <li> I like the way this serum feels. I have been using a tear drop size of this for a week or so and am fairly happy.&lt;br /&gt;My skin did breakout for a few days but I think it was the combination of me putting this on and then a thicker moisturizer at night. I tend to have problems when I do this....maybe I will eventually find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t do this? Or maybe it is the combo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think my skin is looking better. Kinda dewy and youthful. I looked in the mirror today and thought my face appeared thinner. I am going to pop on the scale tomorrow just to see if maybe I lost weight instead. Would be cool if it was the serum and a little weight loss. LOL! Oh, btw, I am 44 years old so keeping my skin looking good has become more important to me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was some what helpful :) I am giving 4 stars as I would like to see a bigger bottle and due to the fact that it was rather hard to get it opened initially.</li>
            <li> Use this for 2 week, great help with the skin&#x27;s hydration and texture, but not sure about the brown spot yet. Great for under the bare minerals I am using now, maes t not as chalky.</li>
            <li> This is the third product of yours that I have purchased.  The first product was in a bottle like I have this as shown.  The second product was in a pump bottle, when there was about  1/4 left I could not pump out any more. Last evening I spilled this  bottle, I was able to rescue some of the serum but lost quite a bit.  I think you should change the shape of the serum bottles and check with the manufacture of the pump bottle in  order the upgrade the pump.  I really like your products but I will look for a new product that I can handle.. Thank you, for listening.  Jo ANN Richardss</li>
            <li> Seriously love this product. I highly recommend this serum. My skin has never looked better. It is soft and looks youthful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks already and I have only been using this product for about a week. I&#x27;ve used Jan Marini products for years, but it is just so expensive.  I was looking for an alternative when I came across this product at Amazon. It amazes me how it has already reduced my pore size, diminishing wrinkles and is clearing up my skin tone too. I plan to purchase this product again and again.</li>
            <li> second time using this serum..love it...makes my face look and feel great</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a serum.  this is it.  It also works on dry heels!!!</li>
            <li> olis arrive en tres bon etat et toujours livraison rapide, je na;i pas encore u le temps de le tester ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for about two months i didn&#x27;t notice any difference . I&#x27;ll never buy this product again .</li>
            <li> It really feels good on the skin, is not one of those products that you feel everytime you smile or frown. The only draw back, too small for my taste, you have to order constantly or several at one time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t a huge serum person before trying this product. Everything I tried either left me greasy or there were no noticeable changes after a couple weeks of using it. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very nice although it is smaller than most serum bottles. It is all glass and has a glass dropper that I love. It adds to the appeal. It is a clear, thick (almost gel) and unscented serum that goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly. I applied it after my toner and my skin felt amazing. It plumped and hydrated my main problem area, my eyes. When applied under my makeup my it coms wonderfully. With only two weeks use two times a day the dry skin around my eyes have diminished, I have fewer fine lines and my eyelids aren&#x27;t are wrinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product to use if you are looking for something to bring your skin back to life. I started out dull and now have hydrated, smooth and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review. All opinions are from my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great &amp; I love it.  terrific consistency.</li>
            <li> I actually think it is pretty good.  Need to use it longer to see results I think though.  Makes your skin feel really good.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;I love this. I feel like I&#x27;m really getting something of high quality when I use this right before my moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t break me out. Quickly absorbs into the skin/ Non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**4/18/13 Ive noticed that the fine lines on my face are hardly noticeable. Since I purchased this for a moisturizer, getting rid of wrinkles was not on my mind. My crows feet and smile lines are only noticeable when I use them now.The biggest difference were with my frown lines...hardly there.(I frown a lot and have always had tiny lines there.) Now I&#x27;ve gotta get rid of those lines on my forehead (they are diminished...but still there).  Did I mention my face feels plump and soft?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that this is a bit pricy, for the size. (In my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try getting Hyaluronic Acid powder to see if that will be a better value.</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey, but is definitely a useful ally in the battle against skin damage. Smells great, easy to apply, and really moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Live it! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I am so torn on this product.  I have been using a different brand of hyaluronic acid for the past few months now, also purchased from Amazon, and it has been just ok.  I decided to switch it up and try this brand since it has added vitamin C and I can use all the help I can get :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel as though the product itself is superior than the cheaper brand as it&#x27;s more moisturizing. The only thing is, the dropper on this bottle is ridiculously long, it goes all the way into the actual dropper part, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to squeeze the dropper because half of it has the hard dropper-part thing stuck in it.  (Sorry, not very articulate today).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is, it is crazy expensive compared to the other brand I used.  If I remember correctly (I threw away the box), on the instructions it says to use \\&quot;several\\&quot; drops...SEVERAL drops?  If I did that, it may last me a week.  I wish I had it like that, but nope :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, I think in writing this review, I just realized that while the product itself is good, it&#x27;s not worth the price (and weird/faulty dropper), at least for me.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Just a small amount before moisturizer in areas with deepest wrinkles and you will see them start to disappear. Perfect for around mouth to plump those tiny lines and plump the lips.</li>
            <li> really have not tried any other product to compare to, but i like the tight feeling it leaves the forehead and under the eyes, wish the tubes were larger.</li>
            <li> I believe that it&#x27;s contains very little amount of vitamin C and the results after use it all is poor. Also it&#x27;s hard to use.they should improve it.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was expecting a bottle of twice the size when I received this.  I should have checked the size.  It felt great, but even with using sparingly to cover face, neck and décolleté, I finished the bottle after just over a week.  The price was low for this product and this is obviously why.</li>
            <li> I like this so far. I gave it three stars because it wasn&#x27;t expensive product and my bottle came 3/4 filled. FaceTime the recommendation of using a few drops I feel like I&#x27;m going to go through this entire bottle in two weeks or less</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything dramatic after using this prodcut. I will not be purchasing it again. I would not say that it works or does not work. It is hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I did not see a change at all.</li>
            <li> A very excellent product.  Did not have an obnoxious smell like some products.  Felt wonderful on the skin. Absorbed well and left no greasy feel.  My skin felt so very soft after using&lt;br /&gt;  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I got this when it was still in the blue bottle. It works great!! It helped to smooth out my skin and you only need a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month with no difference.  I found a temporary plumpness and tightness in my skin soon after applying but only for a very short period of time.  I have always taken very good care of my skin.  As we all know as we age, our skin will eventually show the signs of aging.  The good news I didn&#x27;t spend a lot for this product and enjoyed a few minutes of &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; skin which is why I gave it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I t s e x c e l l e n t p r o d u c t, Im very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> i use it after washing my face and apply it at night, my skin looks rejuveneted i would recommend it</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 bottles; surprised bottles were not sealed. I would have thought both the bottle &#x27;and&#x27; the box would have been sealed ....at the very least, the bottle itself. Cannot speak to the effectiveness as I have not yet used. I simply thought it was odd for this type of product to be sold un-sealed. If I were to reorder I would contact the manufacturer and confirm. Unable to determine effectiveness of the product at this time.</li>
