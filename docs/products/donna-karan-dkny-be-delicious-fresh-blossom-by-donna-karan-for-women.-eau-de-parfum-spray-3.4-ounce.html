            <li>love the light floral citrus smell - lasts a good couple</li>
            <li>This perfume is great, I love the smell, not to strong, light.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in great condition, sealed in the plastic cellophane and smelled exactly as it should.</li>

            <li>Nice fragrant but light, floral scent.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this fragrance : ) 100% Satisfied</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>Third one was perfect.</li>
            <li>Lovely fresh, muted floral scent... very nice counterbalance to the Be Delicious (Green) version...</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s favorite scent and glad it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li>If you like a clean floral scent this is what this fragrance brings!</li>
            <li>I love the original (green) and this stuff is great but not as good as the original.</li>
            <li>Still my favorite perfume...reminds me of a crisp spring day:-)</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, If you love fresh, fruity floral perfumes (along the lines of Marc Jacobs Daisy and its flankers), this is a must try.</li>
            <li>This perfume is more of a fresh spring/summer scent.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments and I can still smell the fragrance on me at the end of the day (which is very rare).  </li>
            <li>It is not as cloyingly sweet as Be Delicious, the green one, and is lighter.</li>
            <li>So fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li>Light and fresh but not too overpowering...closely smells like Delicious Green Apple</li>
            <li>smell, the package and the bottle itself seem to be original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday and office appropriate fragrance that no one would be offended by.</li>
            <li>This smells good at first then right away smells like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>This was a present for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li>But, the overall scent is gorgeous and belongs in my collection.</li>
            <li>Even then it stays pretty close to the skin after about an hour, so if you want something with strong sillage</li>
            <li>I somehow ordered this twice yesterday, and they were really quick to Take out my money</li>
            <li>I love to dust baby powder on top to lighten the scent even further.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This scent is light and pretty.</li>
            <li>Became my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Fresh Blossom is like a walk through a field of flowers on a sunny spring day.</li>
            <li>It is nice also for younger girls.</li>
            <li>The rose is prominent here (without being powdery), and the white florals are quite light, youthful and just pretty, while the red apple and the grapefruit notes make it fresh when first sprayed.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the spring time right when the peak of flowers bloom.</li>
            <li>Soft and floral, not too strong and lingers all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean smelling- not heavy!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for that special woman in your life.</li>
            <li>And if it helps, my family and significant other all have commented on how pretty I smell when I have this on - and who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
            <li>IS exactly what it&#x27;s named.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty, too.  </li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s my second time purchasing ;)</li>
            <li>thanks!  </li>
            <li>It is a very pretty and girly scent without being too young or powerful.</li>
            <li>Clean without smelling completely like laundry.</li>
            <li>Classic and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Very irritated to say the least...&lt;br /&gt;Lets</li>
            <li>I am very sensitives to fragrances, eyes watering, nose burning, etc, but this one does not bother me at all nor does it give me a headache.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product!!!</li>
            <li>This is a review of the scent, not a seller or anything else; I originally purchased my bottle from a local discount store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is a rich, fresh burst of roses and other florals.  </li>
            <li>Her old bottle of this from 2009 smells 10 times stronger, you can tell it&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li>and I live in Texas.</li>
            <li>First try it got &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; second try it was damaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, because it&#x27;s a little strong.  </li>
            <li>Sent is everything to my wife because she is blind, this has to be watered down if not just a faked sent (a knockoff) and very cheap one at that!!!</li>
            <li>I love this crave fence but it is either old or watered down because it doesn&#x27;t last beyond two hours of scent, which Is not like the one I buy in the store, that one lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I ordered mid-September and it wasn&#x27;t received until early Dec.  </li>
            <li>And when it does, and the other item arrives, ill gladly take this review down, and write a good one.</li>
            <li>went to use it because she still had some of her old bottle left when this arrived, when she used it today</li>
            <li>If you are looking to seduce a man, this one is not it unless he is a sucker for all things clean.</li>
            <li>and I received it quicker than I expected even though it came from New York</li>

            <li> Plus, a couple of sprays go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Perfect...just what I expected. ..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last too long on skin, but I can still sense a whiff of it on my clothes by the end of the day - so</li>
            <li> I had a few issues getting the product.</li>
            <li> it was nothing more than water with a very faint sent!!!</li>
            <li> hehehehe, and no more words</li>
            <li> We will never buy this again and it wasn&#x27;t cheap, were very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy and uncomfortable as it spills all over my hand whenever I spray it</li>
            <li> The scent that lingers is like you just got out of the shower and used an expensive shampoo to lather your hair.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> If this inconvenient won&#x27;t bother you, you can purchase this perfume.</li>
            <li> But the metallic cap is defective and badly adjusted.</li>
            <li> This is NOT DKNY, or if it is it&#x27;s a very, very bad batch!!!</li>

            <li> This is a review of the scent, not a seller or anything else; I originally purchased my bottle from a local discount store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;DKNY Be Delicious: Fresh Blossom is like a walk through a field of flowers on a sunny spring day. It&#x27;s floral without being overwhelming or &amp;#34;old-lady-like&amp;#34; in any way. The rose is prominent here (without being powdery), and the white florals are quite light, youthful and just pretty, while the red apple and the grapefruit notes make it fresh when first sprayed. The scent that lingers is like you just got out of the shower and used an expensive shampoo to lather your hair. This perfume is very pleasant, simple (in a good way), and any age could pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength and Longevity:&lt;br /&gt;Once I spray it I can smell it on myself for 1-2 hours. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last too long on skin, but I can still sense a whiff of it on my clothes by the end of the day - so I would recommend spraying it on your shirt if you want the scent to last longer. Even then it stays pretty close to the skin after about an hour, so if you want something with strong sillage this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, If you love fresh, fruity floral perfumes (along the lines of Marc Jacobs Daisy and its flankers), this is a must try. It&#x27;s a great everyday and office appropriate fragrance that no one would be offended by. And if it helps, my family and significant other all have commented on how pretty I smell when I have this on - and who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
            <li> This was a present for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Great smell and price. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Dkny Be Delicious Fresh Blossom IS exactly what it&#x27;s named.  The scent is a rich, fresh burst of roses and other florals.  It&#x27;s beautiful.  The bottle is pretty, too.  Plus, a couple of sprays go a long way.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, because it&#x27;s a little strong.  But, the overall scent is gorgeous and belongs in my collection.</li>
            <li> I somehow ordered this twice yesterday, and they were really quick to Take out my money but I cancelled one and the 50.00$ are still not back on my account! Very irritated to say the least...&lt;br /&gt;Lets just hope it finds its way back on my account. And when it does, and the other item arrives, ill gladly take this review down, and write a good one.</li>
            <li> I love This parfum is awsome for all occasion. Superior recommended</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get when I wear this perfume!  I adore it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the original (green) and this stuff is great but not as good as the original. This scent is light and pretty. It reminds me of the spring time right when the peak of flowers bloom. It is a very pretty and girly scent without being too young or powerful. My husband likes it at well and always says &amp;#34;wow you smell so good&amp;#34; which is always nice to hear. I will be purchasing another one in the future!!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price and delivery time</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter. It&#x27;s her favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this crave fence but it is either old or watered down because it doesn&#x27;t last beyond two hours of scent, which Is not like the one I buy in the store, that one lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I am fond of perfumes!!I think this one is so lovely and it stays on you. It is nice also for younger girls.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite scent and glad it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years and always get compliments on it.  The scent is light and refreshing, great to wear every day.  Since I buy it so often I am always looking for a good price and so far, Amazon has the best deal.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s fresh and clean smelling- not heavy!</li>
            <li> love the light floral citrus smell - lasts a good couple</li>
            <li> Perfect...just what I expected. ..</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Became my new favorite. Best scent from DKNY!  If you like floral scents, this is the perfume to buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered mid-September and it wasn&#x27;t received until early Dec.  I called several times and the agent kept telling me it wasn&#x27;t currently in stock but they would check it out.  Finally, in November,  I got someone who said I had to cancel that order and place another one.  Once I did that the gift was received.  Very frustrating.  No one I talked to seemed to know what was going on.</li>
            <li> is very good perfume is recommended for those who like persoas soft scents and flavors with tender very good ok</li>
            <li> This smells good at first then right away smells like pure alcohol. Do not recommend</li>
            <li> This perfume is great, I love the smell, not to strong, light. Best price I found was on Amazon. I would recommend</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent! Arrived on time and it smelled delicious!</li>
            <li> Great Deal and received on time</li>
            <li> Very delicious!!! Loved it</li>
            <li> Smells great! Light and fresh but not too overpowering...closely smells like Delicious Green Apple so if you like that scent you will like this scent. This scent is also really good in the spring and summer time.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in great condition, sealed in the plastic cellophane and smelled exactly as it should. This perfume is more of a fresh spring/summer scent. Between being floral and smelling like a good fabric softener sheet. Clean without smelling completely like laundry. It is not as cloyingly sweet as Be Delicious, the green one, and is lighter. I am very sensitives to fragrances, eyes watering, nose burning, etc, but this one does not bother me at all nor does it give me a headache. It is not the type of perfume that will walk into the room before you do. I do not think anyone will take notice unless they are close enough for an embrace. It is not going to turn heads as you walk by. I love to dust baby powder on top to lighten the scent even further. If you are looking for clean and fresh, this one is perfect. If you are looking to seduce a man, this one is not it unless he is a sucker for all things clean.</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite perfume at the moment!  I always get compliments and I can still smell the fragrance on me at the end of the day (which is very rare).  Nice fragrant but light, floral scent.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this perfume!</li>
            <li> Love the scent great price</li>
            <li> So fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li> Great price. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Classic and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife for her birthday and she just now at the end of August went to use it because she still had some of her old bottle left when this arrived, when she used it today it was nothing more than water with a very faint sent!!! Sent is everything to my wife because she is blind, this has to be watered down if not just a faked sent (a knockoff) and very cheap one at that!!! Her old bottle of this from 2009 smells 10 times stronger, you can tell it&#x27;s the real thing! This is NOT DKNY, or if it is it&#x27;s a very, very bad batch!!! My wife asked me to smell it and I can&#x27;t smell anything at all!!! Do not waste your money on this product!!! We will never buy this again and it wasn&#x27;t cheap, were very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, great looking package. She loved it. Highly recommended for that special woman in your life. two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT ARRIVED SATISFACTORILY IN VERY GOOD CONDITION, WILL RECOMMEND YOU BUY THE PRODUCT. BE THE RECOMIENMDO. CONGRATULATIONS TO CONTINUE WITH ITS EXCELLENT JOB.</li>
            <li> Lovely fresh, muted floral scent... very nice counterbalance to the Be Delicious (Green) version...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance : ) 100% Satisfied</li>
            <li> Every time I use the atomizer, the perfume leaks on the side of the bottle were the metallic cap joins the glass container. It&#x27;s very messy and uncomfortable as it spills all over my hand whenever I spray it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, the package and the bottle itself seem to be original. But the metallic cap is defective and badly adjusted. If this inconvenient won&#x27;t bother you, you can purchase this perfume. Otherwise, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> just what I was waiting for. Smells delicious, perfectly size,my husband like my fragance hehehehe, and no more words, thank you</li>
            <li> The perfume is an original and smells great and is at a great price .my daughter loves how it smells.</li>
            <li> If you like a clean floral scent this is what this fragrance brings! Love it, it&#x27;s my second time purchasing ;)</li>
            <li> very good perfume, my girlfriend was delighted, excellent fragrance, handsome with nothing more to be desired, very pleased with the product and with attention</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I found a great price and I received it quicker than I expected even though it came from New York and I live in Texas. thanks!  Angie B</li>
            <li> Still my favorite perfume...reminds me of a crisp spring day:-)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a birthday gift a week before, a week after, the product haven&#x27;t been shipped. I decided cancelled and order it with another vendor.</li>

            <li> for the price, the bottle is good size. it smells amazing. packaging was great and it smells amazing. my friend loves it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. I had a few issues getting the product. First try it got &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; second try it was damaged. Third one was perfect. Amazon was great when I contacted them and made every easy for me to file a claim. They did everything in their power to make sure I was happy. Including replacing the item at no cost next day shipping plus I kept the damaged bottle.</li>
