            <li>Love this soap...</li>
            <li>I reuse this botte to make more foaming hand soap with a bulk size liquid soap from sams club.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>pleased with the service and the product.  </li>
            <li>Second, it has the most delightful fragrance of berries galore!</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>Please do give it a try if you love the scent of assorted berries in good-quality potpourri.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent, and works as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Love this hand soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect lotion to pull the berry-scents together, so that fragrance lightly remains on your hands for awhile, yet also leaves your hands feeling VERY soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>The price is pretty good for a foaming handwash</li>
            <li>Feel confident that hands are clean:)</li>
            <li>This soap cleans well yet dissolves easily.</li>
            <li>With three bathrooms the kitchen and the backyard sink I can keep my family healthier by making fun and accessible to soap and water! :)</li>
            <li>arrived is 0.20% Benzalkonium chloride which may be fine</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and leaves your hands clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Product definitely smells great, I could tell because it was all over the inside of my box when I opened my package.</li>
            <li>I recommend this, enjoy using this and the aroma, will buy again, and hope this helps.</li>
            <li>really enjoy this hand soap.</li>
            <li>It lasts quite awhile (even though I am constantly washing my hands) and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I have used the dial foaming hand soaps for years, and this is my favorite fragrance -  clean and fresh, not at all &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li>We originally bought it when we moved into our house and put it in the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this product any more at my local Target store, so it&#x27;s really nice to find it available here.</li>
            <li>It foams into a rich lather, not drying for the hands.</li>
            <li>2-months ago as part of a 4-Pack from Sam&#x27;s Club (along with Clean Citrus, Spring Water, &amp; Fresh Pear).  </li>
            <li>These got here quick.  </li>
            <li>quick push and</li>
            <li>Works very well and is easy to set-up and use.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, as does my three year old son.</li>
            <li>Love the foaming action.  </li>
            <li>this gets less pumps than my first successful date</li>
            <li>The children love that it makes a redish foam and the scent left on their hands afterwards.</li>
            <li>-- the smell is so pretty..</li>
            <li>I switched to the white tea scent, and that is now my favorite, but I haven&#x27;t searched for it here on Amazon yet.</li>
            <li>I find it very refreshing &amp; actually has an aromatherapy-effect on me that literally helps me completely relax &amp; feel all warm-n-cozy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delicate, yet effective and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>This particular fragrance being my absolute favorite out of the four (with Fresh Pear running a VERY close second)</li>
            <li>Smelled better than I thought but does not ast as long as the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I find the cost is minimal and am inpressed that the kids love to wash their hands now.</li>
            <li>I guess we really can put a man on the moon and send liquid soap through the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>You can use it up fast because its foam soap.</li>
            <li>It served its purpose and was very drying.  </li>
            <li>But this is something great to know if you are visiting, travelling, in a hospital, any situation where shopping is inconvenient and you  want or need something special, you can have it.</li>
            <li>smells nice but too small</li>
            <li>The small profile also allows it to sit nicely on the powder room pedestal sink.</li>
            <li>There were no seal so soap leaked everywhere, and it seems to be only 85% full or perhaps used.</li>
            <li>With my kitchen being primarily in dark red (with some white &amp; light-sand beige), this soap beautifully harmonizes with my kitchen decor, pulling all my accessories together (dish-drainer, dishpan, dishcloths, dish towels, colanders, etc).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that you can get every last little bit out.  </li>
            <li>from the first pump to the last squeeze</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend keeping it next to your Dial soap at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>It has a fabulous lather with very little effort.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more expensive than bar soap...but the neat foaming action really cleans well and leaves no mess in the soap tray.</li>
            <li>I have VERY dry skin and need gentle soap....</li>
            <li>I will be ordering my next supply directly from them.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, and does not make a mess.</li>

            <li> I will be ordering my next supply directly from them.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, and does not make a mess.</li>
            <li> This product lasts a very long time, so much that we have actually stock piled a few orders.  </li>
            <li> The cranberry was one of my favorite scents, but I noticed after a while of using it that it left an after-scent of almost a dirty foot smell.</li>
            <li> It totally cleans my hands and never seems to get empty.  </li>
            <li> Not leaving your hands dry.  </li>
            <li> What I notice is the foam seems to fizzle when it is almost empty -- but still does the job</li>
            <li> A few months later I was trying to figure out what the name of the soap was.</li>
            <li> I really do not like this soap.</li>
            <li> A bar soap is not for me,&lt;br /&gt;It becomes wet then mushy,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I advise to shop carefully, and review your &amp;#34;shop and save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> am finding that judging the price of these items as an idea to their size is not smart.  </li>
            <li> I was totally shocked that this was not filled all the way, only 2/3&#x27;s filled.</li>
            <li> Feels extremely watery.</li>
            <li> One half pump is all you need to wash.</li>
            <li> A little too odoriferous....</li>
            <li> was already half over!</li>
            <li> I do wish the packaging was a bit nicer, I use it in the kitchen as I think it would be too big and awkward for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Thick soaps take effort to lather and effort to rinse well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m all done, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s not the worst part, after only a couple of uses the bottle</li>
            <li> We like the product, but it is a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been disappointed both times.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible... like chemicals</li>

            <li> smells nice but too small</li>
            <li> Works very well, and does not make a mess.</li>
            <li> Not what the picture shows. The picture shows 0.46% Triclosan - which is why I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;What arrived is 0.20% Benzalkonium chloride which may be fine but it&#x27;s NOT what is shown.&lt;br /&gt;(It may have been recently reformulated - I couldn&#x27;t find the 0.46% Triclosan in a drug store either)</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this Antibacterial soap. The children love that it makes a redish foam and the scent left on their hands afterwards. I find the cost is minimal and am inpressed that the kids love to wash their hands now. Actually, so do I. I order one for each sink in our home each month and that keeps me in good supply. With three bathrooms the kitchen and the backyard sink I can keep my family healthier by making fun and accessible to soap and water! :)O</li>
            <li> Love the product could be cheaper on the price</li>
            <li> Smells great happy customer</li>
            <li> My kids really enjoy this and the smell is very good.</li>
            <li> what can i say... gets the job done.</li>
            <li> great and cheap and I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere +++</li>
            <li> Good soap. Good price</li>
            <li> great scent and good foaming!  I wish these would go back on Subscribe and Save!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> incredible wrapping and packaging for this type of item.  I guess we really can put a man on the moon and send liquid soap through the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finding that judging the price of these items as an idea to their size is not smart.  The items are considerably smaller than what the price suggests to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not order merchandise like this to replace &#x27;shopping&#x27; although Amazon has replaced 85% of it.  But this is something great to know if you are visiting, travelling, in a hospital, any situation where shopping is inconvenient and you  want or need something special, you can have it.</li>
            <li> Smelled better than I thought but does not ast as long as the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this Dial foaming hand soap. It smells great (not overpowering) and works well. I would but it again.</li>
            <li> foaming soap ... feels like it works</li>
            <li> I love this soap, as does my three year old son. It&#x27;s delicate, yet effective and smells fabulous. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Not leaving your hands dry.  What I notice is the foam seems to fizzle when it is almost empty -- but still does the job --&lt;br /&gt;again -- the smell is so pretty.. I ordered more of this</li>
            <li> Love this soap... Feel confident that hands are clean:)</li>
            <li> Smells terrible... like chemicals</li>
            <li> I consider this soap a bit of a personal luxury...haha. It is definitely more expensive than bar soap...but the neat foaming action really cleans well and leaves no mess in the soap tray. It is actually a bit cheaper than the foaming soap at our local bath shop. I just like it.</li>
            <li> These got here quick.  They were sold for an awesome price and they smell great.  No complaints from me. Will be ordering again when we run out.</li>
            <li> Love the foaming action.  Great adding to meet subscribe and save goal!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this soap.  She loves that it foams and smells nice.  It makes hand washing easier.  It&#x27;s also nice that you can get every last little bit out.  The small profile also allows it to sit nicely on the powder room pedestal sink.</li>
            <li> I was totally shocked that this was not filled all the way, only 2/3&#x27;s filled. Last time I do this product!</li>
            <li> Product definitely smells great, I could tell because it was all over the inside of my box when I opened my package. There were no seal so soap leaked everywhere, and it seems to be only 85% full or perhaps used.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is easy to set-up and use. I recommend this, enjoy using this and the aroma, will buy again, and hope this helps.</li>
            <li> from the first pump to the last squeeze this foaming hand wash does the job.  It totally cleans my hands and never seems to get empty.  This product lasts a very long time, so much that we have actually stock piled a few orders.  Either that or someone in my household isn&#x27;t washing their hands enough!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, though with coupons it can likely be purchased cheaper in a brick and mortar store</li>
            <li> really enjoy this hand soap. nice smell and meets expectations.</li>
            <li> I adore this soap. We originally bought it when we moved into our house and put it in the guest bathroom. A few months later I was trying to figure out what the name of the soap was. It has a very nice fragrance but doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice snaking foaming hand soap. It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  I reuse this botte to make more foaming hand soap with a bulk size liquid soap from sams club.  The foaming dispensers lose their effectiveness over time so that is why I bought this.</li>
            <li> I have this on auto ship...I wish they also had the Coconut Water in auto ship as well.  This is great for kids because it comes out already foamed up.</li>
            <li> Smells good,kids love the foam so more hand washing,love it!</li>
            <li> Great Price and free shipping!</li>
            <li> Listing states antioxidant and actual label states antibacterial which I avoid like the plague.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smells so refreshing.</li>
            <li> A little too odoriferous.... but great value!</li>
            <li> smells great but goes fast.</li>
            <li> I really do not like this soap. This is the second time I&#x27;m trying a Dial product (last was regular liquid soap) and I&#x27;ve been disappointed both times. This soap May foam when you pump it out of the bottle but scrub your hands all you want and it&#x27;s not going to foam. Feels extremely watery. And that&#x27;s not the worst part, after only a couple of uses the bottle was already half over! Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> awesome product, fast delivery, and great scent. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Buy 1 a month from Subscibe and Save to replace bathrooms and such.  Smells and works well.</li>
            <li> This soap cleans well yet dissolves easily. It has a fabulous lather with very little effort. Thick soaps take effort to lather and effort to rinse well. I use at every sink in my home.</li>
            <li> Great product for the Money!</li>
            <li> This hand wash has a great scent (especially if you like berries) and does the job superbly.  Add the Dial brand to the mix and you have an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good.</li>
            <li> A bar soap is not for me,&lt;br /&gt;It becomes wet then mushy,&lt;br /&gt;I need a bottle to dispense it out,&lt;br /&gt;Standing tall, like a nice stout,&lt;br /&gt;I quick push and my hands are clean,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all done, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Great items, great price, great shipping from a great dealer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this gets less pumps than my first successful date</li>
            <li> Very good product. Pleasant smell and leaves your hands clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our customer bathrooms!</li>
            <li> I like the foaming hand soaps by Dial, especially those with antibacterial properties. The cranberry was one of my favorite scents, but I noticed after a while of using it that it left an after-scent of almost a dirty foot smell. I switched to the white tea scent, and that is now my favorite, but I haven&#x27;t searched for it here on Amazon yet. I advise to shop carefully, and review your &amp;#34;shop and save&amp;#34; updates when you get them by e-mail because sometimes the seller increases the price without you realizing it.</li>
            <li> What a good deal.This is a great soap. You can use it up fast because its foam soap.</li>
            <li> Smells great, however, it dries out my hand some.</li>
            <li> We like the product, but it is a bit expensive.  I prefer the foaming soap to the liquid, as this delivers a perfect quantity of soap.  Good smell too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It lasts quite awhile (even though I am constantly washing my hands) and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I have used the dial foaming hand soaps for years, and this is my favorite fragrance -  clean and fresh, not at all &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or flowery.  I can&#x27;t find this product any more at my local Target store, so it&#x27;s really nice to find it available here.</li>
            <li> pleased with the service and the product.  I have VERY dry skin and need gentle soap....Thanx</li>
            <li> Well its soap.  It served its purpose and was very drying.  Smells great though</li>
            <li> I purchased this Power Berries Anti-Oxidant Dial Foaming Soap 2-months ago as part of a 4-Pack from Sam&#x27;s Club (along with Clean Citrus, Spring Water, &amp; Fresh Pear).  However, they didn&#x27;t sell it separately.  This particular fragrance being my absolute favorite out of the four (with Fresh Pear running a VERY close second) I felt that I must give it a great write-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this soap has the most beautiful shade of cranberry-red that I&#x27;ve ever seen in a minute!  With my kitchen being primarily in dark red (with some white &amp; light-sand beige), this soap beautifully harmonizes with my kitchen decor, pulling all my accessories together (dish-drainer, dishpan, dishcloths, dish towels, colanders, etc).  It literally draws your eyes to it as though it was a huge ruby!  Second, it has the most delightful fragrance of berries galore! &#x3D;)  As I rub it in, I hold my hands up to my nose and inhale deeply.  I find it very refreshing &amp; actually has an aromatherapy-effect on me that literally helps me completely relax &amp; feel all warm-n-cozy inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a follow-up after rinsing &amp; drying your hands, another product that goes marvelously well with Dial&#x27;s Power Berries Foaming Soap, is EOS (Evolution Of Smooth) Berry Blossom Hand Lotion.  It&#x27;s the perfect lotion to pull the berry-scents together, so that fragrance lightly remains on your hands for awhile, yet also leaves your hands feeling VERY soft &amp; smooth.  It boasts a fast-absorbing formula that provides 24-hour moisture to your hands and I highly recommend keeping it next to your Dial soap at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Amazon does sell this soap separately (yay!) I will be ordering my next supply directly from them.  Please do give it a try if you love the scent of assorted berries in good-quality potpourri.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be glad you did.  &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This one smells good! It foams into a rich lather, not drying for the hands. One half pump is all you need to wash. The berry smell is good without being overpoweringly sweet. I do wish the packaging was a bit nicer, I use it in the kitchen as I think it would be too big and awkward for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> its soap with nice smell</li>
            <li> The price is pretty good for a foaming handwash</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, and works as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Love this hand soap. Convenient and sanitary. It also smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this product, smells great!</li>
