            <li>However, this stuff is an amazing moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Definitively, this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>, I guess it takes longer for the results to show, but it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING as an after shave too!</li>
            <li>and this is amazing on my eyes!</li>
            <li>The moisture that this cream provides is amazing!</li>
            <li>Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Love it the best!</li>
            <li>This cream smells really good and works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff honestly took 5 years off of my face in a matter of weeks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been the kind of person who cares about what type of ingredients that  are in the products I use!  </li>
            <li>Great price too, which is a good thing : to me cosmetics</li>
            <li>and I can gladly say it was a very great investment!</li>
            <li>and I can see a remarkable difference already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product!</li>
            <li>am loving it!</li>
            <li>I also love the way you aren&#x27;t able to scentse it when you put it on!!!!</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s not just good for under the eyes, its a great face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>#34;We want your honest opinion!</li>
            <li>I kept giving it more time in hopes that I would see the wonderful results that everyone else had, but no luck.</li>
            <li>I liked it!</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is more greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin, so at night is perfect!</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t like it, I won&#x27;t use it - and no matter how effective something is, it doesn&#x27;t work unless you use it!  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews before purchasing most all were excellent regarding this product.  </li>
            <li>After reading so many good reviews about it, I decided to give it a try!!!!</li>

            <li>and I absolutely love the sweet vanilla scent it has, it smells delicious.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they clarify this - if the product is made of organic ingredients, you should specify, and if it is not, remove this from the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells really lovely!</li>
            <li>cream has a very nice texture and applies easily, it also doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes at all</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not at all exaggerating when I say that THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>It seems that if you give this item a great rating, they will send another jar free.</li>
            <li>I have to say - the results are amazing.</li>

            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing .....</li>
            <li>They get you to GIVE THEM A GREAT  REVIEW by BRIBING you with a FREE BOTTLE of this CANDLE WAX type of I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that once you put it on, you won&#x27;t feel it</li>
            <li>the vanilla smells nice</li>
            <li>It was kind of sticky and felt like something that you might use on a scab to help it heal, but definately not something I would want on my face...</li>
            <li>Feels nice though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a good day time eye cream, but love this for evening.</li>
            <li>Nice product for the eyes.</li>
            <li>I use it on my lips and hands also and it is nice for that.</li>
            <li>Honestly though, this is just made of a bunch of stuff from the kitchen.</li>
            <li>Packaging was effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it didn&#x27;t perform as advertised for me, but the product smells and feels nice, and has an unobjectionable ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me and my concealer still goes nicely over it.</li>
            <li>I really liked the fact of Queen Bee being 100% All-Natural</li>
            <li>It feels nice and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>I read so many good things about this product that I decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 months  2 times a day and honestly hasn&#x27;t done anything.</li>
            <li>so I could share my honest experience.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I bought it for the quality of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is a salve instead of a cream, but your warm finger melts it before application.</li>
            <li>This is a nice mix of beeswax,olive oil, Shea butter, and coconut oil.</li>
            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed nice improvements in my skins texture and color around my eye area.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It is a nice moisturizer ...</li>
            <li>Smells really good too :-).</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and it probably helps with under eye wrinkles, so I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>Honestly I have been using the product for two weeks now</li>
            <li>Nice moisture...</li>
            <li>It smells nice  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of Vaseline like too</li>
            <li>Anyways, its effective and</li>
            <li>I use it at night instead of during the day, though, since it is kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li>I like this product - it has a nice smell, all organic, and it has vitamin K.</li>
            <li>Texture is almost like chapstick that softens or melts when it comes in contact with warm skin.  </li>
            <li>but it melts readily on warm skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, I would reorder this product again</li>
            <li>I read all the wonderful reviews, so I am very hopeful and optimistic.</li>
            <li>In the morning the results are astounding-</li>
            <li>The cream is a nice moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>but it melts when it is on your warm skin.</li>
            <li>The reason this has so many good reviews?</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the best part is that it really HAS diminished the circles.</li>
            <li>And especially love the fact that when it says &amp;#34; all natural&amp;#34; - it really is</li>
            <li>This product feels nice on the skin and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, my skin looks better and more in tone and firmness.</li>
            <li>I find it too greasy feeling to use during the day under makeup, but I&#x27;m loving it as a night cream.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I see it working.</li>
            <li>If you want to spend money on a petroleum jelly kind of cream which you can get for a dollar else where then buy it..</li>
            <li>I have to be honest.  </li>
            <li>this is some good stuff, I am quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Age was catching on me</li>
            <li>I have see so many good comments about this product and that what make me wanted to buy the product.</li>
            <li>Dear company appreciated for the great product that you sell!</li>
            <li>In their defense they state &#x27;honest&#x27; feedback...</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the product is a nice moisturizer but that is it.  </li>
            <li>love this product.......love the fact that i can feel good about putting this on my face  ....</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>but to me is ok, good in the winter time.</li>
            <li>I think you must have to put in a warm oven before each use?  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much to the Queen Bee team ,and for this great creation!</li>
            <li>It feels so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love love love this product!!</li>

            <li>Product is as advertised, nice size, smells good and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They basically build up a list of good reviews with the promise of free jars, then get more orders because people see the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye products and this one I have been very pleased with results.  </li>
            <li>Then I saw that so many people were questioning the reviews based on customers receiving a free jar for giving a great review.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love how it&#x27;s a good size</li>
            <li>When applied to your skin, it warms up and spreads very easily.</li>

            <li>Because Queen Bee eye cream is like wax, it does a very good job of keeping the moisture in for a much longer time.  </li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and applies very easily, I even use it as a lip balm!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best natural eye creams I have used.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t understand what was happening until I did my own research and found many people complaining about irritated lips and skin after using products containing beeswax.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fade creams this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>What can I say it&#x27;s amazing this product change my under eye earia 80% better</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like magic to under eyes and also the face its like its own vegetable bath for your face</li>
            <li>So far I am very impressed!  </li>
            <li>I think people write a good review just to get the Free cream.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this product and I am very happy that its all natural.</li>
            <li>The cream smells amazing and feels fantastic on the skin!</li>
            <li>I look myself in the mirror with a bright light like a thousand times</li>
            <li>but honestly they look much better than when I wasn&#x27;t using this product</li>
            <li>Thank You All Natural for a great product!</li>
            <li>This product was perfect because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>the best part is it is all natural, no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Queen Bee product because it&#x27;s all natural and has excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>So I am always in the market for something that helps and so far this has been the best!</li>
            <li>It gives a nice cooling sensation that I really enjoy!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing i love it.....</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li>There also appears to have been a scam involved in the reviews, with the company offering an additional free jar of the product to reviewers who gave good ratings.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it contains all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>my first time to use it, good smell and good quality...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about dark circles - I had already taken care of that with 5000 units per day of vitamin D - but it is an awesome moisturizer that keeps my eye area looking great all day.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product - it goes on smooth and the scent is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Great product, start working right away for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>This product smells very good, much like vanilla and almond which I love.  </li>
            <li>Awesome alternative to expensive beauty products and gives great results of healthy skin, no wrinkles, and a bright complexion!</li>
            <li>have to say that I have never been so impressed with a product as I am with this one, it is natural, which I love.</li>
            <li>natural ingredients can&#x27;t ask for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a Great product Queen Bee !!!!</li>
            <li>I can finally enjoy myself again and all thanks to my husband and this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I love this cream and it&#x27;s excellent for sensitive eyes like mine.</li>
            <li>I am still using my first jar,and I am very pleased with it!.</li>
            <li>This product is good to keep moist under your eyes; specially during winter...</li>
            <li>Well, need to go now, but I hope people are aware of the fact the someone suffered a great deal of allergy from using this product.</li>
            <li>I have no traces of fine lines anymore!</li>
            <li>Work fine in the skin, love it!</li>
            <li>The cream applied very lightly and is not too overbearing on my skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, nor greasy and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It does sort of feel like having a very light petroleum jelly on the face</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but this eye cream feels very good under the eye.</li>
            <li>Bee&#x27;s is an amazing moisturizer and helped to lighten the darkness very quickly.</li>
            <li>It’s got a nice texture and has been easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>It is greasy and goes on easily and soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li>I love the smell; it has a very light touch of vanilla.</li>
            <li>Also, the product is made of natural products, which is very good.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;This is a very good product and reminded me of our old heritage of using bee wax during winters in Northern India.</li>
            <li>, then i tried the very efficient Palmer&#x27;s Line Smoothing Creme (very good and cheap hydrator).</li>
            <li>and I notice a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I bought it like two weeks ago, HUGE change!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for eyes and facial skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing Queen Bee 100% All-Natural cream and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>, it feels oily when you use it, but when it is absorbed, it feels good.</li>
            <li>I was weighing up whether to purchase this product or an alternative, but I&#x27;m really pleased that I chose this one.</li>
            <li>They were thicker and more noticeable, but after using this cream for about 2 months I am noticing that my wrinkles have thinned and aren’t as noticeable.</li>
            <li>One thing I love about this organic under eye cream is that it does not irritate my eyes or skin.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is more of a waxy substance, I was expecting a sort of cream.  </li>
            <li>It turns out that I am one of many individuals allergic to beeswax.  </li>
            <li>getting better everyday.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>I love this skin balm...</li>
            <li>I have bought it twice now and will be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Seeing some improvement and will post more as time progresses ahead.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by its cheap appearance!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be used for more than just under the eyes.</li>
            <li>and it makes them feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>and i love that I know exectly what</li>
            <li>so I use it mostly at night.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work</li>
            <li>Queen Bee will make you feel like a queen for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it just gets better with continued use.</li>
            <li>For me it attracted pet hair and lint on my face more when I sleep with it on.</li>
            <li>In some ways, this was ok.</li>
            <li>it is not a cream, more like wax or Vaseline.</li>
            <li>and I tried many face creams to get rid of from them</li>
            <li>Works great.i l love it</li>
            <li>When i saw the dryness increasing around my eyes, i tried using a bit more, but the skin wouldn&#x27;t absorb at all.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work they did say u could get 2 free jars with ur honest opinion, so there you have it ..,</li>
            <li>and im starting to see the difference, great product!</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love it, will probably buy again to ensure that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Tonight I plan to apply to most of my face.</li>
            <li>Although I think to get a better result I need to use it more.</li>
            <li>Every eye product I&#x27;ve used always seemed to be a burden to use and not something I enjoyed putting on my face.</li>
            <li>I truly love this product and its so enjoyable to use unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>It has worked in replacement of many creams and moisturizers I used to use.  </li>
            <li>can tell that my eyes soak in the cream through the night, a time when my skin probably dehydrates most.  </li>
            <li>Ok so i have to admitt after a week of using it</li>
            <li>Hopefully as time goes by, I&#x27;ll see more of a change.</li>
            <li>For price and profile ratings you can not do better</li>
            <li>I applied morning and night and found the texture to be more than bearable.  </li>
            <li>I would have a more hydrated softer areas...</li>
            <li>Thanks for this great product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>i think you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your invitation to receive a free jar of this product just for sharing my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I wake up looking more refreshed and awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its more like a balm</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it some more.</li>
            <li>scrape a nice chunk with the fingernail of my ring finger and then rub it between my ring fingers and lightly dab it on.</li>
            <li>so pleased I bought this item, the best thing I have ever bought have been using this now for only just over 1 week</li>
            <li>recommend this to all my friends &amp; will be buying more products in this range</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has many benefits.</li>
            <li>but i was hoping for better results after reading the ratings.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m often allergic to many kinds of eye cream including Lancome.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream, it is more like a salve, which I love.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this cream.  </li>
            <li>and the effect is getting better and better.</li>
            <li>And I Would love to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and love that I do not wake up with dry-feeling skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because the ingredients used are a lot safer than those in many products on the market today.</li>
            <li>This is a truly wonderful product that actually retains moisture through the night.</li>
            <li>As I stated above, it works perfectly, and I will order it again and again.  </li>
            <li>I actually love the buttery consistency of it.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel lovely.</li>
            <li>I use it every day more than one a day</li>
            <li>My eyes feels a lot better.  </li>
            <li>My eyes feel and look 100% better than before.  </li>
            <li>My eye area looks so healthy,  </li>
            <li>And, as a bonus, you receive a free jar if you give it a review!</li>
            <li>The product is safe to use.  </li>
            <li>He got so many reviews by cheating his customers.</li>
            <li>My eyes have never looked better....</li>
            <li>and I have to say that coupled with more sleep and more water</li>
            <li>I also love how this stuff is organic and all-natural.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my wrinkles and where I want to make sure I won&#x27;t have wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>wrinkles are and boy this one worked for me love it</li>
            <li>There are better moisturizer products.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this eye product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve applied many things</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Queen Bee</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I put it on at bedtime and when I wake up the skin under my eyes looks more refreshed.</li>
            <li>also I love the name .</li>
            <li>I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li>In fact, it made my eyes look more wrinkly.</li>
            <li>I bought this to see if it would work better</li>
            <li>it helps moisturize my face but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li>it turned out to be an ok product.</li>
            <li>My sleep schedule doesn&#x27;t help at all with my eyes looking healthy either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Today, I woke up, and my eyes look better than they have since I was probably 20 or perhaps even in my teens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so pleased that I know look my age or</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li>perhaps it takes a bit more to help.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to shut up about this cream since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s magic, people.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to shut up about this cream since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s magic, people.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks before I saw a change, but it seems to have gotten even better over time.</li>
            <li>However, I know there are many factors that contribute to this problem to many people: amount of sleep, a healthy diet, vitamin suplement, or allegies would affect that area.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll see if it continues to get better.</li>
            <li>would give it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me.  :)</li>
            <li>Will use one more jar.</li>
            <li>It may need more Vitamin K.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so oily that it just sits on top of the occular skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I plan to explore more of your products.</li>
            <li>I really love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>most  esp.</li>
            <li>Ok as my header says.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I finished nursing school, I&#x27;ve tried to pay more attention to everything as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li>you gotta kinda break through the top layer and move it around.</li>
            <li>(I apply about a pee size under each eye and any excess I put on the top of my eye lid and any more excess I apply to my forehead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>gotta kinda break through the top layer and move it around.</li>
            <li>(I apply about a pee size under each eye and any excess I put on the top of my eye lid and any more excess I apply to my forehead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>If you wear contacts be sure to remove before use if you get them in the eye</li>
            <li>Feels more like wax.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this eye cream ever since.</li>
            <li>Also, like most products, it migrated into my eyes and irritated them.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to see more results in time.</li>
            <li>Has also made my skin more pliable and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>when really I was getting great sleep (undereye bags).</li>
            <li>bed - make sure you use it every day.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day with a more generous application at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my eye cream</li>
            <li>You would be better off with Crisco cooking oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting it again :D</li>
            <li>Maybe they shall put more protection for delivery.</li>
            <li>and i simply love it</li>
            <li>Hesitant, I looked through many reviews before buying this product.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping the lines beside my eyes, but I&#x27;m confident that with time those will fade as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>When I did my research for the best product I kept coming back to Queen Bee.  </li>
            <li>Love how this feels.  </li>
            <li>Will buy it again for sure</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>I decided to do some research on Amazon and to my amazement, was able to find Queen Bee Under Eye Cream which was 100% organic.</li>
            <li>but more of a balm).</li>
            <li>If this product works I am defiantly ordering more.</li>
            <li>Nice, light scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Its actually more of an oily wax consistency rather than a face cream or lotion.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works much better for the night,helping the skin to revive  :)</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>It has beeswax and coconut oil in it, which are both lovely</li>
            <li>is dryness because this is mostly Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>wait to see more results</li>
            <li>Most of them were OK, but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li>However, I LOVE Queen Bee.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that had something to do with it.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done khiels, Lancôme, dermologica, cerve, and many more.</li>
            <li>and I plan on finding them instead of purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li>But it was ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>But I swirled my finger on top and it melted at body temperature</li>
            <li>To this day, I receive compliments on how youthful I look and of how baby smooth my face is!</li>
            <li>, I am looking forward to more postive results, thank you.</li>
            <li>Hopefully if you buy it, it will do more for you.</li>
            <li>My skin is so radiant, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>My complexion is so much better</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Queen Bee eye cream.  </li>
            <li>and this feels even better.</li>
            <li>But now my face is getting better even with this job.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things and most do not work</li>
            <li>This has way more beeswax content than it should have for an eye cream...</li>
            <li>you need to balance your skin and not add so many products that we cannot name</li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Natural,  healthy and efficient!&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>And will work at night when your most relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure that this is for your night</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;which gave better results.</li>
            <li>I bought the Queen bee because I saw so many 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>this product smells and feels great, and really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>The smell is appealing as well.  </li>
            <li>My eyes look considerably better.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>Now that I have been using it faithfully again for a longer period, I can tell even more so if I skip a night.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my eyes look and feel in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many chemicals I guess.</li>
            <li>I LOVE QUEEN BEE</li>
            <li>, I made sure not to it get into my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a Vaseline based product.</li>
            <li>I wish I could gave it more than two stars.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will surely look forward to buy another one.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product.</li>
            <li>As such it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It sits on top of the skin and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li>More for an overnight cream.</li>
            <li>Smells delicious and glides on facial skin with no problem.</li>
            <li>This cream was able to help me get rid of them within a month of using.</li>
            <li>The product is more of a beeswax than a cream, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>Will post an update after more time.</li>
            <li>I really love the fragrance, also.</li>
            <li>You have to understand it&#x27;s more of a wax feel instead of cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>The balm was more for soothing but that was all it did.</li>
            <li>I will continue using and promise to get back and let you know how is working, but I am sure it will do great!  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked for some people</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Well pleased at this time.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li>I have sooooooooooo many eye creams.  </li>
            <li>I love Queen Bee.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waxy/ oily but in a smooth way and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li>but i am sure i will see more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and am really pleased with the moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>and I will continue using it until I find something else that I like more :)</li>
            <li>Some people have commented on it feeling greasy, but you just have to make sure to rub it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li>and I know my Mom was making sure</li>
            <li>This is surely a product that I would recommend, but just be patient and you will see results.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>description cannot capture how great this product really is.  </li>
            <li>review and get 2 more jar</li>
            <li>Cute jar though...</li>
            <li>After about 1 week of applying this cream once a day under my eyes, I can confidently say that this product works.</li>
            <li>It is definitely mostly shea butter though, you can spot the smell and  consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many jars already.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>This is  nothing more than a skin soothing balm .</li>
            <li>i love the smell of this prouduct and the pacage i will buy it again and again .</li>
            <li>Got to love that.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I was looking for something to use for under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>i applied and it is fully safe for eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product, and how it keeps your eye area moist all day all night.</li>
            <li>product will not fix it overnight, but if you are patient and you want a more permanent solution (provided you take care of your skin, of course) then I would recommend this</li>
            <li>I will continue to use :)</li>
            <li>I bought this eye cream because I&#x27;m having an allergic reaction to most of my cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I am able to keep my eye area soothed and moisturized without irritation.</li>
            <li>I love the outcome of my product Queen Bee</li>
            <li>I wonder how many of us overpaid the $22 for this eye cream because we saw the *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 1 month into using it, and I feel so much better about my eye</li>
            <li>many have found this product to be what they need, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be beneficial for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cream is more of an ointment than a cream and has made no improvement in my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>I will be buying again!! :)</li>
            <li>This product does even more than promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love love</li>
            <li>and I am really satisfied by the results.</li>
            <li>I will surely recommend people to use this all-natural product to fight aging signs.</li>
            <li>Anyways if you&#x27;re looking for a wrinkle cream look somewhere else :)</li>
            <li>love that eye cream ....</li>
            <li>However, after a month of use...skin does not appear to be better.</li>
            <li>and I love the feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought a $47 jar of eye cream a couple weeks ago, and the more I use it, the dryer my skin gets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better at night.</li>
            <li>I am also enjoying putting it on my lips at night, too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a salve</li>
            <li>I would re come d this product and am sure to use it again.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel and look better.</li>
            <li>so glad i purchased this eye cream</li>
            <li>it does and am glad I choose it.</li>
            <li>I have to say that whether or not one is able to see any results also depends on the lighting.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I put it on before going to sleep, I feel I look better waking up.</li>
            <li>Needs more Vitamin K maybe?</li>
            <li>I love that it is all organic</li>
            <li>and I love ingredients.  </li>
            <li>So I believe a month from now, it&#x27;ll be even better.  </li>
            <li>in the beginning i wasn&#x27;t sure about it ..</li>
            <li>/&gt;i just love it ..</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t wait to buy my second jar &#x3D;D</li>
            <li>I thought that I was seeing an improvement after just 3 days, but I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>Now, I am sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product, better to use at night because of its oily compound.</li>
            <li>Great product that works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have to sometimes use my finger nail to scrape it off to be able to apply.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me on top of that</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>Unlike most creams this has no chemicals</li>
            <li>its one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil by itself did more than this..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for eyelash growth.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it makes my under my eye feels and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>It soaks in fairly quickly, and I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product, it is very moisturizing and it makes it super easy to put concealer on afterwards.</li>
            <li>Very rich.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to find Queen Bee organic eye cream.</li>
            <li>Decent product, but not overly great.</li>
            <li>she says Queen Bee works just as good or better and doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much!</li>
            <li>I like the silky texture of the cream, very easy and smooth to apply, leaving my skin looking dewy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend, and it is a great value.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, save your money and make your own.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for a great and natural product!!</li>
            <li>Love it , working great so far!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s my first time use this product, but I think It&#x27;s a good choice for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so beautiful and natural and smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it under my eyes and liked it and then started over full face.</li>
            <li>I was searching on Amazon for something with good reviews and not terribly expensive, and found this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On a side note, this stuff smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but it smells so good and feels so good that I am using it in way more places than planned.</li>
            <li>Smells good and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I use it all over the rest of my face too and it feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to have found this effective, affordable and all natural eye cream!</li>
            <li>Safe, pure and good.</li>
            <li>However it is a very good moisturizer that does seem to soften facial lines, and make skin appear a bit more youthful.</li>
            <li>I will be looking forward to seeing more benefits of this product and am happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li>I use it before bed and in the morning, it is easy to apply and seems to work okay when used with concealers.</li>
            <li>I use it before bed and in the morning, it is easy to apply and seems to work okay when used with concealers.</li>
            <li>Great and all natural i love it</li>
            <li>So far it smells really good and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the awesome product!</li>
            <li>I really love all natural ingredients and best of all, it really works!</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and the consistency of the cream is pretty light and non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is even better for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and when I wake up, my eyes feel more alert and open and bright!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s wonderful &amp; I will repurchase :)</li>
            <li>This product has been wonderful all my fine lines are nearly invisable and my skin is soft and very healthy.  </li>
            <li>it is a great natural eye cream, i even use it on my lips.</li>
            <li>While I enjoy the healthy glow that this product provides for my skin, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my under eye circles after weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I am using this cream from one week now and can&#x27;t wait to see how better is gonna be, the skin around my eyes is so smooth</li>
            <li>But what it excels at is after showering lightly coat your legs and arms with this balm and you&#x27;ll love how your skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I guess since is a natural product it works great on skin.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great</li>
            <li>All natural, great price.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered two more since the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li>I hope that more people will see this 100% chemical free cream to help with their eyes imperfection.</li>
            <li>So far I am terrifically happy with this product.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients that are great for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s o.k., smells good and goes on pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly I feel it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>worked great so far.</li>
            <li>I figured wow, it must be great.</li>

            <li>I love the smell and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It worked so good on my eyes that I&#x27;ve decided to use it on my whole face.  </li>

            <li>I almost get kind of hungry right before bed, hee.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients with no chemicals is very nice to see.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see how much more progress I can make with this.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth your $$!:)</li>

            <li>and I often use it on other areas of my face and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It applies onto my face easily and has been making an improvement in the wrinkles that I have under my else.</li>

            <li>It also has a couple kinds of oils in it, so if you break out easily</li>
            <li>The cream goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the other great reviews... love it!</li>
            <li>And yes, it does leave some oily residue on my pillow case in the morning, but I found that it washes out easily - with no pre-treating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easily resolved by microwaving for just 15 seconds to melt the oils and stirring.</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Then easily found it.  </li>
            <li>milia don&#x27;t just disappear so easily.</li>
            <li>Great price, packaging, fast delivery, its all natural, paraben free, and an impressive all natural ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and has lightened the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure it would work after seeing so many positive reviews, but after receiving my package, I know why there are so many</li>
            <li>And if people can be allergic to beeswax (not an uncommon allergy apparently) or anything else contained in the product, the sellers should have a warning about this in their product description.  </li>
            <li>The pictures I saw looked exactly like the kind of redness and swelling that&#x27;s on my eyelids and beneath my eyes where the concealer was used.  </li>
            <li>awesome cream, seems to reduce dark spots under my eyes, does not smell......</li>
            <li>Some have mentioned that it&#x27;s more waxy than creamy, and that&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Some have mentioned that it&#x27;s more waxy than creamy, and that&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>I keep getting this product too close to my eyes and end up kind of bloodshot and goopy in the morning, but that&#x27;s user error. ;)</li>
            <li>Yesterday I was skyping with my cousin and she also commented on how my dark circles &amp;#34;arent there anymore&amp;#34; :D .</li>
            <li>I am very happy for everyone that had such good results with Queen Bee, but I have had no result and wish I could have my $22.00 back.</li>
            <li>Bees wax has no other benefit but is a great way to sell a cheap product.  </li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion, and despite getting a full nights&#x27; sleep, I always have the shadows starting from the corner of my eye and fanning downwards.</li>
            <li>I realised the great reviews were due to the promise of a free jar if u drop a nice comment.</li>
            <li>The small jar lasted me more than 3-4 months, so the price is definitely great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now, and it does nothing for my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure any avid DIYer would easily be able to recreate it at home at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Doing makeup every day to hide those fine line and wrinkles was too taxing.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it helps with puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines around eyes are not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>it felt fine.</li>
            <li>My lips were fine.  </li>
            <li>and i can already tell a difference in my fine lines</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a reduction on puffiness, fine lines</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to hydrate my under eye area and to improve the appearance of  fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li>have seen the fine lines under my eyes fade away.</li>
            <li>does work for fine lines and not so fines lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>It has helped to plump up the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>My eyes have started to look brighter, however I don&#x27;t see any changes in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any great reduction in dark circles, but to be honest, that&#x27;s a tall order for any product to fill</li>
            <li>It helps with my fine wrinkles and my skin feels soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fine lines are disappearing. .</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles had started to make their presence felt on my face.</li>
            <li>I want to be truthful with my review and not writing something sweet because i get a free jar.</li>
            <li>I have fine lines around my eyes and have already seen a change in hydration while using this cream.  </li>
            <li>I can already see the hydration and softening of my fine lines under my eyes and forehead..</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even get rid of wrinkles or fine lines..</li>
            <li>I quickly saw the stars and the many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>but it is super magical.</li>
            <li>A plus is that it has natural ingredients and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a month and my bag circles has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I am really liking this cream and would not hesitate to purchase more!</li>
            <li>I really  like this product and will be buying more!</li>
            <li>I need to exclaim how incredibly much Queen Bee Organic Under Eye Cream has done for my face (and my life) in the time I have been utilizing this magical product!</li>
            <li>Most will find it pleasant, but I am not a big fan of vanilla</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the seller was able to get the product to me rather quickly...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth and has also cleared up some fine lines as well.</li>
            <li>This tiny jar contains that and some great ingredients and has a pleasant vanilla odor and a soft, waxy feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I let it cool on its own in my cabinet and good as new, smooth as on the first day.</li>
            <li>Most creams make my foundation build up, or emphasize the fine lines in my skin making me even more self conscious, always having to look in the mirror and smooth out the makeup which..only irritates and dries my skin out even more.</li>
            <li>I had huge wrinkles there to the point that it was so bumpy you could feel it.</li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t huge.</li>
            <li>Already see a huge difference in just a week.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE improvement, but if I subtracted this product, I wouldn&#x27;t miss a beat.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been a huge help with wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the most powerful \\&quot;ant-wrinkle\\&quot; or \\&quot;under</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I started applying it lightly.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li>It tends to be a bit greasy in the beginning but after a while after the skin has absorbed it, it becomes better.</li>
            <li>Keep my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>I slept with it on and in the morning my face feels smooth and my pores arnt clogged.</li>
            <li>Smells like smooth vanilla</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days, and now instead of applying concealer 5X, I&#x27;m happy to say that now I only apply it twice!!!</li>
            <li>I also put some under eye in morning under my concealer and this helped my eye makeup to apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Included in this order was a card from the company that said they will send to me a free jar of Queen Bee if I leave a review--</li>
            <li>The skin feels comfortable and that&#x27;s all I expect a skin product to have.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, this product has no annoying perfume scent.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it is an organic product meaning you don’t get any harsh chemicals harming your skin.</li>
            <li>Although, patience is important.</li>
            <li>they give you a coupon for a free jar if you write a review for them.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so smooth.</li>
            <li>it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more soon because he is almost out, so worth thie price.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s primarily made up of.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon it accidentally and decided to order it on a whim (along with the fact that it had great reviews and was only $25).  </li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s more than worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s more than worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I understand the concerns about the promotion of this product by providing a free jar to people who write reviews.</li>
            <li>My free jar you are sending is going to my mother to try.  </li>
            <li>but it goes on really smooth</li>
            <li>I received this eye cream just a few days after I placed the order and this product is wonderful and</li>
            <li>Feels like oil which helps the skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>I had three people come up to me recently and tell me how great  and youthful the texture of my skin looked.</li>
            <li>This cream is great for the entire face as well as neck!</li>
            <li>I decided the truth was worth more.</li>
            <li>seller promises an additional free jar of eye cream if you give them feedback.</li>
            <li>They responded and said that once I posted a review on Amazon and they confirmed it, they would send a free jar.</li>
            <li>But it goes on surprisingly light, and to my delight works well under my make up.</li>
            <li>and we will send you a free one&amp;#34</li>
            <li>customers are just trying to get a free jar sent to them.</li>
            <li>I like how the texture is really light and smooth, and how gentile it is.</li>
            <li>, it was too waxy to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>hope others have more success.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my batch just isn&#x27;t effective or what, but it did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a great investment for facial product.</li>
            <li>They can keep the free one because I don&#x27;t even bother using this.  </li>
            <li>They tempt you with another jar for free if you write one.</li>
            <li>Time got away from me and before I realized it the opportunity has passed for me, so no, I did not get a free jar for my 5-star review.</li>
            <li>Instead, gently smooth it with your finger.</li>
            <li>I really wan to thank the creators of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Overall great product , a tad oily</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and not oily on face.</li>
            <li>I also got a insert with my Order telling me if I contacted the seller of this product, I would another free of charge, I thought.</li>
            <li>It goes in skin smoothly, does not leave sticky feeling and rejuvenate the skin layer.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>A FREE BOTTLE</li>
            <li>Well, I was really perplexed while reading through the reviews.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s chemical free.</li>
            <li>but i applied this on a very back burn and it healed my finger great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and light weight.  </li>
            <li>No side effects, winkles gone, smooth skin</li>
            <li>It does moisturize and is a great product to alternate with your stronger eye creams.  </li>
            <li>well, I could say Fantastic to my skin</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth to apply on, leaves your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am very much pleased with the results, and knowing that my condition plagues others, I want to let prospective buyers it is worth a TRY.</li>
            <li>Free jar be damned.</li>
            <li>It does feel smooth and moisturizing, &amp; is loaded with oils with a light scent like cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I also received a card with the jar stating that I will receive another jar for free if I share my review.</li>
            <li>but I wonder why they would send a free product to someone who didn&#x27;t like the product.  </li>
            <li>It is just some cheap honey wax ingredients.</li>
            <li>I guess this product has been given 5 stars because some people on here got their cream for free.</li>
            <li>Queen Bee leaves my face and neck feeling smooth and moisturized and diminishing lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>and i use this only at night and have noticed great difference</li>
            <li>, I did NOT get a free product for a review.</li>
            <li>eye cream glides on so smoothly, hydrates well,</li>
            <li>After 1 week of use, and reading all the fabulous 5 star reviews, I felt duped.</li>
            <li>I apply it morning and night and wait about an hour before I put on my makeup, so it soaks in my skin and my makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Thank you for helping me to look as young as I feel in my 20&#x27;s :) :) :)</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and keep eyes hydrated.</li>
            <li>This all natural product is good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t over do the sun, eat sensible, de-stress and enjoy life and love for all they&#x27;re worth.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive fair skin</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 month, and the results are so far so good.</li>
            <li>the seller ask you to give you a good review within a week of purchse and it says that they will send you a second Queen bee as appreciation (I thought heck FREE YAY!)</li>
            <li>Before I bought this product, I try to research any natural products that are good to apply under eyes.</li>
            <li>It is a balmy texture, which I think is good for using before bed during the winter.  </li>
            <li>Super natural, and really effective!  </li>
            <li>I wish I could say I have had the great results most of the other reviews rave about...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product !!!!</li>
            <li>product really works!!!</li>
            <li>The information page that was included with the product was very useful.</li>
            <li>The information page that was included with the product was very useful.</li>
            <li>My dark circles are getting  better, and my eyes are looking and feeling more moisturized which makes me happy because I have tried a lot of products without much success.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is super smooth and glides on around my eyes easily.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I forget to used it, but I have really been happy with the product, even if I don&#x27;t use it for the reason they mainly advertise it for.  </li>
            <li>Receive 1 free jar of the product you ordered just for sharing your experience.&amp;#34; I was excited to order because I don&#x27;t like concealer.</li>
            <li>It is great for wrinkle but don&#x27;t see my dark circles getting better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all its good for.</li>
            <li>I have always struggled to find effective eye creams and would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the pleasant and LIGHT (as in totally not overpowering) is detectable when hugging people</li>
            <li>it just seems average to me, and any home soapmaker and lip balm maker can easily make this product on their own and probably better too!</li>
            <li>Plus i read that the company is rewarding positive reviewers with another free jar.</li>
            <li>It is great for evening use, but in the morning it takes too long for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>Product feels natural and has a very appealing smell.</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure my under eye circles are already fading....</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be introduced to the queen bee cream.  </li>
            <li>I put a layer of moisturizing cream under my eyes first, and then apply the Queen Bee eye cream on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I may be imagining, but I feel a significant difference already.</li>
            <li>I was using All about Eyes Rich cream before this.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a significant improvement on my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>The darkness under my eyes had lightened up significantly.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I hope I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell very comforting!</li>
            <li>My nose is just a blush color now, it doesn&#x27;t itch at all and for the first time in years I truly feel confident again.   </li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t so sure after I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I have not yet noticed a significant change.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know first time user, so can&#x27;t say about that for sure.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>It is so rich and I have watched as the lines I was getting on my neck have VANISHED.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I like using this cream at night as it seems to help rejuvenate my skin &amp; help reduce the appearance of under eye circles quite significantly.</li>
            <li>Originally I had written a rave review about this product.</li>
            <li>It gives me the fresh look in the morning!</li>
            <li>Organic, simple, effective ingredients - nothing more required to carry out a fantastic job hydrating as well as plumping the skin around the eyes</li>
            <li>Simple and effective!  </li>
            <li>I started using Queen Bee before I went to bed, and after a couple nights I saw a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines didn&#x27;t diminish after finishing the entire jar, but I did get some compliments that my skin looked good.</li>
            <li>The overwhelming positive response to this product made me feel safe in purchasing it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I love the simple ingredients and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>There was a point I&#x27;d find myself putting it on multiple times a day (more than I was brushing my own teeth)..</li>
            <li>kind of oily most likely not purchasing again if no improvement by the time I finish product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it was good enough to lie for a free jar.</li>
            <li>I apply under eyes  to clean face at night.  </li>
            <li>It will be great for my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin like mine</li>
            <li>the smell is fantastic and smells good enough to eat....</li>
            <li>Works great if your eyes are really really dry.</li>
            <li>This means there&#x27;s probably a bias toward more positive ratings --</li>
            <li>Why so many positive reviews?</li>
            <li>but I am positive that it will be better when I have used the eye cream for a longer time.</li>
            <li>I find that using the derma-e Vitamin E oil and putting a few drops of organic rosehip oil and lavender essential oil in it gives me the best results, smells amazing, and is extraordinarily affordable!</li>
            <li>: These people are amazingly polite, prompt  &amp; professional!  </li>
            <li>I am excited that I have found an effective product that is natural.  </li>
            <li>will certainly be buying her some more when she runs out</li>
            <li>When I opened it and felt its special smell immediately.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this.</li>
            <li>What I love the best is that my success was due to natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am seeing very good results, I will continue to use it everyday</li>
            <li>first impression was &amp;#34;wow, this smells really good.&amp;#34; And after checking out the ingredients I was thrilled to find that it was all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The great reviews on Amazon and a careful study of the ingredients lost led me to this purchase.</li>
            <li>It is so nice not to read a label full of chemicals and with Queen Bee its organic and 100% all natural.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of moisturizing and I just blot away any excess cream that does not absorb into the skin to prevent the shiny wet look.  </li>
            <li>this is great it worked instantly for me, from the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any amazing color or wrinkle reduction, but it works well as moisturizer for sensitive skin/eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Queen Bee:)</li>
            <li>So, nice to have a product like this in the market and that too that&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
            <li>It contains natural ingredients, smells nice, and is very...moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>just started to try it out, so i cannot give a full review.</li>
            <li>At least they be happy wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I ordered Queen Bee because I liked the fact that it is 100% natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Queen Bee all natural organic under eye cream for about a month and have found it it be effective at reducing the apearance of circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and effective.</li>
            <li>smells nice and makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to many things and have not had an rashes or breakouts from this product.</li>
            <li>Not only is it good for under your eyes, you can use all over your face.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a cream, more of a pasty oil?</li>
            <li>well, especially if you have a good skin care routine.</li>
            <li>well, especially if you have a good skin care routine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural product and it&#x27;s smells nice.</li>
            <li>Fairly inexpensive too if compared to similar items on the market.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost still full.</li>
            <li>i love it my undereyes has really change</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li>I can definitely already start see good results.  </li>
            <li>its really good moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;forehead, under eye,&lt;br /&gt;I feel different after 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>I loved that Queen Bee isn’t only utilized for eyes but also for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The fact that it had so much uses really made me grow to love the product more.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but didn&#x27;t seem to actually do anything.</li>
            <li>After a full month of applying it twice a day, no improvement whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Actually, it was too good to be true though.   </li>
            <li>Give it a try :) its also ALL NATURAL!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle undereye balm that gave me results very quickly.</li>
            <li>But we all like free stuff right?  </li>
            <li>I love to use the cream to top off my full vitamin skin treatment: vitamin a and d oil as a base, sheabutter for vitamin e and the awesome Queen Bee Organic Cream for its extremely potent vitamin K.</li>
            <li>I did read the negative views, but because there were so many more good reviews, I thought for sure it would be my new miracle eye cream.</li>
            <li>I also use a little dab on my forehead - absorbs well overnight and smells good too :)</li>
            <li>I chose this item because it was a best seller and had high ratings, but after three weeks of use there was 0 improvement in my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works but within the 1-2 weeks of consistently applying product to my under eye area I noticed a visible reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>You will see a difference in softness and the diminishing of fine lines within the first 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is great because the skin near my eyes are super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I found this product and quickly order a jar to test it out.</li>
            <li>I suppose I imagine there&#x27;s something 5 star worthy out there.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the cream and will definitely order more if needed. :)</li>
            <li>happy with my purchase and recommend it to all young and old.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed at how effective this stuff really is.</li>
            <li>This product is more of a balm consistency, goes on smooth and is not heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not for warm weather climate conditions simply because it melts no matter how lightly applied and somehow always gets in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>This product has helped tremendously by decreasing visibility.</li>
            <li>Those people are lucky.</li>
            <li>most important part is that it contains all natural ingredients without synthetic chemicals or fragrances.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;m pregnant and am trying to not put any chemicals in or on my body.  </li>
            <li>, quickly it seems.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more. :]</li>
            <li>The product makes you look more awake and vibrant.</li>
            <li>will definitely looking for some more changes and edit the review if i find it is more helpful.</li>
            <li>The Queen Bee Eye Circle cream arrived quickly before the delivery date.</li>
            <li>delivered quickly, did not remove circles</li>
            <li>made my skin super greasy, which I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>Given all the positive reviews, I was definitely expecting something more effective.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love this product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try. :-)</li>
            <li>I had a smooth and super FAST!</li>
            <li>I bought it for dark circles, but haven&#x27;t used it often enough to comment on progress, but this cream is just so mild, body friendly and pleasant on so many levels that I just love it.</li>
            <li>I used the product consistently for 6 months and can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>they offered me a free jar if I write a review..if the first one didn&#x27;t work why would I need another jar?</li>
            <li>stars b/c product works well, smells great but did nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I just think everybody should be aware that if you write a review, the company will give you a free jar.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much!</li>
            <li>I purchased this item solely based on the great reviews, but I did not see a change in my dark circles and I use it every night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they just don&#x27;t work for my kind of circles or if the manufacturers are outright lying, but I&#x27;ve always felt that the most they&#x27;ll do is make you feel better to know that at least you&#x27;re doing SOMETHING about the problem and not sitting idly by.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer but hasn&#x27;t impacted my dark circles at all.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer but no changes in dark circles.</li>
            <li>but Queen Bee is awesome, and especially for those with sensitive skin trying to avoid chemicals in their products, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of the great reviews from others who suffer from dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li>and I can see that my dark cirles have diminished by a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I then figured out to rub it between my two fingers first and the warmth made it creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and will be ordering it in the future, and telling my friends about it as well.</li>
            <li>It is not good for under make up because it is so oily, but like a night option it is absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at all of the great reviews and the the ratings, so I thought it would be worth the money since nothing I have used in the last 6-7 years has helped much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything for me, and because it&#x27;s primarily just beeswax, it will make your pillows greasy the first time you roll over in bed.</li>
            <li>After four months of almost daily use I am a very satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>I am on my second jar of the &amp;#34;Queen&amp;#34; , I think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for your eyes at an older age.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy to see some of the puffiness going down.</li>
            <li>I believe that natural is always best and Queen Bee will be an active part in my skin care</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the package the smell was so light and wonderfull , the cream was very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, simple natural ingredients, smells great, very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t irritate at all</li>
            <li>I have used less concealer, which is great for my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesnt feel like applying under the eyes but gives soothing effect and by far the best dark circle remover.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, photos taken of me actually look good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also so good to be able to use a product that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh or toxic chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>And it is super economical</li>
            <li>Used for the first time last night seems like a Good Product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, sure, but it&#x27;s pretty much like rubbing lard on your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews...</li>
            <li>Not worth getting another one for free as was promised by the company if you write a good review.  </li>
            <li>it is useful for her eyes, she is also lucky ,she got your card.</li>
            <li>If you have not purchased please select a brand that is not afraid to print in bold letters what is inside their products.</li>
            <li>Well first of all I use the product in all my face and neck, my face appearance looks more bright and my eyes look a little refresh that is why I didn&#x27;t fill in</li>
            <li>This is very effective on my dark circles.</li>
            <li>This company promises to send you a free bottle if you leave positive feedback.  </li>
            <li>letter that if you write a positive review you will receive a free jar.</li>
            <li>So I came on here to review the one star comment and seen that a person received a free jar if they wrote a positive review....</li>
            <li>This has worked better than sweet almond oil &amp; much better than every other dark eye cream, plus it’s working great as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a first for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for more than 2 months, and I can clearly see the results!</li>
            <li>I really hoped it would have worked on the puffiness!!</li>
            <li>So far I think it is good product, I don&#x27;t have dark circles, but I am still using it now as a kind of eye cream to protect skin aroud eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is outstanding on this 60 year old skin!</li>
            <li>Love the all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>, I saw results within the first two weeks!  </li>
            <li>It is my first time using this product, because I like to natural organic product, I think it is good for your body and skin to use as much as nutural product.</li>
            <li>Since i like trying new products, i started with the amazing hydrator LaRoche Posay Hydraphase Intense Eyes (over my EL and Roc)</li>
            <li>I bought Queen Bee a few days ago; first i must say the shipping was super fast, very good and friendly customer service.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, and this has made my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Consequently, I am greatly concerned by this business practice as a loyal Amazon customer who relies heavily on the product reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  not the most pleasant cream I&#x27;ve tried: it has a thick and sort-of greasy texture.</li>
            <li>product itself is very smooth and not heavy</li>
            <li>I have not seen an improvement in dark circles but it is good for moisture and the natural ingredients are great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am very light skin and ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t done a single thing for many, many months.....</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t remove my fine lines, but my skin around my eyes feels much softer.</li>
            <li>Used it for 2 weeks, so absolutely zero affect on my fine lines/dark circles, I&#x27;m suspicious of the reviews on here...</li>
            <li>I originally looked for vitamin K in liquid form (for my dark circles), but I decided on this product seeing as there a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it less stars because it moisturizes your skin around the eyes very nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the cream is kind of on the verge of chapstick but a little creamier and more spreadable.</li>
            <li>The instruction says apply before bed, is it for night only?&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream has so hard texture, is there a good way to use it to help skin better absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m A Female from Bklyn NYC &amp;amp; this cream is AMAZING LADIES.</li>
            <li>WOW really impressed wish I had bought a few years</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for few months now and have seen great results .</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this amazing product...</li>
            <li>The aroma helps me feel calm.  </li>
            <li>I really wish it worked, because my under eye area feels so smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li>My mom around 60 years old love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant of this product because most eye creams contain chemicals I can&#x27;t even pronounce, but so far queen bee has been spot on.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive, and most of the products that I have tried have chemicals that burn, itch or cause breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and i love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Also love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>It stays on your skin kind of like vaseline but to a lesser degree</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>When my skin absorbs it, my face looks fresh, young and healthy.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>for the price its worth a try.</li>
            <li>I also love that the product is all natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve not experienced any of the wonderful results others have.</li>
            <li>So I guess the product is worth giving a try</li>
            <li>simple, natural ingredient list, smells great</li>
            <li>It seems to have worked well in terms of reducing the puffiness under my eyes, and even has reduced the lines when I smile.</li>
            <li>Having said that, this is a nice product to carry around while travelling because I can apply it to my entire face.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic, safe, and gentle on the skin, and will definitely continue to purchase it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My under eye area is smooth, even, soft, and line free.</li>
            <li>I drink a ton of water, eat well, sleep good (haha), and as my daily and nightly routine.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft and younger-looking for sure.</li>
            <li>I love that its natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily and it&#x27;s not going to be 100% absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased this product is 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li>and I love the natural ingredients it is made with, however</li>
            <li>After receiving the product I was surprised to feel it had more of a waxy consistency than a creamy one.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a miracle worker and is worth</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found something that works and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes and skin.</li>
            <li>but none of them was useful.</li>
            <li>The first day I tried it I saw my under eye dark circles get a bit lighter, I am still trying it, but so far I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I received the Queen Bee Eye Cream a few days ago and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>felt that the skin under my eyes got thinner and saggy when I smile after using this product.</li>
            <li>and I regret having used it since I now have saggy under eye skin when I smile.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot say the same.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural, and am glad that I found this product.  </li>
            <li>It really did help with the bags and circles, to the point where I don&#x27;t really consider them a problem any more.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>It was even harder to buy this eye cream with a name like &amp;#34;Queen Bee&amp;#34;, but since the price and reviews were good, and no one could see me buy it, I ordered myself a jar.  </li>
            <li>At age 38 I was beginning to develop laugh lines</li>
            <li>I have seen remarkable reduction in the appearance of dark circles under my eyes in just a week.  </li>
            <li>I love the all natural products that its made with.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this natural products, I love it.</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing that I love about it is that it is natural and organic.</li>
            <li>I love that this cream is 100% natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my under eyes - don&#x27;t quite know if it has done anything miraculous, but it softens and soothes the sensitive skin there</li>
            <li>For the cost of this product, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I feel like Queen Bee is just as effective, but without the harsh chemicals that most eye creams contain.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I have rec&#x27;d so many compliments on how young I look.  </li>
            <li>product did make my skin feel more soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I place it not just under the eye but also on my forehead, between the eyes (frown lines), around my lips and smile lines.  </li>
            <li>The price you pay is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so satisfied and skin under eyes is soft after the wash.</li>
            <li>Most eye creams I&#x27;ve tried (natural or not) make my eyes water and burn, but not this product.</li>
            <li>I knew that buying a more natural product would take time to see results.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s better than putting a cream that&#x27;s packed with chemicals.</li>
            <li>Most of all it is Organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>( gotta love her busy bees )</li>
            <li>Love the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Coconut oil would probably give the same results; which honestly I would rather use.</li>
            <li>The reviews from others looked very positive and so I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>I use it before bedtime, the cream is very rich and the skin around my eyes feels soft and nourished in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this eye cream, so much so that I use it on other parts of my face.</li>
            <li>I use it in the eyes area as well as on my fine lines (mainly in my forehead).</li>
            <li>This is much more than I can say for other treatments I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve paid quite a bit more for some of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that goes away pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>A fabulous moisturizer, and able to be used on full face, as I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Using my concealing cream is more effective with a little of this cream first.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d just use it under my eyes - but because it feels and smells so good (very subtle fragrance, but nice)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results, but was surprised at how long it took for the cream to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Originally, I don&#x27;t have a lot of confidence in drug store products but since it&#x27;s in a reasonable price, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>My facial skin dries out very quickly but since using this cream my face has never been more smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if this is the right eye cream for me.</li>
            <li>The item arrived right on time</li>
            <li>and again right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that&#x27;s about $8 per month, so price seems to be right too&lt;</li>
            <li>Bee  is just  right for me.</li>
            <li>am not one to right reviews</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s right away, once before bed and once in the morning.</li>
            <li>My current product (sweet almond oil), like so many others, causes my eyes to burn &amp; water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>queen bee acts as more of a moisturizer for me and ontop of it, it has been able to get rid of the dark circles I had on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t do much for dark circles.  </li>
            <li>My dark circles have lessened, my makeup stays put so no mascara smudges, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes which has been a big problem with me.</li>
            <li>So the fact that I like it and want to use it in more places on my face makes it very likely that I&#x27;ll get the full benefits from the product.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered my second bottle of this, as liked the first one and missed it after I ran out.</li>
            <li>I received this eye cream a few days ago and was surprised at the amount they give you (pleasant surprise) and like the idea of using a waxier treatment instead of a more liquid or lotion consistency.</li>
            <li>The pri is olive oil, beeswax, more oil ., no active ingredients.</li>
            <li>, first i love the fact that it is natural ingredients</li>
            <li>This is a very soft and fine easily absorbed cream.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft and fine easily absorbed cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smelling creams...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and just a note to those who try to discredit the high ratings, suggesting they are a result of the &#x27;free jar&#x27; offer ...</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and my skin is much better!</li>
            <li>but I would love to see them come out with some flavors a little more intriguing than vanilla.</li>
            <li>Once i got used to this vaseline-like cream, it was more comfortable to use it on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>more refreshing, less puffiness, younger!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever</li>
            <li>Seems to have definitely improved my slight darkness, good stuff!!!</li>
            <li>I thought this product smelled nice, but that is the only positive I have seen with it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion from now on do not waste money on these products you would be better setting a healthy food and exercise routine and going to bed earlier.</li>
            <li>so I really much consider that this is the product that prove me nothing is imposible if the product is truely trusted.</li>
            <li>Most important - it is all natural and therefore I trust using it near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Good product but does not reduce the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I might be able to come upon something that actually works the way it should after two months of consistent usage if I am lucky.</li>
            <li>I think this product is not necessarily marketed honestly as it is an oily skin balm that adds a nice glow to your skin but other than that</li>
            <li>and I’m excited to be seeing such good results after only a couple weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a month now right before bed</li>
            <li>Also shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Just recently introduced to the product and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>so far so good hope to see a bigger result</li>
            <li>It goes on like a balm, but it easily disperses on the skin and leaves skin feeling soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the ingredients are natural, it keeps my under eye area moist, and it smells good, so I will keep using it and hope for further improvement.</li>
            <li>This product is so amazing that keeps the round areas of my eyes smooth and rejuvinate.</li>
            <li>, I love being social now.  </li>
            <li>Good for lines, does nothing for black circles.</li>
            <li>I will say that I originally only purchased this item because it had such great reviews.</li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t use too much in the morning because it takes a while to absorb and is super shiny.</li>
            <li>I initially purchased this cream because I was looking for a product with more natural ingredients to use for moisturizing my under-eye area - I wasn&#x27;t expecting to find a product that not only moisturized my under-eye area, but also reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, made an incredible lip balm, and was useful as an intensive salve-like moisturizer for dry spots, scratches, and scars all over my body!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and is quite light in application.</li>
            <li>, I think the reviews made me more hopeful than I normally would have been, and it&#x27;s really done absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I saw many five star reviews and bought it right away without actually reading them.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for the results i got.  </li>
            <li>I cheerfully threw out my dirty eye creams (yes, I needed more than one of them), and have continued to use only Queen Bee with wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Product was also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I was turned off by the waxy look of the product, but it goes on very much like thinned out vaseline based cream and stays put on your face.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle product.</li>
            <li>I received it very fast, I started using the Queen Bee</li>
            <li>my daughter likes it very much.</li>
            <li>The creme worked wonders after just a couple of weeks it had almost completely faded the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because I&#x27;m pleased with the delivery of the product due to the fact that it was free shipping.</li>
            <li>As many others who have tried this, I too have purchased/used MANY different eye creams ( a small fortune&#x27;s worth) and have never been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed much, if any, change which is surprising based upon the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I usually have allergies to under-eyes cosmetics, but this cream (more like a paste) feels very light</li>
            <li>so as to not sport the raccoon look, but it would be good to know how to remove this product so it is compatible with the little bit of eye makeup</li>
            <li>Queen Bee is my favorite antiage cream for my fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is that it is much more gentle than other products for the under eye area.  </li>
            <li>Nothing irritating, so that&#x27;s very good.  </li>
            <li>I like to put it on my whole face, the smell is great, and I put it under my eyes to PREVENT dark circles and lines as I get older.</li>
            <li>It does take quite a while to absorb (a result of the natural oils that make the product so incredible) and can look a bit shiny on the skin, so I only use it at night or when I know I&#x27;ll just be lounging around the house, but the moisturized feeling lasts until the next day, so only using it at night works just fine for me!</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not sure how well it works for the eyes, it&#x27;s amazing stuff for your lips!  </li>
            <li>Although, I wasn&#x27;t sure that the cream would work, for I had yet to try a cream that actually worked.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot Queen bee cream!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products for wrinkles, for tightening the skin on the face and neck, (as we know, with age the skin on the neck can wrinkle and sag) and the bags that I have under my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right away, I noticed that Queen Bee worked at least as good as the sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>By the time I’m ready to apply makeup around my eyes, I know that my skin has absorbed all it can.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and when I wake up my skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and i was expecting more of a cream, it actually works well</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I ordered a second bottle two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Once I received it I was very upset because it looked like someone had home printed the label!</li>
            <li>and so far enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I was on the search for an affordable, natural eye cream and this fit criteria.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend this to a friend, and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m definitely going  to buy more as soon as I run out of it.</li>
            <li>Im putting on my face no weird names of things that i dont know.  </li>
            <li>I actually read so many reviews and wonder if people lie.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that I will like this product as I will use it more regularly.</li>
            <li>love this eye cream and will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Put these under my eyes the first night, woke up the next morning to even more pronounced bags.</li>
            <li>First, let me say I have coal mines for eyes.  </li>
            <li>It looks shiny but not heavy &amp; goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  about the product: The jar looks pretty small,and the cream has like a wax texture to it</li>
            <li>Just be aware of the nature of the problem you&#x27;re trying to fix - i.e. whether it&#x27;s fixable or not.</li>
            <li>This morning was the first time that I applied this under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I will be trying to use consistently morning and evening</li>
            <li>My eyes are soft and smooth looking.</li>
            <li>however it is exactly like Vaseline and there is no way that you could put makeup over it because it would just come off immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first tried Queen Bee</li>
            <li>This is the first cream I have used for under eyes</li>
            <li>More updates later.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>I actually stopped using any creams for months because those creams did more damage than help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 24 and just recently came to the conclusion that I need to start taking care of my skin better</li>
            <li>I also think it is interesting that no one else has commented on this product in the last year...</li>
            <li>In brief, I love this product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I can only use at night, could not keep my makeup on over top of this.  </li>
            <li>When i first saw this product here in Amazon</li>
            <li>The first night i tried this product</li>
            <li>I mix this with the vitamin K serum it does exactly what it days</li>
            <li>Everything about it is consistent with the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, Queen Bee for a terrific product AND a free jar!</li>
            <li>And on top of it , the product is totally natural!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using this product consistently since I received it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just use it on my eyes, I use it all over my face because I have noticed that it works better than the nighttime facial cream I was devoted to.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product consistently for about a week.</li>
            <li>I can only assume that&#x27;s why this has so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>but the darkish circles and morning puffiness aren&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>And if i get up in the middle of the night I put more on.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect it to work over night.</li>
            <li>Almost done with my first jar.</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned Crisco and that seems pretty on target.</li>
            <li>Did exactly like it said it would do.</li>
            <li>I already bought 3 more for the future.</li>
            <li>I already bought 3 more for the future.</li>
            <li>I wake up with smaller pores, blemishes disappear or fade, and more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>this is the real deal folks!</li>
            <li>I have noticed the product to do exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>I am still waiting on a more deep result on my eye area</li>
            <li>when applying this product on your face don&#x27;t forget the sun screen is very essential :-)</li>
            <li>I seem to have some sort of allergy to most facial cleansers/washes and was hoping that since this was very simple it would be ok for me.  </li>
            <li>The cream helps reduce puffiness around the eyes with consistent nightly use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it says - shea butter and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Product does exactly what it says it does ....</li>
            <li>The ingredients of the product remind me about Native American remedies and indigenous medicine, so now I am confident using this product around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better for night use only.</li>
            <li>It kind of looks like petroleum jelly but is harder.  </li>
            <li>I did not like it at first though</li>
            <li>Because of this nature, the cream is able to stick to my eyes longer and keep eye area moist longer than eye gel or regular watery eye cream.  </li>
            <li>and i think the shininess is mild enough that it&#x27;s fine to wear it during the day without worrying about how it looks.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up</li>
            <li>Once I get back into my sleeping schedule and routine, it will probably be better.</li>
            <li>Old fashioned, ineffective and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>First of all this is a salve type product, it&#x27;s not a cream.</li>
            <li>Really did wonders for me!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I based my decision to buy this product in the first place.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this consistently every night for a month now.</li>
            <li>I am planning to start again soon and will be sure to apply it daily for about a month and see what happens then.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been satisfied with it except the one that there are tiny balls you can feel when you apply to your skin, which bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>Noticeable difference after the first week ...</li>
            <li>I am close to finishing my first jar.</li>
            <li>I got my first jar for the $50 price tag.</li>
            <li>Third purchases and I&#x27;m still greatly satisfied.</li>
            <li>When I get up in the morning, it is no longer greasy, but soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>No, they are not gone, but they are definitely shades and shades lighter, and the skin under my eyes looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li>Thanks queen bee!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous products in the past and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>but it goes on smooth and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I thought it was fluke the first time</li>
            <li>This really is an awsome product!  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really helped to lighten my dark circles under my eyes and it helps to keep my lashes nice and full as well.</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t get more in the future.</li>
            <li>I use this for only 5 days now,and i allready  love the smell,the texture and the fact</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to many people and I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li>Over the years I’ve tried many different products and none made any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something that is paraben free and had all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>The cream is so smooth and soft when applied to my skin</li>
            <li>The product makes my skin feel and look smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I know it sounds weird, but that&#x27;s the best I could describe the feeling I had.  </li>
            <li>My hubby is even interested.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a difference, some blotching hoping to see more results in the future.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and not greasy and very easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would love to continue to see the results</li>
            <li>You have to know that the first ingredient listed is Olive Oil</li>
            <li>iam deep in love with this cram</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As far as using it all the time or are trying to smooth away wrinkles, your not going to get the results you so desire.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I smells great, but was not effective for my application.</li>
            <li>I would buy more in future.</li>
            <li>it is not expensive.</li>
            <li>Feels exactly like Crisco</li>
            <li>Initially, I was suspicious because one eye cream never seems to please everyone and to see so many (600</li>
            <li>But after trying the whole bottle, I have not seen any effect around my eyes at all!</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying this :)</li>
            <li>No side effects on my skin and the facial lines are no longer prominent.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how I felt about this cream at first because of the wax-ish consistency.</li>
            <li>I can think of many uses for it, and will definitely continue to keep this on hand at all times.  </li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for a couple of months now</li>
            <li>so i know exactly what</li>
            <li>but I did not notice any improvements even when I used it consistently.</li>
            <li>I did not like this greasy feeling at first, but you do not need to apply a lot around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>and it only made my eyes more puffy looking.</li>
            <li>I wear it every night and every morning and saw a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for weeks until the product was used in its entirety.</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s texture is like a lip balm, and</li>
            <li>Works really well...love it!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s about the only thing I enjoyed about it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sleep nearly as many hours as I should, and I struggle with waking in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li>I then started using it twice a day, and definitely feel better about my under eye appearance.  </li>
            <li>I know not everyone has the same level of improvement, but I really love what it&#x27;s done for me.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m down to just using the Queen Bee, and my usual makeup regime, and I feel good, my husband says my skin looks and feels good to the touch, and after 28 years of marriage, I appreciate any compliment</li>
            <li>so it was a refreshing experience to try something new and all natural.</li>
            <li>It makes my dry skin feel so much softer and nice.</li>
            <li>My skin is not only clean and fresh, fine lines and wrinkles are significantly reduced making me feel like a look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>you want an amazing, natural eye cream, pay a little more and go with Real Purity.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin radiant, clear and fresh feeling!</li>
            <li>Friends say with a very moist, effective mitigation eye skin wrinkles, worth having, but also has some effect on the dark circles</li>
            <li>The dark circles have diminished greatly in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it and the skin around my eyes appear to be more moist.</li>
            <li>I just received and haven&#x27;t used yet, but I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye cream that is organic and 100% natural, and was excited to find this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve put this on every night for not even a week and my wrinkles under my eyes and dark circles have already gotten better!</li>
            <li>old and after my 30&#x27;s my eye bags were significant to the point co-workers @</li>
            <li>Im doubtful because there is a lot of good ratings that is so good to be true.</li>
            <li>I love trying new products and rarely buy the same thing twice, but this skin balm is one I will continue to buy.  </li>
            <li>This turned out to be the best one I have ever used, takes care of dark circles, makes your skin soft and supple, highly recommend the product!Yule not loose anything !!</li>
            <li>This really makes your eyes soft and helps with your eye concealer to go on smooth.</li>
            <li>It is soothing, clean scented and natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that not only I found the cream that doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reaction but also really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put on my body from full time school and full time work at the same time.  </li>
            <li>so the asian side of me has blessed me with, overall, good skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice - no chemicals and only natural scents.</li>
            <li>I am usually pretty cautious when I hear about natural products that work to deal with skin problems, and with this product that held true.</li>
            <li>For me, the professional products seem to work better or Living Clay makes my eyes nearly flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The postal carrier lost my package and they were sure to get me my item as fast as possible after knowing about the issue.</li>
            <li>Vitamin K. Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that as far as NATURAL under eye creams</li>
            <li>I saw that so many people love this cream, and it works for them, but it was too thick for my under eyes.</li>
            <li>An overall nice, natural product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products and methods (like cucumber slices) to get the dark bags under my eyes to go away but the results have been average at best</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty pale, so my under eye circles are very prominent.</li>
            <li>This really does help me and it&#x27;s very gentle being</li>
            <li>i can not believe the positive reviews, EVEN if they show it&#x27;s a \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t think it does because of all the positive comments.</li>
            <li>I read positive reviews about it and thought I&#x27;d try it out.</li>
            <li>But on the positive side, it may lighten the skin around eyes.</li>
            <li>I saw all the positive reviews on Amazon and had to try this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Any product with positive rating from EWG and works like this gets an A+ from me.</li>
            <li>Did not see the results noted in positive reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so happy with this cream that I thought it is not fair if I don&#x27;t write one.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a long time now, and is extremely satisfied</li>
            <li>I used it twice today for the first time &amp;amp; saw results really fast.</li>
            <li>I know this is all very subjective, but I&#x27;m willing to continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>My first thoughts when I started using Queen Bee was feeling like a real Queen ^.^</li>
            <li>When i woke up Ohhhh my it really works just on the first application.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product especially when you think about the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and don&#x27;t have the who-know-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for making such a fantastic natural, organic product available.  </li>
            <li>I love this &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>You can use it pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have noticed much of a difference, other than it feels nice on my skin</li>
            <li>feels stretched with more noticable wrinkles, darker circles &amp; puffier bags.</li>
            <li>luv this, true ORGANIC ALL NATURAL PRODUCT,  </li>
            <li>Honestly, it said it would remove dark circles, but I didn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>Surprising how such simple ingredients can help so much.</li>
            <li>I will have to give it a little more time for final product review but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Often I have to do my own research to track down a product&#x27;s ingredients and it gets so time consuming.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 2 months, mainly with the purpose of  minimizing my age lines and preventing more.</li>
            <li>It is good in a way because I use less than a normal cream (which I tend to use too much).  </li>
            <li>I would like to explain a little bit more about the product how affect on my face!</li>
            <li>For age related facial / eye issues I enjoy the result and noticeable reduction in significant problems that can occur around the eye area!</li>
            <li>The slight hint of coca butter scent is a nice touch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a short time dark circles have improved as well as it being a great moisturizing product</li>
            <li>Product also has a slight but nice smell.</li>
            <li>My under eye wrinkles diminished tremendously and my skin naturally glows.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it more for dry peeling skin around my nose (from allergies) and for keeping my skin moisturized after at home chemical peels.</li>
            <li>Overall it makes my face baby smooth after my first overnight application.  </li>
            <li>But I also use it for my chronic dry lips and it has worked better then anything else I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like natural, Organic products and vitamin K is good for dark circles...</li>
            <li>it does get rid of very dry patches on my face and great to use on dry lips too</li>
            <li>I will certainly recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li>certain chemicals can offset and therefor detour the eye cream from working.</li>
            <li>certain chemicals can offset and therefor detour the eye cream from working.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m almost certain</li>
            <li>It certainly has not offered the results it touts--</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Better off with Pure Vitamin K cream which repaired the &amp;#34;damage&amp;#34; done by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for bringing a useful product to my natural skin regime!</li>
            <li>While the product is all natural and feels OK and smells nice, the formulation is not good for its intended use.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely something new to me, more like a salve.</li>
            <li>Amazing Product at Reasonable Cost:&lt;br /&gt;I had been struggling with dark circles under my eye for quite some time and tried some products, but hardly any gave as good a result as Queen Bee.</li>
            <li>, it mixes great with makeup foundation, making under-eye wrinkles less visible throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>Nice natural balm smell without any phony fragrances that can dry skin.</li>
            <li>If it is dry around your eyes and regular eye cream does not seem to help improve the wrinkles and puffiness just like me, this is a good cream to try.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this is positive enough to get a free one to.</li>
            <li>And I haven&#x27;t decided if this is a positive or a negative, but it smells so good</li>
            <li>I began to use this product last night it will take few days if the dark sleeping circles will disappear but what I love it is all natural with an excellent fragrance</li>
            <li>After using this product for about a month now, it definitely helped soften and moisturize my eye-area while reducing the appearance of fine lines and the darkness.</li>
            <li>i see this as very high priced considering what it achieved.</li>
            <li>I think it works just as good, if not better, than other products that cost much more.  </li>
            <li>First of all, what happened to the high ratings posted here?</li>
            <li>have hard good things about this product.</li>
            <li>and I already see an improvement the product is very thick, but goes on nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>results,,I had a very dark circle in the eyes area and the change its amazing,,,</li>
            <li>After all the good reviews I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; Well, when you get the package queen bee adds a little piece of paper that offers a second free jar upon a &amp;#34;great review&amp;#34; received.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I took out time to order this cream, well receive and start using only a week and notice that this cream has already done wonders for my skin, I&#x27;m a woman over 45 years of age and started to notice my skin getting very dark and drier, tried using over the counter creams but was unsucessful with find something that would work for me, while on amazon website searching ran across this item and having been using it since for under my eyes and all over the rest of my face, notice my skin is more softer and supptle</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for giving me this amazing product at such low price</li>
            <li>After a few short weeks of using it I already began to see great results.</li>
            <li>I had only been using it for one week and already noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Volume is huge, it will last for years.</li>
            <li>It takes 4-5 days to really see the effects.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I once received 2 jars at one time, &amp; both of them had a gritty, rather than smooth product in them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really think that Amazon should require a listing of all ingredients from sellers for makeup and skin products (this seller listed the ingredients).  </li>
            <li>For the amount that cosmetic companies charge for their products, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask to have them disclose what they&#x27;re asking the consumer to pay for.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It really reduced in color.</li>
            <li>This really does make my skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, just be a bit patient, you&#x27;ll see it works!</li>
            <li>Thanks, JHA-Florida</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do anything, I finished the whole jar</li>
            <li>It is very greasy (made from olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax and vitamin K</li>
            <li>This cream is really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t  ready to leave the wonders that they do to my skin..</li>
            <li>I really saw a differences.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li>It is very greasy</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see difference after using the almost whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say I can recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This was a very moisturizing oil based eye cream.</li>
            <li>The product is really a balm and not a cream</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much of improvement yet,I will rate it once i&#x27;m done with the bottle i&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I really like how it smells</li>
            <li>Needless to mention the packaging which is incredibly cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating</li>
            <li>Using on my whole face before going to bed may be an issue however.</li>
            <li>It suits me very well.</li>
            <li>so wrinkles are not my problem and that seems to be what this eye cream is really for</li>
            <li>Applying something so close to your eyes needs to be gentle, and I have found queen bee to be my answer.  </li>
            <li>It really works for my under eye wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>My eyes have improves so much I wish I had before and after pictures.</li>
            <li>Very thankful.</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle and didnt even see any changes at all.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works really well</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I prefer this cream for night time as it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>This product really doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>The queen bee eye cream is very soothing.</li>
            <li>Queen Bee is Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>i use this on my whole face, not just my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to get in my opinion before too much time passed by.</li>
            <li>and it really moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>There is a noticeable difference-- much improved.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY shiny</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very concealable under make up.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes the areas under my eyes very well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve yet to see much improvement in my genetic undereye circles.  </li>
            <li>but it is very greasy.</li>
            <li>For now, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>truly i don&#x27;t see much change....</li>
            <li>Was very hesitant ordering this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>but it really does nothing</li>
            <li>the improvements have been really noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The cream is very oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month and my eye area feels very moisturized.</li>
            <li>Yes Ladies this eye cream really does work.</li>
            <li>The seller offered a free 2nd product after a review was posted.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe the hype, as you are offered a product to write a review so save yourself some money and get something that really works.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m this happy with it on the first day getting it, I can only imagine how amazed I will be in a few weeks!</li>
            <li>Ive also noticed that I don&#x27;t use a much concealer as before.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving my order I also received a promotional note saying I could get another free order if I only wrote a review here on amazon.</li>
            <li>This product has worked where others haven&#x27;t -- have tried Neutrogena and straight vitamin E.</li>
            <li>This product is very greasy and stay greasy under my eyes all night.</li>
            <li>This product is also very greasy.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if it were in a lip balm container, it would be much easier to use/apply.</li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes was getting very lose.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how, but it does really work.</li>
            <li>I really like how I&#x27;m not putting a lot of chemicals on my face</li>
            <li>It really works....</li>
            <li>and now I have clogged sweat pores that my dermatologist wants to do a microderma skin care procedure to unclog.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has worked really well.</li>
            <li>My eyes have cleared up really well.</li>
            <li>I used my ring finger to apply this stuff being that it&#x27;s the gentle finger.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very greasy, so could not wear under makeup, but now a problem for nighttime use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>For those like me with chemical sensitivity, that&#x27;s really appreciated.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference  with the crow&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li>It is also quite greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>So much for the Amazon rating system with this one.</li>
            <li>and I use it on my whole face not just around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive for this type of product.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this product, I was really optimistic.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I really like how it smells.</li>
            <li>and i could see much difference within 7 days.</li>
            <li>i really like this brand and will continue buying it always</li>
            <li>It applies much thicker than anything I tried</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin around your eyes very greasy looking and does not soak into the skin well.  </li>
            <li>Also - no coupon for a second jar free</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my under eye darkness</li>
            <li>I really amaze with this product and never regret that I bought this.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but it really acts like the coconut oil, that I was used to ,nothing special.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to work as fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very soothing though</li>
            <li>Not overly greasy on the skin which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is very versatile, which is also an advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I also should say, that I was just putting this on in the morning for under eye circles, but when using it at night and in the morning, I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like the smells</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, just be a bit patient, you&#x27;ll see it works!</li>
            <li>But it did moisturize the area very well.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing eye cream.</li>
            <li>It is everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t do much for me in the eye department.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I also coupled it with  {Copy and paste this link-------&amp;#62;(Best-Selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin-- 100% Pure-Highest Quality, Anti-Aging Serum-- Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free-Best Hyaluronic Acid for Your Face</li>
            <li>but I feel very shiny after using the cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff really truly works, can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I think this product works really well.</li>
            <li>I got it two years ago and after using it intermittently it didn&#x27;t work very well which makes sense.</li>
            <li>It was very waxy</li>
            <li>and I did not think it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this all summer at night on my whole face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes when you are using a product that gives gradual results, you don&#x27;t really appreciate how much it is working until you stop.</li>
            <li>I started using it 4 months ago, and in the beginning I was very faithful to put it on EVERY night.</li>
            <li>For me, really liking something makes all the difference in the world.  </li>
            <li>but I can say this product really works.</li>
            <li>I use morning and night and highly recomend this product!</li>
            <li>This product really is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Really like the consistency and the texture of this eye cream .</li>
            <li>It even works really well as a lip</li>
            <li>so I am VERY senstitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>delivery was fast as well.</li>
            <li>all the eye creams I&#x27;ve used did not do much for my problem.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this product is working very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Crows feet still very noticable.</li>
            <li>Not noticing much difference under my eyes</li>
            <li>But I really want to recommend it as an overnight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>On day 3, my whole face was swollen like &amp;</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t help me.......</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much change from using this product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to share that I really like this product.</li>
            <li>After much research, I found the under eye cream</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much cover up under my eyes anymore.</li>
            <li>I was very diligent with this product</li>
            <li>This stuff really changed my appearance</li>
            <li>, I did not notice a change in that area, but really softens the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it looked as if it was getting ready to blister.  </li>
            <li>This is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>and keeps my under eye are very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I no longer look like a zombie in the morning haha</li>
            <li>This product really work on my skin .</li>
            <li>much should be apply to face?</li>
            <li>Much thanks.</li>
            <li>It is very oily</li>
            <li>Every morning my whole face glows after using this stuff overnight.</li>
            <li>a real consumer</li>
            <li>I really lost my hope that they recover.</li>
            <li>and we get the cream how much we want.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even use it as a moistariser because it&#x27;s very oil.</li>
            <li>but it is much stiffer.  </li>
            <li>It really starts working soon, even my colleague mentioned it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy/</li>
            <li>I do really like this product</li>
            <li>product really works and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It leaves the eyes really oily looking.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the deal on the product--it is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>For me, not so much.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and always use oil-free products as much as I can.</li>
            <li>I have had this about 2 weeks now and really like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like the moisturizing benefits of this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Would not repurchase though as it did not fix much.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li>After using it it also made my skin look and feel -really- oily.</li>
            <li>Just set your expectations reasonably.</li>
            <li>I am a Jamaican and the product works really well for my skin.</li>
            <li>very minium)</li>
            <li>Didnt really seem like it helped me much.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I started putting it on my whole face</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>and now my skin stays moisturized throughout the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He smell reminded me of baked cookies and the texture was smooth enough to pat all over my face.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing out there I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really fix the darkness under the eye</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>After finishing my first jar of Queen Bee, I realized that I never notice dark circles under my eyes any more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams over the years and this is first product that has helped my dark circles and crows feet.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact it has only natural ingredients, without alcohol which so many skin products seem to contain.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using queen bee, I can honestly say that I can see and feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>I just got this a few days ago, every night before bed I put it on and even during the day I put some on if I&#x27;m not leaving the house because it&#x27;s kind of greasy</li>
            <li>and I had issues putting something like that with so many chemicals I couldn&#x27;t pronounce in such a sensitive area like my under eye region.</li>
            <li>It is also good to spread it thick around eyes when taking a bath and relax.  </li>
            <li>My eye skin was soft and supple, even after a looooong night!!!</li>
            <li>The consistency is super thick and greasy, but overall has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to tell about any long term results/effects, but I love it so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rare you can stumble upon something this neutral, mild and gentle when you are sensitive to pretty much EVERYTHING including all-natural/organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far im please with the product,i just wish it was a bigger jar for the price,the jar is small,but other than that,it came early and the package was good,&amp;it smells good!</li>
            <li>I do like it at night mostly because we live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles are gone, fine lines are things of past and my skin is quite smooth.</li>
            <li>I found this under eye cream more hydrating than most of the other natural products I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!), and it was soothing and refreshing for my very sensitive skin (no itching and no red marks like other creams).</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t really tried that many other products, but I would much rather put something that is chemical free and natural on my face every day, than some of the other creams on the market full of who-knows-what.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other eye creams but since using Queen Bee I have found it to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Better than I expected results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every night for the past two weeks and love it!</li>
            <li>In the short time I have been using the eye cream I have already had significant results.</li>
            <li>if you like it and want another jar, you will leave a review even if you don&#x27;t normally review products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely hydrating without the harmful chemicals like in most products nowadays.</li>
            <li>but I decided to buy this cream due to many reviews by people who claim this cream</li>
            <li>It does seem to give me a more awake look, but as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s if you miss a day</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems rich enough to keep my under eye moisturised</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for other things.  </li>
            <li>I really did not see any improvement as far as dark circles were concerned, but the cream did feel nice on my eyes</li>
            <li>I have been looking for almost 10 years for something and stumbled across this a couple years ago after trying many other products.  </li>
            <li>Again, love the moisturizing that I get along with my other products.  </li>
            <li>When i woke up, I immediately could see my dark circles were already appearing lighter and my fine lines were fading!</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it&#x27;s a natural product and is very emollient which is wonderful in this cold, very dry, New Jersey winter weather!</li>
            <li>The cream is pretty oily and it takes 20-30 minutes to get fully absorbed, so I only used it before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product may be totally great and do exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li>Great product and this little bottle goes a long way too!</li>
            <li>use this every night and my dark circles are completely gone and the skin around my eyes is nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The difference in just a few short weeks is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have not been using this product long enough to see the full potential of it, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin nice and soft but did not get any results in terms of diminishing my dark circles</li>
            <li>and I honestly see no difference in my dark circles so far.</li>
            <li>Very moisturising and lovely smell.&lt;br /&gt;Still need to try it to see the result with dark circles.</li>
            <li>It does last a long time though, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this product was all natural, I have been using it for dark circles and under eye wrinkles</li>
            <li>Nice natural ingredients however, I found it did nothing for my dark circles and was a bit greasy for me....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very sensitive when it comes to products used near my eyes and simply can&#x27;t use most of the ones sold brick and-mortar stores.</li>
            <li>Organic is much safer and better than other creams on the market!</li>
            <li>Not only is this product 100% natural, it&#x27;s amazing for smoothing lines under your eyes and make the skin under your eye look and feel supple, hydrated and really much younger!</li>
            <li>I am using this on my face and neck,  I noticed an immediate tightening with the first application, my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to urea (used as a preservative in cosmetics) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoulene which is apparently related to the toluene found in nail polish that many people are allergic to) and so, being fed up with having to check every ingredient list of every makeup and skin care product I wanted to buy, I decided to go all natural or organic.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say this is the first time I ever used an eye treatment completely and then immediately reordered.</li>
            <li>But most of all, I noticed that my dark under eye circles were gone.</li>
            <li>It cost $22.98 and is most definitely not worth $2.00.</li>
            <li>I can already say that my dark circles are almost not visible and the skin around my eyes looks so much better after 1 month of use.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and moistrurizing skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients lets you know just exactly what&#x27;s going on your eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving more time to see results on the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews but decided to try it for myself ,boy was I impressed.</li>
            <li>This is is my first natural organic eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I have battled with dark circles most of my life</li>
            <li>Better for face rather than dark circle remover.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say for sure my dark undereye circles have lightened at all, but I use it all over my face for my aging skin -</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know about the dark circles yet, but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>So, hopefully, with continuous use my dark circles and perhaps my wrinkles will get better.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying All Natural Queen Bee Eye Cream</li>
            <li>The area that bothers me the most is dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking and using many eye creams for my dark circles problems.</li>
            <li>and I can see my dark circles getting better.</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that is kind to sensitive skin and actually works effortlessly!</li>
            <li>Love this put it on overnight and 30 min before applying makeup and it will reduce puffy dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I had dark circles although not terrible</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of creams and make up, and nothing has worked as well as this product for dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for wrinkles/crows feet as I don&#x27;t have them yet, but I am pleased that my dark circles are lighter.</li>
            <li>i guess its focused more on wrinkles than dark circles/</li>
            <li>Overall I recommend this product and will continue using to see the full affects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 years old and recently noticing signs fine lines.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better for the rosacea, which started to go down after just a week or two of use.  </li>
            <li>so I am very excited at the prospect of lessening this problem even further as this product will absolutely have my support for the foreseeable future!</li>
            <li>First morning after I applied the cream, I noticed that the skin was smoothed out (no little bumps).</li>
            <li>Good quality ingredients, no complaint there, I just thought it would be absorbed better into my skin and naively believed it might actually lighten my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>This will not stop me from buying this product as I also love to apply it in the morning under my make up to get a more supply look under my eye area and my dark circles are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Queen Bee for almost 2 years now and it has significantly reduced both the rosacea and the dark circles (not completely gone, but much much better).  </li>
            <li>This product really provided an enriching feeling that gave new color to my skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>you get a free jar for a positive review until ordering and afterward reading some other reviews.</li>
            <li>It feels great and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell or rough feel.  </li>
            <li>I love the slight honey/organic scent.  </li>
            <li>Not a quick fix for wrinkles, but I am pleased with the moisturizing effect over time.  </li>
            <li>We are all looking for a miracle product but less stress, eating healthy, yoga, meditation and drinking water will provide the miracle.</li>
            <li>circles under my eyes are less noticeable and folks tell me I look better rested now that I have in years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s better if you don&#x27;t dab it under your eyes like typical eye creams.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel more hydrated, and slightly plumper.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is less like a cream and more of a wax and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>There is a slight vanilla scent and it is more like a salve than a lotion or cream.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use daily to see constant effects!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I found this cream because the couple of creases under my eyes that were starting to form are now definitely starting to fade.</li>
            <li>I apply it every night before going to bed and when I wake up, my eyes feel vibrant and youthful.</li>
            <li>The main difference I see is the wrinkles around the corners of my eyes have minimized in appearance.</li>
            <li>I had bought this product based on the number of reviews, only to find when I received the product that the company offers free product as incentives to write reviews.</li>
            <li>I tried many eye creams such as Lancôme, Olay, Shiseido, and found the real problem is that even though some eye creams provide moisture and ease wrinkles when you apply them, they dry out fast and the wrinkles appear again.  </li>
            <li>but the older</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s not any better than Vaseline and a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Consulted doctors and friends, tries multiple products; some worked but had side effects on my skin, while others weren’t that effective.</li>
            <li>Wonderful definitely try it and you will not be sorry</li>
            <li>The texture was different than what I was used to, but I got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>This has taken two or three months, applying morning and night, to happen, with steady decrease in pigment.  </li>
            <li>This has taken two or three months, applying morning and night, to happen, with steady decrease in pigment.  </li>
            <li>Not thinking there was a difference in any particular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an intensely moisturizing under-eye night cream made with natural ingredients I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>the older I get</li>
            <li>but they must be from people whoose main issue</li>
            <li>is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li>So, I apply a mixture of 2 drops of Tamanu oil mixed with nivea white and one drop of rose-hip oil on top of it, for softness.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a magic cream to work in a short amount of time, this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to male and female species alike :)</li>
            <li>I was a bit iffy at first buying this under eye cream since most eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the past never seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use at night.  </li>
            <li>This is a MUST HAVE for any woman who wants to use a natural product that really delivers.  </li>
            <li>Coconut oil is the closest to a decent improvement .</li>
            <li>(I should note that while I&#x27;m 25 years old, I&#x27;ve been battling pretty severe symptoms that have caused chronic sleep deprivation for a little more than 2 years.)  </li>
            <li>But being a person with VERY sensitive skin, particularly around my eyes, I&#x27;ve learned to really like this.</li>
            <li>I am in my late 40s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles (yet!)</li>
            <li>The only drawback from it is the wax form, but it&#x27;s just a minor minus compared to the great benefit it carries.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend anyone giving  this product a try.</li>
            <li>high up in my list of things to check for before purchasing cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it with no</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with undereye bags.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light not to heavy where it clogs up your pores.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>I will reorder this one and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommends this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>All the other reviews are absolutely correct how fantastic this is.</li>
            <li>I had very dry skin on my face and within a matter of days it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>Maybe better to scoop out with a little spoon.</li>
            <li>it is a little oily, but it&#x27;s ok, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>it is a little oily, but it&#x27;s ok, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things for my dark circles around eyes and this is it!</li>
            <li>I do feel as though the skin under my eyes looks a little more refreshed in the mornings after I&#x27;ve washed my face and</li>
            <li>I have noticed fine lines and small wrinkles disappearing, and my skin feels so fresh and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream really gets rid of dark circles and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>main concern is that I purchased the \\&quot;eye cream\\&quot; thinking it was a new product by Queen Bee.  </li>
            <li>I apply this by using the third finger as it offers the most gentle touch as i smooth on the hard formula to my under eye and my eye lid.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was very sceptical because it is a soft, moist cream that smells like honey and looks like it shouldn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early twenties, so I can&#x27;t really testify to its effects on lines and wrinkles, but it didn&#x27;t work well on my shadows.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like all the natural ingredients they use.  </li>
            <li>I really like that the ingredients are all natural &amp; plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to rub it in too much under my eyes because the skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>It can be greasy if you use too much or if it&#x27;s not rubbed in completely.</li>
            <li>It is natural and really softens my eye area.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical from the moment i received my package because it came with a &amp;#34;give us a great review</li>
            <li>Might be natural but doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>This is a very hydrating eye moisturizer and I like that it&#x27;s made of identifiable ingredients.</li>
            <li>but you can put it on your whole face and it feels soft.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t removed the darkness completely, but I don&#x27;t think anything really could considering my Sicilian heritage.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and gentle, provide moisture to the under eye area, and fade the darkness as well.</li>
            <li>Ive tried so many products and have spent so much money on different skincare but this one jar takes care of it all.  </li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m sure not to waste money.  </li>
            <li>I usually use products with chemicals in them; recently I was aware of the harm that these kind of products do to my skin</li>
            <li>and I already feel that my face is soft, smooth and bit clear as compare to prior to using this product.</li>
            <li>This one however does not irritate eyes and allows me to remain normal and non squinting when i used it</li>
            <li>this natural eye cream smells soft and very edible!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and under-eye circles aren&#x27;t gone, but look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update again in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Honestly I had dark spot on both side of my upper checks</li>
            <li>He was actually the one who ordered Queen Bee for me after reading some reviews about others customers with rosacea having success with it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li>so no complaint at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrill that others have had such success with Queen Bee, but for me it&#x27;s not the case.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I normally use the product before bed.</li>
            <li>so much so that I&#x27;m OK with leaving the house now on a lazy Sunday when I don&#x27;t feel like putting makeup on.</li>
            <li>I saw improvements in my circles after a few weeks and they&#x27;ve been getting progressively better.</li>
            <li>I am confident that it would erase my dark circles completely if i keep using it.</li>
            <li>I like that it is made from beeswax as I am trying to use as many natural organic products in my daily life as possible.</li>
            <li>Ordering a few more</li>
            <li>that I used alot the second day,  and remembered that my doctor said when using any topical products , the best results is when a thin amount is applied.</li>
            <li>I have had dark circles all of my life, and frankly, I believe that how and if they are able to be fixed depends on how you&#x27;ve gotten them.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily on a normal basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to talk about long lasting effects, but it definitely does something good to my skin.</li>
            <li>I love that is is all natural and is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t do the job like other, non natural eye creams would.</li>
            <li>So I bought this product mainly because of the natural ingredients in it, along with the surprisingly high reviews it got.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that would be natural and not full of chemicals like most under eye creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that would be natural and not full of chemicals like most under eye creams.</li>
            <li>It works fabulously to tame my bangs into place and to eliminate some of the top frizz that we curly girls tend to get.</li>
            <li>Luckily they haven&#x27;t lasted long and disappeared after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>and I usually went with the relatively cheap rollers and while they did provide a refreshing feel; none of them really lightened up the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I would like to try using this on my forehead above my eyebrow area to see if it helps with the fine lines that are starting to form up there, but I&#x27;m a little nervous that it might break my skin out since I&#x27;m so sensitive to most products.  </li>
            <li>So far, I really like it and it seems to be working well to eliminate dark circles and smooth wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It will remain shiny for a long time without absorbing and feel kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>Which is what made me try something a little more natural this time around.</li>
            <li>So I just chalked it up that I would just had to live with it.</li>
            <li>It was shipped in a timely fashion and without damage to the unpackaged, but new jar.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this, I just wanted to try a new under eye cream.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have a new lease on life</li>
            <li>I will live with them for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>The cream went on much smoother than other products I&#x27;ve tried and without leaving a super greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>However, after using it for about one week, I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark circles and fine lines were fading.</li>
            <li>but did nothing for dark circles and fine lines been using it for weeks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any improvement in dark circles or fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Have used for about a month and have not seen any improvement on my dark circles or fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I did not have the dark circles but fine lines looking to help.  </li>
            <li>but it is making my fine lines and dark circles disappear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m realistic and know its not going to take them away completely</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the fast delivery of this item and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>As the years passed the dark circles got darker and more apparent.</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old female with sensitive skin that is prone to mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>Besides, WHY would I want an extra jar of something that does not work, even if it is free, that will only add to the clutter on my bathroom</li>
            <li>Initially, posted a generic favorable review because the seller promised to ship the product free after it posted.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, it is natural, sweet and a lot compared with other eye treatment.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll notices a very soft honey like texture.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin around my eyes very soft.</li>
            <li>I look very young and the skin is indeed blemish and bump-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am very conscious of everything I&#x27;m eating and using.</li>
            <li>Put very little though, because when I put a bit more it can get into my eyes when I blink.</li>
            <li>Ok, the quantity is very little, it will surprise you.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and love that this keeps my under eye area moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS INGREDIENT in anything to you are putting on your face especially if your skin is very sensitive like mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I have come to learn that it is the exact same product as the Skin Balm!  </li>
            <li>Fade creams don&#x27;t work over night so it only stands to reason that you have to without a doubt remain consistent with use.</li>
            <li>After the first 3 weeks of using it, I noticed a big difference in my under-eyes AND the color of a mole that is also under my eye.</li>
            <li>The mole was first obvious.</li>
            <li>Wow it works!  </li>
            <li>Will continue to buy and use this natural product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to start using my product because after reading the reviews and hearing other people stories I&#x27;m excited to see the change.</li>
            <li>I love using it on my face, especially with this extreme weather.</li>
            <li>Their eye cream turned my eyes around completely!</li>
            <li>For one it is 100% Natural and Organic!  </li>
            <li>Because of the creaminess of this cream, I decided to try it on my lips one day when they had become so red (the first stage of my suffrage).  </li>
            <li>All Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream!</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>But now at 23, over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve paid more attention to my skin.</li>
            <li>I surprised!</li>
            <li>Not sure if my under eyes look better</li>
            <li>Plus, for the price it&#x27;s great because a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li>Have had no problems with this product so far!</li>
            <li>This is the first eye cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but actually feels like velvet.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all natural to boot!</li>
            <li>More importantly other similar products burn my eyes if they accidentally get in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t have eye bags but after using this product, I developed eye bags.  </li>
            <li>Like others have said, it is pretty greasy/waxy, so it is definitely a night-time product for me</li>
            <li>This is the only eye cream product that works for me although I&#x27;ve tried out higher end products (i.e. Lancôme, etc).&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural, too!  </li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to know what the long term results will be, but it is already making my face look smoother and nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about a week and on the first night using this cream, I could feel the softness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It felt so soft to the touch!  </li>
            <li>And it is useful for any other areas needing intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I purchased a second jar of the product only because I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better than this at the moment.</li>
            <li>I thought spending more for an organic product would be more beneficial, but it just left a greasy look around my eyes, making me look even worse!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>I did so and did received a full refund minus the shipping fee.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to say whether it will reduce fine lines, so the jury is still out for now.</li>
            <li>My experience so far has been positive, the cream has a very faint and pleasant smell as well as it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Maybe good if you have super dry skin, and a little goes a long way, but definitely NOT for me!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I just want people to know about this unbelievable product, especially those who are very self-conscious about their dark circles, so that they can be as happy with it as I am.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I just want people to know about this unbelievable product, especially those who are very self-conscious about their dark circles, so that they can be as happy with it as I am.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long will take to get rid off them, but I am on the right way.</li>
            <li>However, this doesn&#x27;t really absorb fast and so skin does stay moist for a long time.</li>
            <li>I dap the upper lid with a tissue to remove most of the product, but under my eye I dab the skin with clean fingers so that a thin layer will remain.</li>
            <li>I just wipe them off on a towel, but they are everywhere, so it&#x27;s easy to still have a few end up on my skin/hair/eyes.</li>
            <li>Dark circles are caused by many different factors (hereditary, diet/exercise, lack of sleep, hyperpigmentation, loss of collagen/indentation, leaky blood vessels, etc.)</li>
            <li>So far i have used it about three days now and from the moment i first put it on hours later</li>
            <li>This eye cream was just what I was looking for; an all natural toxic free cream with vitamin K for dark circle reduction</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different product for dark circle and none compare to this all natural product it not only removed the darkness underneath my lovely eyes but left them delicate and smooth</li>
            <li>I have already noticed an improvement in my fine lines &amp; wrinkles as well as my dark circles!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to remove dark circles and the seller ships quickly</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t look old when I am old!</li>
            <li>My dark circles were reduced significantly, and my peers even noticed it.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to use for the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed significant improvement in my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I am young and do not currently use this cream for wrinkles or dark circles, but I love it as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping to have finally found a product that would diminish my dark circles, I was very excited after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Use it at night and have noticed a significant improvement in dark circles and wrinkles disappearing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for dark circles, and I haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement yet.</li>
            <li>It was super heavy on my face and very oily.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I first tried it because it was more balmy than creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to work.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the fine lines under my eyes or the slight pigmentation (very minor &amp;#34;dark circles&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>and now I have SOFT, YOUNG and CLEAR FACE SKIN!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this product really provides the moisture that I need, and I really like the fact that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, white, normal to dry and live in Denver, Colorado, which also make my skin more dry.</li>
            <li>I received a little coupon that said I could get a free one</li>
            <li>I will use up my little jar and report back if my eyes look better after a stretch of continuous use.</li>
            <li>It works if you use it twice a day, the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it can be a little bit more greasy than lotion, almost like Vaseline.</li>
            <li>it has more like a really hard lip balm consistency.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This does gives a little shine underneath the eyes that goes away after few minutes, also, it does not crape the under eye layer as is common with many good eye cremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this I am 51 and 2  years ago had pnemonia that left me with very dark circles.</li>
            <li>I bought this July 31 (today is November 12), have been using it consistently, still have a little of the product left in the bottom of the little jar, and will most definitely purchase this again because it works quickly and beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really self conscious about it, so I try to hide it as much as possible.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and skin and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate them, it is gentle enough.</li>
            <li>which makes me question if it&#x27;s really doing something to improve my skin- as so far the results seem to only be temporary.</li>
            <li>is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li>I really like how the product is all natural and will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li>It helped to clear up my eyes and keep them that way.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  </li>
            <li>It also helps to keep under my eyes feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural eye cream since I do not like to use chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li>For a natural approach to skin care</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>still young and no wrinkles xD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised my acne</li>
            <li>But I thought it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this because 2 thigs its all natural and it works.</li>
            <li>My skin is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>I already ordered another jar and I&#x27;m not near finished with the first one.</li>
            <li>were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and feels natural.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and natural ingredients, but I think I will just use it as a lip balm if it continues show no results.</li>
            <li>not for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>but so far I can give you what I know.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>and sometime I use it for my lips because of the hydration and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If it works like this for me, it should work real miracles for younger women.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think anything out there works for dard circles for I have tried enough of them.  </li>
            <li>I thought it made sense even if I question the effectiveness of absorbing enough through my skin to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>The circles have lightened 50% so far.</li>
            <li>having a natural appearance has always been my desire.</li>
            <li>but I began my hopes of restoring my under eyes to their natural beauty.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>that is natural and would probably buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product works,as a healthcare professional, I am recommending it to my patients.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much so the jar will last awhile.</li>
            <li>I like that this is a completely natural product.</li>
            <li>but I am very hopeful that it will reduce if not eliminate them in the next couple of weeks/months.</li>
            <li>(I have combination/acne prone skin, 30 years old).  </li>
            <li>Its all natural</li>
            <li>I apply this product not only under my eyes but to my whole face.</li>
            <li>That is a perk of the Queen Bee, it is all natural and you don&#x27;t have to worry about what you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li>all natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to a lot of products</li>
            <li>So this is why I was so surprised that this cream affected me the way that it did.</li>
            <li>Very itchy, red, and it feels as though the skin under my eyes has gotten</li>
            <li>It took me around 3+ months to get rid of under-eye circles completely.</li>
            <li>It read 100% all natural, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>My face skin feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Natural Ingredients!&lt;br</li>
            <li>All natural and not oily.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I like is all natural however it did not help my eyes in any way</li>
            <li>Just get professional help and see a skin clinic or your dermatologist..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even remotely old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my thirties and so far seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>probably only noticeable to me--but definitely real.  </li>
            <li>So far I like the product.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for a month.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this eye cream because the area around my eyes is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>It’s made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Nothing has helped so far.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work because it contains only a few, and natural, ingredients.</li>
            <li>; look that really makes a big difference, I don&#x27;t think I can go without it now!</li>
            <li>I am 69 yrs old and have used lots of eye creams.  </li>
            <li>your eyes don&#x27;t have natural oil glands</li>
            <li>your eyes don&#x27;t have natural oil glands</li>
            <li>I  was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and helped clear up my under-eye circles after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the balm-y feel of it</li>
            <li>will bring me some surperise change in near furture.</li>
            <li>greasy, like you are wearing Vaseline, but it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>All natural is just a bonus.  </li>
            <li>I am afro american and very sceptic to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can also put it near my eyes</li>
            <li>I am already depressed and self conscious about it</li>
            <li>If it helps at all I am a 30 year old Tagalog Philippino non smoker.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something with natural ingredients and tried it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural to boot.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my skin, no redness, and definitely see results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>From here on in, I will stick to professional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this product has not been an issue with that thus far, it has offered relief.</li>
            <li>, it goes on like soft butter.</li>
            <li>Still, i like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like you need a lot of product</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have sensitive skin, and oily skin</li>
            <li>and I also use it for my lips because of the hydration and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>a young teenager&#x27;s acne infested face on my nose.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my in the skin area under my eyes at all after going through a complete bottle.</li>
            <li>Did not work for me, I have not seen any effect so far.  </li>
            <li>So far, I do not see any change.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and feels natural.  </li>
            <li>So far works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li>As for the second jar, went straight to the garbage.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, and the jar can last a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all natural ingredients as stated on the label which I appreciate</li>
            <li>I use it only at nights as it is very greasy and can not be used under make up.</li>
            <li>This product combined with drinking lots of water daily has made the blackness under my eyes appear much lighter.</li>
            <li>But in the morning, the skin around my eyes is soft, well hydrated, and not puffy.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only been using ita few days so far, a friend of my already commented on how much better the darker circles under my eyes look.  </li>
            <li>Not to the smell or to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was suppose to be all natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but for me this product is not up to par.</li>
            <li>It smelled old like it might be out of date.</li>
            <li>However, I do have to give it props for being all natural and organic</li>
            <li>like how natural it is.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something natural to use on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>and I read that you can use it 2 times per day for faster results, but I saw fast enough results with just using it one time a day.</li>
            <li>they still made me feel old.</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product under my eyes before bed for 2 weeks now and it seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to find something natural.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>The thing that got me to try this product was that there are no harsh chemicals just sitting on my skin from this product.</li>
            <li>After reading about the All Natural Queen Bee Eye Cream, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues, so that is another plus.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and softens the lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cream because all its ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>natural NO chemical</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really balmy.</li>
            <li>but I also use it on my cheeks over old acne scars.</li>
            <li>I must say my skin is sensitive, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Even hours after, my skin is still so soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Using it anywhere near your eyes in the day time will make your vision blurry.</li>
            <li>Makeups became common, but I was looking for a better solution.</li>
            <li>and my husband say I look young just like a Queen again.</li>
            <li>Everything in this cream is natural and proven to do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li>It last forever, and it really does moisturize your eyes at night.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and makes my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly three weeks.</li>
            <li>it works so far..</li>
            <li>all natural NO chemical and like it.&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pleased with the effectiveness, price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I like that it has natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised at the results so far.  </li>
            <li>It also makes the skin around my eyes silky soft which is another plus.  </li>
            <li>The product does not work very well, but moderate results can be seen after two months for myself.</li>
            <li>that I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it NATURAL</li>
            <li>w/ a natural product.</li>
            <li>I am 45 yrs old</li>
            <li>2nd, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really see a different....</li>
            <li>I think its much too pricey though and would recommend it only as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin feels &amp; looks softer and the product has never caused any skin reaction - a testament to its all natural composition.  </li>
            <li>and I like knowing that what I am putting on my skin is all naturally made.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>it leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for all natural under eye cream for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking radiant and soft.</li>
            <li>shipping with this company, and their product so far is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used so many eye creams before and found they actually irritate eyes and sensitivity making me look like i am crying.</li>
            <li>decided to use the cream once more a few weeks after and got the same reaction.</li>
            <li>The next morning the laugh line melts back into my skin and become unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle in a jar though, it will not completely erase dark circles for most people.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I was surprised by the waxy substance, but thought that I need to at least give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>The texture is very similar to Vaseline, and I put it on every night, hoping that the gross feeling was worth it since it was supposed to make the circles go away.  </li>
            <li>I have used expensive cosmetic counter eye creams and this is just as good as all of them.  </li>
            <li>I have no intentions of going back to my old creams that are full of chemicals and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Seeing all of the positive reviews I was very optimistic to finally find a product that could help alleviate the naturally dark circles under my eyes but this product has really neither helped nor hurt.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my nighttime routine, but in the morning I have to be careful to only put a very thin layer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also excellent for those who live in dry cold areas as it counteracts dryness but is manageable enough to wear under make up.</li>
            <li>understand what people mean about the out of the box consistency being kinda like candle wax, but that&#x27;s just the top layer.</li>
            <li>Since using this product for a little over a month the undereye bags have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li>It keeps my whole face to very smooth and manageable to repair the dead cells that makes it brighten from the dark skin.</li>
            <li>It is a bit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;, but here in dry, hot California</li>
            <li>I noticed it took the dark circles and puffiness away quickly.</li>
            <li>my jar is still over half full.</li>
            <li>so it will probably take at least  few more weeks or even a couple of months of consistent use of this cream to see real results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now, and I have definitely seen an improvement in the dark circles and fine lines under my eyes,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and I am very surprised that it has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>, I love that a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had little wrinkles, they went away pretty fast, my skin is so moisturized.</li>
            <li>I also applied some to my laugh line when I noticed that the other day.  </li>
            <li>I have to laugh when I read some of the other reviews-</li>
            <li>I have purchased many products that claim to alleviate dark circles and none worked as well as this product has in such a short time.  </li>
            <li>Even though your under-eye may look a little shiny for the first hour, it will not dry out like other eye creams, which makes our wrinkles more apparent .</li>
            <li>Sometimes a little red dot will appear under an eye, but it&#x27;s nothing much and is gone almost as quickly as it came, without leaving any mark.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes a little red dot will appear under an eye, but it&#x27;s nothing much and is gone almost as quickly as it came, without leaving any mark.  </li>
            <li>The natural formula helps because I have very sensitive skin and with many chemicals I get skin rashes, especially on the delicate skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>jar is a little smaller than I expected, but I still expect this to last me a while, and I think it is definitely worth the money if I continue to see this level of improvement, and hopefully more as time goes on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is working for my fine lines or winkles.</li>
            <li>My friends have mentioned how much younger and vibrant I look.</li>
            <li>Bees wax is just a selling point and only is used to keep the two main ingredients (olive oil and Shea butter) in a emollient form.</li>
            <li>I read some pretty outstanding reviews and decided to make the expensive plunge and purchase one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this pretty consistently, once a day (at night) for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li>I usually purchase a product from Origins for a lot more $$ with results not lasting all day.</li>
            <li>It really helps and the price is much less than many other products I&#x27;ve seen for the same issue.</li>
            <li>I guess I fell for the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t do enough research that this product has high clore clogging ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for daily use.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good moisturizer to apply at night, and after a few week my dark circles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>IT DID NOTHING SPECIAL AFTER MY PEDICURES; BUT I DID NOT WANT TO WASTE MONEY.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference so far only after a few days and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Thank you for using all natural ingredients in this all natural product for an woman who loves a natural facial appearance.</li>
            <li>There is still a light shade of darkness but it defiantly all small.</li>
            <li>Now that my under-eye area is free of dark circle, I can say that the product really helped and would recommend it to all those looking to fight against dark circles.</li>
            <li>but I have no dark circles now after using Queen bee for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>It took my eyes over a week to get back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products to reduce my dark circles, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I waited a few months to write my review because I wanted to see the full results.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the price was a little high</li>
            <li>It can be a tad oily but absorbs well, so I use it right before I go to sleep and wake up with soft skin around my eyes, no dry patches like I had with other products.</li>
            <li>Instead, I noticed that the few fine lines I have seem to double in number.  </li>
            <li>The weather has been so dry lately that my face was showing more wrinkles than normal.  </li>
            <li>However, after using it for less than a month, I can definitely see a significant improvement around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Being only 23 years old I was becoming very insecure of how my eyes looked and only felt secure with makeup on which I generally don&#x27;t like to wear as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In July I started using all organic products, never throwing out a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; product until I could see definite results from my new organic purchases.  </li>
            <li>So I came back to make a new order this time one for me and one for her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it at night and in the morning under my concealer and it works really well, the skin around my eyes feels softer and not so dry anymore</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product however because I like using it on the delicate under eye skin compared to regular lotion because it seems to provide more moisture.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning my under eyes were red, puffy, scaly, and itched so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m getting ready to order my second jar now (used faithfully, one jar will last me about 3 months).</li>
            <li>I have been using your all natural Queen Bee eye cream for only two days and have began to notice clear results.</li>
            <li>I actually use the back of my fingernail to stab at it a bit, to break it off the whole.</li>
            <li>When I first found out about Queen Bee Eye Cream, I was searching for an all natural cream to get rid of my dark circles and improve the skin under my eyes reversing the age.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft the next morning.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for the dark circles under my eyes, other than to make them super greasy.  </li>
            <li>I could hardly get anything off the top without digging my nail into it, and that wouldn&#x27;t really help much either because then I&#x27;d just be rubbing a hard clump of stuff around my face, but it would never rub in.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from major bags, from a number of things, from lack of sleep to allergies plus its hereditary .  </li>
            <li>After using Queen Bee for a week or two I saw major improvements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of expensive brand name eye creams but this $20 eye cream is a  magic!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what it feels like 2-3 weeks in, definitely recommend considering the price point and the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>The fact that it is 100% All-Natural, Organic and Contains NO cancer causing additives or preservatives is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything significant.</li>
            <li>- sometimes I will apply it first thing to my skin &amp; apply other products/moisturizers over it in the daytime.</li>
            <li>After applying this product under my eyes each night at bedtime for the last week or two, I have already noticed a significant improvement on the dark circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li>Ordered this product and within three days could see a major reduction in the darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My dark circles are fading away and my wrinkles are less notable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So be very careful, this stuff can be very harmful and there is no Manufacture Information on it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say whether or not my dark circles have faded or if my wrinkles have gotten better ( I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks)</li>
            <li>First, I was under the impression that creams made for specific purposes like removing the black area under the eyes, are like any other creams available in the market, they just assign each cream to a specific problems, but at the end they are all creams.</li>
            <li>I have spent much more for a similar product by dr haushka and this is comparable, us made and much less costly.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing in it other than these natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Like many other people, I have tried various products in an attempt to reduce my dark circles, however, none seemed to make a difference even after months of use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li>After finding this product online, I wanted to give it a try, and already now, in less than 3 months I am witnessing tremendous changes to the contrast under my eyes and skin overall.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any improvement, the cream is quite oily, I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if the effects take longer (I have quite dark circles) took two months of use</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has the patience to use Queen Bee daily or twice daily.</li>
            <li>I rotate a few high quality moisterizing items, this among, them and do not want to use this up too fast</li>
            <li>I am an African American women I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are no more with this stuff!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to positive results and trying other products of this brand.</li>
            <li>After reading other positive reviews I decided to give this balm a try.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my jar is bad lol</li>
            <li>There was a lot, so it should last for quite a long time, however, I just didn&#x27;t notice any real difference.</li>
            <li>I never had dark circles just a few more lines around my eyes than I wanted.</li>
            <li>I ordered the product to help my chronic dark circles but was surprised at how fast it rehydrated my skin.  </li>
            <li>these dark circles are no joke it could really take away from your natural beauty but with this product I see a difference</li>
            <li>a friend gave me this product as a gift &amp; it definitely changed the way I look at natural products..</li>
            <li>The circles are barely noticeable and the lines under my eyes are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li>It is very waxy which is expected since an ingredient is beeswax.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the All Natural Queen Bee eye cream to a friend.</li>
            <li>and Im surprised because my blemishes looks smaller too.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re dealing with dark eye circles, it&#x27;s absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li>Within two days of using Queen Bee the age-related dark circles under my eyes looked better than they had since their on-set, better than they had with using the dirty products, which I had to use daily in order to keep the minimum results.  </li>
            <li>It has very simple ingredients and is all natural.</li>
            <li>The first time i put it on under my eyes (to get rid of dark circles)</li>
            <li>Vitamin K can only go so far.</li>
            <li>I want to go out bare face</li>
            <li>but I can barely see any difference.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any dark eye circle cream</li>
            <li>WOW, only a week&#x27;s use</li>
            <li>But this stuff had basic and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>At 69 years old, all of a sudden</li>
            <li>I was barely scratching my nose anymore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 28 year old male by the way to.</li>
            <li>I was initially concerned it might cause acne breakouts, but it hasn&#x27;t so far.</li>
            <li>but thank god for this product that helps get rid of the dark circles at first when I got this product</li>
            <li>and there actually almost faded away completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy, and it makes my face look wet for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>The product is all natural, so that&#x27;s something definitely to keep in mind.</li>
            <li>It has all natural  ingredients such as Shea Butter, Olive oil, Coconut oil, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then I got a sample of a different brand with wild yam, arnica, and hydroxyproline in it.  </li>
            <li>does not do as advertised, so far, and it has been used for several weeks.</li>
            <li>I use it on my entire face, it leave you skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Be careful, the ingredients are very pore clogging and can give pimples and milia.  </li>
            <li>, the texture is soft and creamy at the same time.</li>
            <li>When I am looking in the mirror in a well-lit room, the improvements seem to be there, but just barely.</li>
            <li>I started applying it 2-3 weeks back so its too early to say anything.</li>
            <li>I used the product for one week hoping it was something that might be worth using to treat the dark circles under my eyes and help with the puffiness, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>:) I recommend it to anymore with dark circles and fluffy eyes.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was skeptical from the start putting forth the $$ once again for another product I didn&#x27;t figure would work..</li>
            <li>However, I figured I&#x27;d try it because so many people found it helpful and because I was so tired of looking like I was pulling all-nighters</li>
            <li>I’ve had a problem with dark puffy circles under my eyes for many years, which made me look old and tired no matter how much sleep I got.  </li>
            <li>The cream had lots of tiny hard balls in it and these balls didn&#x27;t melt easily when put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I am not certain that the dark circles have decreased in intensity but it definitely keeps the area well-moisturized and concealer is easy to apply on top.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you put on a very small amount, it might be fine.</li>
            <li>Other eye creams left me with a burning sensation but Queen Bee is natural and gentle on the skin and has helped reduce redness.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles and very fine wrinkles under my eyes because of my pale skin and working 12 hour shifts in the hospital; this started working wonders in just 3 days!</li>
            <li>First of all, the texture is not very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>If you use it just for around eyes it would last for a long time, because the quantity is relative large for eye cream.</li>
            <li>It has a greasy texture and actually seemed to make my dark circles a little more noticable the day after I used it</li>
            <li>I almost sold out to write a glowing review for my free jar with purchase...but the only reason I would want the free jar is to make up for the amount of money I spent on a useless product.</li>
            <li>It shipped out fast and got here on the earliest day expected!</li>
            <li>The other thing I would like to point out is when you put it on it makes your skin look very shiny.</li>
            <li>I tried 3 other products before this and they did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Per reading other reviews I used it on my whole face not just my eyes.</li>
            <li>May I recommend: get a little extra sleep at night, laugh a lot, don&#x27;t smoke,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Albeit a few days, I did notice my dark circles lighten up a bit, and I shall continue using it! :)</li>
            <li>I no longer have red puffy skin and no dark circles.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I realized long ago that spending so much money on eye creams that didn&#x27;t really do anything was ridiculous, and I didn&#x27;t try another till a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it has actually lightened a facial scar, and makes my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I think it is completely overpriced for such a tiny jar with a label that looks like someone made on their home printer.</li>
            <li>As it contains all natural ingredients, I have used it not only for eyes but also for my entire face at night.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars for it working so well for my lips, for having such simple natural ingrediants and keeping moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li>Now, and since this is a product review, i would have to state &amp;#34;Queen Beez&#x27;, is the only product i&#x27;ve used so far, that does not contain caffeine (which would actually aggravate a sinus infection) that works!</li>
            <li>I occasionally get a rough spot under an eye or on my face which this cream really helps to soften and in time remove.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for the past 3 weeks and most of the dark circle is gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve inherited that lovely feature especially when tired.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love all of the natural ingredients, I don&#x27;t feel guilty using it because I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s helping dark circles yet, but usually nothing works on those, so even if it helps a little I&#x27;ll be happy!</li>
            <li>I had large bags and dark circles under my eyes as a result of hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li>it is a little greasy when you first apply it</li>
            <li>With Queen Bee, I started seeing some results almost immediately and major improvements after only 3 days!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised about the note from the seller asking me to write a review in order to get a jar free, usually this is not a good sign; but I have to say I am pretty please with the product.</li>
            <li>but I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again after I finish it because there are moisturizers out there that work fine for less than half the price of this.</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend this under eye cream to be used everyday to remove dark circles.</li>
            <li>I unfortunately have had dark circles my whole life and have tried pretty much every high priced cream as well as just almond oil (also works well).</li>
            <li>I am very pale so my dark circles are more from that than from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>I am still using the product, but can&#x27;t really tell any difference in my dark under-eye circles or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for dark circles and wrinkles and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any differences, but I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>But I have been using it for 4 days and it the dark circles are really fading.</li>
            <li>I had dark circles under my eyes that cover the whole underpart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from dark circles my whole life</li>
            <li>my husband really loves this for his dark circles</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that had vitamin K in it because I was told that really helps with fixing dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Aaaand, it really does decrease the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on reducing dark circles, but I really hope it does.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed any change w/ the dark rings under my eyes, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have dark circles, (yet)</li>
            <li>It has seemed to help with my dark circles some but not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>so I think it really depends what is causing the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in my dark eye shadows</li>
            <li>I do what I can, but the dark circles under my eyes continued to be a real challenge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really want to thank the creators, because this product has helped me to decrease the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really believe in the natural ingredients used and I will continue to use it for the next few months and buy another jar.</li>
            <li>The dark circles have improved too, just not as much as the rosacea has improved.  </li>
            <li>I really need something to help with my hereditary dark circles.</li>
            <li>I have hederitary dark circles and I have tried everything to get rid of them but nothing really seemed to work.</li>
            <li>Truth be told it does absolutely nothing for the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>A1 Cream smells like shea butter goes on smooth only need a VERY small amout Must have</li>
            <li>This only helps to moisturize the area around your eyes, but other than that, it doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered my first jar a few months ago.</li>
            <li>My eyes made me look deprived of life, sad or depressed and they are nearly gone now, I feel so much better about my self and my face especially!!!</li>
            <li>Its is pretty heavy</li>
            <li>I had my doubts when I first opened the jar and saw how firm it was.</li>
            <li>A small amount was applied, but never seemed to be absorbed by the skin - face looked greasy, fell greasy, rubbed off on pillow.  </li>
            <li>I live in Northern Colorado and the air is very dry.  </li>
            <li>my dark circles seem a little less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for creating a product that I feel safe using since I know it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>next morning my circles look lighter but after a few hours they come right back.</li>
            <li>Since I was little I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about my huge dark circles.</li>
            <li>100% All Natural, organic under eye cream with few hundred high</li>
            <li>This is more like a petroleum based product than a cream, but the next morning when I awaken after using Queen Bee, my wrinkles are noticably less, my skin is soft and moisturized and I never thought I would say that my dark circles seem less pronounced.  </li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin that when I wear other face creams near my eyes, I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off and throw the product in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>(I apply it all over around the eye), keeps wrinkles around eye kinda relaxed &amp; smoothed for a few hours before it fully absorbed into the skin, after that you&#x27;d need to apply again (I would say at least twice a day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely more PM cream because it&#x27;s oily, but I apply just a little bit under my regular eye cream before I leave home too</li>
            <li>I am a family practice physician and very careful when it comes to advising my patients about any particular product.  </li>
            <li>This product within a reasonable amount of time (2 and a half weeks as I&#x27;m writing this) takes care of that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Others are also likely to respond differently to it and may or may not see more dramatic results than I did.</li>
            <li>Then leave the skin damp after gently washing the soap off, so less amount of bee-wax I apply on the face could spread throughout.</li>
            <li>The color of the under eye area is much lighter compared to what i had previously.</li>
            <li>I keep it on hand for the dry MN winters, but I only use it sparingly when my skin feels really dry since it&#x27;s just too heavy/greasy for me to use very often.</li>
            <li>I noticed my wrinkles were less noticeable, but the real difference was how moist my skinned stayed.  </li>
            <li>It is greasy but soaks into to dry skin leaving it soft with a sheen.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it can be dry.</li>
            <li>As a blonde, I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life and now they truly are much lighter.  </li>
            <li>This is third day aim using i really got hope that it reduce my dark circle and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to keep using this, but so far from what i&#x27;ve seen, if you want a day to day eye cream that will help your circles each time you use it- instead of concealer, this is for you, but don&#x27;t buy it expecting long lasting results-</li>
            <li>It works okay at removing dark circles, at least somewhat.</li>
            <li>not fan , its super thick and has done nothing for my eyes .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my dark circles are the result of very thin skin--my eyes aren&#x27;t sunken, but the skin under my eyes has always been recessed, a definite line between it and the skin over my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li>When you open the jar, the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is actually solid, which is a little disconcerting at first.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little bit, so it will last a long time, and it is definitely helping my fine lines and dry patches!</li>
            <li>At first, it was little difficult to use this cream since it didnt look like a regular eye cream -- it was more like a vaseline.</li>
            <li>using this Queen Bee 100% All-Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream for (3) nights, I am seeing really progress and the black area is starting to to go away.</li>
            <li>do I use it: I gently apply African Black Soap on my face.</li>
            <li>It does a good job moisturizing, but it is so greasy that I would rather use a much less expensive moisturizing cream instead.</li>
            <li>This product was very hard and wouldnt smooth onto my face.</li>
            <li>(I certainly wouldn&#x27;t turn it down at this point!)</li>
            <li>I have under eye discoloration under my right eye due to hereditary and constant rubbing due to allergies.</li>
            <li>It can stay a little on the greasy side of you apply too much</li>
            <li>Also, it makes your face really oily if you don&#x27;t wipe a little off with a paper tower or something.</li>
            <li>Tried a few other creams and they were successful in irritating my skin and making me breakout.</li>
            <li>I believe it will help with the fine lines, but not totally sure about the dark circles.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it did anything for my dark circles, but it did help with the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>fine lines that are only getting worse</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for dark circles.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends who suffer from dark circles.</li>
            <li>The circles are now less dark and less prominent.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I had a skin irritation, especially pimples, I also applied a little bit on the skin and found it very helpful with that area.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my hands and other skin areas that are super dry due to the winter weather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few very high end creams that cost three to four times this price.  </li>
            <li>Very little change in dark circle or lines but definitely smooth out the skin.</li>
            <li>Am a little skeptical about the very positive reviews, as a card was included with the shipment offering free product for a comment on Amazon.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING as an after shave too!</li>
            <li> and this is amazing on my eyes!</li>

            <li> Love it the best!</li>
            <li> This cream smells really good and works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff honestly took 5 years off of my face in a matter of weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been the kind of person who cares about what type of ingredients that  are in the products I use!  </li>
            <li> Great price too, which is a good thing : to me cosmetics</li>
            <li> and I can gladly say it was a very great investment!</li>

            <li> am loving it!</li>
            <li> I also love the way you aren&#x27;t able to scentse it when you put it on!!!!</li>
            <li> also it&#x27;s not just good for under the eyes, its a great face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> #34;We want your honest opinion!</li>
            <li> I kept giving it more time in hopes that I would see the wonderful results that everyone else had, but no luck.</li>
            <li> I liked it!</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is more greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin, so at night is perfect!</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t like it, I won&#x27;t use it - and no matter how effective something is, it doesn&#x27;t work unless you use it!  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing most all were excellent regarding this product.  </li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews about it, I decided to give it a try!!!!</li>

            <li> This wonderful cream has cleared up the peeling very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I hoped for the best, but I guess I am super allergic to something in this, I am guessing it is the FRAGRANCE they put in!</li>
            <li> Plus my skin feels SO smooth and beautiful!!</li>
            <li> I am surpised and delighted.</li>

            <li> #34;that is some good stuff&amp;#34; it&#x27;s making the darkness gradually lighter.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too rich for me to use during the day under make-up, but it&#x27;s the perfect night cream.</li>

            <li> and I absolutely love the sweet vanilla scent it has, it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if they clarify this - if the product is made of organic ingredients, you should specify, and if it is not, remove this from the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells really lovely!</li>
            <li> cream has a very nice texture and applies easily, it also doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes at all</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not at all exaggerating when I say that THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> It seems that if you give this item a great rating, they will send another jar free.</li>
            <li> I have to say - the results are amazing.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing .....</li>
            <li> They get you to GIVE THEM A GREAT  REVIEW by BRIBING you with a FREE BOTTLE of this CANDLE WAX type of I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that once you put it on, you won&#x27;t feel it</li>
            <li> the vanilla smells nice</li>
            <li> It was kind of sticky and felt like something that you might use on a scab to help it heal, but definately not something I would want on my face...</li>
            <li> Feels nice though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a good day time eye cream, but love this for evening.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it on my lips and hands also and it is nice for that.</li>
            <li> Honestly though, this is just made of a bunch of stuff from the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Packaging was effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it didn&#x27;t perform as advertised for me, but the product smells and feels nice, and has an unobjectionable ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me and my concealer still goes nicely over it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the fact of Queen Bee being 100% All-Natural</li>
            <li> It feels nice and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> I read so many good things about this product that I decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months  2 times a day and honestly hasn&#x27;t done anything.</li>
            <li> so I could share my honest experience.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I bought it for the quality of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is a salve instead of a cream, but your warm finger melts it before application.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mix of beeswax,olive oil, Shea butter, and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed nice improvements in my skins texture and color around my eye area.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It is a nice moisturizer ...</li>
            <li> Smells really good too :-).</li>
            <li> It does smell nice and it probably helps with under eye wrinkles, so I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> Honestly I have been using the product for two weeks now</li>
            <li> Nice moisture...</li>
            <li> It smells nice  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of Vaseline like too</li>
            <li> Anyways, its effective and</li>
            <li> I use it at night instead of during the day, though, since it is kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li> I like this product - it has a nice smell, all organic, and it has vitamin K.</li>
            <li> Texture is almost like chapstick that softens or melts when it comes in contact with warm skin.  </li>
            <li> but it melts readily on warm skin.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, I would reorder this product again</li>
            <li> I read all the wonderful reviews, so I am very hopeful and optimistic.</li>
            <li> In the morning the results are astounding-</li>
            <li> The cream is a nice moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> but it melts when it is on your warm skin.</li>
            <li> The reason this has so many good reviews?</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the best part is that it really HAS diminished the circles.</li>
            <li> And especially love the fact that when it says &amp;#34; all natural&amp;#34; - it really is</li>
            <li> This product feels nice on the skin and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, my skin looks better and more in tone and firmness.</li>
            <li> I find it too greasy feeling to use during the day under makeup, but I&#x27;m loving it as a night cream.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I see it working.</li>
            <li> If you want to spend money on a petroleum jelly kind of cream which you can get for a dollar else where then buy it..</li>
            <li> I have to be honest.  </li>
            <li> this is some good stuff, I am quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Age was catching on me</li>
            <li> I have see so many good comments about this product and that what make me wanted to buy the product.</li>
            <li> Dear company appreciated for the great product that you sell!</li>
            <li> In their defense they state &#x27;honest&#x27; feedback...</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the product is a nice moisturizer but that is it.  </li>
            <li> love this product.......love the fact that i can feel good about putting this on my face  ....</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> but to me is ok, good in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I think you must have to put in a warm oven before each use?  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much to the Queen Bee team ,and for this great creation!</li>
            <li> It feels so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice, a light vanilla scent and it does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised, nice size, smells good and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They basically build up a list of good reviews with the promise of free jars, then get more orders because people see the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye products and this one I have been very pleased with results.  </li>
            <li> Then I saw that so many people were questioning the reviews based on customers receiving a free jar for giving a great review.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love how it&#x27;s a good size</li>
            <li> When applied to your skin, it warms up and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li> Love, love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and plan to buy more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! :)</li>
            <li> Happy to do it, and excited about getting a free jar, so now I will have one in my dressing table and one in my travel-bag!  </li>
            <li> Because Queen Bee eye cream is like wax, it does a very good job of keeping the moisture in for a much longer time.  </li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and applies very easily, I even use it as a lip balm!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best natural eye creams I have used.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t understand what was happening until I did my own research and found many people complaining about irritated lips and skin after using products containing beeswax.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fade creams this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s amazing this product change my under eye earia 80% better</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like magic to under eyes and also the face its like its own vegetable bath for your face</li>
            <li> So far I am very impressed!  </li>
            <li> I think people write a good review just to get the Free cream.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this product and I am very happy that its all natural.</li>
            <li> The cream smells amazing and feels fantastic on the skin!</li>
            <li> I look myself in the mirror with a bright light like a thousand times</li>
            <li> but honestly they look much better than when I wasn&#x27;t using this product</li>
            <li> Thank You All Natural for a great product!</li>
            <li> This product was perfect because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> the best part is it is all natural, no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Queen Bee product because it&#x27;s all natural and has excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> So I am always in the market for something that helps and so far this has been the best!</li>
            <li> It gives a nice cooling sensation that I really enjoy!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing i love it.....</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> There also appears to have been a scam involved in the reviews, with the company offering an additional free jar of the product to reviewers who gave good ratings.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it contains all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> my first time to use it, good smell and good quality...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about dark circles - I had already taken care of that with 5000 units per day of vitamin D - but it is an awesome moisturizer that keeps my eye area looking great all day.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product - it goes on smooth and the scent is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Great product, start working right away for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> This product smells very good, much like vanilla and almond which I love.  </li>
            <li> Awesome alternative to expensive beauty products and gives great results of healthy skin, no wrinkles, and a bright complexion!</li>
            <li> have to say that I have never been so impressed with a product as I am with this one, it is natural, which I love.</li>
            <li> natural ingredients can&#x27;t ask for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a Great product Queen Bee !!!!</li>
            <li> I can finally enjoy myself again and all thanks to my husband and this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this cream and it&#x27;s excellent for sensitive eyes like mine.</li>
            <li> I am still using my first jar,and I am very pleased with it!.</li>
            <li> This product is good to keep moist under your eyes; specially during winter...</li>
            <li> Well, need to go now, but I hope people are aware of the fact the someone suffered a great deal of allergy from using this product.</li>
            <li> I have no traces of fine lines anymore!</li>
            <li> Work fine in the skin, love it!</li>
            <li> The cream applied very lightly and is not too overbearing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky, nor greasy and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It does sort of feel like having a very light petroleum jelly on the face</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but this eye cream feels very good under the eye.</li>
            <li> Bee&#x27;s is an amazing moisturizer and helped to lighten the darkness very quickly.</li>
            <li> It’s got a nice texture and has been easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> It is greasy and goes on easily and soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li> I love the smell; it has a very light touch of vanilla.</li>
            <li> Also, the product is made of natural products, which is very good.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is a very good product and reminded me of our old heritage of using bee wax during winters in Northern India.</li>
            <li> , then i tried the very efficient Palmer&#x27;s Line Smoothing Creme (very good and cheap hydrator).</li>
            <li> and I notice a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I bought it like two weeks ago, HUGE change!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for eyes and facial skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing Queen Bee 100% All-Natural cream and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> , it feels oily when you use it, but when it is absorbed, it feels good.</li>
            <li> I was weighing up whether to purchase this product or an alternative, but I&#x27;m really pleased that I chose this one.</li>
            <li> They were thicker and more noticeable, but after using this cream for about 2 months I am noticing that my wrinkles have thinned and aren’t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> One thing I love about this organic under eye cream is that it does not irritate my eyes or skin.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is more of a waxy substance, I was expecting a sort of cream.  </li>
            <li> It turns out that I am one of many individuals allergic to beeswax.  </li>
            <li> getting better everyday.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> I love this skin balm...</li>
            <li> I have bought it twice now and will be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Seeing some improvement and will post more as time progresses ahead.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by its cheap appearance!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be used for more than just under the eyes.</li>
            <li> and it makes them feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> and i love that I know exectly what</li>
            <li> so I use it mostly at night.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work</li>
            <li> Queen Bee will make you feel like a queen for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it just gets better with continued use.</li>
            <li> For me it attracted pet hair and lint on my face more when I sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> In some ways, this was ok.</li>
            <li> it is not a cream, more like wax or Vaseline.</li>
            <li> and I tried many face creams to get rid of from them</li>
            <li> Works great.i l love it</li>
            <li> When i saw the dryness increasing around my eyes, i tried using a bit more, but the skin wouldn&#x27;t absorb at all.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work they did say u could get 2 free jars with ur honest opinion, so there you have it ..,</li>
            <li> and im starting to see the difference, great product!</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I love it, will probably buy again to ensure that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Tonight I plan to apply to most of my face.</li>
            <li> Although I think to get a better result I need to use it more.</li>
            <li> Every eye product I&#x27;ve used always seemed to be a burden to use and not something I enjoyed putting on my face.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product and its so enjoyable to use unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> It has worked in replacement of many creams and moisturizers I used to use.  </li>
            <li> can tell that my eyes soak in the cream through the night, a time when my skin probably dehydrates most.  </li>
            <li> Ok so i have to admitt after a week of using it</li>
            <li> Hopefully as time goes by, I&#x27;ll see more of a change.</li>
            <li> For price and profile ratings you can not do better</li>
            <li> I applied morning and night and found the texture to be more than bearable.  </li>
            <li> I would have a more hydrated softer areas...</li>
            <li> Thanks for this great product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> i think you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your invitation to receive a free jar of this product just for sharing my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I wake up looking more refreshed and awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its more like a balm</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it some more.</li>
            <li> scrape a nice chunk with the fingernail of my ring finger and then rub it between my ring fingers and lightly dab it on.</li>
            <li> so pleased I bought this item, the best thing I have ever bought have been using this now for only just over 1 week</li>
            <li> recommend this to all my friends &amp; will be buying more products in this range</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has many benefits.</li>
            <li> but i was hoping for better results after reading the ratings.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m often allergic to many kinds of eye cream including Lancome.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, it is more like a salve, which I love.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this cream.  </li>
            <li> and the effect is getting better and better.</li>
            <li> And I Would love to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and love that I do not wake up with dry-feeling skin.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because the ingredients used are a lot safer than those in many products on the market today.</li>
            <li> This is a truly wonderful product that actually retains moisture through the night.</li>
            <li> As I stated above, it works perfectly, and I will order it again and again.  </li>
            <li> I actually love the buttery consistency of it.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel lovely.</li>
            <li> I use it every day more than one a day</li>
            <li> My eyes feels a lot better.  </li>
            <li> My eyes feel and look 100% better than before.  </li>
            <li> My eye area looks so healthy,  </li>
            <li> And, as a bonus, you receive a free jar if you give it a review!</li>
            <li> The product is safe to use.  </li>
            <li> He got so many reviews by cheating his customers.</li>
            <li> My eyes have never looked better....</li>
            <li> and I have to say that coupled with more sleep and more water</li>
            <li> I also love how this stuff is organic and all-natural.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my wrinkles and where I want to make sure I won&#x27;t have wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> wrinkles are and boy this one worked for me love it</li>
            <li> There are better moisturizer products.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve applied many things</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Queen Bee</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I put it on at bedtime and when I wake up the skin under my eyes looks more refreshed.</li>
            <li> also I love the name .</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li> In fact, it made my eyes look more wrinkly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it would work better</li>
            <li> it helps moisturize my face but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li> it turned out to be an ok product.</li>
            <li> My sleep schedule doesn&#x27;t help at all with my eyes looking healthy either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, I woke up, and my eyes look better than they have since I was probably 20 or perhaps even in my teens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so pleased that I know look my age or</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li> perhaps it takes a bit more to help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to shut up about this cream since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s magic, people.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to shut up about this cream since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s magic, people.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks before I saw a change, but it seems to have gotten even better over time.</li>
            <li> However, I know there are many factors that contribute to this problem to many people: amount of sleep, a healthy diet, vitamin suplement, or allegies would affect that area.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll see if it continues to get better.</li>
            <li> would give it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me.  :)</li>
            <li> Will use one more jar.</li>
            <li> It may need more Vitamin K.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so oily that it just sits on top of the occular skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I plan to explore more of your products.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> most  esp.</li>
            <li> Ok as my header says.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I finished nursing school, I&#x27;ve tried to pay more attention to everything as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li> you gotta kinda break through the top layer and move it around.</li>
            <li> (I apply about a pee size under each eye and any excess I put on the top of my eye lid and any more excess I apply to my forehead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> gotta kinda break through the top layer and move it around.</li>
            <li> (I apply about a pee size under each eye and any excess I put on the top of my eye lid and any more excess I apply to my forehead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> If you wear contacts be sure to remove before use if you get them in the eye</li>
            <li> Feels more like wax.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this eye cream ever since.</li>
            <li> Also, like most products, it migrated into my eyes and irritated them.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to see more results in time.</li>
            <li> Has also made my skin more pliable and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> when really I was getting great sleep (undereye bags).</li>
            <li> bed - make sure you use it every day.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day with a more generous application at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my eye cream</li>
            <li> You would be better off with Crisco cooking oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting it again :D</li>
            <li> Maybe they shall put more protection for delivery.</li>
            <li> and i simply love it</li>
            <li> Hesitant, I looked through many reviews before buying this product.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping the lines beside my eyes, but I&#x27;m confident that with time those will fade as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> When I did my research for the best product I kept coming back to Queen Bee.  </li>
            <li> Love how this feels.  </li>
            <li> Will buy it again for sure</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I decided to do some research on Amazon and to my amazement, was able to find Queen Bee Under Eye Cream which was 100% organic.</li>
            <li> but more of a balm).</li>
            <li> If this product works I am defiantly ordering more.</li>
            <li> Nice, light scent.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Its actually more of an oily wax consistency rather than a face cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works much better for the night,helping the skin to revive  :)</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> It has beeswax and coconut oil in it, which are both lovely</li>
            <li> is dryness because this is mostly Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> wait to see more results</li>
            <li> Most of them were OK, but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li> However, I LOVE Queen Bee.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that had something to do with it.  </li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done khiels, Lancôme, dermologica, cerve, and many more.</li>
            <li> and I plan on finding them instead of purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> But it was ok.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> But I swirled my finger on top and it melted at body temperature</li>
            <li> To this day, I receive compliments on how youthful I look and of how baby smooth my face is!</li>
            <li> , I am looking forward to more postive results, thank you.</li>
            <li> Hopefully if you buy it, it will do more for you.</li>
            <li> My skin is so radiant, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> My complexion is so much better</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Queen Bee eye cream.  </li>
            <li> and this feels even better.</li>
            <li> But now my face is getting better even with this job.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things and most do not work</li>
            <li> This has way more beeswax content than it should have for an eye cream...</li>
            <li> you need to balance your skin and not add so many products that we cannot name</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Natural,  healthy and efficient!&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> And will work at night when your most relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure that this is for your night</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;which gave better results.</li>
            <li> I bought the Queen bee because I saw so many 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> this product smells and feels great, and really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> The smell is appealing as well.  </li>
            <li> My eyes look considerably better.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using it faithfully again for a longer period, I can tell even more so if I skip a night.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my eyes look and feel in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too many chemicals I guess.</li>
            <li> I LOVE QUEEN BEE</li>
            <li> , I made sure not to it get into my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a Vaseline based product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could gave it more than two stars.</li>
            <li> and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will surely look forward to buy another one.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product.</li>
            <li> As such it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> It sits on top of the skin and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> More for an overnight cream.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and glides on facial skin with no problem.</li>
            <li> This cream was able to help me get rid of them within a month of using.</li>
            <li> The product is more of a beeswax than a cream, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Will post an update after more time.</li>
            <li> I really love the fragrance, also.</li>
            <li> You have to understand it&#x27;s more of a wax feel instead of cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> The balm was more for soothing but that was all it did.</li>
            <li> I will continue using and promise to get back and let you know how is working, but I am sure it will do great!  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it worked for some people</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Well pleased at this time.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li> I have sooooooooooo many eye creams.  </li>
            <li> I love Queen Bee.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waxy/ oily but in a smooth way and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li> but i am sure i will see more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and am really pleased with the moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> and I will continue using it until I find something else that I like more :)</li>
            <li> Some people have commented on it feeling greasy, but you just have to make sure to rub it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> and I know my Mom was making sure</li>
            <li> This is surely a product that I would recommend, but just be patient and you will see results.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> description cannot capture how great this product really is.  </li>
            <li> review and get 2 more jar</li>
            <li> Cute jar though...</li>
            <li> After about 1 week of applying this cream once a day under my eyes, I can confidently say that this product works.</li>
            <li> It is definitely mostly shea butter though, you can spot the smell and  consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many jars already.</li>
            <li> What I love the most is the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> This is  nothing more than a skin soothing balm .</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this prouduct and the pacage i will buy it again and again .</li>
            <li> Got to love that.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I was looking for something to use for under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> i applied and it is fully safe for eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the product, and how it keeps your eye area moist all day all night.</li>
            <li> product will not fix it overnight, but if you are patient and you want a more permanent solution (provided you take care of your skin, of course) then I would recommend this</li>
            <li> I will continue to use :)</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream because I&#x27;m having an allergic reaction to most of my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I am able to keep my eye area soothed and moisturized without irritation.</li>
            <li> I love the outcome of my product Queen Bee</li>
            <li> I wonder how many of us overpaid the $22 for this eye cream because we saw the *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 1 month into using it, and I feel so much better about my eye</li>
            <li> many have found this product to be what they need, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be beneficial for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This cream is more of an ointment than a cream and has made no improvement in my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I will be buying again!! :)</li>
            <li> This product does even more than promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love love</li>
            <li> and I am really satisfied by the results.</li>
            <li> I will surely recommend people to use this all-natural product to fight aging signs.</li>
            <li> Anyways if you&#x27;re looking for a wrinkle cream look somewhere else :)</li>
            <li> love that eye cream ....</li>
            <li> However, after a month of use...skin does not appear to be better.</li>
            <li> and I love the feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a $47 jar of eye cream a couple weeks ago, and the more I use it, the dryer my skin gets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better at night.</li>
            <li> I am also enjoying putting it on my lips at night, too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a salve</li>
            <li> I would re come d this product and am sure to use it again.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel and look better.</li>
            <li> so glad i purchased this eye cream</li>
            <li> it does and am glad I choose it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that whether or not one is able to see any results also depends on the lighting.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I put it on before going to sleep, I feel I look better waking up.</li>
            <li> Needs more Vitamin K maybe?</li>
            <li> I love that it is all organic</li>
            <li> and I love ingredients.  </li>
            <li> So I believe a month from now, it&#x27;ll be even better.  </li>
            <li> in the beginning i wasn&#x27;t sure about it ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;i just love it ..</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wait to buy my second jar &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I thought that I was seeing an improvement after just 3 days, but I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li> Now, I am sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product, better to use at night because of its oily compound.</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have to sometimes use my finger nail to scrape it off to be able to apply.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me on top of that</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I got so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike most creams this has no chemicals</li>
            <li> its one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil by itself did more than this..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for eyelash growth.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it makes my under my eye feels and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> It soaks in fairly quickly, and I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, it is very moisturizing and it makes it super easy to put concealer on afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very rich.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to find Queen Bee organic eye cream.</li>
            <li> Decent product, but not overly great.</li>
            <li> she says Queen Bee works just as good or better and doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much!</li>
            <li> I like the silky texture of the cream, very easy and smooth to apply, leaving my skin looking dewy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend, and it is a great value.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, save your money and make your own.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for a great and natural product!!</li>
            <li> Love it , working great so far!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s my first time use this product, but I think It&#x27;s a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so beautiful and natural and smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it under my eyes and liked it and then started over full face.</li>
            <li> I was searching on Amazon for something with good reviews and not terribly expensive, and found this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On a side note, this stuff smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but it smells so good and feels so good that I am using it in way more places than planned.</li>
            <li> Smells good and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I use it all over the rest of my face too and it feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to have found this effective, affordable and all natural eye cream!</li>
            <li> Safe, pure and good.</li>
            <li> However it is a very good moisturizer that does seem to soften facial lines, and make skin appear a bit more youthful.</li>
            <li> I will be looking forward to seeing more benefits of this product and am happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li> I use it before bed and in the morning, it is easy to apply and seems to work okay when used with concealers.</li>
            <li> I use it before bed and in the morning, it is easy to apply and seems to work okay when used with concealers.</li>

            <li> I love that it is natural and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> I really love all natural ingredients and best of all, it really works!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and the consistency of the cream is pretty light and non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is even better for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and when I wake up, my eyes feel more alert and open and bright!</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s wonderful &amp; I will repurchase :)</li>
            <li> This product has been wonderful all my fine lines are nearly invisable and my skin is soft and very healthy.  </li>
            <li> it is a great natural eye cream, i even use it on my lips.</li>
            <li> While I enjoy the healthy glow that this product provides for my skin, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my under eye circles after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I am using this cream from one week now and can&#x27;t wait to see how better is gonna be, the skin around my eyes is so smooth</li>
            <li> But what it excels at is after showering lightly coat your legs and arms with this balm and you&#x27;ll love how your skin feels.  </li>
            <li> I guess since is a natural product it works great on skin.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working great</li>
            <li> All natural, great price.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered two more since the price is so cheap.</li>

            <li> So far I am terrifically happy with this product.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients that are great for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k., smells good and goes on pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly I feel it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> worked great so far.</li>
            <li> I figured wow, it must be great.</li>

            <li> I love the smell and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It worked so good on my eyes that I&#x27;ve decided to use it on my whole face.  </li>

            <li> I almost get kind of hungry right before bed, hee.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients with no chemicals is very nice to see.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see how much more progress I can make with this.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth your $$!:)</li>

            <li> it is a great product love it, smells nice &amp; gets rid of the dark under eye that haunts us when we look into the mirror in the morning</li>
            <li> and I often use it on other areas of my face and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It applies onto my face easily and has been making an improvement in the wrinkles that I have under my else.</li>
            <li> queen bee is easy to put on and has a creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I really like how it not messy or greasy like a lot of under eye/wrinkle products and smells wonderful!</li>

            <li> It also has a couple kinds of oils in it, so if you break out easily</li>
            <li> The cream goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other great reviews... love it!</li>
            <li> And yes, it does leave some oily residue on my pillow case in the morning, but I found that it washes out easily - with no pre-treating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easily resolved by microwaving for just 15 seconds to melt the oils and stirring.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Then easily found it.  </li>
            <li> milia don&#x27;t just disappear so easily.</li>
            <li> Great price, packaging, fast delivery, its all natural, paraben free, and an impressive all natural ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and has lightened the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure it would work after seeing so many positive reviews, but after receiving my package, I know why there are so many</li>
            <li> And if people can be allergic to beeswax (not an uncommon allergy apparently) or anything else contained in the product, the sellers should have a warning about this in their product description.  </li>
            <li> The pictures I saw looked exactly like the kind of redness and swelling that&#x27;s on my eyelids and beneath my eyes where the concealer was used.  </li>
            <li> awesome cream, seems to reduce dark spots under my eyes, does not smell......</li>
            <li> Some have mentioned that it&#x27;s more waxy than creamy, and that&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> Some have mentioned that it&#x27;s more waxy than creamy, and that&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> I keep getting this product too close to my eyes and end up kind of bloodshot and goopy in the morning, but that&#x27;s user error. ;)</li>
            <li> Yesterday I was skyping with my cousin and she also commented on how my dark circles &amp;#34;arent there anymore&amp;#34; :D .</li>
            <li> I am very happy for everyone that had such good results with Queen Bee, but I have had no result and wish I could have my $22.00 back.</li>
            <li> Bees wax has no other benefit but is a great way to sell a cheap product.  </li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion, and despite getting a full nights&#x27; sleep, I always have the shadows starting from the corner of my eye and fanning downwards.</li>
            <li> I realised the great reviews were due to the promise of a free jar if u drop a nice comment.</li>
            <li> The small jar lasted me more than 3-4 months, so the price is definitely great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now, and it does nothing for my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure any avid DIYer would easily be able to recreate it at home at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Doing makeup every day to hide those fine line and wrinkles was too taxing.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it helps with puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines around eyes are not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> it felt fine.</li>
            <li> My lips were fine.  </li>
            <li> and i can already tell a difference in my fine lines</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a reduction on puffiness, fine lines</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to hydrate my under eye area and to improve the appearance of  fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> have seen the fine lines under my eyes fade away.</li>
            <li> does work for fine lines and not so fines lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> It has helped to plump up the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes have started to look brighter, however I don&#x27;t see any changes in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any great reduction in dark circles, but to be honest, that&#x27;s a tall order for any product to fill</li>
            <li> It helps with my fine wrinkles and my skin feels soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fine lines are disappearing. .</li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles had started to make their presence felt on my face.</li>
            <li> I want to be truthful with my review and not writing something sweet because i get a free jar.</li>
            <li> I have fine lines around my eyes and have already seen a change in hydration while using this cream.  </li>
            <li> I can already see the hydration and softening of my fine lines under my eyes and forehead..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even get rid of wrinkles or fine lines..</li>
            <li> I quickly saw the stars and the many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> but it is super magical.</li>
            <li> A plus is that it has natural ingredients and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a month and my bag circles has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I am really liking this cream and would not hesitate to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I really  like this product and will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I need to exclaim how incredibly much Queen Bee Organic Under Eye Cream has done for my face (and my life) in the time I have been utilizing this magical product!</li>
            <li> Most will find it pleasant, but I am not a big fan of vanilla</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the seller was able to get the product to me rather quickly...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth and has also cleared up some fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> This tiny jar contains that and some great ingredients and has a pleasant vanilla odor and a soft, waxy feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I let it cool on its own in my cabinet and good as new, smooth as on the first day.</li>
            <li> Most creams make my foundation build up, or emphasize the fine lines in my skin making me even more self conscious, always having to look in the mirror and smooth out the makeup which..only irritates and dries my skin out even more.</li>
            <li> I had huge wrinkles there to the point that it was so bumpy you could feel it.</li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t huge.</li>
            <li> Already see a huge difference in just a week.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE improvement, but if I subtracted this product, I wouldn&#x27;t miss a beat.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been a huge help with wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the most powerful \\&quot;ant-wrinkle\\&quot; or \\&quot;under</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I started applying it lightly.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> It tends to be a bit greasy in the beginning but after a while after the skin has absorbed it, it becomes better.</li>
            <li> Keep my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> I slept with it on and in the morning my face feels smooth and my pores arnt clogged.</li>
            <li> Smells like smooth vanilla</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days, and now instead of applying concealer 5X, I&#x27;m happy to say that now I only apply it twice!!!</li>
            <li> I also put some under eye in morning under my concealer and this helped my eye makeup to apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Included in this order was a card from the company that said they will send to me a free jar of Queen Bee if I leave a review--</li>
            <li> The skin feels comfortable and that&#x27;s all I expect a skin product to have.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, this product has no annoying perfume scent.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that it is an organic product meaning you don’t get any harsh chemicals harming your skin.</li>
            <li> Although, patience is important.</li>
            <li> they give you a coupon for a free jar if you write a review for them.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so smooth.</li>
            <li> it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more soon because he is almost out, so worth thie price.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s primarily made up of.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon it accidentally and decided to order it on a whim (along with the fact that it had great reviews and was only $25).  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s more than worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s more than worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand the concerns about the promotion of this product by providing a free jar to people who write reviews.</li>
            <li> My free jar you are sending is going to my mother to try.  </li>
            <li> but it goes on really smooth</li>
            <li> I received this eye cream just a few days after I placed the order and this product is wonderful and</li>
            <li> Feels like oil which helps the skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> I had three people come up to me recently and tell me how great  and youthful the texture of my skin looked.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for the entire face as well as neck!</li>
            <li> I decided the truth was worth more.</li>
            <li> seller promises an additional free jar of eye cream if you give them feedback.</li>
            <li> They responded and said that once I posted a review on Amazon and they confirmed it, they would send a free jar.</li>
            <li> But it goes on surprisingly light, and to my delight works well under my make up.</li>
            <li> and we will send you a free one&amp;#34</li>
            <li> customers are just trying to get a free jar sent to them.</li>
            <li> I like how the texture is really light and smooth, and how gentile it is.</li>
            <li> , it was too waxy to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> hope others have more success.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my batch just isn&#x27;t effective or what, but it did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a great investment for facial product.</li>
            <li> They can keep the free one because I don&#x27;t even bother using this.  </li>
            <li> They tempt you with another jar for free if you write one.</li>
            <li> Time got away from me and before I realized it the opportunity has passed for me, so no, I did not get a free jar for my 5-star review.</li>
            <li> Instead, gently smooth it with your finger.</li>
            <li> I really wan to thank the creators of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Overall great product , a tad oily</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and not oily on face.</li>
            <li> I also got a insert with my Order telling me if I contacted the seller of this product, I would another free of charge, I thought.</li>
            <li> It goes in skin smoothly, does not leave sticky feeling and rejuvenate the skin layer.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> A FREE BOTTLE</li>
            <li> Well, I was really perplexed while reading through the reviews.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s chemical free.</li>
            <li> but i applied this on a very back burn and it healed my finger great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth and light weight.  </li>
            <li> No side effects, winkles gone, smooth skin</li>
            <li> It does moisturize and is a great product to alternate with your stronger eye creams.  </li>
            <li> well, I could say Fantastic to my skin</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth to apply on, leaves your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am very much pleased with the results, and knowing that my condition plagues others, I want to let prospective buyers it is worth a TRY.</li>
            <li> Free jar be damned.</li>
            <li> It does feel smooth and moisturizing, &amp; is loaded with oils with a light scent like cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I also received a card with the jar stating that I will receive another jar for free if I share my review.</li>
            <li> but I wonder why they would send a free product to someone who didn&#x27;t like the product.  </li>
            <li> It is just some cheap honey wax ingredients.</li>
            <li> I guess this product has been given 5 stars because some people on here got their cream for free.</li>
            <li> Queen Bee leaves my face and neck feeling smooth and moisturized and diminishing lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> and i use this only at night and have noticed great difference</li>
            <li> , I did NOT get a free product for a review.</li>
            <li> eye cream glides on so smoothly, hydrates well,</li>
            <li> After 1 week of use, and reading all the fabulous 5 star reviews, I felt duped.</li>
            <li> I apply it morning and night and wait about an hour before I put on my makeup, so it soaks in my skin and my makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Thank you for helping me to look as young as I feel in my 20&#x27;s :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and keep eyes hydrated.</li>
            <li> This all natural product is good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t over do the sun, eat sensible, de-stress and enjoy life and love for all they&#x27;re worth.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive fair skin</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 month, and the results are so far so good.</li>
            <li> the seller ask you to give you a good review within a week of purchse and it says that they will send you a second Queen bee as appreciation (I thought heck FREE YAY!)</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I try to research any natural products that are good to apply under eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a balmy texture, which I think is good for using before bed during the winter.  </li>
            <li> Super natural, and really effective!  </li>
            <li> I wish I could say I have had the great results most of the other reviews rave about...</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product !!!!</li>
            <li> product really works!!!</li>
            <li> The information page that was included with the product was very useful.</li>
            <li> The information page that was included with the product was very useful.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are getting  better, and my eyes are looking and feeling more moisturized which makes me happy because I have tried a lot of products without much success.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is super smooth and glides on around my eyes easily.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I forget to used it, but I have really been happy with the product, even if I don&#x27;t use it for the reason they mainly advertise it for.  </li>
            <li> Receive 1 free jar of the product you ordered just for sharing your experience.&amp;#34; I was excited to order because I don&#x27;t like concealer.</li>
            <li> It is great for wrinkle but don&#x27;t see my dark circles getting better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much all its good for.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled to find effective eye creams and would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the pleasant and LIGHT (as in totally not overpowering) is detectable when hugging people</li>
            <li> it just seems average to me, and any home soapmaker and lip balm maker can easily make this product on their own and probably better too!</li>
            <li> Plus i read that the company is rewarding positive reviewers with another free jar.</li>
            <li> It is great for evening use, but in the morning it takes too long for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> Product feels natural and has a very appealing smell.</li>
            <li> but I am pretty sure my under eye circles are already fading....</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be introduced to the queen bee cream.  </li>
            <li> I put a layer of moisturizing cream under my eyes first, and then apply the Queen Bee eye cream on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I may be imagining, but I feel a significant difference already.</li>
            <li> I was using All about Eyes Rich cream before this.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a significant improvement on my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> The darkness under my eyes had lightened up significantly.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell very comforting!</li>
            <li> My nose is just a blush color now, it doesn&#x27;t itch at all and for the first time in years I truly feel confident again.   </li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t so sure after I first put it on.</li>
            <li> I have not yet noticed a significant change.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know first time user, so can&#x27;t say about that for sure.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> It is so rich and I have watched as the lines I was getting on my neck have VANISHED.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I like using this cream at night as it seems to help rejuvenate my skin &amp; help reduce the appearance of under eye circles quite significantly.</li>
            <li> Originally I had written a rave review about this product.</li>
            <li> It gives me the fresh look in the morning!</li>
            <li> Organic, simple, effective ingredients - nothing more required to carry out a fantastic job hydrating as well as plumping the skin around the eyes</li>
            <li> Simple and effective!  </li>
            <li> I started using Queen Bee before I went to bed, and after a couple nights I saw a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines didn&#x27;t diminish after finishing the entire jar, but I did get some compliments that my skin looked good.</li>
            <li> The overwhelming positive response to this product made me feel safe in purchasing it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love the simple ingredients and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li> There was a point I&#x27;d find myself putting it on multiple times a day (more than I was brushing my own teeth)..</li>
            <li> kind of oily most likely not purchasing again if no improvement by the time I finish product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it was good enough to lie for a free jar.</li>
            <li> I apply under eyes  to clean face at night.  </li>
            <li> It will be great for my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin like mine</li>
            <li> the smell is fantastic and smells good enough to eat....</li>
            <li> Works great if your eyes are really really dry.</li>
            <li> This means there&#x27;s probably a bias toward more positive ratings --</li>
            <li> Why so many positive reviews?</li>
            <li> but I am positive that it will be better when I have used the eye cream for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I find that using the derma-e Vitamin E oil and putting a few drops of organic rosehip oil and lavender essential oil in it gives me the best results, smells amazing, and is extraordinarily affordable!</li>
            <li> : These people are amazingly polite, prompt  &amp; professional!  </li>
            <li> I am excited that I have found an effective product that is natural.  </li>
            <li> will certainly be buying her some more when she runs out</li>
            <li> When I opened it and felt its special smell immediately.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this.</li>
            <li> What I love the best is that my success was due to natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am seeing very good results, I will continue to use it everyday</li>
            <li> first impression was &amp;#34;wow, this smells really good.&amp;#34; And after checking out the ingredients I was thrilled to find that it was all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The great reviews on Amazon and a careful study of the ingredients lost led me to this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is so nice not to read a label full of chemicals and with Queen Bee its organic and 100% all natural.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of moisturizing and I just blot away any excess cream that does not absorb into the skin to prevent the shiny wet look.  </li>
            <li> this is great it worked instantly for me, from the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any amazing color or wrinkle reduction, but it works well as moisturizer for sensitive skin/eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks Queen Bee:)</li>
            <li> So, nice to have a product like this in the market and that too that&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
            <li> It contains natural ingredients, smells nice, and is very...moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> just started to try it out, so i cannot give a full review.</li>
            <li> At least they be happy wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I ordered Queen Bee because I liked the fact that it is 100% natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Queen Bee all natural organic under eye cream for about a month and have found it it be effective at reducing the apearance of circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and effective.</li>
            <li> smells nice and makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to many things and have not had an rashes or breakouts from this product.</li>
            <li> Not only is it good for under your eyes, you can use all over your face.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a cream, more of a pasty oil?</li>
            <li> well, especially if you have a good skin care routine.</li>
            <li> well, especially if you have a good skin care routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product and it&#x27;s smells nice.</li>
            <li> Fairly inexpensive too if compared to similar items on the market.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost still full.</li>
            <li> i love it my undereyes has really change</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> I can definitely already start see good results.  </li>
            <li> its really good moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;forehead, under eye,&lt;br /&gt;I feel different after 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> I loved that Queen Bee isn’t only utilized for eyes but also for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The fact that it had so much uses really made me grow to love the product more.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, but didn&#x27;t seem to actually do anything.</li>
            <li> After a full month of applying it twice a day, no improvement whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Actually, it was too good to be true though.   </li>
            <li> Give it a try :) its also ALL NATURAL!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle undereye balm that gave me results very quickly.</li>
            <li> But we all like free stuff right?  </li>
            <li> I love to use the cream to top off my full vitamin skin treatment: vitamin a and d oil as a base, sheabutter for vitamin e and the awesome Queen Bee Organic Cream for its extremely potent vitamin K.</li>
            <li> I did read the negative views, but because there were so many more good reviews, I thought for sure it would be my new miracle eye cream.</li>
            <li> I also use a little dab on my forehead - absorbs well overnight and smells good too :)</li>
            <li> I chose this item because it was a best seller and had high ratings, but after three weeks of use there was 0 improvement in my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works but within the 1-2 weeks of consistently applying product to my under eye area I noticed a visible reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> You will see a difference in softness and the diminishing of fine lines within the first 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is great because the skin near my eyes are super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I found this product and quickly order a jar to test it out.</li>
            <li> I suppose I imagine there&#x27;s something 5 star worthy out there.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the cream and will definitely order more if needed. :)</li>
            <li> happy with my purchase and recommend it to all young and old.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed at how effective this stuff really is.</li>
            <li> This product is more of a balm consistency, goes on smooth and is not heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not for warm weather climate conditions simply because it melts no matter how lightly applied and somehow always gets in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> This product has helped tremendously by decreasing visibility.</li>
            <li> Those people are lucky.</li>
            <li> most important part is that it contains all natural ingredients without synthetic chemicals or fragrances.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m pregnant and am trying to not put any chemicals in or on my body.  </li>
            <li> , quickly it seems.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be getting more. :]</li>
            <li> The product makes you look more awake and vibrant.</li>
            <li> will definitely looking for some more changes and edit the review if i find it is more helpful.</li>
            <li> The Queen Bee Eye Circle cream arrived quickly before the delivery date.</li>
            <li> delivered quickly, did not remove circles</li>
            <li> made my skin super greasy, which I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Given all the positive reviews, I was definitely expecting something more effective.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love this product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a try. :-)</li>
            <li> I had a smooth and super FAST!</li>
            <li> I bought it for dark circles, but haven&#x27;t used it often enough to comment on progress, but this cream is just so mild, body friendly and pleasant on so many levels that I just love it.</li>
            <li> I used the product consistently for 6 months and can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> they offered me a free jar if I write a review..if the first one didn&#x27;t work why would I need another jar?</li>
            <li> stars b/c product works well, smells great but did nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I just think everybody should be aware that if you write a review, the company will give you a free jar.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item solely based on the great reviews, but I did not see a change in my dark circles and I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they just don&#x27;t work for my kind of circles or if the manufacturers are outright lying, but I&#x27;ve always felt that the most they&#x27;ll do is make you feel better to know that at least you&#x27;re doing SOMETHING about the problem and not sitting idly by.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer but hasn&#x27;t impacted my dark circles at all.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer but no changes in dark circles.</li>
            <li> but Queen Bee is awesome, and especially for those with sensitive skin trying to avoid chemicals in their products, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the great reviews from others who suffer from dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> and I can see that my dark cirles have diminished by a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I then figured out to rub it between my two fingers first and the warmth made it creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and will be ordering it in the future, and telling my friends about it as well.</li>
            <li> It is not good for under make up because it is so oily, but like a night option it is absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at all of the great reviews and the the ratings, so I thought it would be worth the money since nothing I have used in the last 6-7 years has helped much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me, and because it&#x27;s primarily just beeswax, it will make your pillows greasy the first time you roll over in bed.</li>
            <li> After four months of almost daily use I am a very satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> I am on my second jar of the &amp;#34;Queen&amp;#34; , I think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for your eyes at an older age.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy to see some of the puffiness going down.</li>
            <li> I believe that natural is always best and Queen Bee will be an active part in my skin care</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the package the smell was so light and wonderfull , the cream was very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, simple natural ingredients, smells great, very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t irritate at all</li>
            <li> I have used less concealer, which is great for my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesnt feel like applying under the eyes but gives soothing effect and by far the best dark circle remover.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, photos taken of me actually look good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also so good to be able to use a product that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh or toxic chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> And it is super economical</li>
            <li> Used for the first time last night seems like a Good Product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, sure, but it&#x27;s pretty much like rubbing lard on your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews...</li>
            <li> Not worth getting another one for free as was promised by the company if you write a good review.  </li>
            <li> it is useful for her eyes, she is also lucky ,she got your card.</li>
            <li> If you have not purchased please select a brand that is not afraid to print in bold letters what is inside their products.</li>
            <li> Well first of all I use the product in all my face and neck, my face appearance looks more bright and my eyes look a little refresh that is why I didn&#x27;t fill in</li>
            <li> This is very effective on my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This company promises to send you a free bottle if you leave positive feedback.  </li>
            <li> letter that if you write a positive review you will receive a free jar.</li>
            <li> So I came on here to review the one star comment and seen that a person received a free jar if they wrote a positive review....</li>
            <li> This has worked better than sweet almond oil &amp; much better than every other dark eye cream, plus it’s working great as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a first for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for more than 2 months, and I can clearly see the results!</li>
            <li> I really hoped it would have worked on the puffiness!!</li>
            <li> So far I think it is good product, I don&#x27;t have dark circles, but I am still using it now as a kind of eye cream to protect skin aroud eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is outstanding on this 60 year old skin!</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> , I saw results within the first two weeks!  </li>
            <li> It is my first time using this product, because I like to natural organic product, I think it is good for your body and skin to use as much as nutural product.</li>
            <li> Since i like trying new products, i started with the amazing hydrator LaRoche Posay Hydraphase Intense Eyes (over my EL and Roc)</li>
            <li> I bought Queen Bee a few days ago; first i must say the shipping was super fast, very good and friendly customer service.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and this has made my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Consequently, I am greatly concerned by this business practice as a loyal Amazon customer who relies heavily on the product reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  not the most pleasant cream I&#x27;ve tried: it has a thick and sort-of greasy texture.</li>
            <li> product itself is very smooth and not heavy</li>
            <li> I have not seen an improvement in dark circles but it is good for moisture and the natural ingredients are great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am very light skin and ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a single thing for many, many months.....</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove my fine lines, but my skin around my eyes feels much softer.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 weeks, so absolutely zero affect on my fine lines/dark circles, I&#x27;m suspicious of the reviews on here...</li>
            <li> I originally looked for vitamin K in liquid form (for my dark circles), but I decided on this product seeing as there a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it less stars because it moisturizes your skin around the eyes very nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the cream is kind of on the verge of chapstick but a little creamier and more spreadable.</li>
            <li> The instruction says apply before bed, is it for night only?&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream has so hard texture, is there a good way to use it to help skin better absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m A Female from Bklyn NYC &amp;amp; this cream is AMAZING LADIES.</li>
            <li> WOW really impressed wish I had bought a few years</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for few months now and have seen great results .</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this amazing product...</li>
            <li> The aroma helps me feel calm.  </li>
            <li> I really wish it worked, because my under eye area feels so smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li> My mom around 60 years old love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant of this product because most eye creams contain chemicals I can&#x27;t even pronounce, but so far queen bee has been spot on.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive, and most of the products that I have tried have chemicals that burn, itch or cause breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and i love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Also love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> It stays on your skin kind of like vaseline but to a lesser degree</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> When my skin absorbs it, my face looks fresh, young and healthy.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> for the price its worth a try.</li>
            <li> I also love that the product is all natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve not experienced any of the wonderful results others have.</li>
            <li> So I guess the product is worth giving a try</li>
            <li> simple, natural ingredient list, smells great</li>
            <li> It seems to have worked well in terms of reducing the puffiness under my eyes, and even has reduced the lines when I smile.</li>
            <li> Having said that, this is a nice product to carry around while travelling because I can apply it to my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic, safe, and gentle on the skin, and will definitely continue to purchase it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My under eye area is smooth, even, soft, and line free.</li>
            <li> I drink a ton of water, eat well, sleep good (haha), and as my daily and nightly routine.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin soft and younger-looking for sure.</li>
            <li> I love that its natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily and it&#x27;s not going to be 100% absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased this product is 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li> and I love the natural ingredients it is made with, however</li>
            <li> After receiving the product I was surprised to feel it had more of a waxy consistency than a creamy one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle worker and is worth</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found something that works and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes and skin.</li>
            <li> but none of them was useful.</li>
            <li> The first day I tried it I saw my under eye dark circles get a bit lighter, I am still trying it, but so far I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I received the Queen Bee Eye Cream a few days ago and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> felt that the skin under my eyes got thinner and saggy when I smile after using this product.</li>
            <li> and I regret having used it since I now have saggy under eye skin when I smile.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot say the same.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural, and am glad that I found this product.  </li>
            <li> It really did help with the bags and circles, to the point where I don&#x27;t really consider them a problem any more.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> It was even harder to buy this eye cream with a name like &amp;#34;Queen Bee&amp;#34;, but since the price and reviews were good, and no one could see me buy it, I ordered myself a jar.  </li>
            <li> At age 38 I was beginning to develop laugh lines</li>
            <li> I have seen remarkable reduction in the appearance of dark circles under my eyes in just a week.  </li>
            <li> I love the all natural products that its made with.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this natural products, I love it.</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing that I love about it is that it is natural and organic.</li>
            <li> I love that this cream is 100% natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for my under eyes - don&#x27;t quite know if it has done anything miraculous, but it softens and soothes the sensitive skin there</li>
            <li> For the cost of this product, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I feel like Queen Bee is just as effective, but without the harsh chemicals that most eye creams contain.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I have rec&#x27;d so many compliments on how young I look.  </li>
            <li> product did make my skin feel more soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I place it not just under the eye but also on my forehead, between the eyes (frown lines), around my lips and smile lines.  </li>
            <li> The price you pay is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so satisfied and skin under eyes is soft after the wash.</li>
            <li> Most eye creams I&#x27;ve tried (natural or not) make my eyes water and burn, but not this product.</li>
            <li> I knew that buying a more natural product would take time to see results.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s better than putting a cream that&#x27;s packed with chemicals.</li>
            <li> Most of all it is Organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> ( gotta love her busy bees )</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Coconut oil would probably give the same results; which honestly I would rather use.</li>
            <li> The reviews from others looked very positive and so I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I use it before bedtime, the cream is very rich and the skin around my eyes feels soft and nourished in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this eye cream, so much so that I use it on other parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I use it in the eyes area as well as on my fine lines (mainly in my forehead).</li>
            <li> This is much more than I can say for other treatments I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve paid quite a bit more for some of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that goes away pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> A fabulous moisturizer, and able to be used on full face, as I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Using my concealing cream is more effective with a little of this cream first.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d just use it under my eyes - but because it feels and smells so good (very subtle fragrance, but nice)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results, but was surprised at how long it took for the cream to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Originally, I don&#x27;t have a lot of confidence in drug store products but since it&#x27;s in a reasonable price, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> My facial skin dries out very quickly but since using this cream my face has never been more smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if this is the right eye cream for me.</li>
            <li> The item arrived right on time</li>
            <li> and again right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that&#x27;s about $8 per month, so price seems to be right too&lt;</li>
            <li> Bee  is just  right for me.</li>
            <li> am not one to right reviews</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s right away, once before bed and once in the morning.</li>
            <li> My current product (sweet almond oil), like so many others, causes my eyes to burn &amp; water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> queen bee acts as more of a moisturizer for me and ontop of it, it has been able to get rid of the dark circles I had on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t do much for dark circles.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles have lessened, my makeup stays put so no mascara smudges, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes which has been a big problem with me.</li>
            <li> So the fact that I like it and want to use it in more places on my face makes it very likely that I&#x27;ll get the full benefits from the product.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered my second bottle of this, as liked the first one and missed it after I ran out.</li>
            <li> I received this eye cream a few days ago and was surprised at the amount they give you (pleasant surprise) and like the idea of using a waxier treatment instead of a more liquid or lotion consistency.</li>
            <li> The pri is olive oil, beeswax, more oil ., no active ingredients.</li>
            <li> , first i love the fact that it is natural ingredients</li>
            <li> This is a very soft and fine easily absorbed cream.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft and fine easily absorbed cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smelling creams...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and just a note to those who try to discredit the high ratings, suggesting they are a result of the &#x27;free jar&#x27; offer ...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and my skin is much better!</li>
            <li> but I would love to see them come out with some flavors a little more intriguing than vanilla.</li>
            <li> Once i got used to this vaseline-like cream, it was more comfortable to use it on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> more refreshing, less puffiness, younger!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever</li>
            <li> Seems to have definitely improved my slight darkness, good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this product smelled nice, but that is the only positive I have seen with it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion from now on do not waste money on these products you would be better setting a healthy food and exercise routine and going to bed earlier.</li>
            <li> so I really much consider that this is the product that prove me nothing is imposible if the product is truely trusted.</li>
            <li> Most important - it is all natural and therefore I trust using it near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Good product but does not reduce the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I might be able to come upon something that actually works the way it should after two months of consistent usage if I am lucky.</li>
            <li> I think this product is not necessarily marketed honestly as it is an oily skin balm that adds a nice glow to your skin but other than that</li>
            <li> and I’m excited to be seeing such good results after only a couple weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a month now right before bed</li>
            <li> Also shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Just recently introduced to the product and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> so far so good hope to see a bigger result</li>
            <li> It goes on like a balm, but it easily disperses on the skin and leaves skin feeling soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the ingredients are natural, it keeps my under eye area moist, and it smells good, so I will keep using it and hope for further improvement.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing that keeps the round areas of my eyes smooth and rejuvinate.</li>
            <li> , I love being social now.  </li>
            <li> Good for lines, does nothing for black circles.</li>
            <li> I will say that I originally only purchased this item because it had such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t use too much in the morning because it takes a while to absorb and is super shiny.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this cream because I was looking for a product with more natural ingredients to use for moisturizing my under-eye area - I wasn&#x27;t expecting to find a product that not only moisturized my under-eye area, but also reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, made an incredible lip balm, and was useful as an intensive salve-like moisturizer for dry spots, scratches, and scars all over my body!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and is quite light in application.</li>
            <li> , I think the reviews made me more hopeful than I normally would have been, and it&#x27;s really done absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I saw many five star reviews and bought it right away without actually reading them.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for the results i got.  </li>
            <li> I cheerfully threw out my dirty eye creams (yes, I needed more than one of them), and have continued to use only Queen Bee with wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Product was also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I was turned off by the waxy look of the product, but it goes on very much like thinned out vaseline based cream and stays put on your face.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle product.</li>
            <li> I received it very fast, I started using the Queen Bee</li>
            <li> my daughter likes it very much.</li>
            <li> The creme worked wonders after just a couple of weeks it had almost completely faded the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I&#x27;m pleased with the delivery of the product due to the fact that it was free shipping.</li>
            <li> As many others who have tried this, I too have purchased/used MANY different eye creams ( a small fortune&#x27;s worth) and have never been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed much, if any, change which is surprising based upon the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I usually have allergies to under-eyes cosmetics, but this cream (more like a paste) feels very light</li>
            <li> so as to not sport the raccoon look, but it would be good to know how to remove this product so it is compatible with the little bit of eye makeup</li>
            <li> Queen Bee is my favorite antiage cream for my fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say is that it is much more gentle than other products for the under eye area.  </li>
            <li> Nothing irritating, so that&#x27;s very good.  </li>
            <li> I like to put it on my whole face, the smell is great, and I put it under my eyes to PREVENT dark circles and lines as I get older.</li>
            <li> It does take quite a while to absorb (a result of the natural oils that make the product so incredible) and can look a bit shiny on the skin, so I only use it at night or when I know I&#x27;ll just be lounging around the house, but the moisturized feeling lasts until the next day, so only using it at night works just fine for me!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure how well it works for the eyes, it&#x27;s amazing stuff for your lips!  </li>
            <li> Although, I wasn&#x27;t sure that the cream would work, for I had yet to try a cream that actually worked.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot Queen bee cream!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products for wrinkles, for tightening the skin on the face and neck, (as we know, with age the skin on the neck can wrinkle and sag) and the bags that I have under my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right away, I noticed that Queen Bee worked at least as good as the sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> By the time I’m ready to apply makeup around my eyes, I know that my skin has absorbed all it can.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and when I wake up my skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and i was expecting more of a cream, it actually works well</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that I ordered a second bottle two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Once I received it I was very upset because it looked like someone had home printed the label!</li>
            <li> and so far enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I was on the search for an affordable, natural eye cream and this fit criteria.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this to a friend, and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m definitely going  to buy more as soon as I run out of it.</li>
            <li> Im putting on my face no weird names of things that i dont know.  </li>
            <li> I actually read so many reviews and wonder if people lie.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that I will like this product as I will use it more regularly.</li>
            <li> love this eye cream and will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Put these under my eyes the first night, woke up the next morning to even more pronounced bags.</li>
            <li> First, let me say I have coal mines for eyes.  </li>
            <li> It looks shiny but not heavy &amp; goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  about the product: The jar looks pretty small,and the cream has like a wax texture to it</li>
            <li> Just be aware of the nature of the problem you&#x27;re trying to fix - i.e. whether it&#x27;s fixable or not.</li>
            <li> This morning was the first time that I applied this under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I will be trying to use consistently morning and evening</li>
            <li> My eyes are soft and smooth looking.</li>
            <li> however it is exactly like Vaseline and there is no way that you could put makeup over it because it would just come off immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first tried Queen Bee</li>
            <li> This is the first cream I have used for under eyes</li>
            <li> More updates later.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I actually stopped using any creams for months because those creams did more damage than help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 24 and just recently came to the conclusion that I need to start taking care of my skin better</li>
            <li> I also think it is interesting that no one else has commented on this product in the last year...</li>
            <li> In brief, I love this product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I can only use at night, could not keep my makeup on over top of this.  </li>
            <li> When i first saw this product here in Amazon</li>
            <li> The first night i tried this product</li>
            <li> I mix this with the vitamin K serum it does exactly what it days</li>
            <li> Everything about it is consistent with the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Thank you, Queen Bee for a terrific product AND a free jar!</li>
            <li> And on top of it , the product is totally natural!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this product consistently since I received it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just use it on my eyes, I use it all over my face because I have noticed that it works better than the nighttime facial cream I was devoted to.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product consistently for about a week.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that&#x27;s why this has so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> but the darkish circles and morning puffiness aren&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li> And if i get up in the middle of the night I put more on.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect it to work over night.</li>
            <li> Almost done with my first jar.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned Crisco and that seems pretty on target.</li>
            <li> Did exactly like it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I already bought 3 more for the future.</li>
            <li> I already bought 3 more for the future.</li>
            <li> I wake up with smaller pores, blemishes disappear or fade, and more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> this is the real deal folks!</li>
            <li> I have noticed the product to do exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting on a more deep result on my eye area</li>
            <li> when applying this product on your face don&#x27;t forget the sun screen is very essential :-)</li>
            <li> I seem to have some sort of allergy to most facial cleansers/washes and was hoping that since this was very simple it would be ok for me.  </li>
            <li> The cream helps reduce puffiness around the eyes with consistent nightly use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says - shea butter and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it says it does ....</li>
            <li> The ingredients of the product remind me about Native American remedies and indigenous medicine, so now I am confident using this product around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better for night use only.</li>
            <li> It kind of looks like petroleum jelly but is harder.  </li>
            <li> I did not like it at first though</li>
            <li> Because of this nature, the cream is able to stick to my eyes longer and keep eye area moist longer than eye gel or regular watery eye cream.  </li>
            <li> and i think the shininess is mild enough that it&#x27;s fine to wear it during the day without worrying about how it looks.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up</li>
            <li> Once I get back into my sleeping schedule and routine, it will probably be better.</li>
            <li> Old fashioned, ineffective and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> First of all this is a salve type product, it&#x27;s not a cream.</li>
            <li> Really did wonders for me!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I based my decision to buy this product in the first place.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this consistently every night for a month now.</li>
            <li> I am planning to start again soon and will be sure to apply it daily for about a month and see what happens then.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been satisfied with it except the one that there are tiny balls you can feel when you apply to your skin, which bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after the first week ...</li>
            <li> I am close to finishing my first jar.</li>
            <li> I got my first jar for the $50 price tag.</li>
            <li> Third purchases and I&#x27;m still greatly satisfied.</li>
            <li> When I get up in the morning, it is no longer greasy, but soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> No, they are not gone, but they are definitely shades and shades lighter, and the skin under my eyes looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> Thanks queen bee!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products in the past and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> but it goes on smooth and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I thought it was fluke the first time</li>
            <li> This really is an awsome product!  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really helped to lighten my dark circles under my eyes and it helps to keep my lashes nice and full as well.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t get more in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this for only 5 days now,and i allready  love the smell,the texture and the fact</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to many people and I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Over the years I’ve tried many different products and none made any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something that is paraben free and had all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> The cream is so smooth and soft when applied to my skin</li>
            <li> The product makes my skin feel and look smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird, but that&#x27;s the best I could describe the feeling I had.  </li>
            <li> My hubby is even interested.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a difference, some blotching hoping to see more results in the future.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and not greasy and very easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would love to continue to see the results</li>
            <li> You have to know that the first ingredient listed is Olive Oil</li>
            <li> iam deep in love with this cram</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> As far as using it all the time or are trying to smooth away wrinkles, your not going to get the results you so desire.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I smells great, but was not effective for my application.</li>
            <li> I would buy more in future.</li>
            <li> it is not expensive.</li>
            <li> Feels exactly like Crisco</li>
            <li> Initially, I was suspicious because one eye cream never seems to please everyone and to see so many (600</li>
            <li> But after trying the whole bottle, I have not seen any effect around my eyes at all!</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this :)</li>
            <li> No side effects on my skin and the facial lines are no longer prominent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how I felt about this cream at first because of the wax-ish consistency.</li>
            <li> I can think of many uses for it, and will definitely continue to keep this on hand at all times.  </li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for a couple of months now</li>
            <li> so i know exactly what</li>
            <li> but I did not notice any improvements even when I used it consistently.</li>
            <li> I did not like this greasy feeling at first, but you do not need to apply a lot around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> and it only made my eyes more puffy looking.</li>
            <li> I wear it every night and every morning and saw a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently for weeks until the product was used in its entirety.</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s texture is like a lip balm, and</li>
            <li> Works really well...love it!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s about the only thing I enjoyed about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sleep nearly as many hours as I should, and I struggle with waking in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> I then started using it twice a day, and definitely feel better about my under eye appearance.  </li>
            <li> I know not everyone has the same level of improvement, but I really love what it&#x27;s done for me.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m down to just using the Queen Bee, and my usual makeup regime, and I feel good, my husband says my skin looks and feels good to the touch, and after 28 years of marriage, I appreciate any compliment</li>
            <li> so it was a refreshing experience to try something new and all natural.</li>
            <li> It makes my dry skin feel so much softer and nice.</li>
            <li> My skin is not only clean and fresh, fine lines and wrinkles are significantly reduced making me feel like a look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> you want an amazing, natural eye cream, pay a little more and go with Real Purity.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin radiant, clear and fresh feeling!</li>
            <li> Friends say with a very moist, effective mitigation eye skin wrinkles, worth having, but also has some effect on the dark circles</li>
            <li> The dark circles have diminished greatly in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it and the skin around my eyes appear to be more moist.</li>
            <li> I just received and haven&#x27;t used yet, but I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye cream that is organic and 100% natural, and was excited to find this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve put this on every night for not even a week and my wrinkles under my eyes and dark circles have already gotten better!</li>
            <li> old and after my 30&#x27;s my eye bags were significant to the point co-workers @</li>
            <li> Im doubtful because there is a lot of good ratings that is so good to be true.</li>
            <li> I love trying new products and rarely buy the same thing twice, but this skin balm is one I will continue to buy.  </li>
            <li> This turned out to be the best one I have ever used, takes care of dark circles, makes your skin soft and supple, highly recommend the product!Yule not loose anything !!</li>
            <li> This really makes your eyes soft and helps with your eye concealer to go on smooth.</li>
            <li> It is soothing, clean scented and natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that not only I found the cream that doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reaction but also really improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put on my body from full time school and full time work at the same time.  </li>
            <li> so the asian side of me has blessed me with, overall, good skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice - no chemicals and only natural scents.</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty cautious when I hear about natural products that work to deal with skin problems, and with this product that held true.</li>
            <li> For me, the professional products seem to work better or Living Clay makes my eyes nearly flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The postal carrier lost my package and they were sure to get me my item as fast as possible after knowing about the issue.</li>
            <li> Vitamin K. Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that as far as NATURAL under eye creams</li>
            <li> I saw that so many people love this cream, and it works for them, but it was too thick for my under eyes.</li>
            <li> An overall nice, natural product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products and methods (like cucumber slices) to get the dark bags under my eyes to go away but the results have been average at best</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty pale, so my under eye circles are very prominent.</li>
            <li> This really does help me and it&#x27;s very gentle being</li>
            <li> i can not believe the positive reviews, EVEN if they show it&#x27;s a \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t think it does because of all the positive comments.</li>
            <li> I read positive reviews about it and thought I&#x27;d try it out.</li>
            <li> But on the positive side, it may lighten the skin around eyes.</li>
            <li> I saw all the positive reviews on Amazon and had to try this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Any product with positive rating from EWG and works like this gets an A+ from me.</li>
            <li> Did not see the results noted in positive reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so happy with this cream that I thought it is not fair if I don&#x27;t write one.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time now, and is extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> I used it twice today for the first time &amp;amp; saw results really fast.</li>
            <li> I know this is all very subjective, but I&#x27;m willing to continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> My first thoughts when I started using Queen Bee was feeling like a real Queen ^.^</li>
            <li> When i woke up Ohhhh my it really works just on the first application.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product especially when you think about the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and don&#x27;t have the who-know-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you for making such a fantastic natural, organic product available.  </li>
            <li> I love this &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> You can use it pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have noticed much of a difference, other than it feels nice on my skin</li>
            <li> feels stretched with more noticable wrinkles, darker circles &amp; puffier bags.</li>
            <li> luv this, true ORGANIC ALL NATURAL PRODUCT,  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it said it would remove dark circles, but I didn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> Surprising how such simple ingredients can help so much.</li>
            <li> I will have to give it a little more time for final product review but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Often I have to do my own research to track down a product&#x27;s ingredients and it gets so time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 2 months, mainly with the purpose of  minimizing my age lines and preventing more.</li>
            <li> It is good in a way because I use less than a normal cream (which I tend to use too much).  </li>
            <li> I would like to explain a little bit more about the product how affect on my face!</li>
            <li> For age related facial / eye issues I enjoy the result and noticeable reduction in significant problems that can occur around the eye area!</li>
            <li> The slight hint of coca butter scent is a nice touch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a short time dark circles have improved as well as it being a great moisturizing product</li>
            <li> Product also has a slight but nice smell.</li>
            <li> My under eye wrinkles diminished tremendously and my skin naturally glows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it more for dry peeling skin around my nose (from allergies) and for keeping my skin moisturized after at home chemical peels.</li>
            <li> Overall it makes my face baby smooth after my first overnight application.  </li>
            <li> But I also use it for my chronic dry lips and it has worked better then anything else I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like natural, Organic products and vitamin K is good for dark circles...</li>
            <li> it does get rid of very dry patches on my face and great to use on dry lips too</li>
            <li> I will certainly recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> certain chemicals can offset and therefor detour the eye cream from working.</li>
            <li> certain chemicals can offset and therefor detour the eye cream from working.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m almost certain</li>
            <li> It certainly has not offered the results it touts--</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Better off with Pure Vitamin K cream which repaired the &amp;#34;damage&amp;#34; done by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you for bringing a useful product to my natural skin regime!</li>
            <li> While the product is all natural and feels OK and smells nice, the formulation is not good for its intended use.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely something new to me, more like a salve.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product at Reasonable Cost:&lt;br /&gt;I had been struggling with dark circles under my eye for quite some time and tried some products, but hardly any gave as good a result as Queen Bee.</li>
            <li> , it mixes great with makeup foundation, making under-eye wrinkles less visible throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> Nice natural balm smell without any phony fragrances that can dry skin.</li>
            <li> If it is dry around your eyes and regular eye cream does not seem to help improve the wrinkles and puffiness just like me, this is a good cream to try.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this is positive enough to get a free one to.</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t decided if this is a positive or a negative, but it smells so good</li>
            <li> I began to use this product last night it will take few days if the dark sleeping circles will disappear but what I love it is all natural with an excellent fragrance</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a month now, it definitely helped soften and moisturize my eye-area while reducing the appearance of fine lines and the darkness.</li>
            <li> i see this as very high priced considering what it achieved.</li>
            <li> I think it works just as good, if not better, than other products that cost much more.  </li>
            <li> First of all, what happened to the high ratings posted here?</li>
            <li> have hard good things about this product.</li>
            <li> and I already see an improvement the product is very thick, but goes on nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> results,,I had a very dark circle in the eyes area and the change its amazing,,,</li>
            <li> After all the good reviews I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; Well, when you get the package queen bee adds a little piece of paper that offers a second free jar upon a &amp;#34;great review&amp;#34; received.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I took out time to order this cream, well receive and start using only a week and notice that this cream has already done wonders for my skin, I&#x27;m a woman over 45 years of age and started to notice my skin getting very dark and drier, tried using over the counter creams but was unsucessful with find something that would work for me, while on amazon website searching ran across this item and having been using it since for under my eyes and all over the rest of my face, notice my skin is more softer and supptle</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for giving me this amazing product at such low price</li>
            <li> After a few short weeks of using it I already began to see great results.</li>
            <li> I had only been using it for one week and already noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Volume is huge, it will last for years.</li>
            <li> It takes 4-5 days to really see the effects.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I once received 2 jars at one time, &amp; both of them had a gritty, rather than smooth product in them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really think that Amazon should require a listing of all ingredients from sellers for makeup and skin products (this seller listed the ingredients).  </li>
            <li> For the amount that cosmetic companies charge for their products, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask to have them disclose what they&#x27;re asking the consumer to pay for.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It really reduced in color.</li>
            <li> This really does make my skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, just be a bit patient, you&#x27;ll see it works!</li>
            <li> Thanks, JHA-Florida</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything, I finished the whole jar</li>
            <li> It is very greasy (made from olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax and vitamin K</li>
            <li> This cream is really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t  ready to leave the wonders that they do to my skin..</li>
            <li> I really saw a differences.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li> It is very greasy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see difference after using the almost whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say I can recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This was a very moisturizing oil based eye cream.</li>
            <li> The product is really a balm and not a cream</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of improvement yet,I will rate it once i&#x27;m done with the bottle i&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I really like how it smells</li>
            <li> Needless to mention the packaging which is incredibly cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating</li>
            <li> Using on my whole face before going to bed may be an issue however.</li>
            <li> It suits me very well.</li>
            <li> so wrinkles are not my problem and that seems to be what this eye cream is really for</li>
            <li> Applying something so close to your eyes needs to be gentle, and I have found queen bee to be my answer.  </li>
            <li> It really works for my under eye wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> My eyes have improves so much I wish I had before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> Very thankful.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle and didnt even see any changes at all.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works really well</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I prefer this cream for night time as it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> The queen bee eye cream is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Queen Bee is Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> i use this on my whole face, not just my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to get in my opinion before too much time passed by.</li>
            <li> and it really moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference-- much improved.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY shiny</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very concealable under make up.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes the areas under my eyes very well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve yet to see much improvement in my genetic undereye circles.  </li>
            <li> but it is very greasy.</li>
            <li> For now, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> truly i don&#x27;t see much change....</li>
            <li> Was very hesitant ordering this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> but it really does nothing</li>
            <li> the improvements have been really noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and my eye area feels very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Yes Ladies this eye cream really does work.</li>
            <li> The seller offered a free 2nd product after a review was posted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype, as you are offered a product to write a review so save yourself some money and get something that really works.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m this happy with it on the first day getting it, I can only imagine how amazed I will be in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Ive also noticed that I don&#x27;t use a much concealer as before.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving my order I also received a promotional note saying I could get another free order if I only wrote a review here on amazon.</li>
            <li> This product has worked where others haven&#x27;t -- have tried Neutrogena and straight vitamin E.</li>
            <li> This product is very greasy and stay greasy under my eyes all night.</li>
            <li> This product is also very greasy.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if it were in a lip balm container, it would be much easier to use/apply.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes was getting very lose.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but it does really work.</li>
            <li> I really like how I&#x27;m not putting a lot of chemicals on my face</li>
            <li> It really works....</li>
            <li> and now I have clogged sweat pores that my dermatologist wants to do a microderma skin care procedure to unclog.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has worked really well.</li>
            <li> My eyes have cleared up really well.</li>
            <li> I used my ring finger to apply this stuff being that it&#x27;s the gentle finger.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very greasy, so could not wear under makeup, but now a problem for nighttime use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> For those like me with chemical sensitivity, that&#x27;s really appreciated.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference  with the crow&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li> It is also quite greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> So much for the Amazon rating system with this one.</li>
            <li> and I use it on my whole face not just around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for this type of product.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I was really optimistic.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I really like how it smells.</li>
            <li> and i could see much difference within 7 days.</li>
            <li> i really like this brand and will continue buying it always</li>
            <li> It applies much thicker than anything I tried</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin around your eyes very greasy looking and does not soak into the skin well.  </li>
            <li> Also - no coupon for a second jar free</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my under eye darkness</li>
            <li> I really amaze with this product and never regret that I bought this.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it really acts like the coconut oil, that I was used to ,nothing special.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to work as fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very soothing though</li>
            <li> Not overly greasy on the skin which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is very versatile, which is also an advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I also should say, that I was just putting this on in the morning for under eye circles, but when using it at night and in the morning, I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like the smells</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, just be a bit patient, you&#x27;ll see it works!</li>
            <li> But it did moisturize the area very well.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing eye cream.</li>
            <li> It is everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do much for me in the eye department.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I also coupled it with  {Copy and paste this link-------&amp;#62;(Best-Selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin-- 100% Pure-Highest Quality, Anti-Aging Serum-- Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free-Best Hyaluronic Acid for Your Face</li>
            <li> but I feel very shiny after using the cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff really truly works, can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I think this product works really well.</li>
            <li> I got it two years ago and after using it intermittently it didn&#x27;t work very well which makes sense.</li>
            <li> It was very waxy</li>
            <li> and I did not think it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this all summer at night on my whole face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes when you are using a product that gives gradual results, you don&#x27;t really appreciate how much it is working until you stop.</li>
            <li> I started using it 4 months ago, and in the beginning I was very faithful to put it on EVERY night.</li>
            <li> For me, really liking something makes all the difference in the world.  </li>
            <li> but I can say this product really works.</li>
            <li> I use morning and night and highly recomend this product!</li>
            <li> This product really is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Really like the consistency and the texture of this eye cream .</li>
            <li> It even works really well as a lip</li>
            <li> so I am VERY senstitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> delivery was fast as well.</li>
            <li> all the eye creams I&#x27;ve used did not do much for my problem.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this product is working very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Crows feet still very noticable.</li>
            <li> Not noticing much difference under my eyes</li>
            <li> But I really want to recommend it as an overnight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> On day 3, my whole face was swollen like &amp;</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t help me.......</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much change from using this product.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to share that I really like this product.</li>
            <li> After much research, I found the under eye cream</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use as much cover up under my eyes anymore.</li>
            <li> I was very diligent with this product</li>
            <li> This stuff really changed my appearance</li>
            <li> , I did not notice a change in that area, but really softens the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it looked as if it was getting ready to blister.  </li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> and keeps my under eye are very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I no longer look like a zombie in the morning haha</li>
            <li> This product really work on my skin .</li>
            <li> much should be apply to face?</li>
            <li> Much thanks.</li>
            <li> It is very oily</li>
            <li> Every morning my whole face glows after using this stuff overnight.</li>
            <li> a real consumer</li>
            <li> I really lost my hope that they recover.</li>
            <li> and we get the cream how much we want.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even use it as a moistariser because it&#x27;s very oil.</li>
            <li> but it is much stiffer.  </li>
            <li> It really starts working soon, even my colleague mentioned it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy/</li>
            <li> I do really like this product</li>
            <li> product really works and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It leaves the eyes really oily looking.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal on the product--it is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> For me, not so much.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and always use oil-free products as much as I can.</li>
            <li> I have had this about 2 weeks now and really like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizing benefits of this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Would not repurchase though as it did not fix much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li> After using it it also made my skin look and feel -really- oily.</li>
            <li> Just set your expectations reasonably.</li>
            <li> I am a Jamaican and the product works really well for my skin.</li>
            <li> very minium)</li>
            <li> Didnt really seem like it helped me much.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I started putting it on my whole face</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> and now my skin stays moisturized throughout the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He smell reminded me of baked cookies and the texture was smooth enough to pat all over my face.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing out there I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really fix the darkness under the eye</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> After finishing my first jar of Queen Bee, I realized that I never notice dark circles under my eyes any more.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams over the years and this is first product that has helped my dark circles and crows feet.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact it has only natural ingredients, without alcohol which so many skin products seem to contain.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using queen bee, I can honestly say that I can see and feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago, every night before bed I put it on and even during the day I put some on if I&#x27;m not leaving the house because it&#x27;s kind of greasy</li>
            <li> and I had issues putting something like that with so many chemicals I couldn&#x27;t pronounce in such a sensitive area like my under eye region.</li>
            <li> It is also good to spread it thick around eyes when taking a bath and relax.  </li>
            <li> My eye skin was soft and supple, even after a looooong night!!!</li>
            <li> The consistency is super thick and greasy, but overall has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell about any long term results/effects, but I love it so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so rare you can stumble upon something this neutral, mild and gentle when you are sensitive to pretty much EVERYTHING including all-natural/organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far im please with the product,i just wish it was a bigger jar for the price,the jar is small,but other than that,it came early and the package was good,&amp;it smells good!</li>
            <li> I do like it at night mostly because we live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles are gone, fine lines are things of past and my skin is quite smooth.</li>
            <li> I found this under eye cream more hydrating than most of the other natural products I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!), and it was soothing and refreshing for my very sensitive skin (no itching and no red marks like other creams).</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t really tried that many other products, but I would much rather put something that is chemical free and natural on my face every day, than some of the other creams on the market full of who-knows-what.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other eye creams but since using Queen Bee I have found it to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Better than I expected results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for the past two weeks and love it!</li>
            <li> In the short time I have been using the eye cream I have already had significant results.</li>
            <li> if you like it and want another jar, you will leave a review even if you don&#x27;t normally review products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hydrating without the harmful chemicals like in most products nowadays.</li>
            <li> but I decided to buy this cream due to many reviews by people who claim this cream</li>
            <li> It does seem to give me a more awake look, but as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s if you miss a day</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems rich enough to keep my under eye moisturised</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for other things.  </li>
            <li> I really did not see any improvement as far as dark circles were concerned, but the cream did feel nice on my eyes</li>
            <li> I have been looking for almost 10 years for something and stumbled across this a couple years ago after trying many other products.  </li>
            <li> Again, love the moisturizing that I get along with my other products.  </li>
            <li> When i woke up, I immediately could see my dark circles were already appearing lighter and my fine lines were fading!</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it&#x27;s a natural product and is very emollient which is wonderful in this cold, very dry, New Jersey winter weather!</li>
            <li> The cream is pretty oily and it takes 20-30 minutes to get fully absorbed, so I only used it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product may be totally great and do exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li> Great product and this little bottle goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> use this every night and my dark circles are completely gone and the skin around my eyes is nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The difference in just a few short weeks is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product long enough to see the full potential of it, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and soft but did not get any results in terms of diminishing my dark circles</li>
            <li> and I honestly see no difference in my dark circles so far.</li>
            <li> Very moisturising and lovely smell.&lt;br /&gt;Still need to try it to see the result with dark circles.</li>
            <li> It does last a long time though, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this product was all natural, I have been using it for dark circles and under eye wrinkles</li>
            <li> Nice natural ingredients however, I found it did nothing for my dark circles and was a bit greasy for me....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very sensitive when it comes to products used near my eyes and simply can&#x27;t use most of the ones sold brick and-mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Organic is much safer and better than other creams on the market!</li>
            <li> Not only is this product 100% natural, it&#x27;s amazing for smoothing lines under your eyes and make the skin under your eye look and feel supple, hydrated and really much younger!</li>
            <li> I am using this on my face and neck,  I noticed an immediate tightening with the first application, my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to urea (used as a preservative in cosmetics) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoulene which is apparently related to the toluene found in nail polish that many people are allergic to) and so, being fed up with having to check every ingredient list of every makeup and skin care product I wanted to buy, I decided to go all natural or organic.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say this is the first time I ever used an eye treatment completely and then immediately reordered.</li>
            <li> But most of all, I noticed that my dark under eye circles were gone.</li>
            <li> It cost $22.98 and is most definitely not worth $2.00.</li>
            <li> I can already say that my dark circles are almost not visible and the skin around my eyes looks so much better after 1 month of use.</li>
            <li> It feels soft and moistrurizing skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients lets you know just exactly what&#x27;s going on your eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving more time to see results on the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews but decided to try it for myself ,boy was I impressed.</li>
            <li> This is is my first natural organic eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I have battled with dark circles most of my life</li>
            <li> Better for face rather than dark circle remover.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say for sure my dark undereye circles have lightened at all, but I use it all over my face for my aging skin -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the dark circles yet, but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> So, hopefully, with continuous use my dark circles and perhaps my wrinkles will get better.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying All Natural Queen Bee Eye Cream</li>
            <li> The area that bothers me the most is dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking and using many eye creams for my dark circles problems.</li>
            <li> and I can see my dark circles getting better.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that is kind to sensitive skin and actually works effortlessly!</li>
            <li> Love this put it on overnight and 30 min before applying makeup and it will reduce puffy dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I had dark circles although not terrible</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of creams and make up, and nothing has worked as well as this product for dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for wrinkles/crows feet as I don&#x27;t have them yet, but I am pleased that my dark circles are lighter.</li>
            <li> i guess its focused more on wrinkles than dark circles/</li>
            <li> Overall I recommend this product and will continue using to see the full affects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and recently noticing signs fine lines.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better for the rosacea, which started to go down after just a week or two of use.  </li>
            <li> so I am very excited at the prospect of lessening this problem even further as this product will absolutely have my support for the foreseeable future!</li>
            <li> First morning after I applied the cream, I noticed that the skin was smoothed out (no little bumps).</li>
            <li> Good quality ingredients, no complaint there, I just thought it would be absorbed better into my skin and naively believed it might actually lighten my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> This will not stop me from buying this product as I also love to apply it in the morning under my make up to get a more supply look under my eye area and my dark circles are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Queen Bee for almost 2 years now and it has significantly reduced both the rosacea and the dark circles (not completely gone, but much much better).  </li>
            <li> This product really provided an enriching feeling that gave new color to my skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> you get a free jar for a positive review until ordering and afterward reading some other reviews.</li>
            <li> It feels great and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell or rough feel.  </li>
            <li> I love the slight honey/organic scent.  </li>
            <li> Not a quick fix for wrinkles, but I am pleased with the moisturizing effect over time.  </li>
            <li> We are all looking for a miracle product but less stress, eating healthy, yoga, meditation and drinking water will provide the miracle.</li>
            <li> circles under my eyes are less noticeable and folks tell me I look better rested now that I have in years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s better if you don&#x27;t dab it under your eyes like typical eye creams.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel more hydrated, and slightly plumper.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is less like a cream and more of a wax and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> There is a slight vanilla scent and it is more like a salve than a lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use daily to see constant effects!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I found this cream because the couple of creases under my eyes that were starting to form are now definitely starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I apply it every night before going to bed and when I wake up, my eyes feel vibrant and youthful.</li>
            <li> The main difference I see is the wrinkles around the corners of my eyes have minimized in appearance.</li>
            <li> I had bought this product based on the number of reviews, only to find when I received the product that the company offers free product as incentives to write reviews.</li>
            <li> I tried many eye creams such as Lancôme, Olay, Shiseido, and found the real problem is that even though some eye creams provide moisture and ease wrinkles when you apply them, they dry out fast and the wrinkles appear again.  </li>
            <li> but the older</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s not any better than Vaseline and a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Consulted doctors and friends, tries multiple products; some worked but had side effects on my skin, while others weren’t that effective.</li>
            <li> Wonderful definitely try it and you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> The texture was different than what I was used to, but I got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> This has taken two or three months, applying morning and night, to happen, with steady decrease in pigment.  </li>
            <li> This has taken two or three months, applying morning and night, to happen, with steady decrease in pigment.  </li>
            <li> Not thinking there was a difference in any particular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an intensely moisturizing under-eye night cream made with natural ingredients I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> the older I get</li>
            <li> but they must be from people whoose main issue</li>
            <li> is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li> So, I apply a mixture of 2 drops of Tamanu oil mixed with nivea white and one drop of rose-hip oil on top of it, for softness.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a magic cream to work in a short amount of time, this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to male and female species alike :)</li>
            <li> I was a bit iffy at first buying this under eye cream since most eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the past never seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use at night.  </li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE for any woman who wants to use a natural product that really delivers.  </li>
            <li> Coconut oil is the closest to a decent improvement .</li>
            <li> (I should note that while I&#x27;m 25 years old, I&#x27;ve been battling pretty severe symptoms that have caused chronic sleep deprivation for a little more than 2 years.)  </li>
            <li> But being a person with VERY sensitive skin, particularly around my eyes, I&#x27;ve learned to really like this.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles (yet!)</li>
            <li> The only drawback from it is the wax form, but it&#x27;s just a minor minus compared to the great benefit it carries.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend anyone giving  this product a try.</li>
            <li> high up in my list of things to check for before purchasing cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it with no</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with undereye bags.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light not to heavy where it clogs up your pores.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I will reorder this one and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommends this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews are absolutely correct how fantastic this is.</li>
            <li> I had very dry skin on my face and within a matter of days it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> Maybe better to scoop out with a little spoon.</li>
            <li> it is a little oily, but it&#x27;s ok, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it is a little oily, but it&#x27;s ok, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things for my dark circles around eyes and this is it!</li>
            <li> I do feel as though the skin under my eyes looks a little more refreshed in the mornings after I&#x27;ve washed my face and</li>
            <li> I have noticed fine lines and small wrinkles disappearing, and my skin feels so fresh and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream really gets rid of dark circles and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> main concern is that I purchased the \\&quot;eye cream\\&quot; thinking it was a new product by Queen Bee.  </li>
            <li> I apply this by using the third finger as it offers the most gentle touch as i smooth on the hard formula to my under eye and my eye lid.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was very sceptical because it is a soft, moist cream that smells like honey and looks like it shouldn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early twenties, so I can&#x27;t really testify to its effects on lines and wrinkles, but it didn&#x27;t work well on my shadows.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like all the natural ingredients they use.  </li>
            <li> I really like that the ingredients are all natural &amp; plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to rub it in too much under my eyes because the skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li> It can be greasy if you use too much or if it&#x27;s not rubbed in completely.</li>
            <li> It is natural and really softens my eye area.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical from the moment i received my package because it came with a &amp;#34;give us a great review</li>
            <li> Might be natural but doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> This is a very hydrating eye moisturizer and I like that it&#x27;s made of identifiable ingredients.</li>
            <li> but you can put it on your whole face and it feels soft.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t removed the darkness completely, but I don&#x27;t think anything really could considering my Sicilian heritage.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and gentle, provide moisture to the under eye area, and fade the darkness as well.</li>
            <li> Ive tried so many products and have spent so much money on different skincare but this one jar takes care of it all.  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m sure not to waste money.  </li>
            <li> I usually use products with chemicals in them; recently I was aware of the harm that these kind of products do to my skin</li>
            <li> and I already feel that my face is soft, smooth and bit clear as compare to prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> This one however does not irritate eyes and allows me to remain normal and non squinting when i used it</li>
            <li> this natural eye cream smells soft and very edible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and under-eye circles aren&#x27;t gone, but look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update again in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Honestly I had dark spot on both side of my upper checks</li>
            <li> He was actually the one who ordered Queen Bee for me after reading some reviews about others customers with rosacea having success with it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li> so no complaint at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrill that others have had such success with Queen Bee, but for me it&#x27;s not the case.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I normally use the product before bed.</li>
            <li> so much so that I&#x27;m OK with leaving the house now on a lazy Sunday when I don&#x27;t feel like putting makeup on.</li>
            <li> I saw improvements in my circles after a few weeks and they&#x27;ve been getting progressively better.</li>
            <li> I am confident that it would erase my dark circles completely if i keep using it.</li>
            <li> I like that it is made from beeswax as I am trying to use as many natural organic products in my daily life as possible.</li>
            <li> Ordering a few more</li>
            <li> that I used alot the second day,  and remembered that my doctor said when using any topical products , the best results is when a thin amount is applied.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles all of my life, and frankly, I believe that how and if they are able to be fixed depends on how you&#x27;ve gotten them.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily on a normal basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to talk about long lasting effects, but it definitely does something good to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love that is is all natural and is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t do the job like other, non natural eye creams would.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product mainly because of the natural ingredients in it, along with the surprisingly high reviews it got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that would be natural and not full of chemicals like most under eye creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that would be natural and not full of chemicals like most under eye creams.</li>
            <li> It works fabulously to tame my bangs into place and to eliminate some of the top frizz that we curly girls tend to get.</li>
            <li> Luckily they haven&#x27;t lasted long and disappeared after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> and I usually went with the relatively cheap rollers and while they did provide a refreshing feel; none of them really lightened up the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I would like to try using this on my forehead above my eyebrow area to see if it helps with the fine lines that are starting to form up there, but I&#x27;m a little nervous that it might break my skin out since I&#x27;m so sensitive to most products.  </li>
            <li> So far, I really like it and it seems to be working well to eliminate dark circles and smooth wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It will remain shiny for a long time without absorbing and feel kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> Which is what made me try something a little more natural this time around.</li>
            <li> So I just chalked it up that I would just had to live with it.</li>
            <li> It was shipped in a timely fashion and without damage to the unpackaged, but new jar.  </li>
            <li> When I bought this, I just wanted to try a new under eye cream.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have a new lease on life</li>
            <li> I will live with them for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> The cream went on much smoother than other products I&#x27;ve tried and without leaving a super greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> However, after using it for about one week, I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark circles and fine lines were fading.</li>
            <li> but did nothing for dark circles and fine lines been using it for weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement in dark circles or fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Have used for about a month and have not seen any improvement on my dark circles or fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I did not have the dark circles but fine lines looking to help.  </li>
            <li> but it is making my fine lines and dark circles disappear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m realistic and know its not going to take them away completely</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the fast delivery of this item and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> As the years passed the dark circles got darker and more apparent.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old female with sensitive skin that is prone to mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> Besides, WHY would I want an extra jar of something that does not work, even if it is free, that will only add to the clutter on my bathroom</li>
            <li> Initially, posted a generic favorable review because the seller promised to ship the product free after it posted.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is natural, sweet and a lot compared with other eye treatment.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll notices a very soft honey like texture.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin around my eyes very soft.</li>
            <li> I look very young and the skin is indeed blemish and bump-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am very conscious of everything I&#x27;m eating and using.</li>
            <li> Put very little though, because when I put a bit more it can get into my eyes when I blink.</li>
            <li> Ok, the quantity is very little, it will surprise you.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and love that this keeps my under eye area moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS INGREDIENT in anything to you are putting on your face especially if your skin is very sensitive like mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I have come to learn that it is the exact same product as the Skin Balm!  </li>
            <li> Fade creams don&#x27;t work over night so it only stands to reason that you have to without a doubt remain consistent with use.</li>
            <li> After the first 3 weeks of using it, I noticed a big difference in my under-eyes AND the color of a mole that is also under my eye.</li>
            <li> The mole was first obvious.</li>
            <li> Wow it works!  </li>
            <li> Will continue to buy and use this natural product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to start using my product because after reading the reviews and hearing other people stories I&#x27;m excited to see the change.</li>
            <li> I love using it on my face, especially with this extreme weather.</li>
            <li> Their eye cream turned my eyes around completely!</li>
            <li> For one it is 100% Natural and Organic!  </li>
            <li> Because of the creaminess of this cream, I decided to try it on my lips one day when they had become so red (the first stage of my suffrage).  </li>
            <li> All Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream!</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> But now at 23, over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve paid more attention to my skin.</li>
            <li> I surprised!</li>
            <li> Not sure if my under eyes look better</li>
            <li> Plus, for the price it&#x27;s great because a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> Have had no problems with this product so far!</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but actually feels like velvet.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all natural to boot!</li>
            <li> More importantly other similar products burn my eyes if they accidentally get in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t have eye bags but after using this product, I developed eye bags.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, it is pretty greasy/waxy, so it is definitely a night-time product for me</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream product that works for me although I&#x27;ve tried out higher end products (i.e. Lancôme, etc).&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural, too!  </li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to know what the long term results will be, but it is already making my face look smoother and nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week and on the first night using this cream, I could feel the softness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> It felt so soft to the touch!  </li>
            <li> And it is useful for any other areas needing intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I purchased a second jar of the product only because I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better than this at the moment.</li>
            <li> I thought spending more for an organic product would be more beneficial, but it just left a greasy look around my eyes, making me look even worse!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> I did so and did received a full refund minus the shipping fee.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to say whether it will reduce fine lines, so the jury is still out for now.</li>
            <li> My experience so far has been positive, the cream has a very faint and pleasant smell as well as it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Maybe good if you have super dry skin, and a little goes a long way, but definitely NOT for me!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I just want people to know about this unbelievable product, especially those who are very self-conscious about their dark circles, so that they can be as happy with it as I am.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I just want people to know about this unbelievable product, especially those who are very self-conscious about their dark circles, so that they can be as happy with it as I am.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long will take to get rid off them, but I am on the right way.</li>
            <li> However, this doesn&#x27;t really absorb fast and so skin does stay moist for a long time.</li>
            <li> I dap the upper lid with a tissue to remove most of the product, but under my eye I dab the skin with clean fingers so that a thin layer will remain.</li>
            <li> I just wipe them off on a towel, but they are everywhere, so it&#x27;s easy to still have a few end up on my skin/hair/eyes.</li>
            <li> Dark circles are caused by many different factors (hereditary, diet/exercise, lack of sleep, hyperpigmentation, loss of collagen/indentation, leaky blood vessels, etc.)</li>
            <li> So far i have used it about three days now and from the moment i first put it on hours later</li>
            <li> This eye cream was just what I was looking for; an all natural toxic free cream with vitamin K for dark circle reduction</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different product for dark circle and none compare to this all natural product it not only removed the darkness underneath my lovely eyes but left them delicate and smooth</li>
            <li> I have already noticed an improvement in my fine lines &amp; wrinkles as well as my dark circles!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to remove dark circles and the seller ships quickly</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t look old when I am old!</li>
            <li> My dark circles were reduced significantly, and my peers even noticed it.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use for the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed significant improvement in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I am young and do not currently use this cream for wrinkles or dark circles, but I love it as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have finally found a product that would diminish my dark circles, I was very excited after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Use it at night and have noticed a significant improvement in dark circles and wrinkles disappearing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for dark circles, and I haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement yet.</li>
            <li> It was super heavy on my face and very oily.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried it because it was more balmy than creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to work.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the fine lines under my eyes or the slight pigmentation (very minor &amp;#34;dark circles&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> and now I have SOFT, YOUNG and CLEAR FACE SKIN!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this product really provides the moisture that I need, and I really like the fact that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, white, normal to dry and live in Denver, Colorado, which also make my skin more dry.</li>
            <li> I received a little coupon that said I could get a free one</li>
            <li> I will use up my little jar and report back if my eyes look better after a stretch of continuous use.</li>
            <li> It works if you use it twice a day, the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it can be a little bit more greasy than lotion, almost like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> it has more like a really hard lip balm consistency.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This does gives a little shine underneath the eyes that goes away after few minutes, also, it does not crape the under eye layer as is common with many good eye cremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this I am 51 and 2  years ago had pnemonia that left me with very dark circles.</li>
            <li> I bought this July 31 (today is November 12), have been using it consistently, still have a little of the product left in the bottom of the little jar, and will most definitely purchase this again because it works quickly and beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really self conscious about it, so I try to hide it as much as possible.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and skin and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate them, it is gentle enough.</li>
            <li> which makes me question if it&#x27;s really doing something to improve my skin- as so far the results seem to only be temporary.</li>
            <li> is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li> I really like how the product is all natural and will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> It helped to clear up my eyes and keep them that way.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  </li>
            <li> It also helps to keep under my eyes feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural eye cream since I do not like to use chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li> For a natural approach to skin care</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> still young and no wrinkles xD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised my acne</li>
            <li> But I thought it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this because 2 thigs its all natural and it works.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> I already ordered another jar and I&#x27;m not near finished with the first one.</li>
            <li> were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and feels natural.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and natural ingredients, but I think I will just use it as a lip balm if it continues show no results.</li>
            <li> not for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> but so far I can give you what I know.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> and sometime I use it for my lips because of the hydration and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> If it works like this for me, it should work real miracles for younger women.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think anything out there works for dard circles for I have tried enough of them.  </li>
            <li> I thought it made sense even if I question the effectiveness of absorbing enough through my skin to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> The circles have lightened 50% so far.</li>
            <li> having a natural appearance has always been my desire.</li>
            <li> but I began my hopes of restoring my under eyes to their natural beauty.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> that is natural and would probably buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product works,as a healthcare professional, I am recommending it to my patients.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much so the jar will last awhile.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a completely natural product.</li>
            <li> but I am very hopeful that it will reduce if not eliminate them in the next couple of weeks/months.</li>
            <li> (I have combination/acne prone skin, 30 years old).  </li>
            <li> Its all natural</li>
            <li> I apply this product not only under my eyes but to my whole face.</li>
            <li> That is a perk of the Queen Bee, it is all natural and you don&#x27;t have to worry about what you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li> all natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of products</li>
            <li> So this is why I was so surprised that this cream affected me the way that it did.</li>
            <li> Very itchy, red, and it feels as though the skin under my eyes has gotten</li>
            <li> It took me around 3+ months to get rid of under-eye circles completely.</li>
            <li> It read 100% all natural, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My face skin feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Natural Ingredients!&lt;br</li>
            <li> All natural and not oily.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I like is all natural however it did not help my eyes in any way</li>
            <li> Just get professional help and see a skin clinic or your dermatologist..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even remotely old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my thirties and so far seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> probably only noticeable to me--but definitely real.  </li>
            <li> So far I like the product.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for a month.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this eye cream because the area around my eyes is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> It’s made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Nothing has helped so far.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work because it contains only a few, and natural, ingredients.</li>
            <li> ; look that really makes a big difference, I don&#x27;t think I can go without it now!</li>
            <li> I am 69 yrs old and have used lots of eye creams.  </li>
            <li> your eyes don&#x27;t have natural oil glands</li>
            <li> your eyes don&#x27;t have natural oil glands</li>
            <li> I  was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and helped clear up my under-eye circles after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the balm-y feel of it</li>
            <li> will bring me some surperise change in near furture.</li>
            <li> greasy, like you are wearing Vaseline, but it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> All natural is just a bonus.  </li>
            <li> I am afro american and very sceptic to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can also put it near my eyes</li>
            <li> I am already depressed and self conscious about it</li>
            <li> If it helps at all I am a 30 year old Tagalog Philippino non smoker.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something with natural ingredients and tried it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural to boot.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin, no redness, and definitely see results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> From here on in, I will stick to professional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this product has not been an issue with that thus far, it has offered relief.</li>
            <li> , it goes on like soft butter.</li>
            <li> Still, i like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like you need a lot of product</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have sensitive skin, and oily skin</li>
            <li> and I also use it for my lips because of the hydration and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> a young teenager&#x27;s acne infested face on my nose.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my in the skin area under my eyes at all after going through a complete bottle.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, I have not seen any effect so far.  </li>
            <li> So far, I do not see any change.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and feels natural.  </li>
            <li> So far works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li> As for the second jar, went straight to the garbage.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, and the jar can last a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural ingredients as stated on the label which I appreciate</li>
            <li> I use it only at nights as it is very greasy and can not be used under make up.</li>
            <li> This product combined with drinking lots of water daily has made the blackness under my eyes appear much lighter.</li>
            <li> But in the morning, the skin around my eyes is soft, well hydrated, and not puffy.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using ita few days so far, a friend of my already commented on how much better the darker circles under my eyes look.  </li>
            <li> Not to the smell or to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was suppose to be all natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but for me this product is not up to par.</li>
            <li> It smelled old like it might be out of date.</li>
            <li> However, I do have to give it props for being all natural and organic</li>
            <li> like how natural it is.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something natural to use on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> and I read that you can use it 2 times per day for faster results, but I saw fast enough results with just using it one time a day.</li>
            <li> they still made me feel old.</li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product under my eyes before bed for 2 weeks now and it seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to find something natural.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> The thing that got me to try this product was that there are no harsh chemicals just sitting on my skin from this product.</li>
            <li> After reading about the All Natural Queen Bee Eye Cream, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues, so that is another plus.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and softens the lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream because all its ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> natural NO chemical</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really balmy.</li>
            <li> but I also use it on my cheeks over old acne scars.</li>
            <li> I must say my skin is sensitive, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Even hours after, my skin is still so soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Using it anywhere near your eyes in the day time will make your vision blurry.</li>
            <li> Makeups became common, but I was looking for a better solution.</li>
            <li> and my husband say I look young just like a Queen again.</li>
            <li> Everything in this cream is natural and proven to do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> It last forever, and it really does moisturize your eyes at night.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and makes my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly three weeks.</li>
            <li> it works so far..</li>
            <li> all natural NO chemical and like it.&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pleased with the effectiveness, price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like that it has natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> and I am pleasantly surprised at the results so far.  </li>
            <li> It also makes the skin around my eyes silky soft which is another plus.  </li>
            <li> The product does not work very well, but moderate results can be seen after two months for myself.</li>
            <li> that I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it NATURAL</li>
            <li> w/ a natural product.</li>
            <li> I am 45 yrs old</li>
            <li> 2nd, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really see a different....</li>
            <li> I think its much too pricey though and would recommend it only as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin feels &amp; looks softer and the product has never caused any skin reaction - a testament to its all natural composition.  </li>
            <li> and I like knowing that what I am putting on my skin is all naturally made.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> it leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for all natural under eye cream for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking radiant and soft.</li>
            <li> shipping with this company, and their product so far is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used so many eye creams before and found they actually irritate eyes and sensitivity making me look like i am crying.</li>
            <li> decided to use the cream once more a few weeks after and got the same reaction.</li>
            <li> The next morning the laugh line melts back into my skin and become unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle in a jar though, it will not completely erase dark circles for most people.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I was surprised by the waxy substance, but thought that I need to at least give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very similar to Vaseline, and I put it on every night, hoping that the gross feeling was worth it since it was supposed to make the circles go away.  </li>
            <li> I have used expensive cosmetic counter eye creams and this is just as good as all of them.  </li>
            <li> I have no intentions of going back to my old creams that are full of chemicals and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Seeing all of the positive reviews I was very optimistic to finally find a product that could help alleviate the naturally dark circles under my eyes but this product has really neither helped nor hurt.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my nighttime routine, but in the morning I have to be careful to only put a very thin layer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also excellent for those who live in dry cold areas as it counteracts dryness but is manageable enough to wear under make up.</li>
            <li> understand what people mean about the out of the box consistency being kinda like candle wax, but that&#x27;s just the top layer.</li>
            <li> Since using this product for a little over a month the undereye bags have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li> It keeps my whole face to very smooth and manageable to repair the dead cells that makes it brighten from the dark skin.</li>
            <li> It is a bit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;, but here in dry, hot California</li>
            <li> I noticed it took the dark circles and puffiness away quickly.</li>
            <li> my jar is still over half full.</li>
            <li> so it will probably take at least  few more weeks or even a couple of months of consistent use of this cream to see real results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now, and I have definitely seen an improvement in the dark circles and fine lines under my eyes,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and I am very surprised that it has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> , I love that a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had little wrinkles, they went away pretty fast, my skin is so moisturized.</li>
            <li> I also applied some to my laugh line when I noticed that the other day.  </li>
            <li> I have to laugh when I read some of the other reviews-</li>
            <li> I have purchased many products that claim to alleviate dark circles and none worked as well as this product has in such a short time.  </li>
            <li> Even though your under-eye may look a little shiny for the first hour, it will not dry out like other eye creams, which makes our wrinkles more apparent .</li>
            <li> Sometimes a little red dot will appear under an eye, but it&#x27;s nothing much and is gone almost as quickly as it came, without leaving any mark.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes a little red dot will appear under an eye, but it&#x27;s nothing much and is gone almost as quickly as it came, without leaving any mark.  </li>
            <li> The natural formula helps because I have very sensitive skin and with many chemicals I get skin rashes, especially on the delicate skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> jar is a little smaller than I expected, but I still expect this to last me a while, and I think it is definitely worth the money if I continue to see this level of improvement, and hopefully more as time goes on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working for my fine lines or winkles.</li>
            <li> My friends have mentioned how much younger and vibrant I look.</li>
            <li> Bees wax is just a selling point and only is used to keep the two main ingredients (olive oil and Shea butter) in a emollient form.</li>
            <li> I read some pretty outstanding reviews and decided to make the expensive plunge and purchase one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty consistently, once a day (at night) for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase a product from Origins for a lot more $$ with results not lasting all day.</li>
            <li> It really helps and the price is much less than many other products I&#x27;ve seen for the same issue.</li>
            <li> I guess I fell for the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t do enough research that this product has high clore clogging ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for daily use.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good moisturizer to apply at night, and after a few week my dark circles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> IT DID NOTHING SPECIAL AFTER MY PEDICURES; BUT I DID NOT WANT TO WASTE MONEY.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference so far only after a few days and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for using all natural ingredients in this all natural product for an woman who loves a natural facial appearance.</li>
            <li> There is still a light shade of darkness but it defiantly all small.</li>
            <li> Now that my under-eye area is free of dark circle, I can say that the product really helped and would recommend it to all those looking to fight against dark circles.</li>
            <li> but I have no dark circles now after using Queen bee for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> It took my eyes over a week to get back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products to reduce my dark circles, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I waited a few months to write my review because I wanted to see the full results.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the price was a little high</li>
            <li> It can be a tad oily but absorbs well, so I use it right before I go to sleep and wake up with soft skin around my eyes, no dry patches like I had with other products.</li>
            <li> Instead, I noticed that the few fine lines I have seem to double in number.  </li>
            <li> The weather has been so dry lately that my face was showing more wrinkles than normal.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it for less than a month, I can definitely see a significant improvement around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Being only 23 years old I was becoming very insecure of how my eyes looked and only felt secure with makeup on which I generally don&#x27;t like to wear as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In July I started using all organic products, never throwing out a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; product until I could see definite results from my new organic purchases.  </li>
            <li> So I came back to make a new order this time one for me and one for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it at night and in the morning under my concealer and it works really well, the skin around my eyes feels softer and not so dry anymore</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product however because I like using it on the delicate under eye skin compared to regular lotion because it seems to provide more moisture.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning my under eyes were red, puffy, scaly, and itched so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m getting ready to order my second jar now (used faithfully, one jar will last me about 3 months).</li>
            <li> I have been using your all natural Queen Bee eye cream for only two days and have began to notice clear results.</li>
            <li> I actually use the back of my fingernail to stab at it a bit, to break it off the whole.</li>
            <li> When I first found out about Queen Bee Eye Cream, I was searching for an all natural cream to get rid of my dark circles and improve the skin under my eyes reversing the age.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft the next morning.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for the dark circles under my eyes, other than to make them super greasy.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly get anything off the top without digging my nail into it, and that wouldn&#x27;t really help much either because then I&#x27;d just be rubbing a hard clump of stuff around my face, but it would never rub in.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from major bags, from a number of things, from lack of sleep to allergies plus its hereditary .  </li>
            <li> After using Queen Bee for a week or two I saw major improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of expensive brand name eye creams but this $20 eye cream is a  magic!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what it feels like 2-3 weeks in, definitely recommend considering the price point and the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> The fact that it is 100% All-Natural, Organic and Contains NO cancer causing additives or preservatives is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything significant.</li>
            <li> - sometimes I will apply it first thing to my skin &amp; apply other products/moisturizers over it in the daytime.</li>
            <li> After applying this product under my eyes each night at bedtime for the last week or two, I have already noticed a significant improvement on the dark circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and within three days could see a major reduction in the darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are fading away and my wrinkles are less notable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be very careful, this stuff can be very harmful and there is no Manufacture Information on it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say whether or not my dark circles have faded or if my wrinkles have gotten better ( I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks)</li>
            <li> First, I was under the impression that creams made for specific purposes like removing the black area under the eyes, are like any other creams available in the market, they just assign each cream to a specific problems, but at the end they are all creams.</li>
            <li> I have spent much more for a similar product by dr haushka and this is comparable, us made and much less costly.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing in it other than these natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Like many other people, I have tried various products in an attempt to reduce my dark circles, however, none seemed to make a difference even after months of use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li> After finding this product online, I wanted to give it a try, and already now, in less than 3 months I am witnessing tremendous changes to the contrast under my eyes and skin overall.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement, the cream is quite oily, I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if the effects take longer (I have quite dark circles) took two months of use</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who has the patience to use Queen Bee daily or twice daily.</li>
            <li> I rotate a few high quality moisterizing items, this among, them and do not want to use this up too fast</li>
            <li> I am an African American women I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are no more with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to positive results and trying other products of this brand.</li>
            <li> After reading other positive reviews I decided to give this balm a try.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my jar is bad lol</li>
            <li> There was a lot, so it should last for quite a long time, however, I just didn&#x27;t notice any real difference.</li>
            <li> I never had dark circles just a few more lines around my eyes than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product to help my chronic dark circles but was surprised at how fast it rehydrated my skin.  </li>
            <li> these dark circles are no joke it could really take away from your natural beauty but with this product I see a difference</li>
            <li> a friend gave me this product as a gift &amp; it definitely changed the way I look at natural products..</li>
            <li> The circles are barely noticeable and the lines under my eyes are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> It is very waxy which is expected since an ingredient is beeswax.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the All Natural Queen Bee eye cream to a friend.</li>
            <li> and Im surprised because my blemishes looks smaller too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re dealing with dark eye circles, it&#x27;s absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li> Within two days of using Queen Bee the age-related dark circles under my eyes looked better than they had since their on-set, better than they had with using the dirty products, which I had to use daily in order to keep the minimum results.  </li>
            <li> It has very simple ingredients and is all natural.</li>
            <li> The first time i put it on under my eyes (to get rid of dark circles)</li>
            <li> Vitamin K can only go so far.</li>
            <li> I want to go out bare face</li>
            <li> but I can barely see any difference.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any dark eye circle cream</li>
            <li> WOW, only a week&#x27;s use</li>
            <li> But this stuff had basic and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> At 69 years old, all of a sudden</li>
            <li> I was barely scratching my nose anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old male by the way to.</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned it might cause acne breakouts, but it hasn&#x27;t so far.</li>
            <li> but thank god for this product that helps get rid of the dark circles at first when I got this product</li>
            <li> and there actually almost faded away completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy, and it makes my face look wet for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> The product is all natural, so that&#x27;s something definitely to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> It has all natural  ingredients such as Shea Butter, Olive oil, Coconut oil, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then I got a sample of a different brand with wild yam, arnica, and hydroxyproline in it.  </li>
            <li> does not do as advertised, so far, and it has been used for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it on my entire face, it leave you skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Be careful, the ingredients are very pore clogging and can give pimples and milia.  </li>
            <li> , the texture is soft and creamy at the same time.</li>
            <li> When I am looking in the mirror in a well-lit room, the improvements seem to be there, but just barely.</li>
            <li> I started applying it 2-3 weeks back so its too early to say anything.</li>
            <li> I used the product for one week hoping it was something that might be worth using to treat the dark circles under my eyes and help with the puffiness, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> :) I recommend it to anymore with dark circles and fluffy eyes.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was skeptical from the start putting forth the $$ once again for another product I didn&#x27;t figure would work..</li>
            <li> However, I figured I&#x27;d try it because so many people found it helpful and because I was so tired of looking like I was pulling all-nighters</li>
            <li> I’ve had a problem with dark puffy circles under my eyes for many years, which made me look old and tired no matter how much sleep I got.  </li>
            <li> The cream had lots of tiny hard balls in it and these balls didn&#x27;t melt easily when put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I am not certain that the dark circles have decreased in intensity but it definitely keeps the area well-moisturized and concealer is easy to apply on top.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you put on a very small amount, it might be fine.</li>
            <li> Other eye creams left me with a burning sensation but Queen Bee is natural and gentle on the skin and has helped reduce redness.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and very fine wrinkles under my eyes because of my pale skin and working 12 hour shifts in the hospital; this started working wonders in just 3 days!</li>
            <li> First of all, the texture is not very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> If you use it just for around eyes it would last for a long time, because the quantity is relative large for eye cream.</li>
            <li> It has a greasy texture and actually seemed to make my dark circles a little more noticable the day after I used it</li>
            <li> I almost sold out to write a glowing review for my free jar with purchase...but the only reason I would want the free jar is to make up for the amount of money I spent on a useless product.</li>
            <li> It shipped out fast and got here on the earliest day expected!</li>
            <li> The other thing I would like to point out is when you put it on it makes your skin look very shiny.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 other products before this and they did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> Per reading other reviews I used it on my whole face not just my eyes.</li>
            <li> May I recommend: get a little extra sleep at night, laugh a lot, don&#x27;t smoke,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Albeit a few days, I did notice my dark circles lighten up a bit, and I shall continue using it! :)</li>
            <li> I no longer have red puffy skin and no dark circles.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I realized long ago that spending so much money on eye creams that didn&#x27;t really do anything was ridiculous, and I didn&#x27;t try another till a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it has actually lightened a facial scar, and makes my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I think it is completely overpriced for such a tiny jar with a label that looks like someone made on their home printer.</li>
            <li> As it contains all natural ingredients, I have used it not only for eyes but also for my entire face at night.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars for it working so well for my lips, for having such simple natural ingrediants and keeping moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> Now, and since this is a product review, i would have to state &amp;#34;Queen Beez&#x27;, is the only product i&#x27;ve used so far, that does not contain caffeine (which would actually aggravate a sinus infection) that works!</li>
            <li> I occasionally get a rough spot under an eye or on my face which this cream really helps to soften and in time remove.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the past 3 weeks and most of the dark circle is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve inherited that lovely feature especially when tired.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love all of the natural ingredients, I don&#x27;t feel guilty using it because I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping dark circles yet, but usually nothing works on those, so even if it helps a little I&#x27;ll be happy!</li>
            <li> I had large bags and dark circles under my eyes as a result of hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> it is a little greasy when you first apply it</li>
            <li> With Queen Bee, I started seeing some results almost immediately and major improvements after only 3 days!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised about the note from the seller asking me to write a review in order to get a jar free, usually this is not a good sign; but I have to say I am pretty please with the product.</li>
            <li> but I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again after I finish it because there are moisturizers out there that work fine for less than half the price of this.</li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend this under eye cream to be used everyday to remove dark circles.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have had dark circles my whole life and have tried pretty much every high priced cream as well as just almond oil (also works well).</li>
            <li> I am very pale so my dark circles are more from that than from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> I am still using the product, but can&#x27;t really tell any difference in my dark under-eye circles or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for dark circles and wrinkles and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any differences, but I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> But I have been using it for 4 days and it the dark circles are really fading.</li>
            <li> I had dark circles under my eyes that cover the whole underpart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dark circles my whole life</li>
            <li> my husband really loves this for his dark circles</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that had vitamin K in it because I was told that really helps with fixing dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Aaaand, it really does decrease the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on reducing dark circles, but I really hope it does.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed any change w/ the dark rings under my eyes, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have dark circles, (yet)</li>
            <li> It has seemed to help with my dark circles some but not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> so I think it really depends what is causing the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in my dark eye shadows</li>
            <li> I do what I can, but the dark circles under my eyes continued to be a real challenge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really want to thank the creators, because this product has helped me to decrease the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really believe in the natural ingredients used and I will continue to use it for the next few months and buy another jar.</li>
            <li> The dark circles have improved too, just not as much as the rosacea has improved.  </li>
            <li> I really need something to help with my hereditary dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have hederitary dark circles and I have tried everything to get rid of them but nothing really seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Truth be told it does absolutely nothing for the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> A1 Cream smells like shea butter goes on smooth only need a VERY small amout Must have</li>
            <li> This only helps to moisturize the area around your eyes, but other than that, it doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my first jar a few months ago.</li>
            <li> My eyes made me look deprived of life, sad or depressed and they are nearly gone now, I feel so much better about my self and my face especially!!!</li>
            <li> Its is pretty heavy</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I first opened the jar and saw how firm it was.</li>
            <li> A small amount was applied, but never seemed to be absorbed by the skin - face looked greasy, fell greasy, rubbed off on pillow.  </li>
            <li> I live in Northern Colorado and the air is very dry.  </li>
            <li> my dark circles seem a little less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for creating a product that I feel safe using since I know it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> next morning my circles look lighter but after a few hours they come right back.</li>
            <li> Since I was little I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about my huge dark circles.</li>
            <li> 100% All Natural, organic under eye cream with few hundred high</li>
            <li> This is more like a petroleum based product than a cream, but the next morning when I awaken after using Queen Bee, my wrinkles are noticably less, my skin is soft and moisturized and I never thought I would say that my dark circles seem less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin that when I wear other face creams near my eyes, I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off and throw the product in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> (I apply it all over around the eye), keeps wrinkles around eye kinda relaxed &amp; smoothed for a few hours before it fully absorbed into the skin, after that you&#x27;d need to apply again (I would say at least twice a day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely more PM cream because it&#x27;s oily, but I apply just a little bit under my regular eye cream before I leave home too</li>
            <li> I am a family practice physician and very careful when it comes to advising my patients about any particular product.  </li>
            <li> This product within a reasonable amount of time (2 and a half weeks as I&#x27;m writing this) takes care of that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others are also likely to respond differently to it and may or may not see more dramatic results than I did.</li>
            <li> Then leave the skin damp after gently washing the soap off, so less amount of bee-wax I apply on the face could spread throughout.</li>
            <li> The color of the under eye area is much lighter compared to what i had previously.</li>
            <li> I keep it on hand for the dry MN winters, but I only use it sparingly when my skin feels really dry since it&#x27;s just too heavy/greasy for me to use very often.</li>
            <li> I noticed my wrinkles were less noticeable, but the real difference was how moist my skinned stayed.  </li>
            <li> It is greasy but soaks into to dry skin leaving it soft with a sheen.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it can be dry.</li>
            <li> As a blonde, I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life and now they truly are much lighter.  </li>
            <li> This is third day aim using i really got hope that it reduce my dark circle and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to keep using this, but so far from what i&#x27;ve seen, if you want a day to day eye cream that will help your circles each time you use it- instead of concealer, this is for you, but don&#x27;t buy it expecting long lasting results-</li>
            <li> It works okay at removing dark circles, at least somewhat.</li>
            <li> not fan , its super thick and has done nothing for my eyes .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my dark circles are the result of very thin skin--my eyes aren&#x27;t sunken, but the skin under my eyes has always been recessed, a definite line between it and the skin over my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li> When you open the jar, the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is actually solid, which is a little disconcerting at first.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, so it will last a long time, and it is definitely helping my fine lines and dry patches!</li>
            <li> At first, it was little difficult to use this cream since it didnt look like a regular eye cream -- it was more like a vaseline.</li>
            <li> using this Queen Bee 100% All-Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream for (3) nights, I am seeing really progress and the black area is starting to to go away.</li>
            <li> do I use it: I gently apply African Black Soap on my face.</li>
            <li> It does a good job moisturizing, but it is so greasy that I would rather use a much less expensive moisturizing cream instead.</li>
            <li> This product was very hard and wouldnt smooth onto my face.</li>
            <li> (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t turn it down at this point!)</li>
            <li> I have under eye discoloration under my right eye due to hereditary and constant rubbing due to allergies.</li>
            <li> It can stay a little on the greasy side of you apply too much</li>
            <li> Also, it makes your face really oily if you don&#x27;t wipe a little off with a paper tower or something.</li>
            <li> Tried a few other creams and they were successful in irritating my skin and making me breakout.</li>
            <li> I believe it will help with the fine lines, but not totally sure about the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it did anything for my dark circles, but it did help with the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> fine lines that are only getting worse</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends who suffer from dark circles.</li>
            <li> The circles are now less dark and less prominent.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I had a skin irritation, especially pimples, I also applied a little bit on the skin and found it very helpful with that area.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hands and other skin areas that are super dry due to the winter weather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few very high end creams that cost three to four times this price.  </li>
            <li> Very little change in dark circle or lines but definitely smooth out the skin.</li>
            <li> Am a little skeptical about the very positive reviews, as a card was included with the shipment offering free product for a comment on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Probably the secret is that I&#x27;ve been using it religiously at night and under my makeup everyday, I love the fact that it is completely natural and I&#x27;m not putting God knows what in my face.</li>
            <li> However, after applying this product under my eyes each night at bedtime for the last few weeks, I have noticed a significant improvement on the dark circles under my eyes!  </li>
            <li> and my dark circles have lightened up, there is so much product in the jar I will have it for a long time and keep re ordering!</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have mentioned that the cream is too thick and it is a goo idea to only apply it right before you fall asleep, but I beg to differ.</li>
            <li> I have been using the balm under my eyes twice a day for the month and a half and WOW what a difference!!</li>
            <li> As a person who had never had any allergy to the skin care products I previously used, I had not expected this 100% all natural Queen Bee cream would even bring the smallest redness on my face.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t do much about my genes, using this eye cream along with getting my allergies under control, I do so a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and have noticed no real difference with my under eye dark circles, puffiness or fine lines.</li>
            <li> I learned last year that I&#x27;m allergic to Methylisothiazolinone and Methylcholoroisothiasolinone that both are  cheap preservatives used in 90% of  major (including the expensive ones) cosmetic brands.</li>
            <li> However, I was very surprised at the greasiness of the product and that it literally sits up on the skin and is not absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> For the TINY amount you get I would advise you try out a couple of other products that cost half as much as this and then make this product yourself for all of 4$!</li>
            <li> The price is right, the cream is thick but lasts a long time on, wear it under your daily make-up and apply twice daily for the ultimate effect.  </li>
            <li> it took about an HOUR to dry, and even then it doesnt dry completely.</li>
            <li> I actually use it all over my face and it has been great during this very cold and dry winter.  </li>
            <li> This product clearly outperforms the other products used.  </li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of expensive products like Hydrolyze or Murad and saw a little bit of change but wasn&#x27;t very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is very hard--like a wax, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, no lingering residue like other products because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hydrating and does not irritate the skin with no harsh smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting either like other eye creams I&#x27;ve used, and I I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> last a long time since only a tiny amount is needed for application&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> It might looks a little bit hard , but give it some stirs using your figure and it&#x27;ll melt very quickly.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and greasy and does not soak into my skin.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, then the itching began to become less and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I think it might be helping a little, but definitely won&#x27;t remove the eye bags completely.</li>
            <li> The only reason I dont give this product a 5 star is because I have very long hair and during the night my hair touches my face</li>

            <li> The outer half of each circle is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> The outer half of each circle is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Now I have dry flaky red skin under my eyes, DONT BUY THIS, I have to go to the doctor now, and my eyes hurt and are swollen, this is all I have been using under my eyes</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a slight improvement so far.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a cream of dry facial patches when they arise.</li>
            <li> In the next few days I saw my puffiness clearly shrink and some of my wrinkles disappeared too.</li>
            <li> Only 1/4 through the bottle can&#x27;t wait til its empty to see the total effect</li>
            <li> and when I was pregnant, the smell was even worse.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that organic doesn&#x27;t mean safe.  </li>
            <li> I dried my skin around my eyes, and I looked very old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several months and have not seen a single change.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that everything in it is natural and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 7 days and after the 3rd application I began noticing that my dark circles have definitely lightened up.  </li>
            <li> The changes I have seen have been very gradual but after about a week, the dark bruising I have is less noticeable.</li>

            <li> and I feel the effect would be same if I simply put olive or any other type of oil.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other similar products that did not work as well.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews, I was expecting a much smaller jar but its actually MUCH larger than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It is creamy, yes, but its ingredients are not any different than other similar eye creams.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be very natural and is not strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li> This is just a little container of moisturizing mixes of natural oils.</li>
            <li> No dark circles, less wrinkles, no burning eyes, no</li>
            <li> those who have had a bad experience and claim the rest of us are lying for a free jar, or that it is a complete scam on the company&#x27;s part: everyone&#x27;s skin is different and it will not be a guaranteed hit with each customer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not get the offer to get a free cream if I wrote a review :</li>
            <li> and you get a free jar of cream that is fake.</li>
            <li> This is when I became skeptical, so rather than review immediately for the free offer, I wanted to wait.</li>
            <li> I have no facial lines or wrinkles, but I do have deep dark circles and I am hoping this organic product will help.</li>
            <li> I ve been using it for 6 months regularly and sometimes it seems that my dark circles and puffiness actually worsened.  </li>
            <li> Ethnically I have skin that is medium dark (hispanic and African origins) with a red hue...</li>
            <li> I am starting to see my dark under eyes starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful that I would be able to see a difference after using this product, but unfortunately, I continue to deal with the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I will update my review in two months to help out potential buyers and people who also suffer from dark circles constantly searching for the holy grail product.</li>
            <li> Although my dark circles are not deep but they are visible enough.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles (I&#x27;m African American</li>
            <li> I am African American, and have suffered from dark under eye circles for years.</li>
            <li> goes a long way</li>
            <li> and i will continue to use this one as long as it continues to work.</li>
            <li> It did not take long to arrive in the mail either.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay like that for long.</li>
            <li> The jar lasts a long time</li>
            <li> have remained supply soft in the harsh winter.  </li>
            <li> The darkness under my eyes is not completely gone, though.  </li>
            <li> It takes too long to absorb and makes the makeup start to run.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long</li>
            <li> The outcome was the same - absolutely no change.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged guy</li>
            <li> This does not have long term changes for me.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t have long term results to report yet.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin) waste of money.</li>
            <li> (not really a cream, its different but it</li>
            <li> Was a complete waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients, but I wish it had worked :(</li>
            <li> Because it is so thick you really have to rub it to get it on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The texture is a little thick, but you will quickly get used to that.</li>
            <li> But I always get guessed a few years older than I really am due to the wear and tear</li>
            <li> I found that Queen Bee not only diminished my dark circles and kept my skin glowing and firm, but it also helped me sleep, having insomnia I often find trouble going to bed, after applying this eye cream it helped me want to close my eyes and head right off.</li>
            <li> but I am in love right now with this product only after 4 days which is shocking.</li>
            <li> Though this product is very thick, it does go on very smooth (warms with your finger), though at first I was afraid it would be all over my pillow in the morning, that was not the case.</li>
            <li> My eyes immiadetely looked different and the black circles are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> It proved to be a promise keeper by doing exactly what is promised removing my black circles under my eyes and small lines that had just started to appear on the sides of my eyes.</li>
            <li> very soothing and moisturizing, no more undereye darkness!</li>
            <li> It might seem a little oily at first, but it will absorb into your skin (just keep your hair away from it for a little while!).</li>
            <li> The only slight down side is the cream is slightly greasy/oily and looks a bit shiny around the eyes, but as it is meant to be applied at night that really doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I do have to put it on after I cleanse my face in the morning and let it dry while I have breakfast, but it doesn&#x27;t take long..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying though, as long as the results deliver!</li>
            <li> I threw it out &amp; used the other gritty jar as cuticle cream.</li>
            <li> I threw it out &amp; used the other gritty jar as cuticle cream.</li>
            <li> the other eye product that I was using made by a different company).</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other people, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> As stated by other reviewers, this is a solid eye cream and melts with your body heat.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the eye cream was different (unlike other creams)</li>
            <li> my eyes like other products, it&#x27;s only for UNDER eyes(and</li>
            <li> Maybe it just works different for other ppl.</li>
            <li> Due to this, I am using this product only at nights and not during day time.</li>
            <li> what... this stuff works better than any expensive, toxin-filled products that I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> Will definitely look into other products this seller has to offer from this line.</li>
            <li> I combine it with other essential oils/antioxidants etc</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing that i noticed is that it DOES NOT sting the way other similar products sting once they land up in the eye.</li>
            <li> I have used other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made them tear all the time.</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing, it is in a jar in solid form, but once touched, it turns to oil.  </li>
            <li> try other cheaper products that have the same effect as this one.</li>
            <li> I have not had this for very long and do not use it every day</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product, especially if you feel any irritation.</li>
            <li> A jar lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> but my skin tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> It draws up the under eye puffiness and moisturizes away the dry cracks around my lips and chin from shaving(Yes</li>
            <li> When I try to apply concealer, the concealer cakes because my skin is so dry.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this cream especially on really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also the skin was dry and that has cleared up.</li>
            <li> and I already see an improvement for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a normal/ dry skin combination and I use queen&#x27;s bee as my night cream.</li>
            <li> I had crepey, dry eyes.</li>
            <li> since I was a highschooler (football and track athlete) I&#x27;ve always suffered from dry skin</li>
            <li> However, all was not lost - I now use this as a hair product on my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> but....I have also been using on my dry elbows and it works like a dream.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this on dry patches of skin too.  </li>
            <li> As a result, my eyelids are inflammed and  have patches of eczema that are itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> It has not been a drastic or lasting change though so I am still giving it time since I only got it a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and has done wonders for my dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> It will not completely remove dark circles, but it definitely reduces the appearance of them.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that is helping me with my life long dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This did not live up to the claims.</li>
            <li> I was worried that maybe it would not live up to the hype</li>
            <li> Too early to say whether the dark circles have gone down</li>
            <li> , that is after using it every single night.</li>
            <li> The little jar will last a long, long time</li>
            <li> I have noticed a softening of the lines and less puffiness, and I do like the consistency of the eye cream, which will make it long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that there are other less expensive products that would also do this</li>
            <li> I found the product to be very greasy after applying, it was not a good idea to put on in the morning before my makeup.  </li>
            <li> YES after only a FEW days I&#x27;m starting to see a little lighter apperarance from my dark eye circles&amp;#62; I have even decided toplace on my whole face to see if it will help with a little sagging here and</li>
            <li> I was starting to have semi dark coloring under my eyes, and a line was forming under my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing instant improvements with this product with regards to dark circles.</li>
            <li> I hv been using it regularly for 1 month now but no reduction in dark circle.</li>
            <li> I needed  something to help alleviate the  dark circles underneath my eyes that were caused from me not sleeping enough.</li>
            <li> The dark circles are still visible, but like I said, it has only been 3 days.</li>
            <li> Feel younger without those dark circles and my skin feels softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would help, but I&#x27;m not too optimistic at this point, for it to actually work on the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend after she noticed dark circles starting to develop under her eyes.</li>
            <li> It definitely diminishes dark circles &amp; hydrates the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24-year-old male, and I wanted to get rid of my dark circles and</li>
            <li> My dark circles are starting to fade!</li>
            <li> BUT,  on my dads european side of the family, they suffer from genetic under eye bags, and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that reduced my dark circles prior to using this!  </li>
            <li> but I did not notice any difference in dark under eye circles, lines and puffiness and fades facial wrinkles as stated in the description!!...</li>
            <li> but it definitely does not lessen dark circles/ under eye bags in any way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily need it for dark circles</li>
            <li> Try to face your face and applly this cream which smells like a white diary chocolate and do wonders to remove your dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes all my life and this is the only thing that has faded them.</li>
            <li> After using this product not only did the dark circles remain, but I also saw/</li>
            <li> The only problem is getting the product out of such a small jar because I have long nails, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I have deep dark bruises around my eyes; that&#x27;s chronic illness for you.</li>
            <li> started looking for some eye cream products, and initially started using a Neutrogena product that helped - I saw about a 50% improvement in the &#x27;sagging&#x27; bags under my eyes, but it had no impact on the dark circles (that reddish, purplish &#x27;swoosh&#x27; under the eye).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m starting to see some changes I had dark circles all my life</li>
            <li> Only had this a couple weeks, but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I placed the creme under my eyes every night before bed and the dark circles are definitely fading and my skin feels softer abd smoother.</li>
            <li> I bought it for dark circles and it has definitely helped.</li>
            <li> have struggled with dark circles since teen years.</li>
            <li> If you were to browse all my orders here on Amazon, you will find a ton of different products for dark circle remover</li>
            <li> did not notice any lasting results, there is no miracle and all my wrinkles and dark circles</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dark circles since I was a teenager, I am starting to think it may have something to do with genetics.</li>
            <li> I found this eye cream and it started reducing my dark circles by the third day of using it day and night.</li>
            <li> I have moderate dark circles from my hectic schedule as well as heredity.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily purchase it for the dark circles, but just to keep the area under my eyes and my lips moist.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say that I have noticed a big difference in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> it seems to help my dark circles but hasn&#x27;t totally done away with them...</li>
            <li> I guess it is too soon for big changes as my dark circles are still there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really dark circles on medium-brown skin my entire life, and graduate school is not helping my cause.</li>
            <li> but I am already seeing reduction in dark circles in only two weeks.</li>
            <li> I wish I could be refunded for this product because it was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed improvement with lines and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for several monthes, I see no change in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dark bags under their eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with dark circles my entire life.</li>
            <li> puffiness and dark circles are still the same.</li>
            <li> I like this faint sweet aroma too.</li>
            <li> It’s a little hard to get out of the container at first, but now I am used to it.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, in my own home when looking in the mirror, it is impossible to see any improvements.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 3 days and the swelling in my eyes have already gone down.</li>
            <li> This made me look much older and tired than I actually am.</li>
            <li> Finally broke down, sucked up the macho pride, and bought some eye cream to try and get rid of the bags/dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t replace it right away and noticed wrinkles that I didn&#x27;t have while using this product and some serious dark circles!</li>
            <li> While it has been only a couple of days, I can tell there is a slight difference in my dark circles, however my wrinkles have stayed the same.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with my eyes due to allergies, and I tried using another brand&#x27;s &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; eye cream, which left my eyes red and puffy!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eyes are slightly less dry, and look forward to seeing the results even more when the cold winter subsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doing that definitely causes my eyes to appear less wrinkly under makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a jar of this balm and have been using it for the last month and a half in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li> I recently received my order less than a week ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waxy substance due to the fact that it is made of beeswax, coconut oil, and other things that are a solid when in room temperature.</li>
            <li> As regards the dark circle under my eyes, I don&#x27;t see much difference; because I often stay up late</li>
            <li> I have only been using this eye cream which is the consistecy of vasoline  for less than a week</li>
            <li> If the progress continues in the same rate, I expect the black areas to vanish in the coming (2) weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will probably go back to using my previous eye cream</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they put fragrance in a under eye cream, and yes it is just essential oil, but it still was enough to make my eyes swell shut every time I used this.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount gives you big returns.  </li>
            <li> but I will say it does make them look less obvious.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product I was skeptical about whether it would react with my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many eye creams over the past 2 years: expensive creams like Peter Thomas Roth burned when applied; the Clinique product didn&#x27;t do anything for me; and the Genefique product didn&#x27;t work for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was little weird to add this into my morning routine, but I&#x27;m glad I did as my dark circles/bags have just about disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies that tend to leave my eyelids very dry.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin, so even though my skin looks greasy after application, it feels constricted and taut.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is very dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, so there are only a very few personal beauty care items that I consider &#x27;critical-can&#x27;t-live-without&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether it removes dark circles, but dark circles run in my family.  </li>
            <li> This really pissed me off to say the least!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;removes dark circles&amp;#34; claim but am not holding it against the product since there is no eye cream out there that will do much for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I only used this for a few weeks.. and have EXTREMELY dry skin.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this and read the ingredient list (which is limited to about 4 things) and the reviews, I said I have to try it!  </li>
            <li> Due to my work situation, I have to deal with some pretty serious sleep deprivation sometimes, and the dark circles under my eyes shout it to the world.</li>
            <li> and i was used to them , but few weeks back a co wroker pointed out how ugly the dark circles look , i was so upset and came to amazon for help and found this amazing product.</li>
            <li> The area is noticeably lighter, I have struggled w/ dark circles due to allergies my entire life.</li>
            <li> I had dark eye circles and after using the cream for a week, I noticed a big difference; My eyes definitely look brighter and the dark circles under my eyes are less</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit under my eyes each night and it does the trick at keeping the bags away.</li>
            <li> it will reduce puffiness and circles under eyes and only a little is needed.</li>
            <li> So I just kept rubbing in what I could each night, and, surely enough, the wax started softening a little bit to where, after about 2-3 times of swirling my index finger around the vat to get some on my finger and onto my eye, I could get the job</li>
            <li> I can only rub a little off at a time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little over a couple months into using this product and I can definitely see the difference.</li>
            <li> However when I used the product I was no difference in my under eye circles and it started to clog the pores under my circles giving me little white heads</li>
            <li> and i use only a little in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little waxy but again, you need that extra hydration at night (would not use in the daytime).  </li>
            <li> It felt greasy going on and I started to get little white bumps under my eyes from using it.</li>
            <li> And a little bit of this goes a long long way..</li>
            <li> use very little like I said it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy, and hard to take out of the jar -- difficult to apply (especially to the sensitive eye area).  </li>
            <li> i bought this for dark circles but on the actual jar it says nothing about removing dark circles.</li>
            <li> if i should find any negative about this product i will update my review but so far i have no real issues with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised nobody complained about this in the reviews.</li>
            <li> not sure have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> It sinks in, not greasy.</li>
            <li> wrinkled, puffy slits with two beady, green marbles staring back at you.  </li>
            <li> I tried the under eye treatment from Avon which had minimal affects.</li>
            <li> I even tried home remedies like cucumbers over the eyes nightly for 6 months which also had minimal affects.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days, but I can already say I am a fan.</li>
            <li> I hope that it will also reduce dark circles if I use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I received this product only a few day ago.  </li>
            <li> I have dark under eye circles from long hours at work and it bothers me a lot as I don&#x27;t like walking around like a zombie all the time</li>
            <li> have absolutely no allergies, I can use any type of cream on my body.</li>
            <li> I expected a cream based eye cream when ordering this.</li>
            <li> It might have affected crows feet minimally.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see long term how this product helps my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> I used to never really care about taking care of my skin over as a youngin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past that claims to help remove dark circles, but fails to do so.</li>
            <li> The only catch was I was about to leave on vacation in a few days and was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t receive it in time for me to take it along with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything with really no improvement.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put the eye cream on , she tries to lick it off.</li>
            <li> I think my money ($23) is well spent -</li>
            <li> but did not really work for me.  </li>
            <li> I do not want to discredit the product because it has worked for people, but if not much has worked for you then this probably won&#x27;t either.  </li>
            <li> , I will admit that I barely get any sleep since I usually have to be up for work at 5:00 am.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night because it&#x27;s just too heavy for makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> You can see difference later on, maybe like a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not really seeing any changes but will continue to use it and hopefully by the time the jar is empty</li>
            <li> have used this for about a month and see no improvement yet, will continue use till jar is empty</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my eyes, but since allergy season is on us, my poor nose has been peeling from me blowing my nose so much.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say except it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Also, it is too thick and actually began to block my pores under my eyes that looked like tiny bubbles.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product, so far I like the product, it helps my eyes to not look tired.</li>
            <li> I know a lot about skin care and all this product has is natural ingredients and vitamin k, not exactly amazing.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this cream for very long but already I notice a difference in the dark circles under my eyes, they appear lighter and after only a few day &amp; evening applications.  </li>
            <li> I would use this around other parts of my face my face and other dry patches around my body.  </li>
            <li> Since it has only been a week, I can start to see a slight difference on my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> and I can definitely say that my dark circles have become less visible.</li>
            <li> I used to have a number of breakouts a weak because my skin is very sensitive, and since using this product I have almost no pimples...ever!  </li>
            <li> could help me because I got ues to have dark dry puffy eyes</li>
            <li> I purchased it because the area around my eyes were puffy, flaky, dark, irritated and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used products that made my eyes constantly watering and other products that just dried up and did nothing after applying.</li>
            <li> I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have retinol or other products that conceal wrinkles by irritating your skin</li>
            <li> The size is small, but it only takes a little bit, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to tell about how much help this product has been with the dark circles</li>
            <li> The ER doctors tried to figure our what exactly caused such bad allergy, but the ingredients listed on the label are obviously incomplete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff before, the Radiant Eye Cream, which helped some, but it never helped completely get rid of my dark circles and lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started this stuff about a week ago, and I was very skeptical of it at first.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a hard wax, I expect the cream to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> In the second application I feel my eye firm and dark circle reduced.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my eyes are less dry.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for serious, natural moisturizer, this is your product.</li>
            <li> I was really wanting to see a difference in under eye dark circles, but alas...</li>
            <li> I had heredity dark circles but this product instantly moisturizers make skin and makes my dark circles look less noticeable.</li>
            <li> If you are a man who has &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; puffy eyes which make you look older and tired all the time get it.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the Queen Bee; a little goes a long way and it leaves the skin around your eyes feeling like silk.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> just so I don&#x27;t run out even though a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> , a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After a week of using the product I can see a difference already, dark circles under the eye line starting to show less and less.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product and because of this I do not hesitate to apply to other needy areas of my face.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the sensitive, delicate eye area and reduces typical wrinkling.  </li>
            <li> Once I got pregnant I had to let go of the harsh chemicals and randomly found this creme which I got because it is made with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not sure how one can be called an eye cream and the other a skin balm and yet do totally different things.  </li>
            <li> Other products reduced the darkness but Queen Bee has made me forget that it was a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week already, and have already gotten compliments from family and friends that something is different about my face</li>
            <li> I read other people&#x27;s reviews and ordered this product (all of them rated 5 stars and said it worked well.)  </li>
            <li> I have had discoloration under my eyes since I was in my teens due to allergies and other illnesses.  </li>
            <li> What results it has given in just a month, simple unbelievable.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am thinking this is due to the Vitamin K in the cream.</li>
            <li> When it happened the 1st time , i thought that it might be the other reason.</li>
            <li> have tried other products to reduce my eye circles, but nothing has worked as well as this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used under eyes, before bed, for the past couple months and definitely saw a difference in under eye darkness.</li>
            <li> I was worried that my organic products wouldn&#x27;t work as well as my old and more expensive dirty products.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely chapped lips that gets so blistered</li>
            <li> The next day when my lips usually start to crack up and pain, nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> I even use it over my cuticles when they are a bit rough!</li>
            <li> This has stopped that and is turning things the other way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like people to see I have any product on me that I use anything, but  it still works, also works in eliminating other wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It also works well on other areas of the face (using it on my forehead for wrinkles).</li>
            <li> little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It does nothing other than hydrate in a greasy format.</li>
            <li> The other reviews for this product made me give it a try</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the immediate effects of Queen Bee, I have been using it since the past week only.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the item works for  other people</li>
            <li> get a bit oily if not used in tiny small quantities.</li>
            <li> Unlike other under eye cream this stuff keeps you hydrated and yes, I have been noticing the lines going away</li>
            <li> Before this i had tried other products but they did not work it all all they did was hurt my skin or make me spend money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first</li>
            <li> and it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> nothing it doesn&#x27;t work at all other than greasing up my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep on using it and will post back updated results in a few month!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even getting my mom into it for her small facial lines/wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I put it on every morning under my eyes and you really only need a small amount and just blend it in</li>
            <li> It makes absolutely no difference on dark circles, minimizes puffiness around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, wish I did not buy the product.</li>
            <li> I would never put anything on my skin that has ingredients that are foreign to me or that I cannot pronounce.</li>
            <li> and i felt that it is unlike other creams.</li>
            <li> other creams i appled</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it will work as other reviews had implied.</li>
            <li> This is a small jar and the cream is yellow and feels like grease.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, terrible for lightening dark spots, it DOES NOT LIGHTEN DARK CIRCLES.</li>
            <li> I use the product for around the eye area and and even other areas of the face.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I use a little on the rest of my face if its feeling dry</li>
            <li> but you need so little everyday that this bottle should last for a while.</li>
            <li> Its hard to juggle work school and a social life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this under eye cream a few times, and I can already see a difference in my dark circles!</li>
            <li> It ordered it because I noticed dark circles under my eyes, not real dark but dark enough to do something about it before it got worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes for my dark circles, which in my case seems to be from thin skin and allergies.  </li>
            <li> I am always game to try something new.</li>
            <li> , I am a bit puzzled about HOW it works, because the simple ingredients listed on the product label aren&#x27;t usually associated with removal of dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I contains no fillers and secret scary chemicals like with most skin products out there.</li>
            <li> I used a expensive product that most like cause the extinction of three species and it hurt my eyes and made them worse as for wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve had lifelong dark circles around my eyes (you can see pictures of me as a kid with dark circles</li>
            <li> I have small dark circles and puffiness under my eyes which are starting to appear lighter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark circles about a week ago and so far not good, but for my mom, it has helped her a lot for her wrinkles, she says she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Seems like an unfair advantage for positive reviews.</li>
            <li> All the other products I saw on amazon looked like concealers that just covered up the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Due to allergies, I&#x27;ve had dark under my eyes all of my life and the darkness has lessen.</li>
            <li> This under eye cream has been extremely helpful in decreasing the dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> In my much younger days, I tried creams that were up to $90 a small jar, and if I noticed any difference at all it was so slight that I found I couldn&#x27;t rule out wishful thinking as the reason for &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; any improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously every night for the  past month and a half</li>
            <li> I was tempted to use other eye creams I have simply because this is so hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I actually can not believe it since I have tried at least 20 other products and none work to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I’ve used other vitamin K products with no noticeable difference, so I really thought that without sweet almond oil, my eyes would still look awful.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick cream that is a bit oily and takes awhile to completely absorb.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with slightly greasy looking hair in the front of my face due to the somewhat greasiness of this product.  </li>
            <li> push into the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; hard enough</li>
            <li> And yes, very little goes a long way in one application.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to get out of the small container, as it is solid you have continuously rub harder and harder to get some of the cream onto your fingers.</li>
            <li> I do not have dark circles per say</li>
            <li> Like lots of people with dark circles, I&#x27;ve tried everything.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles hvn&#x27;t removed at all.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any changes in my under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I bought Queen Bee trying to find something that would work as well on the dark circles under my eyes as what I had been using &amp; that had ingredients that are nontoxic.</li>
            <li> but it had no effect on dark circles</li>
            <li> For myself, I&#x27;ve thrown out everything that contains beeswax especially mascaras where it&#x27;s a common ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I started using this balm about a month ago, I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life and tried everything you can think of but nothing worked until I found this product, it did WONDERS under my eyes and for my face too.</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement in the dark circles under my eyes after using this product.</li>
            <li> I had dark under eye circles and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I have seen my dark undereye lighten up and my skin looks smoother.  </li>
            <li> I had dark cicles</li>
            <li> Despite all my uses, it just hasn&#x27;t helped my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes that I thought were caused by lack of sleep or stress.</li>
            <li> and already I noticed a change with my dark circles where they are gradually getting lighter.  </li>
            <li> Did nothing for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> i purchased it not in the hopes that it will work as an anti aging or anti dark circle product, but just as a moisturizer, given the ingredients.</li>
            <li> : bottom line is that no matter how much you apply, it does NOT moisturize AT ALL, it is difficult to take it out of the jar, AND it is not absorbed at all.</li>
            <li> Dark, baggy,</li>
            <li> after applying some on ur dark circles u can see like a shine to it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to remove or lighten your under eye dark circles, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> I had been using it for a while now but can&#x27;t say that it is erasing my dark circles already.  </li>

            <li> It turned out that I was wrong and their are some creams in the market that really works for what it is intended to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> use it to remove my dark circles caused by aenemia.</li>
            <li> I believe that over the years I have tried every product on the market that claims to reduce these dark circles (I&#x27;m 59) and not one of them has ever done anything to help.</li>
            <li> My dark circles do also appear to be lighter, but it took time (maybe two weeks or so) for the gradual lightening to take effect.</li>
            <li> and I can see lightening of the dark circles below my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you want to reduce your dark circles I reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s removed any dark shadows</li>
            <li> I have been using the Queen Bee under eye cream just a copule of weeks for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I got this balm for my dark circles but I have not seen improvement for some reason my dark circles get darker.</li>

            <li> I have hereditary dark circles, and have tried dozens and dozens of creams, serums, eye rollers, cucumbers, you name it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had puffy eyes and dark circles all my life, and can&#x27;t seem to get rid of them no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 8 different creams/oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product yet, as i&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days-</li>
            <li> I have also seen a lightening of the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I started to noticed a change with my dark circles get alittle bit lighter.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my dark circles after weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> This product has not improved the color of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> The dark circles did not appear overnight, so I can&#x27;t expect them to go away in a week.</li>

            <li> These dark circles I have are one of my biggest confidence issues about my self</li>
            <li> We both plan on continuing to use the product, since we can benefit from fewer dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearing 40 and don&#x27;t have crows feet, but I want to keep the wrinkles at bay while correcting the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have used it for just about a week ( three to four times a day) but already seen the improvements for my eyes dark circle and lines.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference in dark circles under eyes, maybe I&#x27;m beyond repair.</li>
            <li> and I wake up in the morning without dark circles.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are something fierce (even after applying mac concealer and foundation, which says alot)</li>
            <li> It has made the skin under my eyes firmer and the dark circles are going away.</li>
            <li> and when I wake up in the morning I can see a noticeable reduction of dark circles.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove dark circles for me</li>
            <li> I have hereditary bags and started to get dark discoloration under eyes also.</li>
            <li> But after a couple months using the product, my dark circles still there.</li>
            <li> I know for a fact it lightened my dark circles.</li>

            <li> defiantly lightens the dark circles</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles under my eyes and it&#x27;s not helped.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with dark circles under my eyes since I was child.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two months now and have  not seen a bit of difference with my hereditary dark circles.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to reduce dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would help induce dark under eye marks.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to others that have been searching for help with their dark circles.</li>
            <li> I can see my dark circles fading away, after like 3 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> AND, although I do not have dark circles I can attest my under eye skin</li>
            <li> This product has reduced the puffiness and dark circles on the lower part of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Heard all the reviews about dark circles being improved and was hoping this worked.  </li>
            <li> I saw zero lessening of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all to reduce dark circles.</li>
            <li> In addition, the Vitamin K works wonders by repairing leaky vessels causing those  unsightly dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone who have dark circles under the eyes, this works well when using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> This product did not remove my dark circles, however it did lighten them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life and tried everything you can think of but nothing worked until I found this product.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re DARK brown/purplish)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only reason for 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t noticed any immediate reduction in dark circles, but nothing can fix that overnight.</li>
            <li> I do not have dark circles, so cannot tell if this cream works for that.</li>
            <li> I give this a double negative five!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned, and I have under eye darkness that ages me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in dark circles at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some decrease in dark circles around my eye.</li>
            <li> and I have always had dark circles around my eyes from since I can remember.</li>
            <li> It is quite thick, which is what dermatologists say is necessary to hold moisture in for wrinkle prevention.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to make the money I spent on this wasted.</li>
            <li> I use it only at night since it&#x27;s really thick and shiny</li>
            <li> Customers ---Do Not Buy unless you&#x27;re looking for a Surf Wax to rub on your sensitive thin under eye area.</li>
            <li> and I have at least half a jar left</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a natural eye cream without all the chemicals and artificial ingredients other creams offer.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Did notice some slight lightening of the dark circles</li>
            <li> The dark circle is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My twins daughters who are 15 years have also slight dark</li>
            <li> My eyes feel less puffy and some of the dark circles have started to disappear.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles under my eyes are less noticeable, and the skin around my eyes appear firmer.  </li>
            <li> Queen Bee makes the lines and dark circles less visible.</li>
            <li> My wife, on the other hand, has said she thinks that the dark circles have been lightened a bit, with a few less wrinkles to show for it.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing as it too thick to be used in the morning, otherwise it is fine.</li>
            <li> but I know how bad my eyes have looked over the course of these past few years, and, when I noticed that they look better than they have in years already.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and only requires a very very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I was not aware that it has a strong VANILLA scent which is distracting and annoying.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim, as other products are so expensive and this was properly priced and appeared to have some real \\&quot;science\\&quot; behind the ingredients, and I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> After one evening, I can tell the skin around my eyes is softer and the wrinkles are slightly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and it looked like I had two black eyes.</li>
            <li> bought it for the purpose of helping with black bags.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful about its claims but so far it really seems to be reducing the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and i start to ues less</li>
            <li> and this has outperformed all of the is less time.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered less than a week after I placed the order.</li>
            <li> i have tried much mire expensive creams and the work fora while but after a few hours my skin is drying again.  </li>
            <li> so i wait about a half hour before i apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Anyone looking for a less toxic product to use on their face should try this.</li>
            <li> It made my wrinkles less noticeable in about 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Slight--</li>
            <li> It does give the appearance of less lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Every night, I put the eye cream all around my eyes (eyelid, under-eye area, and on my slight crow&#x27;s feet).  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is kept moisturized, I have noticed that my crows feet are less pronounced.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes felt less irritated after one application.</li>
            <li> I have a black eye?&amp;#34; two months ago.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an eye cream that could reduce my black circles for years.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a typical cream - it&#x27;s solidified oils blended together and feels sort of like lip balm.</li>
            <li> The area under my eyes is hydrated and has less noticeable wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Less than 2 days</li>
            <li> I want to begin by saying I have only been using this product for a week and am already noting subtle changes.</li>
            <li> They have become lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> There is less darkness and less puffiness already.  </li>
            <li> and I notice a slight improvement to the wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just less money in my account -_-</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a month on my face and neck</li>
            <li> use it for half month, hope it helps.</li>
            <li> I feel like there may be a slight change in the way my under eyes look.</li>
            <li> A little smoother and less dark.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it reduced my dark circle by a little....</li>
            <li> In fact the little dark circles I started to develop have also vanished.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with dark circles but the consistency is a little oily to use it in the day</li>
            <li> I will continue using for another 2 weeks to see if my dark circles get a little lighter if not i will stop using it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this eye cream, especially after reading all the positive reviews.?</li>
            <li> When I first tried this cream I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was pretty desperate to find something that worked.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product everyday for about 5 weeks on my dark eye circles and have seen no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks if the dark circles diminish.</li>
            <li> I never really got the promised results from the $100 + creams and had been using just almond oil for the past year.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to withhold judgment on this product, as it will take a few weeks to determine if it is going to work on dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Eye area looks fresher now and the dark circle vanished after few weeks.</li>
            <li> 100% All-Natural, Organice Under Eye Cream for a few weeks now and my under eye dark circles are fading.</li>
            <li> Another wasted product trying to get rid of dark circles.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lighten the dark circles under my eyes but around my eyes they got firm.</li>
            <li> , I have noticed some small changes after a month, but really not that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> so the cream doubles to take care of that itchy, tight feeling in my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have suffered with bags/dark circles since middle school and high school; and I&#x27;m now being a college graduate my bags/dark circles were getting so bad.</li>
            <li> Its false claim of company to reduce dark circle in one week only.</li>
            <li> This product not only didn&#x27;t work, but it made my dark circles visibly  worse.... would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a product, and based on the positive reviews, I selected Queen Bee Organic Eye Cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just a little shadowy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the ethnicity of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> not sure it does what the other posters claimed</li>
            <li> I have no complaints and would recommend this to anyone wanting to reduce their dark circles!</li>
            <li> and I do see a little improvement.</li>
            <li> As someone with makeup allergies, I was a little hesitant to try it, but I haven&#x27;t had any reactions too it.</li>
            <li> As it is made from beeswax, it may be a little greasy.</li>
            <li> A little oily and shiny once applied so it needs to be applied at night as directed.</li>
            <li> It is a little oily</li>
            <li> For day, it is little too oily for me.</li>
            <li> It does look shiny for a little bit after you apply it, but as another reviewer suggested, I just dab it a little with my finger when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> It does look shiny for a little bit after you apply it, but as another reviewer suggested, I just dab it a little with my finger when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> When my dark circles are gone I will give a 5 star!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over three weeks</li>
            <li> and then I stumbled onto this little gem.</li>
            <li> and it also soothes my little wrinkles that I have on my forehead.</li>
            <li> For over a year now, I&#x27;ve had under eye circles, my girlfriend suggested this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for as little as a week now.</li>
            <li> would like a little bit of literature on the product and the company, so</li>
            <li> I have to press my fingertip to melt the cream a little so that I can use.  </li>
            <li> A little background on my skin-</li>
            <li> It is a little shiny looking, but the instructions say to use it at night anyway</li>
            <li> My dark circles are diminshing !</li>
            <li> I have used this product a little over one month</li>
            <li> I try to massage a little bit.</li>
            <li> Then as my eyes began to improve, I got a little slack about it, and after about a day or so, I could begin to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> The dark circles are gradually, but noticeably receding, and my blemishes are fading!</li>
            <li> Its creamy, moisturizing, a little bit goes a loong way.</li>
            <li> I sort of can&#x27;t believe how well this little jar of balm has worked under my eyes.</li>
            <li> That was a little to get use to</li>
            <li> I just started using Queen Bee eye cream a little while ago</li>
            <li> However, it did little for me</li>
            <li> I use it on my neck, eyes and a little on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes and they have began to start fading away!</li>

            <li> My dark circles have diminished!</li>
            <li> My eyes still look dark and dehydrated !</li>
            <li> I did notice that overall my face looks much less tired when I do use this cream vs when I don&#x27;t use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its very hard and greasy, I just dab it under my eyes at night and morning but starting noticing my eyes</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use because it is rock solid.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark genetic under eye circles, I think this cream did help with those a little</li>
            <li> After applying Queen Bee every night for a few days, I can already see noticeable improvements with my dark circles!</li>
            <li> It goes on a little greasy looking, but let it absorb for a few minutes, put on makeup</li>
            <li> I especially noticed a dramatic difference in my Dark Circles</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for the past week and my dark circles seem to be fading.</li>
            <li> Anyways don&#x27;t waste your time, it&#x27;s too pricey.</li>
            <li> I used this product once a day before sleep and it took a a few weeks before noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing what happens in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Started using this a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few uses under my eyes, I noticed a decrease in under eye bags.  </li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t bother to return it because the bottle is heavy and shipping will be costly</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few times.</li>
            <li> Well, just few days using this cream</li>
            <li> When I put on it looks like I was crying</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after showering.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who has been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have finally found an under eye cream that nourishes my skin without redness or irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is so moisturized after just a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste your $$.</li>
            <li> Please stay away from this cream because its just bona be a waste of your money if you buy it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> Seems like i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a few months, and i can see no difference.</li>
            <li> As a guy I was not sure what to do about the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using it and see what happens after another few weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye cream because I was having trouble finding a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t upset my skin</li>
            <li> This product was harsh on my face</li>
            <li> only made worse by lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> ( in my opinion of course) that should be used everyday.</li>
            <li> Used 2 jars twice a day and absolutely waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> It definitely has decreased my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes since I was a small child</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my skin</li>
            <li> waste money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly dont waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> Queen Bee was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> My schedule has not changed, I still struggle with not getting enough sleep, but no one is commenting that I look tired anymore.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes for the past 8 months and severe blemishes.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> perhaps it takes longer then a few weeks to see results under the eyes</li>
            <li> However, the next morning (day 1), my eyes puffed, and it kept getting worse throughout the day, but still seemed to be &amp;#34;minor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but it has taken a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> In the past year I&#x27;ve been getting dark circles under and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sleeping well, dark circles are usually caused by allergies, or sinus infections?</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my forehead, on the corner of my mouth and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had dark circles for the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> wasted time + money+ effort</li>
            <li> Feels heavy and uncomfy.</li>
            <li> Just a few days in and the puffiness/black circles are diminishing already.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I do not think this product can remove dark circles, and I am not sure any cream can accomplish this.  </li>
            <li> I do not use it in the day or under makeup ( I&#x27;m 32) because it is greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been few weeks</li>
            <li> been a few days, and I had nowhere to go, so I&#x27;ve applied it under my eyes alot of times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this a few times.</li>
            <li> Having a bunch of allergy tests done I was allergic to propylene glycol which is in a lot of creams and makeup and was only the situation much worse.</li>
            <li> Just a few words about the seller &amp; product</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and saw no difference and tossed them into the garbage...</li>
            <li> It is heavy</li>
            <li> hopefully it goes well in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While looking at the price, I was a bit skeptical in the beginning whether to order this or still keep shopping around for other similar products for my mother.</li>
            <li> Although I was very skeptical whether this product would in fact do anything, it does do a decent job of moisturizing the under eye eyes and reducing dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have some sun damage under my eyes which I tried to repair with laser and very expensive retinol cremes with some moderately positive results.</li>
            <li> and I usually gave up after a few weeks of little to no results.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the parsley and plain yogurt which did help some</li>
            <li> I saw a very slight improvement in two days.  </li>
            <li> I cannot give 5 stars because it is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The product is not easy to spread, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> Too sticky and not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Using this is definitely easier than other google solutions for dark circles like cucumber, potatoes, cold spoon, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I have noticed a couple little bumps that have showed up under my eye area and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from the eye cream or not.</li>
            <li> so I think that it&#x27;s hard for dark cirlces to disappear from my eyes.</li>
            <li> I live in MN, so I also need a heavy duty moisturizer over the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> For the ingredients it has it should be much less expensive -- I had bought similar all-natural item travelling in PA&#x27;s Amish side for $4.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use a much less expensive product purchased from a local store.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to get rid of the dark circles around my eyes (or at least lessen them) and I used it for three weeks every day twice a day</li>
            <li> Dark circles fade with in at least two weeks using it.  </li>
            <li> I could feel a negative reaction from my skin but continued to use it anyway in the hopes of getting rid of the dark circles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often told I look tired due to dark areas under my eyes, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used another in the past, but it didn’t seem to work for me and dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> Using it for past few month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few months I did notice some small &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; of what I think were coconut oil appear.</li>
            <li> If you do use in the am, I would suggest using a small amount and waiting for a few minutes before applying concealer etc.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> As I got older my dark circles got bad.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to find a product that will make them less visible.  </li>
            <li> oh another thing I would like to add ladies if you have a minimal dark spot in your face this product helps!!!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked and a bit skeptical when I saw so many reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and a half at least every night, and sometimes during the day if I&#x27;m not wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> I am using this cream since past 2 months and my dark circles are now disappearing slowly.</li>
            <li> However, I am quite disappointed as it did absolutely NOTHING for under eyes dark circle.  </li>
            <li> and i can feel a little difference in them as well!</li>
            <li> Work a little but my circles are still here!</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT do anything on dark circles!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken out under my eyes every single time I used this product.</li>
            <li> I still use it at night because my skin is very dry and this is a very thick greasy wax like product.</li>
            <li> and it was a little too waxy and hard to put on my face.</li>
            <li> : It takes time that my skin absorb it, because it needs to be melted on my skin, also it has a little bit hard texture which make it uneasy to apply.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, and has very little scent.</li>
            <li> In my experience it helped very little with this.</li>
            <li> It was a little thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> The formula is a little thick</li>
            <li> When I first received the product, I was a little doubtful because it did not look like I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> After turning 40 a few years ago, I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding an eye cream that does not contain perfume that will hydrate my under eyes.</li>
            <li> Waste of your hard earned dollars.....</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> thing I do not love about this product is how oily it can be.</li>
            <li> The results you get for the price you pay is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I feel a bit scammed, even though technically they did nothing wrong.  </li>
            <li> I had been getting psoriasis like bumps &amp; scaly dry patches on my eyelids from the horribly cold &amp; dry weather we have had &amp; in literally 4 days they were healed!</li>
            <li> This one is no better.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I am 41 yo male who has tried several products and always ended up dissatisfied or disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> know no more.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s quite emollient, I&#x27;m not sure how it would work if you wear eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Thank you for allowing me to soon throw away the concealer I have been using for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have been  using it for the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> but I do this all at night and by morning it has usually seeped into my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was intended for this</li>
            <li> My skin usually dries out in the winter time</li>
            <li> not sure how beneficial it is for that purpose.</li>
            <li> The cream is on the oily side when applied on the skin, so I usually do it before bed to let it absorb when I sleep.</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable-</li>
            <li> perhaps even some of the small wrinkles that have started showing up in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I work nights and usually by 10</li>
            <li> I have started using this for the past one week</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks, i would apply the balm 3-4 times a day but was not satisfied...</li>
            <li> While I am not sure it did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using it incorrectly</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure how that can be, but just in case), however, I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I like this product, as I bought it for puffiness and small lines.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to give this small company a chance.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my eyes!</li>
            <li> I use it at night but not during the day, since I wear mascara which smudges since this product is so slick.</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to get rid of it faster</li>
            <li> I received this recently and was really skeptical also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Queen Bee eye cream every night for the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This product has the texture of vaseline, it is not a cream and does not absorb therefore you are left with a jelly like pomade under your eyes after each use which makes it complicated to add your make up after using the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it along with rapidlash for the past month or so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if I see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Yet another disappointing eye cream claiming to improve dark circles and not actually working.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin being a little less like crepe paper thin, so perhaps it has</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get it out of the bottle since it is hard like wax.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and feels greasy on my skin, so I don&#x27;t dare wear it under makeup</li>
            <li> I useed this product and after one time, under my eyes got very dry and red and itchy; they got so bad that I had to go to the Dr. and use medicine; my eyes took almost 2 weeks for them to heal; contact the seller, and I told them....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using products with chemicals, fragrance and other ingredients that are unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> Within days of using it, people were telling me I look less tired than usual.</li>
            <li> I do not see any differences, and I feel like the dark circle is getting worse.</li>
            <li> so thats why they look dark, because the skin layer gets thin</li>
            <li> so thats why they look dark, because the skin layer gets thin</li>
            <li> I used it morning and night for 2 weeks, but like another reviewer it seemed to worryingly make my dark circles appear a lot worse, and I had to discontinue use.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing for my dark circles except made them worse.</li>
            <li> Very fatty hard cream.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this stuff when looking for something to help with dark under eye circles</li>
            <li> she (and I) noticed a dramatic improvement in color and tone, and none of that shiny effect you get with other products.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cause any uncomfortable feelings and keep my skin moist all night when it is dry.</li>
            <li> I use it every night under my eyes since October 2013 and the black areas under my eyes has already decreased.  </li>
            <li> I still hope it&#x27;ll start making an improvement eventually, but I&#x27;m certainly disappointed, I was expecting at least a little improvement this far, but I see nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had went in for a facial this year as a gift i received and explained how sensitive my skin but as usual I woke up with the worst allergic reaction under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference for my dark circles by I</li>
            <li> It is hard as wax</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe this is a coincidence.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27; really hard put on the skin and too greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I learn the hard way...</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; arrived and it is hard as a brick.  </li>
            <li> the wax is too hard, and it does take quite a while to get it to soften.</li>
            <li> I think in about another 4-6 weeks they should probably be hard to see.</li>
            <li> The product feels like a hard wax</li>
            <li> It looks like hard oils, like cocoa butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent in it a month in.</li>
            <li> The product itself was also hard to get out of the Jar, it was like trying to pick apart a wax candle.  </li>
            <li> This is really hard to get onto your finger to apply, its like applying a wax candle.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months the texture changed to very hard, not smooth and feels as if there are beads on it because is so hard, not a nice feeling to apply an eye cream and feeling like you are scrubbing it because the texture is</li>
            <li> or so I&#x27;m looking a little tired and droopy around the eyes.</li>
            <li> its not effective</li>
            <li> BUY VASELINE instead, at least it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These people are not honest in their description and should change their item description so no one else is caught up in their deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have had horrible dark circles under my eyes for about fifteen years (since I was about eighteen), and nothing has ever helped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often complained that they made me look dead--or undead, like a zombie.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s solid, like cold coconut oil</li>
            <li> Way too stiff...pulls my delicate skin underneath my eyes.  </li>
            <li> To put it in layman&#x27;s terms it itches like crazy and because it itches, it becomes inflames and red.  </li>
            <li> I should have gotten a refund before it was too late.</li>
            <li> Big promise, disappointing return.</li>
            <li> some reviews I read stated that Queen Bee was too thick &amp; greasy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick made me break out under my eyes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like thick vaseline..</li>
            <li> This product was really thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> As others stated it is quite thick and greasy</li>
            <li> Its not too thick, nor is it too greasy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on a product that entices thru false reviews.</li>
            <li> The cream is really thick when you are getting it out with your finger.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream is thick.  </li>
            <li> It works slowly but it does work.</li>
            <li> Apply a thick layer may be not applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m extremely pale with unfortunately genetic very dark eye circles-</li>
            <li> I really like that this under eye cream doesn&#x27;t have endocrine inhibitors and other nasty stuff in it.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Eyelids feels smoother and no more crows feet!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have tried this before buying all of the other expensive creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Queen Bee</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> is all a thing of the past for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and have not seen any dramatic difference in my eye area.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try, but after a few weeks of use I have not seen any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed with product thus far.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the amount or quality of sleep I get, I usually wake up looking tired.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get out of the jar as quite solid.</li>
            <li> I have had a very difficult time finding anything to use on my face, especially in the under eye area.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and made my dark circles worse!</li>
            <li> It has been just shy of two week, and my dark circles have been reduced by 70-80%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with irritating eye creams in the past.</li>
            <li> this cream seriously speeds up the healing process and reduces the appearance of scars</li>
            <li> a subtle benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product title on Amazon claims that it is &#x27;Organic&#x27; but there is no indication of this on the product itself - either in the ingredients list or otherwise.</li>
            <li> Seriously have tried a lot of eye creams out there this one rocks.</li>
            <li> The funniest thing is that it is so thick and waxy that it is very hard to get some product on your fingers.</li>
            <li> very thick hard to describe.n  </li>
            <li> It has been a very dry and cold winter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the product 2 stars only because if you&#x27;re not allergic to beeswax, this isn&#x27;t a bad cream.  </li>
            <li> only way I would give a bad review</li>
            <li> I have bad under eye circles from not sleeping enough during the week.</li>
            <li> The texture is just not good for an eye cream.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> Feels not good.</li>
            <li> not good</li>
            <li> COMPLETE CRAP</li>
            <li> but b careful if you wear glasses because it does leave a little residue on the eyelashes that can get annoying.</li>
            <li> Once I received your product and as usual I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a while until the itchy was gone, unfortunatelly , the itchy came back as soon as I use it again :(  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers with dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after applying it on different parts of my face for 2 days, I broke out :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They should be forced to return all the customers their monies and dropped from Amazons Website!</li>
            <li> It is very hard.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to take some cream out.</li>
            <li> The cream is very hard.</li>
            <li> Very hard to spread.</li>
            <li> but I find it to be very hard to put under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but my dark circles have been really bad lately, so</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I do have dark circles under my eyes, and this product sadly did not do anything for it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products claiming to remove dark circles and bags and this one was the worst.</li>
            <li> It looked horrible they were swollen, red, and dark</li>
            <li> It gave me a lot of milia in my delicate eye area and those are very hard to get rid of!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s also VERY thick.</li>
            <li> You have to keep in mind that its very thick</li>
            <li> the process is very slow ,</li>
            <li> Also, was very thick and greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!  </li>
            <li> and now that I am 32 they are even worse than they used to be.</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Got tired of it</li>
            <li> Total cosmetic crap.</li>
            <li> I also apply a thin layer on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I think I used the product for approximately 4 months.</li>
            <li> I did break out from this and was not happy .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream under my eyes for approximately 3 weeks</li>
            <li> but I am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-easy to apply after broken layer</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-easy to apply after broken layer</li>
            <li> But the product came with a broken cap.</li>
            <li> worse</li>
            <li> but I apply a thin layer at night and in the morning before work.</li>
            <li> And it just kept getting worse.  </li>
            <li> In fact, sometimes it appears that my circles have gotten a bit worse.</li>
            <li> Would NOT recommend a POOR product......</li>
            <li> My eyes looks puffy and tired.</li>
            <li> I am not happy about this transaction.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after searching for face lotion with vitamin k because it&#x27;s been shown to reduce the appearance of broken blood vessels.</li>
            <li> I would run into friends and they would always comment something like, \\&quot;You look tired.</li>
            <li> it might have gotten worse?</li>
            <li> It made my puffiness worse when I applied it before bed.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m 58 and my skin is thin now.</li>
            <li> So I played the &#x27;game&#x27; to see if it worked.  </li>
            <li> After about 10 days of use around the eyes at night, and maybe a thin film in the morning, there is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> They almost seem worse.</li>
            <li> I must say, I have always had racoon eyes to the point where everyone always thinks that I am tired when I am not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I bought this product and have been using it for approximately two months now.</li>
            <li> and yet I don&#x27;t look as tired.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all  </li>
            <li> my clinic was saying I looked stressed out and tired looking.</li>
            <li> This keeps the under-eye area moist without irritating my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I had 3 not major but annoying wrinkles, now I have maybe 1 wrinkle sticking out</li>
            <li> This product did NOT do anything for dark circles besides the fact that it did NOT smell bad.</li>
            <li> I had ugly dark circles around my eyes</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the money I spent.</li>
            <li> I am not one to have harsh criticism on products, but I must admit that this eye cream is very exaggerated in terms of its results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Queen Bee for about a month and have noticed dramatic changes.  </li>
            <li> ], I get dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Within 5 days i saw a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that I thought the manufacturer mailed it to me, but it looks like some lame reseller or dropshipper, and I haven&#x27;t gotten a response to my week-old request for a refund.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been having really awful under eye circles which is compounded by the dry weather.</li>
            <li> I resorted to using a concealer in which I hate due to never wearing any type of makeup.</li>
            <li> Buying other worthless products its like throwing your money to the trash, but with Queen Bee cream, its like your paying for the $400 cream.</li>
            <li> awake at various ungodly hours and of course as you can imagine it causes horrible bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The cream I was using before this had a weird smell to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another company who succeeded to fool me with fake reviews.</li>
            <li> I also apply a alpha lipoic acid/olive oil/DMAE hand and body lotion by Reviva, which isn&#x27;t too expensive, over it and on my neck and face.  </li>
            <li> Sorry save your money and look else where.</li>
            <li> sorry to say that I can not use it at all.</li>
            <li> I just randomly went on Amazon and looked for a product and came to this cream.</li>
            <li> This works where others have failed.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-can make your eyes feel weird if it gets in there</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-can make your eyes feel weird if it gets in there</li>
            <li> the 5 star reviews are all fake.</li>
            <li> She had been using an expensive cream she bought from one of the shopping channels...</li>
            <li> it kinda stings a bit and contact becomes useless...</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> And too expensive.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer indicated, I also was skeptical when I received this product.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately it has done nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have yet to notice a difference, but I&#x27;ll keep using the product and remain hopeful.</li>
            <li> The cream keeps my elbows moisturized all day which have been difficult to keep moisturized with body lotion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does nothing.</li>
            <li> I randomly came across this item and based on the reviews</li>
            <li> so people don&#x27;t think that this is a fake review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry...</li>
            <li> ill never use nor order again.  </li>
            <li> There is one highly annoying aspect of it, the hards round chunks get in my eyes and don&#x27;t do anything for the product or the skin.  </li>
            <li> , never got one on the mail and honestly I am not impressed with the product at all.</li>
            <li> I thought it was expensive when I ordered it</li>
            <li> I was so wrong this time.</li>
            <li> Sorry, couldn&#x27;t continue, too greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy and it looks weird when u put it on</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the ingrediants that are in it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product</li>
            <li> I have tried one of a men&#x27;s eye cream and it made my eyes look puffy and weird.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like a lot of makeup, and after using this product for about a week I required minium coverage to hide the flawed areas...</li>
            <li> Needless to say I had to go to a dermatologist and every cream they gave me irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using this wrong.</li>
            <li> (Seriously, it is that bad)</li>
            <li> i have very bad dark rings around my eyes</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see my dark circles disappeared since I hate them!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit shiny, but I merely touched it a bit, and the shine wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> There is probably nothing wrong or bad with the product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it again when I was exposed to the cold wind.  </li>
            <li> I walked around two weeks with chicken grease skin for no reason at all.</li>

            <li> you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> This item is waxy and unpleasant on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Was very skeptical if it would be of any help but decided to try it.</li>
            <li> The smell is very faint and not off putting in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to get out of the jar.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made me look tired and sick when I&#x27;m not, and I&#x27;ve hated them all these years.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks and I notice a difference.  I have notice the area under my eyes look nicer, like relaxed, no puffiness.  I do not have dark circles per say but my skin tends to be dry.  So this product moisturizes the area under the skin very nicely and makes it feels relax.  I love the fact that it is natural. Unfortunately I did not get the offer to get a free cream if I wrote a review :o/  But this is a keeper totally so I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in undereye circles</li>
            <li> I have used for several months.  This is an excellent product for eyes and facial skin.  My skin has become smoother. Love it the best!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product! It takes 4-5 days to really see the effects. The cream is pretty oily and it takes 20-30 minutes to get fully absorbed, so I only used it before going to bed. Make sure to use daily to see constant effects! The small jar lasted me more than 3-4 months, so the price is definitely great!</li>
            <li> it is helping my eye circle go away now</li>
            <li> Awesome alternative to expensive beauty products and gives great results of healthy skin, no wrinkles, and a bright complexion!</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing Queen Bee 100% All-Natural cream and am very happy with the results. I have been using it for a long time now, and is extremely satisfied and I think a customer for life.</li>
            <li> My mom around 60 years old love it, she can tell the difference under eye, will keep use it. I have one too, it feels oily when you use it, but when it is absorbed, it feels good.</li>
            <li> waste of my money. Leaves skin nice and soft but did not get any results in terms of diminishing my dark circles</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  I have applied this cream every night for almost 3 months now, and I do not notice any improvement.  I love the natural ingredients, but I wish it had worked :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Within days of using it, people were telling me I look less tired than usual. I&#x27;m often told I look tired due to dark areas under my eyes, but not anymore. The slight hint of coca butter scent is a nice touch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant of this product because most eye creams contain chemicals I can&#x27;t even pronounce, but so far queen bee has been spot on. Also, it looks like the jar will last a while. It is very hard--like a wax, and a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s nice that once you put it on, you won&#x27;t feel it and you forget about it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this 2 days ago, and noticed that it feels like Vaseline on the skin.  I like that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  The size is small, but it only takes a little bit, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> The product worked for me.  It took some time to see the results, but it is working.  Like lots of people with dark circles, I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I must admit though, I am a bit puzzled about HOW it works, because the simple ingredients listed on the product label aren&#x27;t usually associated with removal of dark circles.  With that said, I use it on my face and eyes, and both seem brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern is that I purchased the \\&quot;eye cream\\&quot; thinking it was a new product by Queen Bee.  However, I have come to learn that it is the exact same product as the Skin Balm!  Not sure how one can be called an eye cream and the other a skin balm and yet do totally different things.  Has anyone figured this out?  I&#x27;ll keep buying though, as long as the results deliver!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this cream I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t work. I was starting to have semi dark coloring under my eyes, and a line was forming under my eyes as well. Although, I wasn&#x27;t sure that the cream would work, for I had yet to try a cream that actually worked. So within a week I started seeing results. I&#x27;m really glad that I found this cream because the couple of creases under my eyes that were starting to form are now definitely starting to fade. I even gave a jar to my mother. Thanks a lot Queen bee cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing instant improvements with this product with regards to dark circles. I was weighing up whether to purchase this product or an alternative, but I&#x27;m really pleased that I chose this one.</li>
            <li> For the hair color  Lied about color and burned my skin</li>
            <li> This cream smells really good and works great. It’s a little hard to get out of the container at first, but now I am used to it. It applies onto my face easily and has been making an improvement in the wrinkles that I have under my else. They were thicker and more noticeable, but after using this cream for about 2 months I am noticing that my wrinkles have thinned and aren’t as noticeable. I will continue to use and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. It didn&#x27;t work for me. I hv been using it regularly for 1 month now but no reduction in dark circle. My dark circles hvn&#x27;t removed at all. Its false claim of company to reduce dark circle in one week only.</li>
            <li> The cream lasts me a while. I only use a little bit under my eyes each night and it does the trick at keeping the bags away. It also helps to keep under my eyes feeling soft. I read that you can use it all over your face and I plan to do that shortly to see if it can help me to reduce the wrinkles I have. I will be looking forward to seeing more benefits of this product and am happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li> I am happy with how well queen bee cream has been working for me. I have been using it for about a month and I can notice some changes with my under eye circles. I have had bags under my eyes since I was about 25 and now that I am 32 they are even worse than they used to be. This cream has reduced them a lot during the month I have been using it and I expect that with continued use that I will keep seeing improvements in them. I am excited to see how much more progress I can make with this.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a few weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any changes in my under eye dark circles. I can say it does do a great job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products for wrinkles, for tightening the skin on the face and neck, (as we know, with age the skin on the neck can wrinkle and sag) and the bags that I have under my eyes. My skin is extremely sensitive, and most of the products that I have tried have chemicals that burn, itch or cause breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I have never been so impressed with a product as I am with this one, it is natural, which I love. I am using this on my face and neck,  I noticed an immediate tightening with the first application, my skin feels so soft, has a beautiful glow, and, I have had no adverse reactions. I am on day three of using it and I will update from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a winner, I will continue to use this product. I highly recommend trying it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have been using it. In the second application I feel my eye firm and dark circle reduced. I recommend this product to everyone. thanks</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Queen Bee eye cream.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether it removes dark circles, but dark circles run in my family.  It&#x27;s a bit shiny, but I merely touched it a bit, and the shine wasn&#x27;t too bad.  One thing I love about this organic under eye cream is that it does not irritate my eyes or skin.  I have such sensitive skin that when I wear other face creams near my eyes, I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off and throw the product in the garbage.  Queen Bee is truly wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought Queen Bee trying to find something that would work as well on the dark circles under my eyes as what I had been using &amp; that had ingredients that are nontoxic. I checked it out using EWG’s website (Environmental Working Group). My current product (sweet almond oil), like so many others, causes my eyes to burn &amp; water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away, I noticed that Queen Bee worked at least as good as the sweet almond oil. After finishing my first jar of Queen Bee, I realized that I never notice dark circles under my eyes any more. Other products reduced the darkness but Queen Bee has made me forget that it was a problem. I’ve used other vitamin K products with no noticeable difference, so I really thought that without sweet almond oil, my eyes would still look awful. This has worked better than sweet almond oil &amp; much better than every other dark eye cream, plus it’s working great as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because some reviews I read stated that Queen Bee was too thick &amp; greasy, I thought I’d add how I use it. I wash my face &amp; immediately apply it all around my eyes. It is quite thick, which is what dermatologists say is necessary to hold moisture in for wrinkle prevention. By the time I’m ready to apply makeup around my eyes, I know that my skin has absorbed all it can. I dap the upper lid with a tissue to remove most of the product, but under my eye I dab the skin with clean fingers so that a thin layer will remain. Doing that definitely causes my eyes to appear less wrinkly under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. No dark circles, less wrinkles, no burning eyes, no toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came here to update that this product still does not sting my eyes, &amp; realized that I never added information about the problem I had with this product. I once received 2 jars at one time, &amp; both of them had a gritty, rather than smooth product in them. The grit hurt the skin around my eyes when I tried to apply it. I contacted the company &amp; they promptly replaced them. Since they said something about the cream possibly being too dry, I tried stirring distilled water in 1 jar, but that resulted in mildew. I threw it out &amp; used the other gritty jar as cuticle cream. The company handled the problem with friendliness &amp; speed.cream possibly being too dry, I tried stirring distilled water in 1 jar, but that resulted in mildew.

            <li> I was looking for a natural eye cream since I do not like to use chemicals on my skin. This is one of the best natural eye creams I have used. After one evening, I can tell the skin around my eyes is softer and the wrinkles are slightly less noticeable. It has only been one day but I see a difference. I also used it under my day make up! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the vanilla smells nice but it had no effect on dark circles</li>
            <li> Smells like vanilla - yum. It&#x27;s also quite hydrating</li>
            <li> When I first received the product, I was a little doubtful because it did not look like I was expecting.  It is more of a waxy substance, I was expecting a sort of cream.  However, after applying this product under my eyes each night at bedtime for the last few weeks, I have noticed a significant improvement on the dark circles under my eyes!  I will most definitely continue to use this product.  Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to urea (used as a preservative in cosmetics) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoulene which is apparently related to the toluene found in nail polish that many people are allergic to) and so, being fed up with having to check every ingredient list of every makeup and skin care product I wanted to buy, I decided to go all natural or organic. I learned the hard way that organic doesn&#x27;t mean safe.  It turns out that I am one of many individuals allergic to beeswax.  After using this product and an under eye concealer that contained beeswax, my eyes started to get swollen and red.  I couldn&#x27;t understand what was happening until I did my own research and found many people complaining about irritated lips and skin after using products containing beeswax.  The pictures I saw looked exactly like the kind of redness and swelling that&#x27;s on my eyelids and beneath my eyes where the concealer was used.  I&#x27;m giving the product 2 stars only because if you&#x27;re not allergic to beeswax, this isn&#x27;t a bad cream.  For myself, I&#x27;ve thrown out everything that contains beeswax especially mascaras where it&#x27;s a common ingredient.  For my eye area, I&#x27;m now looking for vegan products.  My understanding is that if a product is vegan it won&#x27;t use beeswax since that&#x27;s considered a product of an animal?  I&#x27;d suggest checking the ingredients anyway.  I really think that Amazon should require a listing of all ingredients from sellers for makeup and skin products (this seller listed the ingredients).  Often I have to do my own research to track down a product&#x27;s ingredients and it gets so time consuming.  For the amount that cosmetic companies charge for their products, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask to have them disclose what they&#x27;re asking the consumer to pay for.  And if people can be allergic to beeswax (not an uncommon allergy apparently) or anything else contained in the product, the sellers should have a warning about this in their product description.  (I wrote a similar postfor the other eye product that I was using made by a different company).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t fond of this product at all. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product may be totally great and do exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do but I hated the texture of it. It was kind of sticky and felt like something that you might use on a scab to help it heal, but definately not something I would want on my face...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cream. I&#x27;m on my second jar. If you are sensitive to fade creams this is the perfect solution. Fade creams don&#x27;t work over night so it only stands to reason that you have to without a doubt remain consistent with use. This cream is now part of my daily regimen and I have noticeable results. For a natural approach to skin care this is heaven scent! It&#x27;s also excellent for those who live in dry cold areas as it counteracts dryness but is manageable enough to wear under make up. I will continue to incorporate this cream in my daily routine. I just like it! Great under eye cream!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Feels nice though.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I have had the great results most of the other reviews rave about...but I have not.  I haven&#x27;t had any changes in the wrinkles or darkness around my eyes.  The only good thing I can say is that it is much more gentle than other products for the under eye area.  My eyes did not burn when I had it on.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY WITH THIS PRODUCT BUT, I HAVE JUST STARTED USING IT. TIME WILL TELL IF IT HELPS WITH WRINKLES.

            <li> Time will tell on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick made me break out under my eyes I use it from time to time for my lips. Contain ingredients that will clog pores.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was very sceptical because it is a soft, moist cream that smells like honey and looks like it shouldn&#x27;t do anything. After the first 3 weeks of using it, I noticed a big difference in my under-eyes AND the color of a mole that is also under my eye. The mole was first obvious. It really reduced in color. It isn&#x27;t advertised for anything under-eyes but I also used  it on an age mark and that lightened up too. I am very impressed with this product. I highly recommend it to anyone who has the patience to use Queen Bee daily or twice daily. They will see results.</li>
            <li> This really does make my skin smoother and softer. I also like that I can read and understand all of the ingredients!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always had purple under my eyes. used this once and the next day i noticed a difference. getting better everyday.&lt;br /&gt;thank you queen bee &amp; all the worker bees!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It is a bit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;, but here in dry, hot California it is just perfect! It lasts all day, and has very little scent. Because it is so creamy, it might interfere with cream type eye cosmetics. Otherwise, I love this product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very Good to improve winkle</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results so far. I bought a jar of this balm and have been using it for the last month and a half in the morning and in the evening. I have noticed the lines under my eyes are fading, as well wrinkles on my forehead. Plus my skin feels SO smooth and beautiful!! My friends have mentioned how much younger and vibrant I look. This stuff honestly took 5 years off of my face in a matter of weeks! I don&#x27;t know if this is the most powerful \\&quot;ant-wrinkle\\&quot; or \\&quot;under-eye\\&quot; cream you can find, I haven&#x27;t really tried that many other products, but I would much rather put something that is chemical free and natural on my face every day, than some of the other creams on the market full of who-knows-what. I have bought these for all of my family and friends for Christmas gifts too and will be purchasing again for myself. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m A Female from Bklyn NYC &amp;amp; this cream is AMAZING LADIES. I used it twice today for the first time &amp;amp; saw results really fast. A1 Cream smells like shea butter goes on smooth only need a VERY small amout Must have</li>
            <li> I love this skin balm...I have bought it twice now and will be ordering more soon.  I put it on at night and when I wake up my skin is soft and smooth.  I keep it with me and use it around my eyes during the day...I can definitly tell that is helps with the puffyness I get around my eyes and seems to brighten the eye area.  I love trying new products and rarely buy the same thing twice, but this skin balm is one I will continue to buy.  I only gave it four stars because it does take time to absorb into your skin, until it does your skin looks and feels a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I am still using the product, but can&#x27;t really tell any difference in my dark under-eye circles or wrinkles. I will use it until it is all gone; maybe by then I will see some results.</li>
            <li> I started using this balm about a month ago, I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life and tried everything you can think of but nothing worked until I found this product, it did WONDERS under my eyes and for my face too. Probably the secret is that I&#x27;ve been using it religiously at night and under my makeup everyday, I love the fact that it is completely natural and I&#x27;m not putting God knows what in my face. I highly recommend it, just be a bit patient, you&#x27;ll see it works!</li>
            <li> I suffer from major bags, from a number of things, from lack of sleep to allergies plus its hereditary .  I was pretty desperate to find something that worked.  i had to use my glasses alot to hide my eyes and i hated that.  I noticed that after using using the Queen bee balm for about a week, its helped A LOT!! The puffiness has been reduced. I bought it based on the reviews so i&#x27;m sure not to waste money.  The price is very reasonable for the results i got.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and recommend it. I&#x27;m realistic and know its not going to take them away completely but i can see the difference and will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Initially, i was thrown off by the texture of the cream. It is hard as wax and i was expecting more of a cream, it actually works well and i love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be more pleased!  This product did just as you said it would. The dark circles have diminished greatly in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it and the skin around my eyes appear to be more moist. I was so pleased that I ordered a second bottle two weeks ago. Once you reach my age the dryness is a constant issue. Thanks, JHA-Florida</li>
            <li> Love the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s organic and not greasy. Seeing some improvement and will post more as time progresses ahead.</li>
            <li> I have some sun damage under my eyes which I tried to repair with laser and very expensive retinol cremes with some moderately positive results. Once I got pregnant I had to let go of the harsh chemicals and randomly found this creme which I got because it is made with organic ingredients. Once I received it I was very upset because it looked like someone had home printed the label! Don&#x27;t be fooled by its cheap appearance! The creme worked wonders after just a couple of weeks it had almost completely faded the fine lines under my eyes. After months of use they are invisible. I am surpised and delighted.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other eye creams but since using Queen Bee I have found it to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;In a short time dark circles have improved as well as it being a great moisturizing product&lt;br /&gt;For the face.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.. Better than I expected results!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything, I finished the whole jar and I don&#x27;t see any difference, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> IM A GUY so WHAT?&lt;br /&gt;im still young and no wrinkles xD&lt;br /&gt;for a week of using it...&lt;br /&gt;it reduced my dark circle by a little.... Im going to keep using it!&lt;br /&gt;AND I&#x27;m surprised my acne scars(red MARKS) on my both cheeks are fading away!!!!!!!!!!! coz of this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks and so far enjoy it. I was on the search for an affordable, natural eye cream and this fit criteria. I have noticed my eyes are slightly less dry, and look forward to seeing the results even more when the cold winter subsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do not love about this product is how oily it can be. It is great for evening use, but in the morning it takes too long for my skin to absorb. I&#x27;m still searching for a good day time eye cream, but love this for evening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fraud..they offered me a free jar if I write a review..if the first one didn&#x27;t work why would I need another jar? I still have it it&#x27;s like thick vaseline..I don&#x27;t recommend it..</li>
            <li> luv this, true ORGANIC ALL NATURAL PRODUCT,  moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with bags/dark circles since middle school and high school; and I&#x27;m now being a college graduate my bags/dark circles were getting so bad. After trying tons of products and never seeing results I almost gave up. Thankfully I came across this item on amazon and decided to try it. After just one night of using this product I saw improvements when I woke up. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and can&#x27;t stop using it! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week already, and have already gotten compliments from family and friends that something is different about my face and I look brighter. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Definitely would recommend this to a friend, and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Good product but does not reduce the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I looked at the components of this product and I thought to myself this has to work. I saw an improvement in the dark circles under my eyes after using this product. I would recommend this product to anyone. I think the idea for such a mix of components is genius.</li>
            <li> Too oily and won&#x27; t absorbe. Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I had doubts about this product when I bought it. But I thought it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try since it&#x27;s all natural. This product does magic! I had dark under eye circles and nothing seemed to work. After using Queen Bee for a week or two I saw major improvements. The results you get for the price you pay is unbelievable. I never write reviews on products but I&#x27;m so happy with this cream that I thought it is not fair if I don&#x27;t write one.  Thanks Queen Bee:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now, and it does nothing for my fine lines and wrinkles.  It is very greasy (made from olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax and vitamin K and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using it in the daytime unless they want a shiny, greasy looking face.  I gave it one star for the good smell, but that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> This cream is really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m awake at various ungodly hours and of course as you can imagine it causes horrible bags under my eyes. This product within a reasonable amount of time (2 and a half weeks as I&#x27;m writing this) takes care of that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it daily (and nightly) I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic reduction of the bags under my eyes and the purple has lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used for more than just under the eyes. I like to use it on my eyelids as well because it creates a pleasant &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; effect which comes out very nicely in pictures and it makes them feel nice and smooth. Not to mention the pleasant and LIGHT (as in totally not overpowering) is detectable when hugging people and I&#x27;ve received compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even after using it religiously for weeks I still have tons of product left. I haven&#x27;t even made a dent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I&#x27;ve never been the kind of person who cares about what type of ingredients that  are in the products I use!  I usually use products with chemicals in them; recently I was aware of the harm that these kind of products do to my skin but I wasn&#x27;t  ready to leave the wonders that they do to my skin.. a friend gave me this product as a gift &amp; it definitely changed the way I look at natural products..&lt;br /&gt;It is my 2nd purchase &amp; I&#x27;m definitely going  to buy more as soon as I run out of it.</li>
            <li> This all natural product is good.  I put in on in the morning and at night under my eyes and my neck and around my lips.  Its great.  I have seen my dark undereye lighten up and my skin looks smoother.  It feels highdrated.  I Don&#x27;t need alot just alittle goes a long way and i love that I know exectly what Im putting on my face no weird names of things that i dont know.  I do recommend this because 2 thigs its all natural and it works.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer but still got panda eyes ugh</li>
            <li> Amazing. I really saw a differences. I had dark cicles but i can verly see them now. :) I recommend it to anymore with dark circles and fluffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.  Definitely use at night only.  It is very greasy so when i used it during the day it ended up smudging my mascara and it looked like I had two black eyes.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed with product thus far. Have been using twice a day everyday but have yet to see any improvements.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cream is great. The cream I was using before this had a weird smell to it and it was a little too waxy and hard to put on my face. queen bee is easy to put on and has a creamy texture. My face feels moisturized after I use it and the dark circles I had under my eyes have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li> This product was really thick and greasy. It recommends to put it on twice a day, but there is no way you could put make-up over this stuff. There was a lot, so it should last for quite a long time, however, I just didn&#x27;t notice any real difference. I have been using it for about a month and a half at least every night, and sometimes during the day if I&#x27;m not wearing make-up. Despite all my uses, it just hasn&#x27;t helped my dark circles. I&#x27;m in my early twenties, so I can&#x27;t really testify to its effects on lines and wrinkles, but it didn&#x27;t work well on my shadows.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite sensitive. This product doesn&#x27;t cause any uncomfortable feelings and keep my skin moist all night when it is dry. It&#x27;s a little greasy so I use it mostly at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and have noticed a difference already. I wasn&#x27;t too racoony (that&#x27;s not a word, I know) but it was getting there. Now it&#x27;s just a little shadowy. It&#x27;s great. I already ordered another jar and I&#x27;m not near finished with the first one. I apply both day and night. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Queen Bee Eye Cream is not only exceeded my expectations but it&#x27;s worked beyond my belief. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work but I know use this not only on my eyes but on my face. I especially noticed a dramatic difference in my Dark Circles but Hubby noticed too. He also noticed which I then realized *after he mentioned it...that my wrinkles on my forehead that I called worry lines were almost completely gone. I had huge wrinkles there to the point that it was so bumpy you could feel it. I wish I could post pix of before and after because THIS PRODUCT WORKS. I actually read so many reviews and wonder if people lie. After trying this product out I WILL repurchase and will recommend it 100%!!!!! Best EYE cream!!</li>
            <li> Very nice cream and for a great price, the effects are fantastic. I apply it every night before going to bed and when I wake up, my eyes feel vibrant and youthful. So, nice to have a product like this in the market and that too that&#x27;s 100% natural. No harsh chemicals or anything scary. Queen Bee will make you feel like a queen for sure. A +++</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see difference after using the almost whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say I can recommend it.  But who knows if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month now since I purchased this product and I haven&#x27;t noticed much, if any, change which is surprising based upon the other reviews. I&#x27;m not sure of the ethnicity of the other reviewers. However, I&#x27;m African-American. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well for my skin-type?</li>
            <li> I read other people&#x27;s reviews and ordered this product (all of them rated 5 stars and said it worked well.)  Actually, it was too good to be true though.   I tried it for about two weeks now.  I do not see any differences, and I feel like the dark circle is getting worse.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing as it too thick to be used in the morning, otherwise it is fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for dark circles and wrinkles and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any differences, but I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft and fine easily absorbed cream. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and feels natural. Very effective</li>
            <li> This was a very moisturizing oil based eye cream. I found it to work wonderfully as a night eye cream. All natural ingredients with no chemicals is very nice to see.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the eyes. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for the past week and my dark circles seem to be fading. I&#x27;m hoping it just gets better with continued use. The product is really a balm and not a cream but I don&#x27;t have any problems spreading it on my skin. I really appreciated the fast delivery of this item and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer.  A little bit goes a long way and it is a good value for the price. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it nightly to see a difference, but I don&#x27;t like putting oily stuff on my face and it seems greasy. For me it attracted pet hair and lint on my face more when I sleep with it on. I like the smell and natural ingredients, but I think I will just use it as a lip balm if it continues show no results. Anyways don&#x27;t waste your time, it&#x27;s too pricey.</li>
            <li> not for sensitive skin...not sure it does what the other posters claimed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my first jar a few months ago. At first, it was little difficult to use this cream since it didnt look like a regular eye cream -- it was more like a vaseline. However, after using it for about one week, I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark circles and fine lines were fading. Once i got used to this vaseline-like cream, it was more comfortable to use it on my dry skin. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of expensive brand name eye creams but this $20 eye cream is a  magic!  I really love all natural ingredients and best of all, it really works! This is a must have eye cream especially during winter time!</li>
            <li> This product works well for me . It feels smooth and comfortable after using it. Although it&#x27;s my first time use this product, but I think It&#x27;s a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I recently received my order less than a week ago. I am disappointed with this product&#x27;s consistency and oiliness.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and the skin around my eyes already feels younger and healthier.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it feels like 2-3 weeks in, definitely recommend considering the price point and the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> This product feels like Vaseline petroleum jelly. It smells like vanilla (pleasant smell).  It&#x27;s very greasy, and hard to take out of the jar -- difficult to apply (especially to the sensitive eye area).  For the ingredients it has it should be much less expensive -- I had bought similar all-natural item travelling in PA&#x27;s Amish side for $4.  I have not seen results.  I just wake up with oily, moisturized around-the-eyes area and I feel the effect would be same if I simply put olive or any other type of oil.  Overall, I would not buy this item again and would not recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only 2 weeks and I already feel that my face is soft, smooth and bit clear as compare to prior to using this product. I have a feeling that I will like this product as I will use it more regularly.</li>
            <li> Very good product!  Just about one of the best products I&#x27;ve seen out there and tried.  Great product and this little bottle goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I used this product once a day before sleep and it took a a few weeks before noticing a difference. The main difference I see is the wrinkles around the corners of my eyes have minimized in appearance. Product also has a slight but nice smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!! Works wonders, will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I have not had this for very long and do not use it every day but so far I can give you what I know. It has a very nice feel to it, smooths on your face nice. The smell is very nice, a light vanilla scent and it does not irritate my eyes. I like the ingredients in it. I am still waiting to get a chance to use it enough to see if it works for my under eye needs. I use it on my lips and hands also and it is nice for that.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have been looking for a product like this for years. I have had dark circles under my eyes that I thought were caused by lack of sleep or stress. I tried all kinds of expensive products like Hydrolyze or Murad and saw a little bit of change but wasn&#x27;t very satisfied. I have been using the balm under my eyes twice a day for the month and a half and WOW what a difference!! The circles are barely noticeable and the lines under my eyes are beginning to fade. I really like how it not messy or greasy like a lot of under eye/wrinkle products and smells wonderful! I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I love it! It&#x27;s so smooth and smells great. I&#x27;m definitely hooked!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now and it has reduced my under eye circles. I use it before bed and in the morning, it is easy to apply and seems to work okay when used with concealers. The information page that was included with the product was very useful. Plus, it&#x27;s all natural. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had discoloration under my eyes since I was in my teens due to allergies and other illnesses.  I don&#x27;t like using products with chemicals, fragrance and other ingredients that are unhealthy.  When I saw this and read the ingredient list (which is limited to about 4 things) and the reviews, I said I have to try it!  I just got it yesterday and applied it at night under my eyes, where my \\&quot;smile\\&quot; lines are by my eyes, mouth and forehead.  It \\&quot;melted\\&quot; into my skin, which I appreciate since no one likes to feel greasy after applying a product.  I am looking forward to seeing what happens in a few weeks. I&#x27;ll keep you posted!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of improvement yet,I will rate it once i&#x27;m done with the bottle i&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> It created bags under my eyes that were not there before. I&#x27;m 21, and never had this problem before. Never again</li>
            <li> EDIT: I suspect this company is attempting to skew reviews by downvoting any under three stars. When I checked, all recent reviews under 3 stars have &amp;#34;0 of 3 people found the following review helpful&amp;#34;.  I find it hard to believe this is a coincidence.  I had bought this product based on the number of reviews, only to find when I received the product that the company offers free product as incentives to write reviews. I feel a bit scammed, even though technically they did nothing wrong.  In some ways, this was ok. It contains natural ingredients, smells nice, and is very...moisturizing.  But it&#x27;s also VERY thick. Even when applied sparingly it caused me to break out.  Honestly though, this is just made of a bunch of stuff from the kitchen. I&#x27;m sure any avid DIYer would easily be able to recreate it at home at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Doing makeup every day to hide those fine line and wrinkles was too taxing. Though my online research I came to know about this 100% all-natural cream Queen Bee. What results it has given in just a month, simple unbelievable. Wrinkles are gone, fine lines are things of past and my skin is quite smooth. In fact the little dark circles I started to develop have also vanished. The best part this cream has no side effect. Thank you Amazon for giving me this amazing product at such low price</li>
            <li> Just started using the product, and I do like it a lot. I put it all over my face.  I also would like to thank customer service for a very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Been using this product everyday for about 5 weeks on my dark eye circles and have seen no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is not a cream, more like wax or Vaseline. I would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye cream! I have only been using it for a week &amp; already I am noticing a difference in my skin. I had been getting psoriasis like bumps &amp; scaly dry patches on my eyelids from the horribly cold &amp; dry weather we have had &amp; in literally 4 days they were healed! I use it on my entire face as well as my neck. It makes my face feel amazing &amp; the smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li> This organic under the eye cream is excellent. I use it almost everynight before I go to bed...and I spread it on my entire face. My skin feels so refreshed and moisturized from it. It hydrates my skin so well! I contains no fillers and secret scary chemicals like with most skin products out there. Love it! Really excellent cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve used it for a week and already I noticed a change with my dark circles where they are gradually getting lighter.  Additionally, I really like how it smells and sometime I use it for my lips because of the hydration and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say this is the first time I ever used an eye treatment completely and then immediately reordered. It sinks in, not greasy. But most of all, I noticed that my dark under eye circles were gone. I didn&#x27;t notice even for awhile, because I didn&#x27;t believe it.  Anyway, thank you for the product. I will keep using it and have recommended it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to switch around on products quite a bit so this is great.  Also love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I had ugly dark circles around my eyes and I tried many face creams to get rid of from them but none of the creams worked out. I was depressed and hopeless than one of my friend refer me Queen Bee 100% All-Natural, Organic Under Eye.I am using this cream since past 2 months and my dark circles are now disappearing slowly. This cream is awesome and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product feels natural and has a very appealing smell. Have used it for 3-4 days and it is already working, am impressed. Will be recommending this product to my friends too. Received the product on time. Packaging was effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using Queen Bee for about a month and have noticed dramatic changes.  The circles under my eyes have dimished, and my skin feels firmer.  My eyes actually look larger because the tender skin above and under them is smoother and tighter.  For the first time in years, photos taken of me actually look good. And I&#x27;m no spring chicken!! If it works like this for me, it should work real miracles for younger women.</li>
            <li> This is not a cream.  It is very hard.  Did nothing for my dark circles.  I really don&#x27;t think anything out there works for dard circles for I have tried enough of them.  This one is no better.</li>
            <li> Works great.i l love it</li>
            <li> I needed  something to help alleviate the  dark circles underneath my eyes that were caused from me not sleeping enough. I found this product and quickly order a jar to test it out. After a few short weeks of using it I already began to see great results. One of the results I saw was the skin tightening underneath my eyes. The cream applied very lightly and is not too overbearing on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth and has also cleared up some fine lines as well. I feel this product has met my standards in a eye cream and i will continue to use this one as long as it continues to work. I would highly recommend anyone giving  this product a try.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but did nothing for dark circles and fine lines been using it for weeks.</li>
            <li> Not only is this product 100% natural, it&#x27;s amazing for smoothing lines under your eyes and make the skin under your eye look and feel supple, hydrated and really much younger! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and it&#x27;s fantastic. Great price too, which is a good thing : to me cosmetics that work should not cost an arm and a leg and this brand has understood that. This balm smells great, of vanilla, which I love. I definitely recommend this product and have already told my friends about it and also registered it on a cosmetics database website that thousands of French consumers depend on to help them choose beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also so good to be able to use a product that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh or toxic chemicals in it! I value this and place this criteria high up in my list of things to check for before purchasing cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;I love this eye cream and will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product, it works great and I love that it uses all-natural ingredients! I have no complaints and would recommend this to anyone wanting to reduce their dark circles!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 14 days before I noticed a difference.  There is now lightening under the eyes.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this eye cream, so much so that I use it on other parts of my face. I love the smell; it has a very light touch of vanilla. It can be a tad oily but absorbs well, so I use it right before I go to sleep and wake up with soft skin around my eyes, no dry patches like I had with other products. It did not take long to arrive in the mail either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waxy substance due to the fact that it is made of beeswax, coconut oil, and other things that are a solid when in room temperature. I&#x27;ve tried it for about a week and I do see a little improvement. However, it isn&#x27;t huge. I will have to continue using it. As someone with makeup allergies, I was a little hesitant to try it, but I haven&#x27;t had any reactions too it.</li>
            <li> Put these under my eyes the first night, woke up the next morning to even more pronounced bags. Avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Started using this a few weeks ago. My skin has never looked or felt better! Seeing and using this product is believing. This has worked much better than expensive department store creams, without all the chemicals. Love, love it!</li>
            <li> i can not believe the positive reviews, EVEN if they show it&#x27;s a \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot;. Plus i read that the company is rewarding positive reviewers with another free jar. i bet the company is paying people to write those reviews. i purchased it not in the hopes that it will work as an anti aging or anti dark circle product, but just as a moisturizer, given the ingredients. i use Estee lauder Re-nutriv eye in the a.m. and Roc Correxion Eye at night, both recommended by my dermatologist. i always apply a moisturizer over both products because they can be drying. Since i like trying new products, i started with the amazing hydrator LaRoche Posay Hydraphase Intense Eyes (over my EL and Roc), then i tried the very efficient Palmer&#x27;s Line Smoothing Creme (very good and cheap hydrator). Got tired of it so i decided to buy Queen Bee. EVER SINCE i started using it, my eyes started showing signs of dryness. Incredible ! The funniest thing is that it is so thick and waxy that it is very hard to get some product on your fingers. I started applying it lightly. it took about an HOUR to dry, and even then it doesnt dry completely. When i saw the dryness increasing around my eyes, i tried using a bit more, but the skin wouldn&#x27;t absorb at all. i kept dabbing with my fingers clockwise and counter clockwise to get my skin to absorb it, to not avail. SO: bottom line is that no matter how much you apply, it does NOT moisturize AT ALL, it is difficult to take it out of the jar, AND it is not absorbed at all. BUY VASELINE instead, at least it is cheaper. Total cosmetic crap. Needless to mention the packaging which is incredibly cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another company who succeeded to fool me with fake reviews. Sick of it. i am going to use their \\&quot;money back guarantee\\&quot; this time.</li>
            <li> have hard good things about this product. just started to try it out, so i cannot give a full review. although, i do believe it has potential.</li>
            <li> I like this product although it&#x27;s a bit pricey for what you get, and the expectations vs. actual outcomes don&#x27;t match up.  First, let me say I have coal mines for eyes.  I&#x27;ve inherited that lovely feature especially when tired.  Dark, baggy, wrinkled, puffy slits with two beady, green marbles staring back at you.  I wanted a product with vitamin K in it.  I thought it made sense even if I question the effectiveness of absorbing enough through my skin to make a difference.  This tiny jar contains that and some great ingredients and has a pleasant vanilla odor and a soft, waxy feel to it.  Thumbs up.  Using it 2x a day, it has lasted over 3 months, and I believe it has lightened my under eyes by ~50%.  I still have wrinkles and get bags.  I know this is all very subjective, but I&#x27;m willing to continue to purchase it.  I also apply a alpha lipoic acid/olive oil/DMAE hand and body lotion by Reviva, which isn&#x27;t too expensive, over it and on my neck and face.  It draws up the under eye puffiness and moisturizes away the dry cracks around my lips and chin from shaving(Yes, I&#x27;m a semi-vain man, but come on, I want to look my best for my wife!  No matter what the age).   May I recommend: get a little extra sleep at night, laugh a lot, don&#x27;t smoke, don&#x27;t over do the sun, eat sensible, de-stress and enjoy life and love for all they&#x27;re worth.  At least they be happy wrinkles!</li>
            <li> This product is good to keep moist under your eyes; specially during winter...nothing else! So, don&#x27;t look for a miracle cream eh!</li>
            <li> I have used so many eye creams before and found they actually irritate eyes and sensitivity making me look like i am crying. This one however does not irritate eyes and allows me to remain normal and non squinting when i used it however people comment it looks greasy and like i have been crying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for the purpose of helping with black bags. In my experience it helped very little with this. The blackness remains but depreciated a tiny amount. I am now 2 weeks in and see no further improvement. Considering its price when i paid for it was £16.00 approx i see this as very high priced considering what it achieved. In my opinion from now on do not waste money on these products you would be better setting a healthy food and exercise routine and going to bed earlier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 2 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased. It ordered it because I noticed dark circles under my eyes, not real dark but dark enough to do something about it before it got worse. I don&#x27;t wear make up all the time and I don&#x27;t want to start. The circles have lightened 50% so far. My husband even notices. I use it at night before I go to bed and because I work from home, I wear it during the day unless I&#x27;m leaving the house. It looks shiny but not heavy &amp; goes on smooth. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Nothing!!! It didn&#x27;t work they did say u could get 2 free jars with ur honest opinion, so there you have it .., no wonder there is a lot of good reviews 😬&lt;br /&gt;  about the product: The jar looks pretty small,and the cream has like a wax texture to it&lt;br /&gt;  after applying some on ur dark circles u can see like a shine to it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and im starting to see the difference, great product! i love it</li>
            <li> After turning 40 a few years ago, I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding an eye cream that does not contain perfume that will hydrate my under eyes. I&#x27;ve been using this every night for the past two weeks and love it! It is very hydrating and I&#x27;ve noticed a big improvement under my eyes. A little bit goes a long way! When applied to your skin, it warms up and spreads very easily. When I wake up in the morning, my under eye area is still moist and hydrated. I will certainly recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I tried once for a week and started breaking out under my eyes. I stopped and tried again two weeks later. The same thing happened. I&#x27;ve broken out under my eyes every single time I used this product. Maybe it works for other people, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t work for me (at all), but I suppose that&#x27;s just my genetics at work. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it didn&#x27;t perform as advertised for me, but the product smells and feels nice, and has an unobjectionable ingredient list.  Just be aware of the nature of the problem you&#x27;re trying to fix - i.e. whether it&#x27;s fixable or not. :/</li>
            <li> Apply night and morning helps to reduce under eye bags. I love it, will probably buy again to ensure that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> This morning was the first time that I applied this under my eyes. Lately, I have been having really awful under eye circles which is compounded by the dry weather. When I try to apply concealer, the concealer cakes because my skin is so dry. I used this underneath my concealer and it worked well to create moisture so my concealer doesn&#x27;t cake. And I hate to say this so soon in using this product but I am pretty sure my under eye circles are already fading.... of course this may be me seeing what I want to see but my dark circles have been really bad lately, so any improvement is noticeable to me. I am thinking this is due to the Vitamin K in the cream. Tonight I plan to apply to most of my face. I will be trying to use consistently morning and evening and I will come back to update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the cream is kind of on the verge of chapstick but a little creamier and more spreadable. It is very waxy which is expected since an ingredient is beeswax. It stays on your skin kind of like vaseline but to a lesser degree so if you don&#x27;t like that sticky, shiny feeling this is probably not for you. It doesn&#x27;t bother me and my concealer still goes nicely over it. Using on my whole face before going to bed may be an issue however.</li>
            <li> I did not give this a five star rating but, believe me, it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve found.  I suppose I imagine there&#x27;s something 5 star worthy out there.  Yes, I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think that this eye cream is great. It provide plenty moisture to my eyes and face. My eyes are soft and smooth looking. I think that it is working. I use it all over my face. Would like to continue to use it. It is a little hard to get it out of the bottle since it is hard like wax. Maybe better to scoop out with a little spoon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months now.  I actually use it all over my face and it has been great during this very cold and dry winter.  I love the simple ingredients and it smells nice.  I will continue to use this cream especially on really dry skin.</li>
            <li> This under eye product is described as a &amp;#34;CREAM&amp;#34;  however it is exactly like Vaseline and there is no way that you could put makeup over it because it would just come off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These people are not honest in their description and should change their item description so no one else is caught up in their deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent a shipping label to me where I have to pay for the return and handling fees.  It cost $22.98 and is most definitely not worth $2.00.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1 month and there was a big difference in between before and after of usage. Although I think to get a better result I need to use it more.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was skeptical from the start putting forth the $$ once again for another product I didn&#x27;t figure would work.. I really liked the fact of Queen Bee being 100% All-Natural and that&#x27;s what prompted me to give it a try. I&#x27;ve always had really bad lines/bags under my eyes, to the point I hated having my picture taken and didn&#x27;t like any I took of myself... When I first tried Queen Bee I was amazed at how smooth it felt on my skin and the fragrance is wonderful! Every eye product I&#x27;ve used always seemed to be a burden to use and not something I enjoyed putting on my face. My first thoughts when I started using Queen Bee was feeling like a real Queen ^.^ There was a point I&#x27;d find myself putting it on multiple times a day (more than I was brushing my own teeth).. I truly love this product and its so enjoyable to use unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever tried and I can gladly say it was a very great investment! Defiantly worth your $$!:) I no longer have to edit my photos to get rid of the horrible bags under my eyes. My eyes made me look deprived of life, sad or depressed and they are nearly gone now, I feel so much better about my self and my face especially!!! I plan to continue using Queen Bee and passing it on to family members and friends! I just want to Thank who ever came up with this amazing concoction!!!&amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to remove or lighten your under eye dark circles, don&#x27;t get this. A complete waste of my money. This only helps to moisturize the area around your eyes, but other than that, it doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is awesome. It suits me very well. I like it. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> As stated by other reviewers, this is a solid eye cream and melts with your body heat.  It feels nice and absorbs well.  Not sure if it did anything for my dark circles, but it did help with the fine lines.  I would use this around other parts of my face my face and other dry patches around my body.  I would recommend for these purposes.</li>
            <li> Wow it works!  I&#x27;ve tried everything. I would highly recommend it for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I just received and haven&#x27;t used yet, but I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye cream that is organic and 100% natural, and was excited to find this one.  I&#x27;ve heard very good things about Queen Bee products and am looking forward to excellent results!</li>
            <li> i bought this for dark circles but on the actual jar it says nothing about removing dark circles. it is a great natural eye cream, i even use it on my lips. but does not make a difference in my eyes at all. im only 23 so wrinkles are not my problem and that seems to be what this eye cream is really for</li>
            <li> Great and all natural i love it and it last forever</li>
            <li> A good product for eye cream! I have used it for years. I will still purchase it again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this product before f/a friend and has been using every since.  it will reduce puffiness and circles under eyes and only a little is needed.</li>
            <li> I had been using it for a while now but can&#x27;t say that it is erasing my dark circles already.  May need to update this review at some point.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream, great value for the money also! My sisters now want to get it too! It works really well and makes your skin soft and best of all did not make my skin break out and that&#x27;s a first for me! I love it and will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> I am 41 yo male who has tried several products and always ended up dissatisfied or disappointed with the results. The last product I tried was Chanel (very expensive), and I still didn&#x27;t see much improvement. I ordered Queen Bee because I liked the fact that it is 100% natural and I saw some raving reviews. Well, I am happy to report that it is all true! I have been using it for about a week (only once a day before I go to bed) and I can see a remarkable difference already. Lines that were getting deeper around my eyes have reversed 5-10 years. I will continue to use this product faithfully!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim, as other products are so expensive and this was properly priced and appeared to have some real \\&quot;science\\&quot; behind the ingredients, and I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, and in such a short amount of time, my face feels like satin to the touch.  I use it under my eyes to soften the circles before I use my makeup and use it all over my face at night to rejuvenate the skin.  It has worked in replacement of many creams and moisturizers I used to use.  Now, I&#x27;m down to just using the Queen Bee, and my usual makeup regime, and I feel good, my husband says my skin looks and feels good to the touch, and after 28 years of marriage, I appreciate any compliment I receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks QUEEN BEE!</li>
            <li> This cream hasn&#x27;t done anything to my dark circles. I even used it on one eye only to see the change, but there is none. What&#x27;s worse is that I thought the manufacturer mailed it to me, but it looks like some lame reseller or dropshipper, and I haven&#x27;t gotten a response to my week-old request for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 3 days and the swelling in my eyes have already gone down. The dark circles are still visible, but like I said, it has only been 3 days. I also apply a thin layer on the rest of my face. It feels smooth and refreshed in the morning. Nice natural balm smell without any phony fragrances that can dry skin. I like this product. I will update in a few weeks if the dark circles diminish.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but they sent two items.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be introduced to the queen bee cream.  My very best friend received it as a gift and when I visited her she shared it with me.  She uses it for her dark circles and has been for a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was &amp;#34;wow, this smells really good.&amp;#34; And after checking out the ingredients I was thrilled to find that it was all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses under my eyes, I noticed a decrease in under eye bags.  I have been applying it nightly and when I wake up, my eyes feel more alert and open and bright! I have used less concealer, which is great for my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell that my eyes soak in the cream through the night, a time when my skin probably dehydrates most.  I have started to apply it to my forehead (which is beginning to show signs of wrinkles) and was happy to see that it wasn&#x27;t causing any breakouts or clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love that a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used eye creams before that made my eyes irritated after application.  Applying something so close to your eyes needs to be gentle, and I have found queen bee to be my answer.  I&#x27;ve already started recommending to friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is the first cream I have used for under eyes so cant compare it to others but I have no dark circles now after using Queen bee for 4 weeks.Also the skin was dry and that has cleared up.I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Queen Bee all natural organic under eye cream for about a month and have found it it be effective at reducing the apearance of circles under my eyes. It smells great, is 100% organic and it is made in the US. I was doubtful about its claims but so far it really seems to be reducing the circles under my eyes. You need to use it every day but it&#x27;s well worth it. Feel younger without those dark circles and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Queen Bee!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the Queen Bee 100% All-Natural Organic Under Eye Cream.  It really works for my under eye wrinkles.  My skin is very dry, especially during the winter.  I tried many eye creams such as Lancôme, Olay, Shiseido, and found the real problem is that even though some eye creams provide moisture and ease wrinkles when you apply them, they dry out fast and the wrinkles appear again.  Because Queen Bee eye cream is like wax, it does a very good job of keeping the moisture in for a much longer time.  I put a layer of moisturizing cream under my eyes first, and then apply the Queen Bee eye cream on top of it.  It works like magic!  My under eye wrinkles diminished tremendously and my skin naturally glows.  I am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last three weeks and will definitely always have a jar of this at all times. I noticed it took the dark circles and puffiness away quickly. I have used products that made my eyes constantly watering and other products that just dried up and did nothing after applying. Some reviews have said this is like putting vaseline on but it doesn&#x27;t stay like that for long. When my skin absorbs it, my face looks fresh, young and healthy.</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s amazing this product change my under eye earia 80% better i look younger and i start to ues less make up I never thought there&#x27;s an eye cream could help me because I got ues to have dark dry puffy eyes know no more.</li>
            <li> Ok so i have to admitt after a week of using it I thought &amp;#34; this stuff ain&#x27;t workin&amp;#34; But after a month I can truly say i see the differance, and, I am only using it once a day in the morning, Starting tonight I&#x27;ll use twice a day as recommended morning and before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I will be a lifetime customer. My eyes have improves so much I wish I had before and after pictures. Amazed, dark circles are gone, wrinkles and puffiness as well I look rested! Very thankful. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> tried this product as the directions say to do so.  Used the whole bottle and didnt even see any changes at all.  Does not work for dark circles, for me anyways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a day since I purchased it, and I am very happy with the results. I have under eye discoloration under my right eye due to hereditary and constant rubbing due to allergies. While I can&#x27;t do much about my genes, using this eye cream along with getting my allergies under control, I do so a very slight difference. Hopefully as time goes by, I&#x27;ll see more of a change. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s a natural product and is very emollient which is wonderful in this cold, very dry, New Jersey winter weather! Since it&#x27;s quite emollient, I&#x27;m not sure how it would work if you wear eye makeup. Maybe if you put on a very small amount, it might be fine.</li>
            <li> I am used to using skin care brands like Dior and clarins so it was a refreshing experience to try something new and all natural. I personally like the texture yes it feels a bit greasy but it&#x27;s perfect for night time since you want your skin to have all the moisture it can get. So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well but b careful if you wear glasses because it does leave a little residue on the eyelashes that can get annoying. For price and profile ratings you can not do better and I sure as hell looked!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream and noticed my undereye circles lightened within 2 weeks.  I have always struggled to find effective eye creams and would highly recommend this product.  I applied morning and night and found the texture to be more than bearable.  If you also struggle to find an affordable eye cream that actually works, try Queen Bee eye cream.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say this is a magnificent product.  I have never ever worn makeup because  having a natural appearance has always been my desire. Once I got in my forties I noticed the dark circles emerging under my eyes. I tried the under eye treatment from Avon which had minimal affects. I think I used the product for approximately 4 months. Then I tried another product that was over the counter to no avail. I even tried home remedies like cucumbers over the eyes nightly for 6 months which also had minimal affects. I also tried the parsley and plain yogurt which did help some but the older i got the worst it seemed to get even while using the parsley and yogurt mixture. I researched the cause and the only thing listed that pointed to my problem was hereditary. So I just chalked it up that I would just had to live with it. As the years passed the dark circles got darker and more apparent. Once I turned 50 I resorted to using a concealer in which I hate due to never wearing any type of makeup. Once I received your product and as usual I was skeptical but I began my hopes of restoring my under eyes to their natural beauty. After two days (using at night before bed as directed) I saw a noticeable difference. The darkness was not as dark and my husband even stated &amp;#34;that is some good stuff&amp;#34; it&#x27;s making the darkness gradually lighter. If my husband noticed then I&#x27;m sold. Thank you for allowing me to soon throw away the concealer I have been using for the past 2 years. Just having a noticeable difference in two days is awesome. Thank you for using all natural ingredients in this all natural product for an woman who loves a natural facial appearance.</li>
            <li> I’m happy with the successful outcome I’ve had with this cream. I have used another in the past, but it didn’t seem to work for me and dried my skin out. queen bee acts as more of a moisturizer for me and ontop of it, it has been able to get rid of the dark circles I had on my face. I like the odor it has too.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT!!! I would have never thought it was going to work... best case I would have a more hydrated softer areas... But I have been using it for 4 days and it the dark circles are really fading. There is still a light shade of darkness but it defiantly all small. I had dark circles under my eyes that cover the whole underpart. They were also baggy looking... but now the swelling is gone and the darkness seem to be lighting and retreating...&lt;br /&gt;for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I have tried everything... and this has outperformed all of the is less time. More updates later.</li>
            <li> I read so many good things about this product that I decided to try it for myself. I&#x27;ve just started using it but so far so good. Highly recommended. Also shipping was super fast. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy and use this natural product! A good price as well. I will have to give it a little more time for final product review but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks so I haven&#x27;t noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of my dark circles.  However, it has actually lightened a facial scar, and makes my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> The cream smells delicious! I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smelling creams...this natural eye cream smells soft and very edible! The cream went on much smoother than other products I&#x27;ve tried and without leaving a super greasy feeling. I found this under eye cream more hydrating than most of the other natural products I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!), and it was soothing and refreshing for my very sensitive skin (no itching and no red marks like other creams). I prefer this cream for night time as it is very hydrating. I will definitely order more. Thank you for bringing a useful product to my natural skin regime!</li>
            <li> I have been  using it for the past 3 weeks. It smells really awesome and feels nice. I may be imagining, but I feel a significant difference already. It does what was advertised, and for a great price too. I anticipate to continue to use this product. Thanks for this great product.</li>
            <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t do a thing. Please don&#x27;t think it does because of all the positive comments. I used it for 2 months  2 times a day and honestly hasn&#x27;t done anything. Sorry save your money and look else where.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and I love it.  I think it has lightened my dark circles some and it feels great on my face.  I really like all the natural ingredients they use.  It helps protect my skin from the weather and makes it easier to apply make-up.  I will keep using it!  Before using this cream I tried a number of others.  The Clinique face cream I tried made me break out.  This is the only cream I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Great value, I will but it again!</li>
            <li> This cream feels like vaseline. I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference but it does moisturize.</li>
            <li> I was using All about Eyes Rich cream before this. After finding out the number of toxic ingredients it had I decided to switch to something organic and non toxic. The great reviews on Amazon and a careful study of the ingredients lost led me to this purchase. The queen bee eye cream is very soothing. I use it at night time. It tends to be a bit greasy in the beginning but after a while after the skin has absorbed it, it becomes better. I am really liking this cream and would not hesitate to purchase more!</li>
            <li> Every night after washing my face I apply the cream under and around my eyes. When I wake up each morning I definitely notice a difference! My the skin around my eyes is smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> sorry to say that I can not use it at all. It makes my eye lid so itchy . When it happened the 1st time , i thought that it might be the other reason. I stopped using it for a while until the itchy was gone, unfortunatelly , the itchy came back as soon as I use it again :(  now i don&#x27;t know hat to do with it , maybe use it as a lip balm ?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes. I just like the idea of keeping my under  eye area moisturized.. Very good cream</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 or 4 products for my dark under-eye circles.  This product clearly outperforms the other products used.  I am a family practice physician and very careful when it comes to advising my patients about any particular product.  Queen Bee is Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I&#x27;m pleased with the delivery of the product due to the fact that it was free shipping. The product was delivered less than a week after I placed the order. I&#x27;ve been looking all over for natural products that will reduce the dark circles under my eyes and soften my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to start using my product because after reading the reviews and hearing other people stories I&#x27;m excited to see the change.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now and it has reduced my under eye circles. I use it before bed and in the morning, it is easy to apply and seems to work okay when used with concealers. The information page that was included with the product was very useful. Plus, it&#x27;s all natural. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is super smooth and glides on around my eyes easily. Keep my skin hydrated and smooth. And it is super economical, I used for about a month now but only used about 10% of the jar. Great buy!</li>
            <li> i have only been using this for a couple of days and I already see an improvement for my dry skin. i have tried much mire expensive creams and the work fora while but after a few hours my skin is drying again.  i use this on my whole face, not just my eyes.  it is a little greasy when you first apply it but it siaks in after a while so i wait about a half hour before i apply makeup. i will continue to use this and would recommend it.  if i should find any negative about this product i will update my review but so far i have no real issues with it.  for the price its worth a try. i think you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar of the &amp;#34;Queen&amp;#34; , I think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for your eyes at an older age.</li>
            <li> I learned last year that I&#x27;m allergic to Methylisothiazolinone and Methylcholoroisothiasolinone that both are  cheap preservatives used in 90% of  major (including the expensive ones) cosmetic brands. Before I learned what was causing my skin problems (e.g. skin around  my eyes was swollen and irritated) I actually stopped using any creams for months because those creams did more damage than help. However, I just turned 40 and I knew I had to find something good to nourish my skin. I chose Queen Bee 100% All-Natural, Under Eye Cream because it had great reviews. I can already say that my dark circles are almost not visible and the skin around my eyes looks so much better after 1 month of use. I&#x27;m so glad that not only I found the cream that doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reaction but also really improved my skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your invitation to receive a free jar of this product just for sharing my honest opinion. I wanted to take a good amount of time to experience the product so I could share my honest experience.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very rich!!!! Emolient! Just what is needed for the dry desert of the Southwest!&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat the quality of the ingredients- {(ONLY! Olive oil, Shea butter, Coconut oil, beeswax, Vitamin K and Vanilla Essential oil)}&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I bought it for the quality of the ingredients. I never intended to use it just for an eye cream before bed and have not used it that way. I have used it on my hands and my face. I found it too greasy/shiny for my face during the day but I know my face needs to drink up that moisture so I may start putting it on before bed. I rotate a few high quality moisterizing items, this among, them and do not want to use this up too fast but I wanted to get in my opinion before too much time passed by. EXCELLENT QUALITY- There is likely nothing in this product that would be harmful to prevent you from ingesting this product and those are the products I appreciate using. Thank You!!! I will keep this product as part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.  I put it on at night. very thick hard to describe.n  I like that is natural and would probably buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my eyes and wrinkles around my mouth.  Because it is so thick you really have to rub it to get it on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;You use very little like I said it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> it does work when i put this cream at nigh i feel so good at morning and its smell so good to</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my eyes are less dry.  I have still have dark circles, but they too have improved.</li>
            <li> I just got the product and used it at night time and morning. It feels soft and moistrurizing skin pretty well. Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product - it goes on smooth and the scent is pleasant.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the amount or quality of sleep I get, I usually wake up looking tired. I stumbled upon this product and have been using it for several weeks now and I have noticed a significant improvement on my under eye circles. The circles are now less dark and less prominent. I wake up looking more refreshed and awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about the product is the scent. Most will find it pleasant, but I am not a big fan of vanilla scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products to reduce my eye circles, but nothing has worked as well as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I began to use this product last night it will take few days if the dark sleeping circles will disappear but what I love it is all natural with an excellent fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product! Its more like a balm so I use it at night and it keeps my eye area hydrated. I use a little on the rest of my face if its feeling dry and it is instantly moisturized. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it did nothing.It has a oily feeling.I did break out from this and was not happy .</li>
            <li> This is some great stuff! Dont be scared to but something that feels (and looks) like lip balm on your face. Its not greasey, and has no smell. I slept with it on and in the morning my face feels smooth and my pores arnt clogged. I was worried about it making my face break-out....but nothing! Truely a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days, but I can already say I am a fan. Natural ingredients lets you know just exactly what&#x27;s going on your eyes. Smells like smooth vanilla and I feel it has already helped out a bit in fading out my dark circles. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it some more.</li>
            <li> This product works,as a healthcare professional, I am recommending it to my patients. Safe, pure and good. It is so nice not to read a label full of chemicals and with Queen Bee its organic and 100% all natural.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have tried several other similar products that did not work as well. I will be only buying this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars b/c product works well, smells great but did nothing for my dark circles. Eyelids feels smoother and no more crows feet! Eyelashes appear to be longer and thicker after 1 month of use. Still looking for something to combat chronic dark circles.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Used under eyes, before bed, for the past couple months and definitely saw a difference in under eye darkness. I also love that the product is all natural. two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 24 and just recently came to the conclusion that I need to start taking care of my skin better so I won&#x27;t look old when I am old! I have dark circles under my eyes and I would apply concealer 5 times throughout putting my make up on in the AM. I&#x27;m really self conscious about it, so I try to hide it as much as possible. I told my mom she should see how she likes it too. After the first night, she noticed that the small creases/wrinkles around her eyes had evened out. After day two, I noticed it myself on her! I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days, and now instead of applying concealer 5X, I&#x27;m happy to say that now I only apply it twice!!! I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I don&#x27;t want them any time soon! I plan on continuing to use this product! I read that some customers said it was \\&quot;greasy,\\&quot; I did NOT find it greasy. After cleaning my face, I applied Queen Bee under and around my eyes, massaging it into my face. I didn&#x27;t cake it on bc I don&#x27;t like \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling things (like lotions feel greasy to me). I only applied Queen Bee under my eyes before going to bed. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes but never bothered to do anything about it. I just randomly went on Amazon and looked for a product and came to this cream. I read positive reviews about it and thought I&#x27;d try it out. After a week of using it, I can say that I am amazed. My dark circles were reduced significantly, and my peers even noticed it. I will continue to use the cream and will definitely order more if needed. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice smelling and it really moisturizes well.  You don&#x27;t need to use much so the jar will last awhile.</li>
            <li> Some improvement in the dark circles in my eyes. Also moisturizes the eye area. Put very little though, because when I put a bit more it can get into my eyes when I blink.</li>
            <li> I saw this product recommended on Martha Stewart&#x27;s show.  Ordered it for dark under eye circles. There is a noticeable difference-- much improved.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This one is a just great and I will continue to use this product. I highly recommend trying it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;The results you get for the price you pay is very fair as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and recommend it to all young and old. It works great and best of all &#x3D; ORGANIC</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It goes on so smooth and works great at night!  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> my first time to use it, good smell and good quality... after finishing this jar, i would buy another jar of the same product...</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. I accidently dropped it on the tile floor and the glass pot broke lol (my fault) but I didn&#x27;t replace it right away and noticed wrinkles that I didn&#x27;t have while using this product and some serious dark circles! I was absolutely amazed at how effective this stuff really is. I bought another pot and the wrinkles diffused and my dark circles disappeared. This stuff is so beautiful and natural and smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scrape a nice chunk with the fingernail of my ring finger and then rub it between my ring fingers and lightly dab it on. With what is left, I rub it on my lips. It&#x27;s VERY shiny but I do this all at night and by morning it has usually seeped into my skin. I sometimes do put some on my eyes in the morning and it&#x27;s very concealable under make up. Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I useed this product and after one time, under my eyes got very dry and red and itchy; they got so bad that I had to go to the Dr. and use medicine; my eyes took almost 2 weeks for them to heal; contact the seller, and I told them.... and I ask who and where is this product make ( because it doesn&#x27;t say anything in the bottle!!!) they didn&#x27;t answer those questions but they said I can return it as long as it&#x27;s not used and get my money back and I have to pay for the shipping too!!!I just didn&#x27;t bother to return it because the bottle is heavy and shipping will be costly and I used it one time too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be very careful, this stuff can be very harmful and there is no Manufacture Information on it!</li>
            <li> I just got this in today and will update in a week and a week after my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive had bags and dark circles all my life, genetic. Hoping this cream works! So far it smells really good and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li> I have spent much more for a similar product by dr haushka and this is comparable, us made and much less costly.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product for the dark circles under my eyes. I like that this is a completely natural product. I put it all over my face and especially under my eyes and on the eye lids at night before going to bed. My skin feels very soft the next morning. Too early to say whether the dark circles have gone down but I am very hopeful that it will reduce if not eliminate them in the next couple of weeks/months.</li>
            <li> so pleased I bought this item, the best thing I have ever bought have been using this now for only just over 1 week and already I see a difference WOW really impressed wish I had bought a few years ago!!&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this to all my friends &amp; will be buying more products in this range thank you amazon for advertising this and also your excellent service.</li>
            <li> While I enjoy the healthy glow that this product provides for my skin, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my under eye circles after weeks of use. I think this product is not necessarily marketed honestly as it is an oily skin balm that adds a nice glow to your skin but other than that I don&#x27;t think it has many benefits. I also think it is interesting that no one else has commented on this product in the last year...</li>
            <li> Did notice some slight lightening of the dark circles but i was hoping for better results after reading the ratings.</li>
            <li> This is definitely something for nighttime wear as it&#x27;s too oily to wear outside. It also did nothing for my dark circles but I do notice the difference it has made in terms of moisturizing my eye-area. I have allergies that tend to leave my eyelids very dry. I haven&#x27;t had problems with that since using this (almost) every night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished one jar of Queen Bee Eye Cream. I have a very sensitive skin and I&#x27;m often allergic to many kinds of eye cream including Lancome. But Queen Bee eye cream doesn&#x27;t give me any allergic reaction and  it moisturizes the areas under my eyes very well. I notice that it greatly helps reduce the wrinkle under my eyes. As regards the dark circle under my eyes, I don&#x27;t see much difference; because I often stay up late so I think that it&#x27;s hard for dark cirlces to disappear from my eyes. In brief, I love this product and I will buy it again. I hope that it will also reduce dark circles if I use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream under my eyes for approximately 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve yet to see much improvement in my genetic undereye circles.  It is very heavy and feels greasy on my skin, so I don&#x27;t dare wear it under makeup (I have combination/acne prone skin, 30 years old).  However, this stuff is an amazing moisturizer!  I&#x27;ve used it more for dry peeling skin around my nose (from allergies) and for keeping my skin moisturized after at home chemical peels. Its all natural so it even works great as a lip moisturizer.  If you&#x27;re looking for serious, natural moisturizer, this is your product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; really hard put on the skin and too greasy. It&#x27;s the worst eye cream I&#x27;ve ever had. I would buy loreal, clinique or esteelauder eye cream.</li>
            <li> not fan , its super thick and has done nothing for my eyes . I will guess this is a sponsored product.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, it is more like a salve, which I love. It is so moisturizing. I unfortunately have had dark circles my whole life and have tried pretty much every high priced cream as well as just almond oil (also works well). I never really got the promised results from the $100 + creams and had been using just almond oil for the past year. Then I found this cream. I have been using it for the past few weeks and have noticed significant improvement in my under eye circles. I actually wear it at night and under make up during the day. I highly recommend giving it a try. :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and have noticed the wrinkles under my eye reduced.  I also put some under eye in morning under my concealer and this helped my eye makeup to apply smoothly.  Would recommend this product to anyone who wishes to reduce their wrinkles under eye.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to withhold judgment on this product, as it will take a few weeks to determine if it is going to work on dark circles under the eyes.  However, I was very surprised at the greasiness of the product and that it literally sits up on the skin and is not absorbed into the skin.  I had to wipe it off so that I could get in my bed and not soil my sheets.  It was shipped in a timely fashion and without damage to the unpackaged, but new jar.  I may update later.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this cream.  It&#x27;s all natural and effective. I use it on the eye area, lips and elbows. I&#x27;m not sure if it was intended for this but it&#x27;s working those areas as well.  I would definitely recommend the All Natural Queen Bee eye cream to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for one week.  So far, I really like it and it seems to be working well to eliminate dark circles and smooth wrinkles.  It is a salve instead of a cream, but your warm finger melts it before application.</li>
            <li> When I considered purchasing this I had read all really good reviews. I like the smell of this product but it is very greasy. I can only use at night, could not keep my makeup on over top of this.  I can&#x27;t see any difference. I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money. I will continue to use and if I see any change I will write another review.</li>
            <li> When i first saw this product here in Amazon Im doubtful because there is a lot of good ratings that is so good to be true. But then i decided to give it a try. The product comes before the date frame and the product itself appears the way i expect it because i read the reviews. The first night i tried this product i knew that this product it going to work because of the moisturizing effect when you apply it. I apply this product not only under my eyes but to my whole face. When i woke up Ohhhh my it really works just on the first application. My eyebags looks lighter my face looks so healthier and Im surprised because my blemishes looks smaller too. Im using  this for a week now and the effect is getting better and better. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT. And I Would love to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It helped with my eczema. I use it at night and love that I do not wake up with dry-feeling skin.  Love the smell too!!</li>
            <li> i just bought this and i cant tell if its working yet. Its a lil greasy and my make-up does not set to well with it. Works great at night. but again i dont see a diff yet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change after using it during two weeks, I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I only used this for a few weeks.. and have EXTREMELY dry skin.  After one application before bed and another before makeup this morning I can tell a difference already!  MUST HAVE product for glowing youthful skin!</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on very easily and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and under-eye circles aren&#x27;t gone, but look better.</li>
            <li> I just think everybody should be aware that if you write a review, the company will give you a free jar. Seems like an unfair advantage for positive reviews. This is a nice mix of beeswax,olive oil, Shea butter, and coconut oil. It goes on like Vaseline. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not any better than Vaseline and a lot more expensive. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I like this product because the ingredients used are a lot safer than those in many products on the market today. I did not give this 5 stars because it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my dark under eye circles (which is the reason I bought it).  I will continue to use this product however because I like using it on the delicate under eye skin compared to regular lotion because it seems to provide more moisture.  Anyone looking for a less toxic product to use on their face should try this. I found it can also be used as a regular face moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing and I will never use anything else. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the Queen Bee; a little goes a long way and it leaves the skin around your eyes feeling like silk. This product is not restricted to your under eye area. I love using it on my face, especially with this extreme weather. My skin usually dries out in the winter time but I have been using Queen Bee and me face is moist. I have noticed a reduction in the dark circles around my eyes and it leaves a dewy glow to my skin. It says to use it at night but I have been using it both day and night because of the weather. I have already recommended this product to all of my friends and my mother. I have no intentions of going back to my old creams that are full of chemicals and dry out my skin. That is a perk of the Queen Bee, it is all natural and you don&#x27;t have to worry about what you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li> I mix this with the vitamin K serum it does exactly what it days it&#x27;s like magic to under eyes and also the face its like its own vegetable bath for your face</li>
            <li> Wow, this is an outstanding product.  Everything about it is consistent with the reviews.  This works where others have failed.  If you&#x27;re dealing with dark eye circles, it&#x27;s absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li> * This is a truly wonderful product that actually retains moisture through the night. * The consistency is super thick and greasy, but overall has a pleasant aroma. * I would not recommend it under eye make up throughout the day, but it&#x27;s definitely a keeper as a night cream. * In the morning, my eyes look virtually wrinkle-free around the eye area. * I never had dark circles, so not sure how beneficial it is for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I bought Queen Bee a few days ago; first i must say the shipping was super fast, very good and friendly customer service. Product is as advertised, nice size, smells good and easy to apply. I have been using it for three days and i already see a difference. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product only a few day ago.  My skin is softer and lines are softer too.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this July 31 (today is November 12), have been using it consistently, still have a little of the product left in the bottom of the little jar, and will most definitely purchase this again because it works quickly and beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In July I started using all organic products, never throwing out a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; product until I could see definite results from my new organic purchases.  I was worried that my organic products wouldn&#x27;t work as well as my old and more expensive dirty products.  Within two days of using Queen Bee the age-related dark circles under my eyes looked better than they had since their on-set, better than they had with using the dirty products, which I had to use daily in order to keep the minimum results.  After two days with Queen Bee I cheerfully threw out my dirty eye creams (yes, I needed more than one of them), and have continued to use only Queen Bee with wonderful results.  I can even go a couple of days without using it (as when I forgot to pack it for a trip) with no regression in the now-light-area under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this also for the redness around my nose, and in a pinch (another time when I ran out of face-cream while traveling) have used it all over my face &amp; neck.  A little goes a very long way.  I highly recommend it with no reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Dec. 22, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I just received my second order of this product.  As I stated above, it works perfectly, and I will order it again and again.  Included in this order was a card from the company that said they will send to me a free jar of Queen Bee if I leave a review--well, that&#x27;a no-brainer!  Happy to do it, and excited about getting a free jar, so now I will have one in my dressing table and one in my travel-bag!  Thank you, Queen Bee for a terrific product AND a free jar!</li>
            <li> NO, IT DOES NOTHING FOR DARK UNDER EYE CIRCLES.  AVOID  This item is waxy and unpleasant on the skin.  It does NOT absorb at all.</li>
            <li> awesome cream, seems to reduce dark spots under my eyes, does not smell......&lt;br /&gt;will last a long time since only a tiny amount is needed for application&lt;br /&gt;has all natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does not seem to absorb well as a result i use it before bed time...</li>
            <li> smells nice and makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few times. Start to see results. It is helpful to remove dark circles. If you use it just for around eyes it would last for a long time, because the quantity is relative large for eye cream. As it is made from beeswax, it may be a little greasy. But on the positive side, it may lighten the skin around eyes.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time last night seems like a Good Product. I like that it is an all-natural product.</li>
            <li> Well, just few days using this cream and I can see the results. Definitely, my dark circles looks already diminished. I don&#x27;t know how long will take to get rid off them, but I am on the right way. For now, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Definitively, this product is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using for more than 2 months, and I can clearly see the results! I have dry skin, and my skin is much better! Also, the product is made of natural products, which is very good.</li>
            <li> I am using this cream from one week now and can&#x27;t wait to see how better is gonna be, the skin around my eyes is so smooth and it&#x27;s lighter, I use it on my face too, will continue ordering...</li>
            <li> this product gives immediate results. I use it in the eyes area as well as on my fine lines (mainly in my forehead). I noticed immediate results especially in the eyes. the skin looks brighter, my dark circles have dramatically improved and all over my skin in smoother. I actually love the buttery consistency of it. And on top of it , the product is totally natural!&lt;br /&gt;I am loving it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks. The cream is on the oily side when applied on the skin, so I usually do it before bed to let it absorb when I sleep. It worked well with my dark circle under my eye. Sometimes if I had a skin irritation, especially pimples, I also applied a little bit on the skin and found it very helpful with that area. Overall it&#x27;s a great product especially when you think about the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and don&#x27;t have the who-know-what chemicals in there. The skin feels comfortable and that&#x27;s all I expect a skin product to have.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for 3-4 months now......truly i don&#x27;t see much change....I just continue to use it for its nourishing effect.....forget the dark circles. I cant say i hate this product, I just don&#x27;t recommend it if you have pressuring concerns about dark circles, wrinkles and so forth. But definitely  a great moisturizer around the eye area.</li>
            <li> A fabulous moisturizer, and able to be used on full face, as I have very dry skin.  Makes skin feel lovely.</li>
            <li> I use it every day more than one a day and I don&#x27;t see the difference. When I put on it looks like I was crying</li>
            <li> i received this product about 3 weeks ago.  I purchased it because the area around my eyes were puffy, flaky, dark, irritated and dry.  I have been using this product consistently since I received it.  My eyes feels a lot better.  The puffiness, flaking, and irritation is gone.  The dark circles have also shown some improvement. My eyes feel and look 100% better than before.  I will continue to use this product because it has greatly improved the appearance of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works but within the 1-2 weeks of consistently applying product to my under eye area I noticed a visible reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. It also helped diminish the bags and lightened the darkness of the bags. Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Works well I see improvements but only after continuous use. I see people here complaining about terminology but that stuff doesn&#x27;t matter to me. Great product with quality ingredients!</li>
            <li> I received this product a week ago, and I have to say I love it! I ordered this product because I noticed bags and dark circles under my eyes. This made me look much older and tired than I actually am. I have already seen such an improvement. My eyes don&#x27;t look as puffy. The dark circles are slowly going away. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I received and started using the Queen Bee Under Eye Cream about 3 weeks ago.  So far I am very impressed!  I don&#x27;t just use it on my eyes, I use it all over my face because I have noticed that it works better than the nighttime facial cream I was devoted to.  I have dry skin and this product really provides the moisture that I need, and I really like the fact that it is all natural.  I have noticed that it helps with puffiness and fine lines.  I&#x27;m giving more time to see results on the dark circles.  I am excited that I have found an effective product that is natural.  I plan to stick with this one!</li>
            <li> The product is as described. I&#x27;ve been using it daily, but so far I still have dark circles. I was hoping this product would help, but I&#x27;m not too optimistic at this point, for it to actually work on the dark circles. I do like the feel of my skin after using it though. But I don&#x27;t plan on reordering.</li>
            <li> I been using it for about about two weeks, already  I am starting to see the difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Was very hesitant ordering this eye cream.  The texture of the eye cream was different (unlike other creams) however I love it!!  My eye area looks so healthy,  I don&#x27;t have dark circles however the lines I do have do subside when using this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  I would buy this again!  And, as a bonus, you receive a free jar if you give it a review!</li>
            <li> Just recently introduced to the product and so far so good.  Also, no lingering residue like other products because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 days. I like its waxy texture and how beautiful it smells. I have sensitive eyes and skin and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate them, it is gentle enough. The cream has a shiny, glossy appearance when I apply before going to bed, but it goes away before morning. I have no facial lines or wrinkles, but I do have deep dark circles and I am hoping this organic product will help. I can see a slight improvement so far. Time will tell if this is the right eye cream for me.</li>
            <li> The product is safe to use.  No harmful ingredients.  I use it mainly for under my eyes.  It does a great job of moisturizing and I just blot away any excess cream that does not absorb into the skin to prevent the shiny wet look.  Also, this product has no annoying perfume scent.  It does not remove the dark circles under the eyes completely but it does help a lot. I use it everyday after showering.  I would recommend and buy again.  The jar lasts a long time so it&#x27;s a bargain too.</li>
            <li> It really works!!! I ordered it for my wife. I ordered by reading the reviews. It started showing effect after 2 weeks. I will recomand this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I have been using for a month and can see the difference.  The fine lines around eyes are not as noticeable.  Will definitely continue using product.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, save your money and make your own.  Bees wax is just a selling point and only is used to keep the two main ingredients (olive oil and Shea butter) in a emollient form. Bees wax has no other benefit but is a great way to sell a cheap product.  Why all the great feedback you ask??  This company promises to send you a free bottle if you leave positive feedback.  This really pissed me off to say the least!</li>
            <li> Initially I felt it was working as there is some shine in the cream but it really does nothing no improvement in dark circle or wrinkles. Also the seller promises you to give a feed back and you get a free jar of cream that is fake. He got so many reviews by cheating his customers. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I recommend this eye cream to everyone ! My eyes have never looked better.... very soothing and moisturizing, no more undereye darkness!</li>
            <li> I have dark under eye circles from long hours at work and it bothers me a lot as I don&#x27;t like walking around like a zombie all the time so I got this product based on the reviews. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve not experienced any of the wonderful results others have. I&#x27;ve used it for several months and have not seen a single change.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend after she noticed dark circles starting to develop under her eyes. She has been using the cream for 3-4 weeks now and I have to say that coupled with more sleep and more water the improvements have been really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a very nice texture and applies easily, it also doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes at all and it smells nice. The only slight down side is the cream is slightly greasy/oily and looks a bit shiny around the eyes, but as it is meant to be applied at night that really doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly be buying her some more when she runs out and I may even pop some on myself...</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a month now, it definitely helped soften and moisturize my eye-area while reducing the appearance of fine lines and the darkness. I also love how this stuff is organic and all-natural. I apply this by using the third finger as it offers the most gentle touch as i smooth on the hard formula to my under eye and my eye lid. This stuff gives a shiny appearance though so I would only use this at night.</li>
            <li> Though this product is very thick, it does go on very smooth (warms with your finger), though at first I was afraid it would be all over my pillow in the morning, that was not the case. I will keep using it until I find something better, but that probably won&#x27;t happen any time soon!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and the seller. I am very allergic to many things and have not had an rashes or breakouts from this product. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I have noticed some difference under my eyes. This product is more of a balm consistency, goes on smooth and is not heavy.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my face, each night and I notice a huge difference! I can tell that my skin is visibly tighter the next morning! Give it a try :) its also ALL NATURAL!!! Amazing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It does seem to be very natural and is not strong smelling.  I am sensitive to a lot of products and I did not get a rash from it.  I used this product on my wrinkles and where I want to make sure I won&#x27;t have wrinkles.  It made my wrinkles less noticeable in about 2 days.  I used the product before I went to sleep.  Sometimes I forget to used it, but I have really been happy with the product, even if I don&#x27;t use it for the reason they mainly advertise it for.  I have very bad under eye circles and it did not help with those.  I think nothing will help with my circles because I think they are from my allergies.  I have had the circles since second grade.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get out of the small container, as it is solid you have continuously rub harder and harder to get some of the cream onto your fingers. The cream is very oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no allergies, I can use any type of cream on my body. So this is why I was so surprised that this cream affected me the way that it did. I applied it the night before- it felt fine. When I woke up the next morning my under eyes were red, puffy, scaly, and itched so much. I did not know what was going on and did not make the connection. It took my eyes over a week to get back to normal. It looked and felt as though I got a burn under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use the cream once more a few weeks after and got the same reaction. Very itchy, red, and it feels as though the skin under my eyes has gotten thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it over my eyelids, under my eye and on the sides of my eye area. I also use it on my forehead to help prevent wrinkles and to help vanish any existing wrinkles I do have. I can tell it has been helping since my forehead looks a lot smoother. This also works great as a night time spot treatment for acne over my night cream! The seller had my item arrive promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream ever. I bought one already and my mom tried it and she loves this stuff. So I came back to make a new order this time one for me and one for her. Please don&#x27;t you ever discontinue or change this product. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing Product at Reasonable Cost:&lt;br /&gt;I had been struggling with dark circles under my eye for quite some time and tried some products, but hardly any gave as good a result as Queen Bee. The best part is that it is an organic product meaning you don’t get any harsh chemicals harming your skin. Now that my under-eye area is free of dark circle, I can say that the product really helped and would recommend it to all those looking to fight against dark circles. Although, patience is important. It took me around 3+ months to get rid of under-eye circles completely.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I think people write a good review just to get the Free cream. But it doesn&#x27;t work so why would they do that.  Just like Vasaline.</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable- they give you a coupon for a free jar if you write a review for them. It&#x27;s a scam, and the product didn&#x27;t work for me AT ALL! It ships from Jamaica, too, which makes me dislike it even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an amazing, natural eye cream, pay a little more and go with Real Purity. Their eye cream turned my eyes around completely!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. It is very difficult to get out of the jar as quite solid. Also, it is too thick and actually began to block my pores under my eyes that looked like tiny bubbles. I only used for a week. I have sensitive fair skin so maybe it would work on someone with a different type skin.</li>
            <li> I did a lot research on eye cream. I am very happy to find this product. It has very simple ingredients and is all natural. I have been using it for a month and my eye area feels very moisturized. It didn&#x27;t remove my fine lines, but my skin around my eyes feels much softer. I like this product very much!</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t remove my dark circles.  Tried it for a while and saw no results at all.  Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Really good eye cream I noticed the deference the second day I used it. Eye area looks fresher now and the dark circle vanished after few weeks. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Yes Ladies this eye cream really does work.I have used a lot of eye creams and none worked as well as this one does dark circles are not my problem wrinkles are and boy this one worked for me love it .I will reorder it again.</li>
            <li> This rating would have been five stars if the product had been used for the advertised purpose...eye area.&lt;br /&gt;It is not for warm weather climate conditions simply because it melts no matter how lightly applied and somehow always gets in your eyes.  But what it excels at is after showering lightly coat your legs and arms with this balm and you&#x27;ll love how your skin feels.  I&#x27;d recommend this product as an excellent body moisturizer and tan saver, just not for the face.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my under eye darkness. There are better moisturizer products.  The seller offered a free 2nd product after a review was posted.</li>
            <li> Dark circles and facial line became common with my personality. Consulted doctors and friends, tries multiple products; some worked but had side effects on my skin, while others weren’t that effective. My searches over internet lead me to Queen Bee. It read 100% all natural, so I decided to give it a try. Have been using it for two weeks now, initial results have been encouraging, no side effects and the dark circles are gradually decreasing. So I guess the product is worth giving a try and when you can get it at a bargain from Amazon, what’s the harm in trying?</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream that I have ever used. I had large bags and dark circles under my eyes as a result of hypothyroidism. Now the bags and circles have greatly diminished. My eyes are brighter and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item solely based on the great reviews, but I did not see a change in my dark circles and I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I read the rave reviews and had this on my list to try for some time.  I&#x27;ve given it a try for 6 months and it has done nothing.  Don&#x27;t believe the hype, as you are offered a product to write a review so save yourself some money and get something that really works.  Throwing this away now realizing I just fell for the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews, I was expecting a much smaller jar but its actually MUCH larger than I was expecting. I received this in the mail yesterday and of course used it immediately! When i woke up, I immediately could see my dark circles were already appearing lighter and my fine lines were fading! It shipped out fast and got here on the earliest day expected! If I&#x27;m this happy with it on the first day getting it, I can only imagine how amazed I will be in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I read good reviews about this cream so wanted to give it a try. I used it under my eyes and liked it and then started over full face. I love it. My face skin feels so soft and silky. I put under my eyes and all over my face at night and in the morning I put it under my eyes again. I am using it for almost 10 days. Already feel the difference. Will continue to buy this product and I am very happy that its all natural.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye product.  For one it is 100% Natural and Organic!  I also have noticed nice improvements in my skins texture and color around my eye area.  I have been using it regularly at night as my night-time eye treatment.  I also use it on my hands and other skin areas that are super dry due to the winter weather.  It&#x27;s helped with this too.  My husband has been using this and loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such a fantastic natural, organic product available.  I definitely want to continue to keep this in stock.</li>
            <li> I bought this item hoping that I would see results however, after a few weeks I havent really noticed a difference. I will continue to use it until its finished and will follow up if I see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Like the way it feels and isn&#x27;t greasy.I also love the way you aren&#x27;t able to scentse it when you put it on!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it for the past few days and my husband notices how my dark circle disappeared.  The puffiness also gone.  I will update this review if this is just a illusion.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use for the dark circles under my eyes.  While I&#x27;m not sure how well it works for the eyes, it&#x27;s amazing stuff for your lips!  I suffer from extremely chapped lips that gets so blistered and I&#x27;ve applied many things but with no relief.  Because of the creaminess of this cream, I decided to try it on my lips one day when they had become so red (the first stage of my suffrage).  The next day when my lips usually start to crack up and pain, nothing happened.  My lips were fine.  I tried it again when I was exposed to the cold wind.  Same result...no progression.  I have religiously been using it for all my kids and their lips have remained supply soft in the harsh winter.  I won&#x27;t buy this for eyes, buy it for your lips.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who has been using it for a few weeks. She likes it a lot and says it seems to work well. It has a nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything, but feels good nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Queen Bee 100% All Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream! I have finally found an under eye cream that nourishes my skin without redness or irritating my eyes. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for about a month.  I don&#x27;t see any improvement in dark circles or fine lines.  Also, the product is a lot like vaseline, which is gross and gets every where.  Maybe good if you have super dry skin, and a little goes a long way, but definitely NOT for me!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for 2 weeks. My skin looks so smooth. Not only is it good for under your eyes, you can use all over your face. Love it</li>
            <li> I chose to try this product based on good reviews. It arrived promptly, good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Queen Bee for 3-4 days now, I guess it takes longer for the results to show, but it smells amazing! I usually have allergies to under-eyes cosmetics, but this cream (more like a paste) feels very light and my eyes feel great. Looking forward to positive results and trying other products of this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a couple of days and already I see a difference. I put it on at bedtime and when I wake up the skin under my eyes looks more refreshed. I&#x27;ve suffered from dark circles my whole life and so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good products and this one seems to be the best one in my opinion. I will definitely order this product again! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews but decided to try it for myself ,boy was I impressed. I have only been using this eye cream which is the consistecy of vasoline  for less than a week and i can already tell a difference in my fine lines I never had dark circles just a few more lines around my eyes than I wanted. Wonderful definitely try it and you will not be sorry also I love the name .</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! Great Value! Natural Ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticeable spider veins around my eyes since having laser surgery. This product has helped tremendously by decreasing visibility.</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot. All natural and not oily. Leaves my skin radiant, clear and fresh feeling! I will definitely buy it again! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin look amazing and feel amazing. I have already noticed an improvement in my fine lines &amp; wrinkles as well as my dark circles!</li>
            <li> my husband really loves this for his dark circles it works fantastic. I will be buying more soon because he is almost out, so worth thie price.</li>
            <li> This product has done nothing for me. In fact, it made my eyes look more wrinkly. Do not waste your money on this product. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like is all natural however it did not help my eyes in any way have been using for  3 weeks and I see no difference.</li>
            <li> The first time i put it on under my eyes (to get rid of dark circles) i did notice an improvement overnight. It has not been a drastic or lasting change though so I am still giving it time since I only got it a few days ago. so far so good hope to see a bigger result</li>
            <li> I expected a cream based eye cream when ordering this. It is definitely something new to me, more like a salve. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my cuticles at night too. A little oily and shiny once applied so it needs to be applied at night as directed. I will still need to use another morning cream.</li>
            <li> I used a expensive product that most like cause the extinction of three species and it hurt my eyes and made them worse as for wrinkles.  I bought this to see if it would work better and I got results over night. It is a little oily so you have to wear it before bed or you look shinny all day. But I was amazed with the results and it help a lot with dark circles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Queen Bee for about 3 months, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  It definitely diminishes dark circles &amp; hydrates the skin.  I think it works just as good, if not better, than other products that cost much more.  I really like that the ingredients are all natural &amp; plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t work for dark circles as promised. Vitamin K can only go so far. Dark circles are caused by many different factors (hereditary, diet/exercise, lack of sleep, hyperpigmentation, loss of collagen/indentation, leaky blood vessels, etc.) so don&#x27;t expect this to be some miracle cream because it&#x27;s not. Don&#x27;t buy into the hype of all these creams-I&#x27;ve tried everyone (Teamine and a dozen others) and none of them work. Just get professional help and see a skin clinic or your dermatologist..</li>
            <li> this is great it worked instantly for me, from the first time I used it I seen good results. also it&#x27;s not just good for under the eyes, its a great face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with dark circles but the consistency is a little oily to use it in the day so I use it at night.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a month now and have noticed the lines disappear and the dark circles reduce. I use the product twice a day under my face cream. Ive also noticed that I don&#x27;t use a much concealer as before. Would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I totally didn&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t work.  rather put coconut oil on your eyes cos that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s primarily made up of.</li>
            <li> I still use it at night because my skin is very dry and this is a very thick greasy wax like product. it helps moisturize my face but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li> I read some pretty outstanding reviews and decided to make the expensive plunge and purchase one. it turned out to be an ok product. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a normal/ dry skin combination and I use queen&#x27;s bee as my night cream. It works good and helps keeping my skin moisturized. For day, it is little too oily for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24-year-old male, and I wanted to get rid of my dark circles and perhaps even some of the small wrinkles that have started showing up in my eyes.  My sleep schedule doesn&#x27;t help at all with my eyes looking healthy either.  I&#x27;ve tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff before, the Radiant Eye Cream, which helped some, but it never helped completely get rid of my dark circles and lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started this stuff about a week ago, and I was very skeptical of it at first.  I could hardly get anything off the top without digging my nail into it, and that wouldn&#x27;t really help much either because then I&#x27;d just be rubbing a hard clump of stuff around my face, but it would never rub in.  So I just kept rubbing in what I could each night, and, surely enough, the wax started softening a little bit to where, after about 2-3 times of swirling my index finger around the vat to get some on my finger and onto my eye, I could get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I woke up, and my eyes look better than they have since I was probably 20 or perhaps even in my teens.  I know, I know.  I&#x27;m not even remotely old.  But I always get guessed a few years older than I really am due to the wear and tear I&#x27;ve put on my body from full time school and full time work at the same time.  I&#x27;m just so pleased that I know look my age or perhaps younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call this a knee-jerk, premature review if you want since I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, but I know how bad my eyes have looked over the course of these past few years, and, when I noticed that they look better than they have in years already.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how they look in a month.  Sorry.  I&#x27;m just too pleased to not post a review!  I felt compelled!</li>
            <li> There is probably nothing wrong or bad with the product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have bags and dark circles under my eyes and I used this product twice a day for a month and saw no improvements at all. I&#x27;m going to keep using it because maybe it will help with wrinkles eventually, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> simple, natural ingredient list, smells great and I have noticed a reduction on puffiness, fine lines dark circles after just one month of using it. Also has a great light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Well let just say after using this I went back to using Clinique.  Save your money because it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now.  The texture was different than what I was used to, but I got used to it quickly.  It is good in a way because I use less than a normal cream (which I tend to use too much).  A little goes a long way. I love the slight honey/organic scent.  My wrinkles have not vanished, but I see a definite improvement.  I use it over my face, and it is smoother in the morning.  It soaks in fairly quickly, and I am very pleased with this product.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product consistently for about a week. No noticeable difference. I will continue to use it, but I can&#x27;t recommend the product at this time.</li>
            <li> Just thought the curtains should be drawn here. Upon receiving my order I also received a promotional note saying I could get another free order if I only wrote a review here on amazon. I can only assume that&#x27;s why this has so many 5 star reviews. Although I&#x27;ve been trying it for weeks on end an it has done nothing for my dark circles. It might have affected crows feet minimally. It&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I have used for a couple of days now and I see a difference already.  Makes my face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> In the short time I have been using the eye cream I have already had significant results. I LOVE this product and plan to buy more! Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 2 months, mainly with the purpose of  minimizing my age lines and preventing more. I&#x27;m in my thirties and so far seems to be helping. Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different product for dark circle and none compare to this all natural product it not only removed the darkness underneath my lovely eyes but left them delicate and smooth I will always return to this Amazing product and recommend .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working for my fine lines or winkles. I&#x27;m 34 years old and recently noticing signs fine lines. I was hoping this might work but i have only used this for 2-3 weeks. perhaps it takes a bit more to help. it does get rid of very dry patches on my face and great to use on dry lips too</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have had horrible dark circles under my eyes for about fifteen years (since I was about eighteen), and nothing has ever helped.  I&#x27;ve often complained that they made me look dead--or undead, like a zombie.  They&#x27;ve made me look tired and sick when I&#x27;m not, and I&#x27;ve hated them all these years.  In my much younger days, I tried creams that were up to $90 a small jar, and if I noticed any difference at all it was so slight that I found I couldn&#x27;t rule out wishful thinking as the reason for &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; any improvement.  Fortunately, I realized long ago that spending so much money on eye creams that didn&#x27;t really do anything was ridiculous, and I didn&#x27;t try another till a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not at all exaggerating when I say that THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.  I stumbled upon it accidentally and decided to order it on a whim (along with the fact that it had great reviews and was only $25).  Honestly, it said it would remove dark circles, but I didn&#x27;t believe it.  All kinds of products say that.  I don&#x27;t know if they just don&#x27;t work for my kind of circles or if the manufacturers are outright lying, but I&#x27;ve always felt that the most they&#x27;ll do is make you feel better to know that at least you&#x27;re doing SOMETHING about the problem and not sitting idly by. I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it when I realized that this time was different.  I saw a very slight improvement in two days.  Slight--probably only noticeable to me--but definitely real.  Not my imagination, not wishful thinking.  Also, my skin started to feel smoother.  I&#x27;m pretty sure my dark circles are the result of very thin skin--my eyes aren&#x27;t sunken, but the skin under my eyes has always been recessed, a definite line between it and the skin over my cheekbones.  If I touched it, I felt an actual ridge between the areas.  Now?  That ridge is gone.  Gone.  My skin is all level, to look at and to touch.  And my circles have been shrinking from the outside in--since the outside areas, of course, were the lightest.  The outer half of each circle is completely gone.  This has taken two or three months, applying morning and night, to happen, with steady decrease in pigment.  I hope the cream will continue working until my circles are completely gone, but I&#x27;m not really worried.  It&#x27;s exceeded all my hopes thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I just want people to know about this unbelievable product, especially those who are very self-conscious about their dark circles, so that they can be as happy with it as I am.  Some have mentioned that it&#x27;s more waxy than creamy, and that&#x27;s true.  It does look shiny for a little bit after you apply it, but as another reviewer suggested, I just dab it a little with my finger when I&#x27;m done.  It also has a couple kinds of oils in it, so if you break out easily (I think I&#x27;m about average here) this may be a bit of a problem.  Sometimes a little red dot will appear under an eye, but it&#x27;s nothing much and is gone almost as quickly as it came, without leaving any mark.  For me, it&#x27;s more than worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to shut up about this cream since I started using it.  My family has to be sick of hearing about it.  But it&#x27;s magic, people.  Forget science (or don&#x27;t).  It&#x27;s magic.ourse, were the lightest.  The outer half of each circle is completely gone.

            <li> I understand the concerns about the promotion of this product by providing a free jar to people who write reviews. This means there&#x27;s probably a bias toward more positive ratings -- if you like it and want another jar, you will leave a review even if you don&#x27;t normally review products! (But this might have backfired since some of the irritated customers who didn&#x27;t like it might have been inspired to leave a review too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this product. It seems to have worked well in terms of reducing the puffiness under my eyes, and even has reduced the lines when I smile. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have retinol or other products that conceal wrinkles by irritating your skin -- what do they do to it after 10 years of use? I am in my late 40s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles (yet!) but the darkish circles and morning puffiness aren&#x27;t pretty. This product has worked where others haven&#x27;t -- have tried Neutrogena and straight vitamin E. The vitamin E capsules did seem to work also, but after a while caused an allergic reaction. Keep in mind that this product doesn&#x27;t work instantly. It took about 2 weeks before I saw a change, but it seems to have gotten even better over time. So I recommend it for puffiness and circles that aren&#x27;t severe. My skin is oily, but another plus is that even using it twice a day it hasn&#x27;t made my skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered a jar for my mom!</li>
            <li> I am shocked that it is working so good. I have had hereditary dark circles forever.&lt;br /&gt;Use it every night and they are starting to go away  And if i get up in the middle of the night I put more on.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect it to work over night. It took about a week for me to start seeing a change. But I had bad circles.&lt;br /&gt;All natural ingredients can&#x27;t ask for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a Great product Queen Bee !!!!</li>
            <li> The item arrived right on time but I am not happy with it. This product is very greasy and stay greasy under my eyes all night.</li>
            <li> First, I was under the impression that creams made for specific purposes like removing the black area under the eyes, are like any other creams available in the market, they just assign each cream to a specific problems, but at the end they are all creams. It turned out that I was wrong and their are some creams in the market that really works for what it is intended to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As using this Queen Bee 100% All-Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream for (3) nights, I am seeing really progress and the black area is starting to to go away. If the progress continues in the same rate, I expect the black areas to vanish in the coming (2) weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Product.</li>
            <li> This is is my first natural organic eye cream.  I like the texture and ingredients even it is oily on the skin it doesn&#x27;t irritates or stings my eyes.  I put it around and over my eye area, including eyelashes and browse for moisturizing at night time.  I noticed the skin are softened under the eye area.  I sometimes use it in the morning before I applied make up.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I also applied some to my laugh line when I noticed that the other day.  The next morning the laugh line melts back into my skin and become unnoticeable.  I am yet to see its effect on my dark circles.  However, I know there are many factors that contribute to this problem to many people: amount of sleep, a healthy diet, vitamin suplement, or allegies would affect that area.  Having said that, this is a nice product to carry around while travelling because I can apply it to my entire face.  I even use it over my cuticles when they are a bit rough! I would recommend it to my friends.  When my dark circles are gone I will give a 5 star!</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife and she has been using for about 3 weeks.  She has been using it daily, and there is a subtle change (reason for only 3 stars right now), but she has really dark circles.  She likes the product though and we&#x27;ll see if it continues to get better. I&#x27;ll update again in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of Vanilla...and it has Vanilla in it. I&#x27;m allergic to Vanilla and it makes me sneeze and when I was pregnant, the smell was even worse. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> So far I like the product. Because of its consistency I am only using it at night. But it is great for before bed. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for a month.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results, but was surprised at how long it took for the cream to be effective.  I saw no change until the third week or so.  (I should note that while I&#x27;m 25 years old, I&#x27;ve been battling pretty severe symptoms that have caused chronic sleep deprivation for a little more than 2 years.)  I love that it&#x27;s organic, safe, and gentle on the skin, and will definitely continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me.  :)</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and next morning my circles look lighter but after a few hours they come right back. This product is also very greasy.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be very greasy after applying, it was not a good idea to put on in the morning before my makeup.  If i did, I had to wipe it off.  I tried using it at night before bed thinking it would have time to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; and I would wake up greasy around the eye area where applied.  I again had to wipe it off.  I did not have the product long enough to see if there would be any changes, it was too greasy for me, so I returned it.  It may work for others, but was not for me.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this eye cream because the area around my eyes is so sensitive. I&#x27;m glad I did because I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s too rich for me to use during the day under make-up, but it&#x27;s the perfect night cream. The skin around my eyes is so moisturized after just a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;removes dark circles&amp;#34; claim but am not holding it against the product since there is no eye cream out there that will do much for dark circles. Dark circles are hereditary, occur from lack of sleep, dehydration, etc. No cream will do anything for that.</li>
            <li> Have used for about a month and have not seen any improvement on my dark circles or fine lines.  kind of oily most likely not purchasing again if no improvement by the time I finish product.</li>
            <li> Almost done with my first jar. My under eye area is smooth, even, soft, and line free. But zero change in my dark circles. The wax is oily so night use only for me. Will use one more jar. And will discontinue use if no change in dark circles. It may need more Vitamin K.</li>
            <li> I waited almost 4 months to write this review in hopes that I could join the hundreds of others who loved this stuff, but It just didn&#x27;t work. I only gave it two stars because it did moisturize as I put it on, but by the time I woke up in the morning I had crepey, dry eyes. It also didn&#x27;t work on my hereditary dark circles at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I would suggest changing the formula. I was tempted to use other eye creams I have simply because this is so hard to apply. The texture is just not good for an eye cream. It&#x27;s like a lip balm. Perhaps if it were in a lip balm container, it would be much easier to use/apply.</li>
            <li> Friends say with a very moist, effective mitigation eye skin wrinkles, worth having, but also has some effect on the dark circles</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for over a month now, and am very happy with the results. It&#x27;s long lasting and has done wonders for my dark circles and puffiness. I will definitely continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my dark circles around my eyes. It&#x27;s just a creme that smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my skin both underneath my eyes and the overall surrounding of my face . It even helps relieve my skin from allergic reactions. The dark circles underneath my eyes seem to be lighting up quite rapidly. I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends who suffer from dark circles. I know for sure that ill continue to buy this  product</li>
            <li> So it definitely does work.  The darkness under my eyes is not completely gone, though.  This product does work as described, and it also leaves the skin under your eyes looking healthier.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle in a jar though, it will not completely erase dark circles for most people.</li>
            <li> Why so many positive reviews? I don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just another eye &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; that doesn&#x27;t do anything. I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a cream, more of a pasty oil? Someone mentioned Crisco and that seems pretty on target. It&#x27;s so oily that it just sits on top of the occular skin. Used it for 2 weeks, so absolutely zero affect on my fine lines/dark circles, I&#x27;m suspicious of the reviews on here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your $$.</li>
            <li> wow!  I have only had this product three days and I&#x27;m in love with it.  Why you might ask so soon.  The skin under my eyes was getting very lose.  I ordered the product to help my chronic dark circles but was surprised at how fast it rehydrated my skin.  My make up lays like velvet now under my eyes.  They look so refreshed I can&#x27;t wait to see long term how this product helps my dark circles.  I was happy to write the reviews and tell my friends about this product.  My free jar you are sending is going to my mother to try.  You gained a customer for like.  I plan to explore more of your products.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients used in this cream. It’s made with all natural ingredients and I’m excited to be seeing such good results after only a couple weeks of using it. I also like it because along with helping my dark circles to go away it makes my face feel soft after I put it on. It’s got a nice texture and has been easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> Did exactly like it said it would do.The product should be called the miracle cure, as it faded the dark bags I had under my eyes for years.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles, and puffiness under and around my eyes. Nothing has helped so far. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work because it contains only a few, and natural, ingredients. I purchased it based on the great reviews, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I don&#x27;t know how, but it does really work. I really like how I&#x27;m not putting a lot of chemicals on my face and I definitely see a difference in not only the darkness and puffiness, but it gives a &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; look that really makes a big difference, I don&#x27;t think I can go without it now! I&#x27;m really happy with this product, and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> It really works.... My dark circles are starting to fade! This is the only product that has worked for me..</li>
            <li> This eye cream is great.  I am 69 yrs old and have used lots of eye creams.  I will have to say that this cream deserves a 5 star rating.  It moisturizes well and only requires a very very small amount.  You will see a difference in softness and the diminishing of fine lines within the first 24 hours.  I really love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my face break out and now I have clogged sweat pores that my dermatologist wants to do a microderma skin care procedure to unclog.  It is good for the feet however.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work for me. most  esp. in my eye dark circles...But it&#x27;s smell good..</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have battled with dark circles most of my life so I was hesitant to try this product. I have been using it for a little over three weeks and it has worked incredibly well. The scent is great too!</li>
            <li> Decent product, but not overly great. It seems that if you give this item a great rating, they will send another jar free. I don&#x27;t feel that it was good enough to lie for a free jar. Better for face rather than dark circle remover. Has a nice scent. Would I recommend this product to any of my friends? Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> Ok as my header says. I&#x27;m a male. I used to never really care about taking care of my skin over as a youngin. But now at 23, over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve paid more attention to my skin. I&#x27;m filipino and european so the asian side of me has blessed me with, overall, good skin. BUT,  on my dads european side of the family, they suffer from genetic under eye bags, and dark circles. He had surgery once to have his removed, but nonetheless, they came back in time. I had signs of it, especially when I got into nursing school and my diet, sleep, and anything that had to do with taking care of my skin went out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I finished nursing school, I&#x27;ve tried to pay more attention to everything as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I was a highschooler (football and track athlete) I&#x27;ve always suffered from dry skin so I&#x27;ve learned to used body lotion. EVERYWHERE. Be that my face. Not thinking there was a difference in any particular moisturizer. But youtube video after video, article after article. I&#x27;ve learned a ton. I drink a ton of water, eat well, sleep good (haha), and as my daily and nightly routine. I use a cleanser (pore refiner), a toner, and moisturizing face lotion. but my dark circles and eye bags never went away. that was my routine for the last 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this queen bee stuff and it&#x27;s been a week. I&#x27;ve used it every day, night and morning. righter after I do cleansing and toning and before I put moisturizer. and I am not lying when I say this. This stuff has worked really well. My eyes have cleared up really well. My family noticed as well especially my mother who always preaches to sleep well. since I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand what people mean about the out of the box consistency being kinda like candle wax, but that&#x27;s just the top layer. I used my ring finger to apply this stuff being that it&#x27;s the gentle finger. but anyways. push into the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; hard enough and you&#x27;ll notices a very soft honey like texture. you gotta kinda break through the top layer and move it around. before each usage. once you do that and apply it. (I apply about a pee size under each eye and any excess I put on the top of my eye lid and any more excess I apply to my forehead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is a little oily, but it&#x27;s ok, in my opinion. I leave it on for as long as possible and if I go out, I just dab away the &amp;#34;oilyness&amp;#34; not all the way though, just enough so it doesn&#x27;t look like I finished crying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-smells great&lt;br /&gt;-easy to apply after broken layer&lt;br /&gt;-WORKS (for me that is)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-oily&lt;br /&gt;-can make your eyes feel weird if it gets in there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;works well, especially if you have a good skin care routine. definitely recommend using a cleanser and toner beforehand and a moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: when applying any eye cream, apply it but dont mix any facial moisturizer into the area you applied the eye cream. certain chemicals can offset and therefor detour the eye cream from working. apply eye cream specifically for the eyes and facial lotions everywhere but the eyes. your eyes don&#x27;t have natural oil glands so thats why they look dark, because the skin layer gets thin and you can see the vessels under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely sold on this stuff. I already bought 3 more for the future. but this current jar will last me probably the next 6-8 months. so I&#x27;m set for the next 2-3 years if the company goes under. which i hope they do not.you gotta kinda break through the top layer and move it around. before each usage. once you do that and apply it.

            <li> Used product for a month...all I got was oily eyes!!!  Waste of money!!!  Do not buy if you value your money!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to get rid of the dark circles around my eyes (or at least lessen them) and I used it for three weeks every day twice a day and there was NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER in my dark eye circles. I bought this because it had a lot of 5 star reviews but now I&#x27;m almost certain the 5 star reviews are all fake. Please stay away from this cream because its just bona be a waste of your money if you buy it.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on easily.  It does leave your eye lid and area under the eyes quite greasy.  It does moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li> Has a real nice smell.Did nothing, however for my dark circles under my eyes after using twice a day for two weeks. I found it to be very greasy, so could not wear under makeup, but now a problem for nighttime use. Wish it had helped. Will look around for something else.</li>
            <li> She had been using an expensive cream she bought from one of the shopping channels... she says Queen Bee works just as good or better and doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much!</li>
            <li> Dark circles fade with in at least two weeks using it.  If you wear contacts be sure to remove before use if you get them in the eye it kinda stings a bit and contact becomes useless... I learn the hard way... no harm done... just an FYI...&lt;br /&gt;removed dark circles, clears up skin tone around the eye... I like it!</li>
            <li> I was shocked and a bit skeptical when I saw so many reviews for this product. Then I saw that so many people were questioning the reviews based on customers receiving a free jar for giving a great review. Against my skepticism, I ordered anyway. I still have dark circles. I don&#x27;t think anything changed. I used it at night for a month and no difference. Not even lighter The card that comes with the cream says &amp;#34;We want your honest opinion! Receive 1 free jar of the product you ordered just for sharing your experience.&amp;#34; I was excited to order because I don&#x27;t like concealer. I want to go out bare face but my dark circles age me and I don&#x27;t like them. And its not a cream. Its almost like shortening and when you put it on your skin it turns into oil. Its too oily to put concealer over and I didn&#x27;t want to rub it in too much under my eyes because the skin is so sensitive so I wore it only at night. Good luck to those who do try it</li>
            <li> I have been using as the directions say to do and have not started to see any results with the dark areas</li>
            <li> Was not impressed. Very hard to take some cream out. Feels more like wax. And too expensive.</li>
            <li> I keep getting this product too close to my eyes and end up kind of bloodshot and goopy in the morning, but that&#x27;s user error. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure my dark undereye circles have lightened at all, but I use it all over my face for my aging skin - it leaves my skin soft and younger-looking for sure. THAT I have noticed! And I haven&#x27;t decided if this is a positive or a negative, but it smells so good I almost get kind of hungry right before bed, hee.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer indicated, I also was skeptical when I received this product.  It is definitely waxy, rather in any way being a cream.  However, after using it for less than a month, I can definitely see a significant improvement around my eyes.  I have never found anything that reduced my dark circles prior to using this!  Even my husband has noticed it.  As a blonde, I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life and now they truly are much lighter.  It also seems to be doing a good job helping with wrinkles around my eyes and in the &amp;#34;frown area&amp;#34;.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My eyes have a lot of problems. I have dark circle, puffiness and since recently they started to grow winkles. Through the years I have been trying to find an eye cream that can help me with these issues. I tried almost all the department store products. I won&#x27;t say that they didn&#x27;t work but I can barely see any difference. Until one day I found this eye cream. Originally, I don&#x27;t have a lot of confidence in drug store products but since it&#x27;s in a reasonable price, I decided to give it a shot. In the next few days I saw my puffiness clearly shrink and some of my wrinkles disappeared too. I fell in love with this eye cream ever since.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days and I already see an improvement the product is very thick, but goes on nice &amp; smooth. I love this &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results. I love that its natural.I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This did not live up to the claims. Did not like fragrance. Seems like a good moisturizer. Returned product with no problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this does not work.  Wish I would of saved my money, but had to try.  Bad call</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks now.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer but hasn&#x27;t impacted my dark circles at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the excellent reviews. I did read the negative views, but because there were so many more good reviews, I thought for sure it would be my new miracle eye cream. I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive. I have been using it for a few months now and unfortunately it has done nothing for me. I kept giving it more time in hopes that I would see the wonderful results that everyone else had, but no luck. It does a good job moisturizing, but it is so greasy that I would rather use a much less expensive moisturizing cream instead. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and I am very surprised that it has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> It is a nice moisturizer ...but I did not notice any difference in dark under eye circles, lines and puffiness and fades facial wrinkles as stated in the description!!...I really hoped it would have worked on the puffiness!!</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I just wanted to try a new under eye cream. This turned out to be the best one I have ever used, takes care of dark circles, makes your skin soft and supple, highly recommend the product!Yule not loose anything !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product and it&#x27;s smells nice. It seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;You need just a bit of product under your eyes. It&#x27;s oily and it&#x27;s not going to be 100% absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li> I  am very pleased with my purchase of Queen Bee. I purchased this product to hydrate my under eye area and to improve the appearance of  fine lines and puffiness. I  was pleasantly surprised by the results. I am a 44 year old female with sensitive skin that is prone to mild rosacea. I have had a very difficult time finding anything to use on my face, especially in the under eye area. This product is amazing! I have begun to use it all over my face. It goes on like a balm, but it easily disperses on the skin and leaves skin feeling soft and non greasy. I am so pleased this product is 100% natural and organic. I highly recommend this product !!!!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does!! Smells really good too :-). Could tell a difference. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I ve been using it for 6 months regularly and sometimes it seems that my dark circles and puffiness actually worsened.  Seems like i wasted my money. the only thing that i notice is that it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> I think this gave me an allergic reaction? Now I have dry flaky red skin under my eyes, DONT BUY THIS, I have to go to the doctor now, and my eyes hurt and are swollen, this is all I have been using under my eyes</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t reduce or eliminate my dark circles. Also, like most products, it migrated into my eyes and irritated them. However, all was not lost - I now use this as a hair product on my dry, curly hair. It works fabulously to tame my bangs into place and to eliminate some of the top frizz that we curly girls tend to get. The smell is nice - no chemicals and only natural scents. For those like me with chemical sensitivity, that&#x27;s really appreciated.</li>
            <li> Love this! I put this on my entire face before I go to bed and in the morning I wake up with smaller pores, blemishes disappear or fade, and more even skin tone. This cream is literally a miracle worker! Also, I love all of the natural ingredients, I don&#x27;t feel guilty using it because I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my face. I recommend this product to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> All this product does is moisturize your skin. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but it definitely does not lessen dark circles/ under eye bags in any way.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a few months, and i can see no difference. i&#x27;m pretty pale, so my under eye circles are very prominent. i&#x27;ll come back here and edit this as soon as they lighten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously every night for the  past month and a half and I honestly see no difference in my dark circles so far. The puffyness did reduce, but puffyness was never really a big problem for me (so it reduced something that was already small in the first place). My problem has always been the dark purple circles under my eyes, and after using this product for almost 2 months I still don&#x27;t see any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it though, as I still have a lot of product left and I don&#x27;t want to make the money I spent on this wasted. I still hope it&#x27;ll start making an improvement eventually, but I&#x27;m certainly disappointed, I was expecting at least a little improvement this far, but I see nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars and not 1 only because of the puffyness reduction and because I like the product&#x27;s consistency.</li>
            <li> I was really wanting to see a difference in under eye dark circles, but alas...I still have them.  It does smell nice and it probably helps with under eye wrinkles, so I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and helped clear up my under-eye circles after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a cream but instead, it&#x27;s waxy but it goes on really smooth and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference so far only after a few days and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I gave this eye cream a four star because it seems to be reducing the puffiness under my eyes and I have only been using it for a week. I haven&#x27;t seen much difference  with the crow&#x27;s feet but I&#x27;m happy to see some of the puffiness going down. I put it on before I go to bed because it does leave a shine on the face.  It does moisturize my face some too. I am hoping to see more results in time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely impressed with Queen Bee Cream! I initially purchased this cream because I was looking for a product with more natural ingredients to use for moisturizing my under-eye area - I wasn&#x27;t expecting to find a product that not only moisturized my under-eye area, but also reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, made an incredible lip balm, and was useful as an intensive salve-like moisturizer for dry spots, scratches, and scars all over my body! The cream smells amazing and feels fantastic on the skin! It does take quite a while to absorb (a result of the natural oils that make the product so incredible) and can look a bit shiny on the skin, so I only use it at night or when I know I&#x27;ll just be lounging around the house, but the moisturized feeling lasts until the next day, so only using it at night works just fine for me! If you&#x27;re looking for an intensely moisturizing under-eye night cream made with natural ingredients I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I found that this product truly has made the dark circles under my eyes fade. Has also made my skin more pliable and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> this is the real deal folks! I have tried many things for my dark circles around eyes and this is it!</li>
            <li> Queen Bee has worked wonders for my dark circles. I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past that claims to help remove dark circles, but fails to do so. After applying Queen Bee every night for a few days, I can already see noticeable improvements with my dark circles! Already had lots of compliments from my fellow co-workers. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer but no changes in dark circles.</li>
            <li> Seeing all of the positive reviews I was very optimistic to finally find a product that could help alleviate the naturally dark circles under my eyes but this product has really neither helped nor hurt. It smells nice and I love the natural ingredients it is made with, however, it seems as ineffective as simply putting water under my eyes. It is also quite greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin very well. I think it is completely overpriced for such a tiny jar with a label that looks like someone made on their home printer. I will continue using it under my eyes and on my neck until I finish the jar, but I will not be purchasing another. I find that using the derma-e Vitamin E oil and putting a few drops of organic rosehip oil and lavender essential oil in it gives me the best results, smells amazing, and is extraordinarily affordable! I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As a guy I was not sure what to do about the dark circles under my eyes. I have a lot of job interviews coming up and did not want a future employers to think I stay up and party all night. All the other products I saw on amazon looked like concealers that just covered up the dark circles. I was looking for a product that had vitamin K in it because I was told that really helps with fixing dark circles and wrinkles. After receiving the product I was surprised to feel it had more of a waxy consistency than a creamy one. The other thing I would like to point out is when you put it on it makes your skin look very shiny. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now using it when I get home from work and again right before I go to bed. I have noticed the product to do exactly as it was described. I am very happy with this eye cream and will purchase it again from this seller. The fact that it is 100% All-Natural, Organic and Contains NO cancer causing additives or preservatives is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty cautious when I hear about natural products that work to deal with skin problems, and with this product that held true. However, I figured I&#x27;d try it because so many people found it helpful and because I was so tired of looking like I was pulling all-nighters when really I was getting great sleep (undereye bags). I have to say - the results are amazing. People would often comment that I looked tired, and I could clearly see why when I would see pictures of myself out with friends, etc. Since using this product for a little over a month the undereye bags have cleared up significantly. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with undereye bags. But you have to use it religiously. If you are using it once a day before bed - make sure you use it every day. I use it twice a day with a more generous application at night. Try this product, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have been using the product for two weeks now and I have to say that I have hereditary dark eye circles but yet before I decide to write my review I look myself in the mirror with a bright light like a thousand times so I can give details of my improvement. Well first of all I use the product in all my face and neck, my face appearance looks more bright and my eyes look a little refresh that is why I didn&#x27;t fill in all the stars bc I am still waiting on a more deep result on my eye area but honestly they look much better than when I wasn&#x27;t using this product oh another thing I would like to add ladies if you have a minimal dark spot in your face this product helps!!!! Honestly I had dark spot on both side of my upper checks and I don&#x27;t see it any longer so keep that in mind I guess since is a natural product it works great on skin. Ideally like my queen bee and when it finish I would buy another also ladies when applying this product on your face don&#x27;t forget the sun screen is very essential :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my eye cream</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; arrived and it is hard as a brick.  I can only rub a little off at a time.  I don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to be like this or not.</li>
            <li> Product works great for lip gloss but that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s like a salve clogged up pours around my eyes! It didn&#x27;t have any effect on my dark circles ended up ordering another product for that. should add a color tint to it makes a great lip gloss!</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for the dark circles under my eyes, other than to make them super greasy.  I&#x27;ve been trying it since November, I think the reviews made me more hopeful than I normally would have been, and it&#x27;s really done absolutely nothing.  It&#x27;s moisturizing, sure, but it&#x27;s pretty much like rubbing lard on your face.  I think the good reviews all come from the manf. letter that if you write a positive review you will receive a free jar. Cheaters.</li>
            <li> You would be better off with Crisco cooking oil. So much for the Amazon rating system with this one. How it got almost 5 stars is a joke!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t do much for dark circles.  I used it for almost 2 months at night and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  Now I use this product for my lips and it works great for that.  For my dark circles I now use a product with haloxyl and that seems to be helping quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I use this  faithfully every night, but after almost two months, I have not seen any improvement at all. It is creamy, yes, but its ingredients are not any different than other similar eye creams.  It certainly has not offered the results it touts--</li>
            <li> Age range: 20s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a good sleeper, I get around 7-8 hours of sleep a night and YET I&#x27;ve always had issues with dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried everything and then I stumbled onto this little gem. I decided to take a shot by buy this last October and oh my god was I surprised! I was surprised at the balm-y feel of it but my skin got used to it soon after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sisters started noticing a difference in my eyes and face just after two weeks of using it in the AM and PM. If they could see a difference in my face even though they see me on a daily basis then I knew this product is legitimate! I&#x27;m definitely getting it again :D</li>
            <li> It is great for wrinkle but don&#x27;t see my dark circles getting better. But the product came with a broken cap. Maybe they shall put more protection for delivery.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Dark under eye circles gone.  Wish I would have tried this before buying all of the other expensive creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Queen Bee</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all.  It was super heavy on my face and very oily.  It also irritated my eyes and seemed to cause an allergic reaction.  This may work for someone else but definitely isn&#x27;t something I can use.  I seem to have some sort of allergy to most facial cleansers/washes and was hoping that since this was very simple it would be ok for me.  I guess not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact the seller and explained that I was having some sort of allergic reaction.  Within 24 hours amazon sent me instructions on how to return the product.  I did so and did received a full refund minus the shipping fee.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any dark eye circle cream and i simply love it, ive been using it for a week and my daark circles are already lighter! Yesterday I was skyping with my cousin and she also commented on how my dark circles &amp;#34;arent there anymore&amp;#34; :D . I have had dark circles since forever and i was used to them , but few weeks back a co wroker pointed out how ugly the dark circles look , i was so upset and came to amazon for help and found this amazing product. love it! also ive been using it on my stretch marks and i can feel a little difference in them as well!</li>
            <li> The cream helps reduce puffiness around the eyes with consistent nightly use. The texture is a little thick, but you will quickly get used to that. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and have struggled with dark circles.  I have been searching for a product to try to diminish the look of my darker circles and I came across this product.  Hesitant, I looked through many reviews before buying this product.  Almost all of them were good! So, I went along and bought this product.  I have been using this for MONTHS, at night and even sometimes during the day.  While it moisturizes, I have NOT noticed any difference in my dark circles.  I&#x27;m so disappointed so I am now searching for another product that will hopefully diminish the look of my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my under eyes look better but this product feels amazing on my face.  I have noticed fine lines and small wrinkles disappearing, and my skin feels so fresh and hydrated.  I used to have a number of breakouts a weak because my skin is very sensitive, and since using this product I have almost no pimples...ever!  I love that it is natural and it smells great.  There are no miracle creams and if your under eyes are dark from genetics, no cream will remove that completely but Queen Bee is awesome, and especially for those with sensitive skin trying to avoid chemicals in their products, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is my first time using this product, because I like to natural organic product, I think it is good for your body and skin to use as much as nutural product. So far I think it is good product, I don&#x27;t have dark circles, but I am still using it now as a kind of eye cream to protect skin aroud eyes.  I am looking forward to it will bring me some surperise change in near furture.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t see any improvement yet ... :(</li>
            <li> This is just a little container of moisturizing mixes of natural oils. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and have not seen any dramatic difference in my eye area. It goes on greasy so I put it on after I wash my face and before bed. Feels hydrating but has not done anything for me.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I took out time to order this cream, well receive and start using only a week and notice that this cream has already done wonders for my skin, I&#x27;m a woman over 45 years of age and started to notice my skin getting very dark and drier, tried using over the counter creams but was unsucessful with find something that would work for me, while on amazon website searching ran across this item and having been using it since for under my eyes and all over the rest of my face, notice my skin is more softer and supptle it&#x27;s like my skin is thirsting for this it&#x27;s very light not to heavy where it clogs up your pores.</li>
            <li> Nice moisture...greasy, like you are wearing Vaseline, but it&#x27;s all natural. My fine lines didn&#x27;t diminish after finishing the entire jar, but I did get some compliments that my skin looked good. I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything significant.</li>
            <li> I use this almost nightly. You only need a tiny bit and I use it on my whole face not just around my eyes. I like the fact that everything in it is natural and not full of chemicals. I wake up with a smooth hydrated face and beautiful skin. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hydrating without the harmful chemicals like in most products nowadays. I use it under my eyes &amp; on my lips. It can stay a little on the greasy side of you apply too much (why I deducted one star) however. Other than that it&#x27;s wonderful &amp; I will repurchase :)</li>
            <li> I did not have to think twice about giving 5 stars.  Smell of vanilla lightens my day.  Balm like cream allows my skin to be moist until the end of day.  All natural is just a bonus.  Wonderful bargain.</li>
            <li> Might work for others,  but for me nothing short of eye surgery will cure my under eye circles.  Mine are just&lt;br /&gt;getting worse the older I get and this did nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  It smells nice  ,my skin fell in  love with queen bee!!  Thank you and I  already reccomended it  to my friends</li>
            <li> I like the consistence of the product. Very moisturising and lovely smell.&lt;br /&gt;Still need to try it to see the result with dark circles.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I had heredity dark circles but this product instantly moisturizers make skin and makes my dark circles look less noticeable. This product is AMAZING as an after shave too! One issue is that I can&#x27;t put it \\&quot;around\\&quot; my eyes like other products, it&#x27;s only for UNDER eyes(and it works great there). It&#x27;s kind of Vaseline like too so I only put it at night. I think you should try it once, it won&#x27;t cause any harm since it&#x27;s made of four organic ingredients</li>
            <li> I am afro american and very sceptic to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it to remove my dark circles caused by aenemia. So far it&#x27;s working great and it also soothes my little wrinkles that I have on my forehead. The smell is pleasant and the consistency of the cream is pretty light and non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I love it I look forward to seeing even better results with time!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the great reviews from others who suffer from dark under-eye circles. I believe that over the years I have tried every product on the market that claims to reduce these dark circles (I&#x27;m 59) and not one of them has ever done anything to help. That is, until I tried Queen Bee Organic Under Eye Cream. This stuff is a miracle worker and is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. I had only been using it for one week and already noticed a huge difference. The darkness under my eyes had lightened up significantly. I have severe allergies, so my eyes water with that. This product does not burn my eyes like others, during allergy season when they water and itch. I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping the lines beside my eyes, but I&#x27;m confident that with time those will fade as well. (Now if they could just come out with a product to help frown lines, that would be wonderful). I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers with dark under-eye circles. It works and it is priced well. Very inexpensive for this type of product. Thank You All Natural for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have had it for a week and already see a difference. I didn&#x27;t necessarily need it for dark circles but I have gotten wrinkles and puffiness under my eyes and dryness on my upper eyes below my brows. This product has helped with it all. I work nights and usually by 10 or so I&#x27;m looking a little tired and droopy around the eyes. This has stopped that and is turning things the other way. I can also put it near my eyes and I&#x27;m not tearing up or burning. I am so glad I found something that works and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes and skin. At first I thought the price was a little high but this will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little over a couple months into using this product and I can definitely see the difference. If I forget to put it on at night, I can literally see the puffiness return the following day. My dark circles do also appear to be lighter, but it took time (maybe two weeks or so) for the gradual lightening to take effect. Don&#x27;t forget to use it or skip nights. Queen Bee works best when it&#x27;s used consistently as a routine. Others are also likely to respond differently to it and may or may not see more dramatic results than I did. But know that it does work, and you&#x27;ll likely see improvements in some form or other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on this cream for life and won&#x27;t be going without it.</li>
            <li> I quickly saw the stars and the many 5 star reviews. I used it for a month and my eye bags look worse!!! ugh!!! I am already depressed and self conscious about it this Queen Bee is worthless imo. Maybe it just works different for other ppl. Those people are lucky.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I was really optimistic. I thought I would definitely see some change in my under eye circles. Unfortunately, I have yet to notice a difference, but I&#x27;ll keep using the product and remain hopeful.</li>
            <li> I received this eye cream just a few days after I placed the order and this product is wonderful and inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;The most important part is that it contains all natural ingredients without synthetic chemicals or fragrances. Additionally, I really like how it smells. Thank you for making this wonderful formula, QUEEN BEE!</li>
            <li> I have started using this for the past one week and i could see much difference within 7 days. Doesnt feel like applying under the eyes but gives soothing effect and by far the best dark circle remover. I have tried Loreal and Garnier eye roller but none of them was useful. Try to face your face and applly this cream which smells like a white diary chocolate and do wonders to remove your dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product just for two weeks now and I can see lightening of the dark circles below my eyes. Using this is definitely easier than other google solutions for dark circles like cucumber, potatoes, cold spoon, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice vanilla smell. However, this doesn&#x27;t really absorb fast and so skin does stay moist for a long time. Due to this, I am using this product only at nights and not during day time. Anyways, its effective and I would certainly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This has been the best under eye cream I&#x27;ve used! Due to allergies, I&#x27;ve had dark under my eyes all of my life and the darkness has lessen.</li>
            <li> If you are a man who has &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; puffy eyes which make you look older and tired all the time get it. I only use it at night since its greasy and I don&#x27;t like people to see I have any product on me that I use anything, but  it still works, also works in eliminating other wrinkles. I bought it like two weeks ago, HUGE change!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty consistently, once a day (at night) for the past 2 months. My under eye circles have lightened a bit, but they are still definitely there, so it has not worked as well as I hoped it would. On the plus side, the ingredients are natural, it keeps my under eye area moist, and it smells good, so I will keep using it and hope for further improvement.</li>
            <li> this is the best body butter i have used! i really like this brand and will continue buying it always</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star because it is the best product that I have used for my under eye darkness.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I can see that my dark cirles have diminished by a great deal.  As I got older my dark circles got bad.  I needed something to help reduce them and this was the product.  When I did my research for the best product I kept coming back to Queen Bee.  I tried 3 other products before this and they did absolutely nothing.  It applies much thicker than anything I tried but it smells great and you can feel it setting in properly.  If you want to reduce your dark circles I reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels.  It makes my dry skin feel so much softer and nice. Will buy it again for sure</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. As others stated it is quite thick and greasy but I apply a thin layer at night and in the morning before work. I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be scented however, especially Vanilla! My face smells like a cake when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I like that I can pronounce every ingredient in this product and I know what each is. I am not certain that the dark circles have decreased in intensity but it definitely keeps the area well-moisturized and concealer is easy to apply on top. I use it all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for few months now and have seen great results . I really  like this product and will be buying more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says - shea butter and coconut oil.  Nothing irritating, so that&#x27;s very good.  Leaves the skin around your eyes very greasy looking and does not soak into the skin well.  Certainly only for use at night.  Can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s removed any dark shadows and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now.  Also - no coupon for a second jar free, so this was a pretty small amount of shea butter and coconut oil for the price I was charged.  Good quality ingredients, no complaint there, I just thought it would be absorbed better into my skin and naively believed it might actually lighten my dark circles.  Foolish me.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product, so far I like the product, it helps my eyes to not look tired. Feels like oil which helps the skin feel smooth and i like the smell of honey. The first day I tried it I saw my under eye dark circles get a bit lighter, I am still trying it, but so far I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Queen Bee under eye cream just a copule of weeks for my dark circles.  I have not used it long enough to see a difference yet, but....I have also been using on my dry elbows and it works like a dream.  The cream keeps my elbows moisturized all day which have been difficult to keep moisturized with body lotion.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it says it does .... Very Happy with this product .. I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other great reviews... love it! I have been having trouble with my eyes due to allergies, and I tried using another brand&#x27;s &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; eye cream, which left my eyes red and puffy! My eyes improved within 1-2 uses of this eye cream. It only takes a little bit, so it will last a long time, and it is definitely helping my fine lines and dry patches! Not sure if it&#x27;s helping dark circles yet, but usually nothing works on those, so even if it helps a little I&#x27;ll be happy! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am delighted to have found this effective, affordable and all natural eye cream! I also use a little dab on my forehead - absorbs well overnight and smells good too :)</li>
            <li> I used this product for seven months and didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.  It does last a long time though, and smells nice.  I do like that it&#x27;s all-natural.  Unfortunately, it does nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that would be natural and not full of chemicals like most under eye creams. I decided to do some research on Amazon and to my amazement, was able to find Queen Bee Under Eye Cream which was 100% organic. The reviews from others looked very positive and so I decided to try it out. The only catch was I was about to leave on vacation in a few days and was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t receive it in time for me to take it along with me. Fortunately, the seller was able to get the product to me rather quickly...I received it the day before I left!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very smooth and not heavy (it&#x27;s not a cream but more of a balm). It&#x27;s been about a week since I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;ve already noticed some difference under my eyes. It also works well on other areas of the face (using it on my forehead for wrinkles). I am very happy with the product and the seller and plan to continue purchasing the product for my wife and I, as well as making recommendations to friends and family. Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the dark circles yet, but I absolutely love this product. I use it as an all-over glowifier (is that a word?) over my makeup. I had three people come up to me recently and tell me how great  and youthful the texture of my skin looked. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for the entire face as well as neck! I use it as a daily moisturizer. I am an African American women I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago. I use it twice a day under my eyes, forehead, and sides of my mouth. It does give the appearance of less lines/wrinkles. It can be greasy if you use too much or if it&#x27;s not rubbed in completely. Looks good under makeup too. Fairly inexpensive too if compared to similar items on the market.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. As it contains all natural ingredients, I have used it not only for eyes but also for my entire face at night. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me. I know everyone is different but I was very disappointed. If it helps at all I am a 30 year old Tagalog Philippino non smoker. Hope this aids in your decision.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m pregnant and am trying to not put any chemicals in or on my body.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I&#x27;ll tell you what... this stuff works better than any expensive, toxin-filled products that I&#x27;ve ever used!  Plus, for the price it&#x27;s great because a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time!  I will definitely keep buying this!</li>
            <li> I got this balm for my dark circles but I have not seen improvement for some reason my dark circles get darker. I have been using it for about 2 weeks, i would apply the balm 3-4 times a day but was not satisfied... I will continue using for another 2 weeks to see if my dark circles get a little lighter if not i will stop using it.</li>
            <li> Works rather well but you have to use it continuously. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to last but I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s almost still full. haha. Also, it makes your face really oily if you don&#x27;t wipe a little off with a paper tower or something.</li>
            <li> I really like that this under eye cream doesn&#x27;t have endocrine inhibitors and other nasty stuff in it.  Aaaand, it really does decrease the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  I use it at night instead of during the day, though, since it is kind of greasy.  I would definitely recommend it to others as a night cream.</li>
            <li> The packaged received 4 days before the estimated day. The ingredients of the product remind me about Native American remedies and indigenous medicine, so now I am confident using this product around my eyes. If this product works I am defiantly ordering more.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Very moisturizing! little goes a long way! Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my under eye darkness but it is probably a gradual change that will take time. even if not, it&#x27;s a great anti wrinkle moisturizer!</li>
            <li> For over a year now, I&#x27;ve had under eye circles, my girlfriend suggested this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for as little as a week now. WOW, only a week&#x27;s use and I already see a difference, can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month of use! Yes, I&#x27;m a guy, but I also noticed my wrinkles seem softer, as well as my girlfriend, I&#x27;ll take that too. Happy customer here.</li>
            <li> I like this product - it has a nice smell, all organic, and it has vitamin K. I originally looked for vitamin K in liquid form (for my dark circles), but I decided on this product seeing as there a lot of good reviews. While it has been only a couple of days, I can tell there is a slight difference in my dark circles, however my wrinkles have stayed the same. So, hopefully, with continuous use my dark circles and perhaps my wrinkles will get better.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is definetly unlike others ive encountered. Its not too thick, nor is it too greasy. I have been applying it before bedtime and i have noticed an improvement in my eyes already. Product was also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Very rich.  Nice, light scent.  All natural, great price.  Texture is almost like chapstick that softens or melts when it comes in contact with warm skin.  I apply under eyes  to clean face at night.  Not a quick fix for wrinkles, but I am pleased with the moisturizing effect over time.  I don&#x27;t wear it during the day if I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  It takes too long to absorb and makes the makeup start to run.  It is WONDERFUL on lips.  I also put it on my two-yr.-old&#x27;s wind-burned cheeks with excellent, healing results.</li>
            <li> I randomly came across this item and based on the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is great because the skin near my eyes are super sensitive. I&#x27;ve been using it almost every night for about 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference. I&#x27;m going to continue using it and see what happens after another few weeks. I hope I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I almost sold out to write a glowing review for my free jar with purchase...but the only reason I would want the free jar is to make up for the amount of money I spent on a useless product. I decided the truth was worth more. You could literally put coconut oil on your face and get the same result. I say this cause I sometimes do this and it&#x27;s cheaper. It does nothing other than hydrate in a greasy format. We are all looking for a miracle product but less stress, eating healthy, yoga, meditation and drinking water will provide the miracle. I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on a product that entices thru false reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing that keeps the round areas of my eyes smooth and rejuvinate. It keeps my whole face to very smooth and manageable to repair the dead cells that makes it brighten from the dark skin. I really amaze with this product and never regret that I bought this. Its very easy to use and my skin doesnt irritate with this product so I really much consider that this is the product that prove me nothing is imposible if the product is truely trusted.</li>
            <li> I received the Queen Bee Eye Cream a few days ago and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It is silky smooth and applies very easily, I even use it as a lip balm! I use it before bedtime, the cream is very rich and the skin around my eyes feels soft and nourished in the morning.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a natural eye cream without all the chemicals and artificial ingredients other creams offer.  The seller is also wonderful, I got the product within 3-5 days, as promised. Will definitely look into other products this seller has to offer from this line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is natural and really softens my eye area. I haven&#x27;t been using it that long so I can&#x27;t comment on reducing dark circles, but I really hope it does.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying All Natural Queen Bee Eye Cream and it&#x27;s an EXCELLENT product!  I saw all the positive reviews on Amazon and had to try this eye cream.  I have extremely dry skin and this eye cream hydrates my eye area perfectly!  Thanks so much for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams over the years and this is first product that has helped my dark circles and crows feet.  Most important - it is all natural and therefore I trust using it near my eyes.  My only suggestion would be that you offer it in a larger size, because I would like to use it all over my face.  Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this stuff when looking for something to help with dark under eye circles but I was looking for something with natural ingredients and tried it.  While I am not sure it did it&#x27;s job on the dark circles, it DOES help your skin heal at miraculous speeds.  I am always cooking and baking in the kitchen and get burned on my wrists and hands sometimes... or the sporadic curling iron neck burn occurs... this cream seriously speeds up the healing process and reduces the appearance of scars SO WELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is Oily, and I cant imagine using it under makeup.  It&#x27;s a &#x27;put on before bed or when you&#x27;re not leaving the house until after you wash your face again&#x27; sort of cream.  Its actually more of an oily wax consistency rather than a face cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I was surprised by the waxy substance, but thought that I need to at least give it a shot.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using it incorrectly (I&#x27;m not sure how that can be, but just in case), however, I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and I have seen ZERO improvement in under eye circles, color or wrinkles.  Wondering if this was perhaps just a poor reaction with my under-eye skin, I tried it on a few other places with either dark or fair coloring and again on wrinkles that were either deep or barely there.  The outcome was the same - absolutely no change.  I am very happy for everyone that had such good results with Queen Bee, but I have had no result and wish I could have my $22.00 back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this day and night for two weeks but haven&#x27;t seen a difference in under eye darkness. I like how it makes my skin feel softer but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything. I&#x27;ll use it until runs out and will then try something else.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !!! &#x3D;) it&#x27;s a bit grease but it works great and it&#x27;s all natural to boot.</li>
            <li> Already see a huge difference in just a week. I am just starting to get wrinkles around my eyes and after 5 uses, I don&#x27;t see them at all anymore. So happy!</li>
            <li> Super natural, and really effective!  I am weird about the products I use on my skin, because it&#x27;s your biggest organ!!!  But this stuff had basic and natural ingredients.  I was skeptical when I first tried it because it was more balmy than creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to work.  My eye skin was soft and supple, even after a looooong night!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I have had dark circles under my eyes all my life and this is the only thing that has faded them. Its is pretty heavy so I use it at night and I use a lighter eye cream in the morning under my make up. Fine lines are no more with this stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it really acts like the coconut oil, that I was used to ,nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;It works much better for the night,helping the skin to revive  :)</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s okay...but it hasn&#x27;t cured my puffy under-eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s solid, like cold coconut oil but it melts readily on warm skin.  I have found it to be a great lip balm, and why wouldn&#x27;t it be?  It has beeswax and coconut oil in it, which are both lovely emollients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t done anything for my major-league eye bags, sadly, but it IS nourishing to the skin, and wonderfully safe and organic.  You could eat the stuff.  I will use up my little jar and report back if my eyes look better after a stretch of continuous use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for about 3 or 4 weeks now. I really haven&#x27;t noticed any change w/ the dark rings under my eyes, which is why I purchased it. I thought for sure it would work after seeing so many positive reviews, but after receiving my package, I know why there are so many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller promises an additional free jar of eye cream if you give them feedback. So I sent them feedback after a few days and commented on the fast delivery. They responded and said that once I posted a review on Amazon and they confirmed it, they would send a free jar. This is when I became skeptical, so rather than review immediately for the free offer, I wanted to wait. They basically build up a list of good reviews with the promise of free jars, then get more orders because people see the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to order, I would suggest something else, or a different seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the queen bee for about a month every night. I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference for my dark circles by I have seen the fine lines under my eyes fade away. I have very dark circles so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to work as fast. I do love the smell very comforting! It makes the skin around my eyes very soft. Love this product will rebuy!</li>
            <li> The cream is very hard. It is nearly impossible to get out of the jar. What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> At 69 years old, all of a sudden I noticed under-eye puffiness and, after reading the reviews, tried the Queen Bee All-Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream.  I have been using the cream about a month twice a day as recommended.  I have noticed a softening of the lines and less puffiness, and I do like the consistency of the eye cream, which will make it long lasting.  I also like the fact that the cream is all-natural and organic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye cream because I was having trouble finding a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t upset my skin (I sometimes get bad reactions from face products that contain lots of chemicals). Have had no problems with this product so far! Gentle on my skin, no redness, and definitely see results!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. This eye cream really gets rid of dark circles and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. I have found that combining this cleansing system with Renuvaderm Oral Skin Supplement and anti-aging serum [here are the links http://www.amazon.com/Renuvaderm-Resveratrol-Phytoceramides-Ingredients-Recommended/dp/B00JK5ZN76?tag&#x3D;donations09-20 and http://www.amazon.com/RenuvaDerm-Anti-Aging-Fast-Acting-Containing-Transforming/dp/B00ITXVZK4?tag&#x3D;donations09-20], I get dramatic results. My skin is not only clean and fresh, fine lines and wrinkles are significantly reduced making me feel like a look 10 years younger. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have dark circles and very fine wrinkles under my eyes because of my pale skin and working 12 hour shifts in the hospital; this started working wonders in just 3 days! Definitely is amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have dark circles, (yet) but I decided to buy this cream due to many reviews by people who claim this cream does work for fine lines and not so fines lines around the eye area.  It leaves a shiny oil around the eye when apply so it&#x27;s better for night use only. It&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s working but I like the  consistency of it and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 2x sometimes 3x a day. I have really dry skin and this is amazing on my eyes! I have seen a difference with my dark circles. They look smoother + my makeup doesn&#x27;t look flaky with this on.You have to keep in mind that its very thick so you can apply it then work on lotion or hair while it dries up.I will be buying this product again. Nothing better than having something that works and being organic!</li>
            <li> I didnt see any  changes in the bags under my eyes from using this product.......I tried ti for a month it doenst work for me.</li>
            <li> Not creamy. I think for my age the wax is too hard, and it does take quite a while to get it to soften. From here on in, I will stick to professional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could be for some people. For me, the professional products seem to work better or Living Clay makes my eyes nearly flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with the seller though.</li>
            <li> did nothing to my eye area. had to order something else. Very soothing though</li>
            <li> Overpriced! I wish the reviews were not so good but they must be from people whoose main issue is dryness because this is mostly Shea Butter. They got over on me with this but I wont buy it EVER again! For the TINY amount you get I would advise you try out a couple of other products that cost half as much as this and then make this product yourself for all of 4$!</li>
            <li> Guess I was expecting something different, but this stuff is literally bee&#x27;s wax and just funky to put on under eyes.  It appears to be a quality product, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product, especially if you feel any irritation. I could feel a negative reaction from my skin but continued to use it anyway in the hopes of getting rid of the dark circles so I can only blame myself. After using this product not only did the dark circles remain, but I also saw/felt that the skin under my eyes got thinner and saggy when I smile after using this product. I have stopped using it but I wanted to warn others. This product was harsh on my face and I regret having used it since I now have saggy under eye skin when I smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this under eye cream for about two weeks now but I do not have dark circles under my eyes, I didn&#x27;t purchase this cream for that purpose. I like to put it on my whole face, the smell is great, and I put it under my eyes to PREVENT dark circles and lines as I get older. I have not noticed anything drastic.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that it has made two of my acne scars a lot lighter. I think in about another 4-6 weeks they should probably be hard to see. I do not think it works overnight but with time you will see results.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that each review I read was superb as customers stated their skin has shown visible signs of improvement. I honestly cannot say the same.  Maybe I&#x27;m looking for a different sign of improvement.  But to date, I haven&#x27;t had a jaw dropping difference.</li>
            <li> This product not only didn&#x27;t work, but it made my dark circles visibly  worse.... would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old and have always struggled with dark circles, (hereditary) and within the last year.. fine lines that are only getting worse, quickly it seems. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything with really no improvement. I purchased this because of the awesome reviews and seemingly fair price. I am only on my second day using it and the hydration alone it has provided has given a noticeable difference in the youth of my skin. I was definitely thrown off in the texture of the product,  it is waxy like a lip balm. But it goes on surprisingly light, and to my delight works well under my make up. Most creams make my foundation build up, or emphasize the fine lines in my skin making me even more self conscious, always having to look in the mirror and smooth out the makeup which..only irritates and dries my skin out even more. But this product has not been an issue with that thus far, it has offered relief. I believe it will help with the fine lines, but not totally sure about the dark circles. I&#x27;ll have to post an update once I&#x27;ve used it a bit longer. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but actually feels like velvet. I have applied it under my eyes at night and wake up without my eyes looking too sore or tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see more results</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles, and have tried dozens and dozens of creams, serums, eye rollers, cucumbers, you name it...And I&#x27;ve never noticed one bit of difference.  I was searching on Amazon for something with good reviews and not terribly expensive, and found this.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Queen Bee eye cream for about two weeks.  I will update this later on if things have changed.  Every night, I put the eye cream all around my eyes (eyelid, under-eye area, and on my slight crow&#x27;s feet).  The area that bothers me the most is dark circles and puffiness.  While I didn&#x27;t wake up to the miracle that they had just disappeared, I have seen some improvement.  This is much more than I can say for other treatments I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve paid quite a bit more for some of them.&lt;br /&gt;The jar is a little smaller than I expected, but I still expect this to last me a while, and I think it is definitely worth the money if I continue to see this level of improvement, and hopefully more as time goes on.  The cream is really thick when you are getting it out with your finger.  It kind of looks like petroleum jelly but is harder.  When it goes on your skin though, it blends well into the skin.  I like that it is all natural, and am glad that I found this product.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and made my dark circles worse! I do not know how this product got 5 stars in Amazon rating system!</li>
            <li> Not overly greasy on the skin which I really appreciate. I do like the way it feels and use often</li>
            <li> I was skeptical from the moment i received my package because it came with a &amp;#34;give us a great review and we will send you a free one&amp;#34; coupon. The cream does not work at all. overpriced. i have not noticed any difference and it has been 3 weeks. do not be deceived by the 5 star ratings. customers are just trying to get a free jar sent to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had puffy eyes and dark circles all my life, and can&#x27;t seem to get rid of them no matter what I do. I decided to give this a try, but after a few weeks of use I have not seen any dramatic results. I still like it, and will continue to use it. I have noticed my skin being a little less like crepe paper thin, so perhaps it has a subtle benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product title on Amazon claims that it is &#x27;Organic&#x27; but there is no indication of this on the product itself - either in the ingredients list or otherwise. Would be nice if they clarify this - if the product is made of organic ingredients, you should specify, and if it is not, remove this from the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells really lovely! I like how the texture is really light and smooth, and how gentile it is. I also like that it is all-natural and  I feel like it is very versatile, which is also an advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like a little bit of literature on the product and the company, so I know who is providing this, and what it is, how I should use it, how it works, what it is good for, etc. When I got it, it was a simple jar with no information, I don&#x27;t want extra packaging, which could be wasteful, but an info letter would add value.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a non toxic eye cream for bags and circles for about two years. I have tried at least 8 different creams/oils. Most of them were OK, but nothing more than that. However, I LOVE Queen Bee. It really did help with the bags and circles, to the point where I don&#x27;t really consider them a problem any more. I did not like it at first though, it was too waxy to go on smoothly. I then figured out to rub it between my two fingers first and the warmth made it creamy and smooth. Now that summer is here though, it goes on like soft butter. Any product with positive rating from EWG and works like this gets an A+ from me. I don&#x27;t have tons of reviews on Amazon, but hopefully enough so people don&#x27;t think that this is a fake review. Oh, this product also seems to last forever. Amazon tells me I bought this in January. It is now July and I have at least half a jar left, that is after using it every single night.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is thick.  I have to press my fingertip to melt the cream a little so that I can use.  Very fatty hard cream.  Because of this nature, the cream is able to stick to my eyes longer and keep eye area moist longer than eye gel or regular watery eye cream.  If it is dry around your eyes and regular eye cream does not seem to help improve the wrinkles and puffiness just like me, this is a good cream to try.  It is also good to spread it thick around eyes when taking a bath and relax.  I highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li> A little background on my skin- i&#x27;m extremely pale with unfortunately genetic very dark eye circles- only made worse by lack of sleep. I&#x27;m not sure about this product yet, as i&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days- once a night before bed as instructed. It does seem to give me a more awake look, but as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s if you miss a day it&#x27;s noticable- which makes me question if it&#x27;s really doing something to improve my skin- as so far the results seem to only be temporary. Still, i like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like you need a lot of product so this jar will probably last me a while. It is a little shiny looking, but the instructions say to use it at night anyway so if you&#x27;re worried about how it would look that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem- and i think the shininess is mild enough that it&#x27;s fine to wear it during the day without worrying about how it looks. i&#x27;m going to keep using this, but so far from what i&#x27;ve seen, if you want a day to day eye cream that will help your circles each time you use it- instead of concealer, this is for you, but don&#x27;t buy it expecting long lasting results- it is something ( in my opinion of course) that should be used everyday.</li>
            <li> I have not seen an improvement in dark circles but it is good for moisture and the natural ingredients are great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream since February and I love it. I have to laugh when I read some of the other reviews- I don&#x27;t think people know what organic means? Lol...&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, I have sensitive skin, and oily skin and this works great, I do have to put it on after I cleanse my face in the morning and let it dry while I have breakfast, but it doesn&#x27;t take long..&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend it.. And a little bit of this goes a long long way..&lt;br /&gt; And I also should say, that I was just putting this on in the morning for under eye circles, but when using it at night and in the morning, I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days and I can already see and feel a difference. I have dry skin and love that this keeps my under eye area moisturized all day long. Because my skin is kept moisturized, I have noticed that my crows feet are less pronounced. I have also seen a lightening of the dark circles under my eyes. A little goes a long way with this product and because of this I do not hesitate to apply to other needy areas of my face. I put it around my mouth and in between my eyebrows. And it&#x27;s all natural to boot! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that would be natural and not full of chemicals like most under eye creams. I search through Amazon and I&#x27;ve found Queen Bee 100% All Natural, organic under eye cream with few hundred high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for almost 3 weeks and I started to noticed a change with my dark circles get alittle bit lighter. I really like the smells and I also use it for my lips because of the hydration and the natural ingredients. I applied every morning and night before i go to bed. I highly recommend it, just be a bit patient, you&#x27;ll see it works!</li>
            <li> Done nothing at all. Used 2 jars twice a day and absolutely waste of my money.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, it is very moisturizing and it makes it super easy to put concealer on afterwards. I find it definitely does help the darkness around my eyes. The only problem is getting the product out of such a small jar because I have long nails, but that&#x27;s about it. It does, however, leave the area which you apply the product shiny, but if you wear make up, this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry...This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I dried my skin around my eyes, and I looked very old</li>
            <li> I like natural, Organic products and vitamin K is good for dark circles... so I choose this product. I like this faint sweet aroma too.</li>
            <li> Way too stiff...pulls my delicate skin underneath my eyes.  Maybe would be good if it was warmed up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since a week and I can definately see improvement. My dark circles are diminshing !</li>
            <li> After reading other positive reviews I decided to give this balm a try.  I used it morning and night for 2 weeks, but like another reviewer it seemed to worryingly make my dark circles appear a lot worse, and I had to discontinue use.  I have now switched to vitamin C cream and Vitamin K cream with better results!</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t know what rosacea is, allow me to explain.  Rosacea is a chronic skin condition involving inflammation of all or parts of the skin on the face.  To put it in layman&#x27;s terms it itches like crazy and because it itches, it becomes inflames and red.  I had what looks like a young teenager&#x27;s acne infested face on my nose.  And it just kept getting worse.  It destroyed my confidence because I always thought people were staring at my big, red nose  so I became reclusive.  I rarely left the house.  My husband, god bless him never gave up telling me I was beautiful but I didn&#x27;t believe him.  He was actually the one who ordered Queen Bee for me after reading some reviews about others customers with rosacea having success with it.  At first I didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up but he was persistent.  I tried it, every day, every 4 hours like clockwork I put this stuff on my nose.  At first, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, then the itching began to become less and less noticeable.  After a week, the redness began to fade.  I was barely scratching my nose anymore so I&#x27;m sure that had something to do with it.  Now it&#x27;s been almost two months, I still take it every three hours but I enjoy it.  My nose is just a blush color now, it doesn&#x27;t itch at all and for the first time in years I truly feel confident again.   I feel like I have a new lease on life, I love being social now.  No longer am I self-conscious about my rosacea.  I can finally enjoy myself again and all thanks to my husband and this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking and using many eye creams for my dark circles problems. I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 month, and the results are so far so good. Once I get back into my sleeping schedule and routine, it will probably be better. I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. Thank you! Recommending to my friends.</li>
            <li> this is my second time using it i love it my undereyes has really change</li>
            <li> It has seemed to help with my dark circles some but not as much as I would like. It definitely has decreased my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Finally broke down, sucked up the macho pride, and bought some eye cream to try and get rid of the bags/dark circles under my eyes.  It was even harder to buy this eye cream with a name like &amp;#34;Queen Bee&amp;#34;, but since the price and reviews were good, and no one could see me buy it, I ordered myself a jar.  After the results I got within a week of use, not only would I have no issues buying this stuff again, I&#x27;ve gone around bragging how well this &amp;#34;Queen Bee&amp;#34; stuff works.  It was little weird to add this into my morning routine, but I&#x27;m glad I did as my dark circles/bags have just about disappeared.  On a side note, this stuff smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many products that claim to alleviate dark circles and none worked as well as this product has in such a short time.  I have been using this product for only 7 days and after the 3rd application I began noticing that my dark circles have definitely lightened up.  I actually can not believe it since I have tried at least 20 other products and none work to my satisfaction.  This product smells very good, much like vanilla and almond which I love.  I was turned off by the waxy look of the product, but it goes on very much like thinned out vaseline based cream and stays put on your face.  The only reason I dont give this product a 5 star is because I have very long hair and during the night my hair touches my face and I wake up with slightly greasy looking hair in the front of my face due to the somewhat greasiness of this product.  I guess I should pull my hair back at night to stop this.  I also tried to wipe off some excess at night but my hair still becomes greasy in the morning even then.  This will not stop me from buying this product as I also love to apply it in the morning under my make up to get a more supply look under my eye area and my dark circles are much less noticeable.  Love love love.</li>
            <li> If you like smearing oil under your eyes then get this product. I can&#x27;t stand the smell and used only twice til I realized this is what women used to shmear over thier faces in the 1950&#x27;s. Old fashioned, ineffective and cheaply made. I&#x27;m using it on my feet after a pedicure just to use it up.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my dark circles after weeks of use.  Joanne C</li>
            <li> Seriously have tried a lot of eye creams out there this one rocks. I&#x27;ve done khiels, Lancôme, dermologica, cerve, and many more. This is my fav.</li>
            <li> Does not work!! Might be natural but doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> 1/8/15 I have Sjogren&#x27;s so my eyes and the skin surrounding them is always irritated. I have deep dark bruises around my eyes; that&#x27;s chronic illness for you. First of all this is a salve type product, it&#x27;s not a cream. The skin around my eyes felt less irritated after one application. It also does not burn, which is a plus.  2/28/15 This product has not improved the color of my dark circles. It does however help the skin to stay hydrated. I am sure that there are other less expensive products that would also do this and I plan on finding them instead of purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
            <li> I liked it! It was a little thick and greasy. I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my in the skin area under my eyes at all after going through a complete bottle. But it did moisturize the area very well. I would have to dab at my skin with a clothe to wipe away some of it, even after rubbing it in for several minutes. I probably would not buy it again. But it was ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes since I was a small child and it is hard to find a product that will make them less visible.  The other reviews for this product made me give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It really helps and the price is much less than many other products I&#x27;ve seen for the same issue.</li>
            <li> Nice product, I would reorder this product again</li>
            <li> After using this product for 2 months, I notice the skin around my eye is smoother. The dark circle is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I first opened the jar and saw how firm it was. But I swirled my finger on top and it melted at body temperature and then the application was great. My dark circles have lessened, my makeup stays put so no mascara smudges, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes which has been a big problem with me.</li>
            <li> Overall it makes my face baby smooth after my first overnight application.  It has helped to plump up the fine lines around my eyes. At age 38 I was beginning to develop laugh lines -this is all a thing of the past for me! Over time of usage, it left my face radiantly glowing! I have no traces of fine lines anymore! This is phenomenal for me!  To this day, I receive compliments on how youthful I look and of how baby smooth my face is! And the only thing that I use on my face is this cream! What I love the best is that my success was due to natural ingredients. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing eye cream. I also use it on my dry patches on my face. It feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, I have not seen any effect so far.  Also found that if I put it on before I go to bed, it gets in my hair (I&#x27;m a flipper when I sleep) and makes my hair strands all oily.  So it&#x27;s not for me, hope others have more success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost 2 months and I haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this product was all natural, I have been using it for dark circles and under eye wrinkles and it gives a great result.  It works well with the skintone, not too greasy and it has been working for the short period of time i have used it, I am looking forward to more postive results, thank you.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I do have dark circles under my eyes, and this product sadly did not do anything for it.  The texture is very similar to Vaseline, and I put it on every night, hoping that the gross feeling was worth it since it was supposed to make the circles go away.  I don&#x27;t know if my batch just isn&#x27;t effective or what, but it did absolutely nothing for me.  Hopefully if you buy it, it will do more for you.</li>
            <li> I only started using this product about a week ago. So far, I do not see any change. The dark circles did not appear overnight, so I can&#x27;t expect them to go away in a week. There is something in the cream that my dog loves. As soon as I put the eye cream on , she tries to lick it off. I read all the wonderful reviews, so I am very hopeful and optimistic.</li>
            <li> I have seen remarkable reduction in the appearance of dark circles under my eyes in just a week.  More importantly other similar products burn my eyes if they accidentally get in my eyes.  This product does not burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Ok, the quantity is very little, it will surprise you. I think my money ($23) is well spent - My skin is so radiant, smooth and shiny! My complexion is so much better and I faired well in sunlight (my facial skin gets fried/burnt on being exposed to sunlight for &gt;1 min)!  All scars have disappeared in just about a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I use it: I gently apply African Black Soap on my face. Then leave the skin damp after gently washing the soap off, so less amount of bee-wax I apply on the face could spread throughout. I have a very dry skin, so even though my skin looks greasy after application, it feels constricted and taut. So, I apply a mixture of 2 drops of Tamanu oil mixed with nivea white and one drop of rose-hip oil on top of it, for softness. This releases some tension on the facial skin caused by bee-wax. Then I go to bed. In the morning the results are astounding- grease is gone, skin is just so beautiful and blemish free. I look very young and the skin is indeed blemish and bump-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the immediate effects of Queen Bee, I have been using it since the past week only. Now I wanna test, if it helps with dark circles removal. Will update the review after I use up the entire jar.Will update the review after I use up the entire jar.</li>
            <li> I already see big improvement under my eyes. bag, winkles, dark area under eyes started diminished. Great product, start working right away for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. I will buy QB again, and again.</li>
            <li> i have not seen any improvement</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Queen Bee eye cream.  It smooths out wrinkles and feels great on my skin.  My friends and family have also commented that they like the look after my using Queen Bee eye cream.  I purchased some for my mother as well and se also loves it.  It is everything I expected and more.  I&#x27;ve used Royal Jelly before and this feels even better.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find an eye cream that focuses on under eye circles and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing changes. Been using it for 2 weeks. It&#x27;s great because I use the computer for work, and I was going downhill. But now my face is getting better even with this job.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft and fine easily absorbed cream.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and feels natural.  Very effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the fine lines under my eyes or the slight pigmentation (very minor &amp;#34;dark circles&amp;#34;). In fact, sometimes it appears that my circles have gotten a bit worse. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s just the lighting, or if it&#x27;s actually the case though. The cream is a nice moisturizer though. You can use it pretty much anywhere on your body. It just doesn&#x27;t do much for me in the eye department.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! Really did wonders for me!</li>
            <li> wasnt a fan. Too heavy for my skin</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a single thing for many, many months..... Have used religiously following the manufacturers details and have seen ZERO improvements..... Would NOT recommend a POOR product...... Waste of your hard earned dollars..... Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see any difference. Smells good. Will keep using and hope to see improvement..</li>
            <li> but did not really work for me.  I have tried many things and most do not work so I think it really depends what is causing the dark circles.  I do not want to discredit the product because it has worked for people, but if not much has worked for you then this probably won&#x27;t either.  I am always game to try something new.</li>
            <li> My hereditary dark circles diminished overnight. I had read a review from someone who had a similar experience. This user thought perhaps it was his/her imagination. Nope, same here. I was delighted.</li>
            <li> First of all, what happened to the high ratings posted here? They&#x27;re all gone.  That&#x27;s how I based my decision to buy this product in the first place.  Anyway, this is not a cream but a petroleum based product just like Vaseline.  It is greasy upon application and cannot be worn under make up. After almost 2 weeks of using this product, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on the skin around my eyes.  No changes in the dark circles.  Instead, I noticed that the few fine lines I have seem to double in number.  Normally, I don&#x27;t have eye bags but after using this product, I developed eye bags.  My eyes looks puffy and tired. Everybody at home noticed the big difference.  I don&#x27;t know if the item works for  other people coz it didn&#x27;t for me.  I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.  It&#x27;s just a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This has way more beeswax content than it should have for an eye cream...it has more like a really hard lip balm consistency.  While the product is all natural and feels OK and smells nice, the formulation is not good for its intended use.  I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews... it just seems average to me, and any home soapmaker and lip balm maker can easily make this product on their own and probably better too!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this consistently every night for a month now. My eyes have started to look brighter, however I don&#x27;t see any changes in the fine lines around my eyes. It has definitely helped reduce the puffiness. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see if I see any changes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a little over one month and I can say that I have seen results. Per reading other reviews I used it on my whole face not just my eyes. I also coupled it with  {Copy and paste this link-------&amp;#62;(Best-Selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin-- 100% Pure-Highest Quality, Anti-Aging Serum-- Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free-Best Hyaluronic Acid for Your Face (Pro Formula)&amp;#60;------These two products together allowed for my face to remain hydrated, even-toned and brightened. I never thought I would look so youthful at 31. I have been asked if I was 24. I can never get mad at that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to balance your skin and not add so many products that we cannot name use Queen Bee. I believe that natural is always best and Queen Bee will be an active part in my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are you waiting for? Order your jar and withing three days of use you will see and feel a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Buying!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this for about a week or two and didn&#x27;t notice any chance.  Being a bit discouraged, I discontinued use of the product.  I am planning to start again soon and will be sure to apply it daily for about a month and see what happens then.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a magic cream to work in a short amount of time, this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> So far works well. It will be great for my winter dry skin. I give it 4 stars because it does granulate but it melts when it is on your warm skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Natural,  healthy and efficient!&lt;br /&gt;Can get a bit oily if not used in tiny small quantities. I use it morning and night and my eyes look more refreshing, less puffiness, younger!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all!</li>
            <li> Pleasant but I feel very shiny after using the cream. I use it under the eyes but also on my lips and sometimes on the entire face.</li>
            <li> No good. Did not like. Too oily</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very rigid and difficult to use .I threw it away .just waste money.</li>
            <li> Using it for past few month. Very little change in dark circle or lines but definitely smooth out the skin.</li>
            <li> I only put this on at night (and generously)!!! the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is more greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin, so at night is perfect! Even moving around and sleeping on my sides I feel it still on my skin! And will work at night when your most relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put this on every night for not even a week and my wrinkles under my eyes and dark circles have already gotten better! I had 3 not major but annoying wrinkles, now I have maybe 1 wrinkle sticking out and my dark circles have lightened up, there is so much product in the jar I will have it for a long time and keep re ordering! This stuff really truly works, can&#x27;t believe it. I don&#x27;t write bs reviews!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for quite awhile for my  under eye lines and haven&#x27;t seen any difference</li>
            <li> Product is too greasy - don&#x27;t like it at all. A small amount was applied, but never seemed to be absorbed by the skin - face looked greasy, fell greasy, rubbed off on pillow.  ill never use nor order again.  I will continue to use a much less expensive product purchased from a local store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it for about 4 months around eyes and noise as well.&lt;br /&gt;It feels soft and moist. Be sure that this is for your night time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been satisfied with it except the one that there are tiny balls you can feel when you apply to your skin, which bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is totally good.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the scent should be improved.</li>
            <li> This really works. It works slowly but it does work. It&#x27;s waxy material. I thought it would feel sticky but once you put it on it feels like regular cream.</li>
            <li> Seems to have definitely improved my slight darkness, good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This is an average product, and I question the reviews on Amazon.  I know a lot about skin care and all this product has is natural ingredients and vitamin k, not exactly amazing.  I combine it with other essential oils/antioxidants etc and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE improvement, but if I subtracted this product, I wouldn&#x27;t miss a beat.  There is one highly annoying aspect of it, the hards round chunks get in my eyes and don&#x27;t do anything for the product or the skin.  I just wipe them off on a towel, but they are everywhere, so it&#x27;s easy to still have a few end up on my skin/hair/eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this product, as I bought it for puffiness and small lines.  Unlike other under eye cream this stuff keeps you hydrated and yes, I have been noticing the lines going away it has been one week of continual daily or twice a day use.&lt;br /&gt;Also I use this on dry patches of skin too.  Good for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have family in the Poconos so I may go check out this company this summer.  Let me know your location.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend</li>
            <li> This is the biggest scam ever. Don&#x27;t fall for it. This product is basic petroleum jelly in a glass jar. I walked around two weeks with chicken grease skin for no reason at all. As for the second jar, went straight to the garbage. Never again will i fall for 400+ reviews again.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural products for the dark circles under my eyes. While searching online I came across your product. I read a lot great reviews so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark circles under my eyes which seems not to go away, I will admit that I barely get any sleep since I usually have to be up for work at 5:00 am. Which leaves me with about 6 hours of sleep during the week. My twins daughters who are 15 years have also slight dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters and I started using the product as soon as we received it. It&#x27;s been close to a month and I notice mines are lighter than it was, and my daughter&#x27;s are basically nonexistence. The product does work wonders!! I use it religiously. Of course, my lack of not getting enough sleep are not allowing me to see a drastic result as seen on my daughter&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with dark circle under their eyes.</li>
            <li> Yes it does! I love the all natural products that its made with. Very inexpensive, and the jar can last a while. Definitely a great investment for facial product. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in my dark eye shadows honestly.&lt;br /&gt;It seems rich enough to keep my under eye moisturised but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after applying it on different parts of my face for 2 days, I broke out :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural ingredients as stated on the label which I appreciate but I will probably go back to using my previous eye cream&lt;br /&gt;which gave better results.</li>
            <li> I am not happy about this transaction. I bought the Queen bee because I saw so many 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Well the seller ask you to give you a good review within a week of purchse and it says that they will send you a second Queen bee as appreciation (I thought heck FREE YAY!) Well dont fall for that...  thats a lie, never got one on the mail and honestly I am not impressed with the product at all. After a couple of months the texture changed to very hard, not smooth and feels as if there are beads on it because is so hard, not a nice feeling to apply an eye cream and feeling like you are scrubbing it because the texture is so bad.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly dont waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after the first week ... this product smells and feels great, and really works. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product just for a week but I definitely see decrease in my eye bags and wrinkles. I use it all over my face, not just my eyes. I thought it was expensive when I ordered it but you need so little everyday that this bottle should last for a while. I use it only at nights as it is very greasy and can not be used under make up. Will definitely recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> If you are planning to buy this product, do not do it.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it didnt work&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad expierence with it</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this eye cream, especially after reading all the positive reviews.? It did nothing for my eyes! I have dark circles and fines lines and saw no difference whatsoever. I also felt like it just sat on my face it didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin under my eyes. It&#x27;s not a cream, it&#x27;s a solid and I thought it was greasy. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged guy and I don&#x27;t always get the sleep I need. So over the years I&#x27;ve noticed dark circles forming under my eyes. It became noticeable enough that I needed to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used cosmetics, creams or anything like this before, but the reviews were encouraging so I decided to give Queen Bee All-Natural Under Eye Cream a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The circles under my eyes are less noticeable and folks tell me I look better rested now that I have in years.&lt;br /&gt;I apply every evening before bed and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It also feels great on my skin, and smells nice. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got it two days ago. It was came within a paper envelope instead of regular box. But the item was intact so no complaint at all. When I opened it and felt its special smell immediately. It might looks a little bit hard , but give it some stirs using your figure and it&#x27;ll melt very quickly. Used one time last night and it&#x27;s feel good. Don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s goes, we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 3 weeks now.  I like the fact it has only natural ingredients, without alcohol which so many skin products seem to contain.  I like the soothing feeling I get around my eyes after I put it on.  The smell is appealing as well.  My eyes look considerably better.  This product combined with drinking lots of water daily has made the blackness under my eyes appear much lighter. I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a very hydrating eye moisturizer and I like that it&#x27;s made of identifiable ingredients. I only use it at night because it&#x27;s just too heavy for makeup. But in the morning, the skin around my eyes is soft, well hydrated, and not puffy. I have not seen any great reduction in dark circles, but to be honest, that&#x27;s a tall order for any product to fill and I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to make a huge difference. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after searching for face lotion with vitamin k because it&#x27;s been shown to reduce the appearance of broken blood vessels. This product was perfect because of the natural ingredients. I recommend applying it at night and I use it all over my face and chest. Great product!</li>
            <li> Pros:I use it for my face as moisturizer. It helps with my fine wrinkles and my skin feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;It has good smell and it seems very natural which I love it. It gave my skin natural glow and it helps with dark skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It takes time that my skin absorb it, because it needs to be melted on my skin, also it has a little bit hard texture which make it uneasy to apply.</li>
            <li> It really works. I am pleased with this product.I noticed changes in a week, give a try !!!</li>
            <li> I think this product works really well. I am close to finishing my first jar. I got it two years ago and after using it intermittently it didn&#x27;t work very well which makes sense. I ended up giving up on it and just accepting the dark circles under my eyes. I then got another question of &amp;#34;do I have a black eye?&amp;#34; two months ago. I decided to go back to the jar and try it again, persistently this time though. After two months of probably 5 nights a week usage I have noticed improvements in coloring. My friends have actually told me that I look healthier and smarter for some reason. Just ordered two more since the price is so cheap. I got my first jar for the $50 price tag. I&#x27;m a 28 year old male by the way to. Had no idea you get a free jar for a positive review until ordering and afterward reading some other reviews. Hopefully this is positive enough to get a free one to.</li>
            <li> It was very waxy and I did not think it worked very well. Very hard to spread.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where all the wonderful reviews came from. I was so excited thinking I would get rid of the dark circles under my eyes, but that was not the case. Queen Bee was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now but no results in reducing my dark circle. It is a waste of time and money. Not even a 1% reduction of dark circle.</li>
            <li> Third purchases and I&#x27;m still greatly satisfied.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Love the smell, love how it&#x27;s a good size so I can take it when I&#x27;m traveling. Love it!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for dark circle ,, the results after 3 month is 5% reduces the dark circles</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this. Not worth getting another one for free as was promised by the company if you write a good review.  They can keep the free one because I don&#x27;t even bother using this.  May as well use petroleum on my face... Yuck.</li>
            <li> Went through TWO jars.  ZERO results.  I used if for under the eyes.  Maybe it works better for other things.  I should have gotten a refund before it was too late.</li>
            <li> Nice natural ingredients however, I found it did nothing for my dark circles and was a bit greasy for me....</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I try to research any natural products that are good to apply under eyes. I read shea butter, coconut oil and vit. K helps to restore the problem of skin under eyes. I found queen bee eye cream has those kinds of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using about 2 weeks. I apply it, not only around my eyes, but also all around face. I try to massage a little bit. I use it twice a day. Since last week, I notice I almost can&#x27;t see my lines on my forehead and I can see my dark circles getting better. Thank you for this natural products, I love it. I will continue using this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this all summer at night on my whole face and I&#x27;ve seen noticeable differences in the texture of my skin, it is a lot smoother and it has also evened out my skin, I think this will be my one and only skin regiment. I have dark circles and I feel they have lightened a shade or two.</li>
            <li> The reason this has so many good reviews? They tempt you with another jar for free if you write one. I wish that I had known the reason for such reviews. The overwhelming positive response to this product made me feel safe in purchasing it in the first place. Wasted money. This stuff is nearly worthless. It&#x27;s greasy and gross. Just sits on top of your skin. You can make this at home, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Due to my work situation, I have to deal with some pretty serious sleep deprivation sometimes, and the dark circles under my eyes shout it to the world. I would run into friends and they would always comment something like, \\&quot;You look tired. You need to get some sleep!\\&quot;. I do what I can, but the dark circles under my eyes continued to be a real challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking for some eye cream products, and initially started using a Neutrogena product that helped - I saw about a 50% improvement in the &#x27;sagging&#x27; bags under my eyes, but it had no impact on the dark circles (that reddish, purplish &#x27;swoosh&#x27; under the eye). After reading some of the reviews, I decided to try the Queen Bee balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t so sure after I first put it on. Like others have said, it is pretty greasy/waxy, so it is definitely a night-time product for me (I can&#x27;t imagine putting this on in the morning to go out of the house!). When I get up in the morning, it is no longer greasy, but soft and smooth. And yes, it does leave some oily residue on my pillow case in the morning, but I found that it washes out easily - with no pre-treating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is that it really HAS diminished the circles. No, they are not gone, but they are definitely shades and shades lighter, and the skin under my eyes looks and feels so healthy. My schedule has not changed, I still struggle with not getting enough sleep, but no one is commenting that I look tired anymore. People think that my work schedule has improved (it hasn&#x27;t!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when you are using a product that gives gradual results, you don&#x27;t really appreciate how much it is working until you stop. I started using it 4 months ago, and in the beginning I was very faithful to put it on EVERY night. Then as my eyes began to improve, I got a little slack about it, and after about a day or so, I could begin to tell the difference. Now that I have been using it faithfully again for a longer period, I can tell even more so if I skip a night. I love the way it makes my eyes look and feel in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting ready to order my second jar now (used faithfully, one jar will last me about 3 months). I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, so there are only a very few personal beauty care items that I consider &#x27;critical-can&#x27;t-live-without&#x27;. This has become one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and just a note to those who try to discredit the high ratings, suggesting they are a result of the &#x27;free jar&#x27; offer ... I didn&#x27;t want to put in a rating until I had time to use the product and see if it would work. Time got away from me and before I realized it the opportunity has passed for me, so no, I did not get a free jar for my 5-star review. (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t turn it down at this point!) But it looks like I will have to purchase my next jar. Besides, WHY would I want an extra jar of something that does not work, even if it is free, that will only add to the clutter on my bathroom shelf??????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0047PPCAW Queen Bee 100% All-Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream - Removes Dark Circles, Facial Lines and Wrinkles Naturally - 1oz (30ml)]]</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but it smells so good and feels so good that I am using it in way more places than planned. I thought I&#x27;d just use it under my eyes - but because it feels and smells so good (very subtle fragrance, but nice) I am using it on several scars on my face (from skin cancer surgeries), around my lips, and on the frown lines on my forehead. For me, really liking something makes all the difference in the world.  If I don&#x27;t like it, I won&#x27;t use it - and no matter how effective something is, it doesn&#x27;t work unless you use it!  So the fact that I like it and want to use it in more places on my face makes it very likely that I&#x27;ll get the full benefits from the product.  I will reorder this one and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Although I was very skeptical whether this product would in fact do anything, it does do a decent job of moisturizing the under eye eyes and reducing dark circles. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to say whether it will reduce fine lines, so the jury is still out for now. I&#x27;m also very sensitive when it comes to products used near my eyes and simply can&#x27;t use most of the ones sold brick and-mortar stores. Too many chemicals I guess. Queen Bee doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I should note is that this is not a cream in the traditional sense since it&#x27;s made out of beeswax. When you open the jar, the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is actually solid, which is a little disconcerting at first. Also, it&#x27;s better if you don&#x27;t dab it under your eyes like typical eye creams. Instead, gently smooth it with your finger. It might seem a little oily at first, but it will absorb into your skin (just keep your hair away from it for a little while!). I was initially concerned it might cause acne breakouts, but it hasn&#x27;t so far.</li>
            <li> I been using it on and off but I can say this product really works. I will highly recommends this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days I apply it on every night and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m starting to see some changes I had dark circles all my life and I&#x27;ve never understood why but thank god for this product that helps get rid of the dark circles at first when I got this product I was a little disappointed because of the size like man ! I I wish it was bigger these dark circles are no joke it could really take away from your natural beauty but with this product I see a difference now I don&#x27;t have to wear 10 pounds of make up to cover my eyes I can just be a diva !</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over about month now. I have not yet noticed a significant change. The product did however come on time and I am still applying daily</li>
            <li> I need to exclaim how incredibly much Queen Bee Organic Under Eye Cream has done for my face (and my life) in the time I have been utilizing this magical product! I have had dark circles under my eyes for the past 8 months and severe blemishes. After finding this product online, I wanted to give it a try, and already now, in less than 3 months I am witnessing tremendous changes to the contrast under my eyes and skin overall. The dark circles are gradually, but noticeably receding, and my blemishes are fading! I love to use the cream to top off my full vitamin skin treatment: vitamin a and d oil as a base, sheabutter for vitamin e and the awesome Queen Bee Organic Cream for its extremely potent vitamin K. My skin is returning to its glory, and the luxurious richness of the touch is beyond awesomeness! I will continue to invest into this product, even after the dark circles are all the way gone. Finally, a product that is kind to sensitive skin and actually works effortlessly! I LOVE QUEEN BEE 100% ALL NATURAL, ORGANIC UNDER EYE CREAM!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really want to thank the creators, because this product has helped me to decrease the dark circles around my eyes. The natural formula helps because I have very sensitive skin and with many chemicals I get skin rashes, especially on the delicate skin under my eyes. I hope that more people will see this 100% chemical free cream to help with their eyes imperfection. I really wan to thank the creators of this wonderful product. Before this i had tried other products but they did not work it all all they did was hurt my skin or make me spend money. Buying other worthless products its like throwing your money to the trash, but with Queen Bee cream, its like your paying for the $400 cream. It totally helpful and it works. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing most all were excellent regarding this product.  I have very dry skin.  I did not have the dark circles but fine lines looking to help.  This product has been wonderful all my fine lines are nearly invisable and my skin is soft and very healthy.  You do not need to use alot or your face would be too greasy.  I use morning and night and highly recomend this product!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles from years of schooling and work.  This is the only eye cream product that works for me although I&#x27;ve tried out higher end products (i.e. Lancôme, etc).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and it&#x27;s all natural, too!  I use this before I go to bed every night and every morning before I go to work.  Love it! :)</li>
            <li> This product really is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;. All of the 5 or 6 ingredients in there I can actually pronounce !!  The cream is wonderful. It is not sticky, nor greasy and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth and silky. I know it says eye cream but i actually use it on my face. (.  A little goes a long way). Although I&#x27;ve only been using ita few days so far, a friend of my already commented on how much better the darker circles under my eyes look.  So far I am terrifically happy with this product. And especially love the fact that when it says &amp;#34; all natural&amp;#34; - it really is</li>
            <li> Really like the consistency and the texture of this eye cream . I&#x27;m currently 27 moderately clear skin but have suffered from dark circles ever since I can remember. I&#x27;ve seen a big difference now alongside my increased intake of water. Overall great product , a tad oily but you can put it on your whole face and it feels soft. Thanks queen bee!</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS BULLSHIT CREAM IT DIDNT WORK WHATSOEVER COMPLETE CRAP</li>
            <li> Love this put it on overnight and 30 min before applying makeup and it will reduce puffy dark circles.  This does not have long term changes for me. But has become a part of my routine now.</li>
            <li> The cream had lots of tiny hard balls in it and these balls didn&#x27;t melt easily when put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Even water didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;m surprised nobody complained about this in the reviews. Did I get a bad batch?</li>
            <li> This eye cream is assisting w/keeping my under eye area moist.  I apply over another cream at night &amp; under eyes during the day-keeps my eyes moist &amp; concealer looks so much better!</li>
            <li> This product works instantly for me just a week. It feels smooth and not oily on face. I put it all over my face with lotion and it doesn&#x27;t shine at all.</li>
            <li> Good for lines, does nothing for black circles.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I am post menopause and my skin is very dry.  I also have dark cirlces.  This product helped aleviate it all!  It even works really well as a lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you worried about scent or sensitivity - I have multiple chemical sensitivity so I am VERY senstitive to fragrances. . .I get headaches etc.  NOT the case with this product.  No adverse reaction at all.  Not to the smell or to my sensitive skin.  Purchase this product.  It is worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I have been in search of an eye cream that removes puffiness and this stuff works great.  It is a balmy texture, which I think is good for using before bed during the winter.  I use a different eye gel for the day time so that it doesn&#x27;t smear with my makeup.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Only had this a couple weeks, but not worth the money. Doesn&#x27;t do anything. What a waste of money. If anything my circles got darker</li>
            <li> This product feels nice on the skin and absorbs well. I was not aware that it has a strong VANILLA scent which is distracting and annoying. I would not buy it again because of the scent.</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;ve used for over 2 weeks and I could see the difference.  I love this product and I&#x27;ll be happy to recommend this product to my friends...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrill that others have had such success with Queen Bee, but for me it&#x27;s not the case. Its very hard and greasy, I just dab it under my eyes at night and morning but starting noticing my eyes were stinging and red, I made sure not to it get into my eyes. I thought this was suppose to be all natural. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but for me this product is not up to par. I have seen no improvement in my dark circles, what so ever. It&#x27;s more like a Vaseline based product. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product after reading all the raving reviews. I also got a insert with my Order telling me if I contacted the seller of this product, I would another free of charge, I thought. Why not? I never heard anything back from the seller, but that&#x27;s not an issue. Way to pricey for such lack of results, so going back to what Used before. It smelled old like it might be out of date. Some users stated it smelled like vanilla, mine don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know first time user, so can&#x27;t say about that for sure. I wish I could gave it more than two stars. The seller did ship on time that where the two stars came in.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. The only problem that my wife had was that it arrived a couple of days late.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 yr. old woman whom has struggles with dark circles for years. To my knowledge my dark circles are attributed to heredity and anemia. This product was my last ditch effort before I looked into surgical options. (Seriously, it is that bad) Within 48 hours, I noticed a reduction by 20%. It has been just shy of two week, and my dark circles have been reduced by 70-80%. The only negative to this product, is the oily residue that remains after applying the product. Because of this, I normally use the product before bed.</li>
            <li> not sure have not used it long enough. Just started about a month maybe I can review it again in about a month or 2</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this cream works! I used it in conjunction with AcneFree face wash, Olay Regenerist serum, CeraVe face wash and CeraVe PM facial cream and my skin has never looked better. I had dark eye circles and after using the cream for a week, I noticed a big difference; My eyes definitely look brighter and the dark circles under my eyes are less prominent.&lt;br /&gt;I actually ended up using this all over my face. The product feels like a hard wax so I just rub it with my fingers and put it on my face. Since it&#x27;s a hard wax, I expect the cream to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still thinking about the product, I suggest buying it and trying it out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is a very good product and reminded me of our old heritage of using bee wax during winters in Northern India. It goes in skin smoothly, does not leave sticky feeling and rejuvenate the skin layer. I noticed that this works best if applied right after the bath and before sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that i noticed is that it DOES NOT sting the way other similar products sting once they land up in the eye. It is quite possible that some of the amount that is rubbed underneath the eye will travel to inside eye and that&#x27;s when the problem starts. It will make the eyes red and itchy and they look swollen. Nothing sort with this creme. My wife liked the Aveeno Shitake complex but lately they changed the formula and that STINGS like hell in the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does gives a little shine underneath the eyes that goes away after few minutes, also, it does not crape the under eye layer as is common with many good eye cremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to male and female species alike :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will surely look forward to buy another one.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an eye cream that could reduce my black circles for years. I was discouraged! all the eye creams I&#x27;ve used did not do much for my problem. Since I was little I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about my huge dark circles. One day I was looking on amazon for a good eye cream when I ran into this product. After reading so many good reviews about it, I decided to give it a try!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks now and I am loving it. My dark circles are fading away and my wrinkles are less notable. I will definitely keep using this amazing product... I gave it 4 starts just because it took a while for me to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I Recommend this Queen Bee eye cream!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit iffy at first buying this under eye cream since most eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the past never seemed to work.  After a few weeks of using queen bee, I can honestly say that I can see and feel the difference.  My eyes feel less puffy and some of the dark circles have started to disappear.  The cream smells amazing too.  A must buy for those who have wrinkles and dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a typical cream - it&#x27;s solidified oils blended together and feels sort of like lip balm. It smells nice but I haven&#x27;t noticed it reducing dark circles - perhaps only sleep can do that! However, I do have to give it props for being all natural and organic - it is very light on the skin, pleasant to use and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now, and I have definitely seen an improvement in the dark circles and fine lines under my eyes, so much so that I&#x27;m OK with leaving the house now on a lazy Sunday when I don&#x27;t feel like putting makeup on. It hasn&#x27;t removed the darkness completely, but I don&#x27;t think anything really could considering my Sicilian heritage.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this cream for very long but already I notice a difference in the dark circles under my eyes, they appear lighter and after only a few day &amp; evening applications.  The price is right, the cream is thick but lasts a long time on, wear it under your daily make-up and apply twice daily for the ultimate effect.  I like the smell as well, refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to suggest everyone try this product, good for wrinkles as well and the best part is it is all natural, no chemicals.</li>
            <li> it is a great product love it, smells nice &amp; gets rid of the dark under eye that haunts us when we look into the mirror in the morning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, my skin looks better and more in tone and firmness. Also is good for acne scars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and I have to say this product is working very well. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products in the past and this one seems to work the best. I was skeptical about this product at first but I gave it a try and it works extremely well. I recommend to anyone that&#x27;s thinking about trying this product out to give it a chance. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a month now right before bed and it seems to be doing the trick. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for. All natural ingredients that are great for my skin. Its creamy, moisturizing, a little bit goes a loong way. I use it on my face and under my eyes, it does wonders for both. It smells good but I would love to see them come out with some flavors a little more intriguing than vanilla.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements and I&#x27;ve been using for three weeks use it at night and in the morning</li>
            <li> So far i have used it about three days now and from the moment i first put it on hours later i could see a difference in my under eye circles. Now its day three and there actually almost faded away completely. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and will be ordering it in the future, and telling my friends about it as well.</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical if it would be of any help but decided to try it. My dark circles reduced considerably in 2 weeks. It actually works.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product. It&#x27;s a combination of oils, shea butter, wax, and vanilla. There is absolutely nothing in it other than these natural ingredients. As such it smells wonderful. It does sort of feel like having a very light petroleum jelly on the face and it takes a while to absorb; however, it has not caused any breakouts at all. I have not used it long enough to know what the long term results will be, but it is already making my face look smoother and nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li> I know this says eye cream. But I also use it for my chronic dry lips and it has worked better then anything else I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I like how natural it is. It is simple ingrediants and smell like vanilla. Unless what is in the jar was a mistake, it does not seem like eye cream. It sits on top of the skin and does not absorb well. I have not tried but I do not think this would work well under makeup. More for an overnight cream. I have been using it for a few weeks and have noticed no real difference with my under eye dark circles, puffiness or fine lines. I give it 4 stars for it working so well for my lips, for having such simple natural ingrediants and keeping moisture in your skin. perhaps it takes longer then a few weeks to see results under the eyes so I will continue using and will update if it does work for the eyes.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and glides on facial skin with no problem. I&#x27;ve used it three times and can see a difference in my under eyes. Extremely happy I bought this product and I am also very pleased with the customer service I received. The postal carrier lost my package and they were sure to get me my item as fast as possible after knowing about the issue. I will purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews i read on Amazon. I have noticed significant improvement in my dark circles. The color of the under eye area is much lighter compared to what i had previously. Will continue to use this as it works. I have also used it to lighten a scar on my body and have noticed skin tone improvement as well. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> So I received it and nothing it doesn&#x27;t work at all other than greasing up my face. So I came on here to review the one star comment and seen that a person received a free jar if they wrote a positive review....this is crazy!!! I want my money back I WILL CONTIUNE TO WRITE BAD REVIEWS!!!!</li>
            <li> Other eye creams left me with a burning sensation but Queen Bee is natural and gentle on the skin and has helped reduce redness.</li>
            <li> I have bad under eye circles from not sleeping enough during the week. Its hard to juggle work school and a social life so my looks have been suffering as a result. Tried a few other creams and they were successful in irritating my skin and making me breakout. Which is what made me try something a little more natural this time around. The formula is a little thick but it goes on smooth and makes my skin feel soft. You dont need to use a whole lot and after two months of using it everyday my jar is still over half full. I saw improvements in my circles after a few weeks and they&#x27;ve been getting progressively better. I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone. I love that it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didnt care for this at all. Was looking for something natural to use on my sensitive face. This product was very hard and wouldnt smooth onto my face. It felt somewhat waxy. Disappointed with the money I spent.</li>
            <li> used it for a couple weeks, didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I really did not see any improvement as far as dark circles were concerned, but the cream did feel nice on my eyes</li>
            <li> I dont know why this has so many good reviews?! It has a greasy texture and actually seemed to make my dark circles a little more noticable the day after I used it but then that went away and my dark circles went back to normal. Crows feet still very noticable.</li>
            <li> Its been about 2 weeks the process is very slow ,</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! I had little wrinkles, they went away pretty fast, my skin is so moisturized. It is not good for under make up because it is so oily, but like a night option it is absolutely wonderful! Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Starting to see some results after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was using this once a day before bed and I read that you can use it 2 times per day for faster results, but I saw fast enough results with just using it one time a day. I had dark circles although not terrible they still made me feel old. This cream was able to help me get rid of them within a month of using. Great product.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment before the estimated delivery date. I thought this product will be greasy and sticky, no it gives me the perfect moisture for my eyes. my eyes are well moistured, and it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Not noticing much difference under my eyes</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year with excellent results. I like the silky texture of the cream, very easy and smooth to apply, leaving my skin looking dewy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months I did notice some small &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; of what I think were coconut oil appear. This is to be expected with natural products that don&#x27;t have tons of fillers and chemicals to maintain texture. It was easily resolved by microwaving for just 15 seconds to melt the oils and stirring. I let it cool on its own in my cabinet and good as new, smooth as on the first day.</li>
            <li> I hoped for the best, but I guess I am super allergic to something in this, I am guessing it is the FRAGRANCE they put in! I am not sure why they put fragrance in a under eye cream, and yes it is just essential oil, but it still was enough to make my eyes swell shut every time I used this. I thought it was fluke the first time and then I tried again, nope... it was the cream.</li>
            <li> Used it for a couple of months for dark undereye circles. Didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> It does work! I placed the creme under my eyes every night before bed and the dark circles are definitely fading and my skin feels softer abd smoother. Excellent...I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but you have to use it every night. You can see difference later on, maybe like a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m one of the unlucky ones but it doesn&#x27;t work and in fact made my dark circles worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am using it now just for rashes and it seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better off with Pure Vitamin K cream which repaired the &amp;#34;damage&amp;#34; done by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel like a Joker instead of a Monarch... Maybe it&#x27;ll work for you? Who knows.</li>
            <li> At 48, I wanted some type of emollient that would diminish the dark areas underneath my eyes. Ethnically I have skin that is medium dark (hispanic and African origins) with a red hue...but years of rubbing from allergies have created the \\&quot;racoon eyes\\&quot;....I sort of can&#x27;t believe how well this little jar of balm has worked under my eyes. Goodness. The little jar will last a long, long time but I definitely will continue using this. Give it a try ladies and gentlemen...definitely a wonder for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. This under eye cream has been extremely helpful in decreasing the dark circles underneath my eyes. The product is more of a beeswax than a cream, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this cream. I just received recently so don&#x27;t have long term results to report yet. It&#x27;s got all of the healthy oils and Vitamin K and feels great on my skin. It&#x27;s already reduced the puffiness under my eyes. I am using every night and am hoping with longer term use it will help reduce the dark circles I have too. Will post an update after more time.</li>
            <li> I received my jar of under eye cream a couple weeks ago and have been using it every night.  I find it too greasy feeling to use during the day under makeup, but I&#x27;m loving it as a night cream.  It also does wonders in removing eye makeup that doesn&#x27;t fully come off when I wash my face! I have noticed a couple little bumps that have showed up under my eye area and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from the eye cream or not. Luckily they haven&#x27;t lasted long and disappeared after a couple of days.  I would like to try using this on my forehead above my eyebrow area to see if it helps with the fine lines that are starting to form up there, but I&#x27;m a little nervous that it might break my skin out since I&#x27;m so sensitive to most products.  I do feel as though the skin under my eyes looks a little more refreshed in the mornings after I&#x27;ve washed my face and my dark circles seem a little less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for creating a product that I feel safe using since I know it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend this product.  I have used it several times, and already see a difference.  My dark circles under my eyes are less noticeable, and the skin around my eyes appear firmer.  I have tried many types of creams and make up, and nothing has worked as well as this product for dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the dark circles. I think it must be working somewhat as I have actually stopped wearing coverup lightener, which I have used all my life. I have used this product for a couple months now. But I really want to recommend it as an overnight moisturizer. It is outstanding on this 60 year old skin! I really love the fragrance, also. I would definitely buy this again, if only for the moisturizer feature. The fact that it works on the dark circles too is a plus, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients. Its a great moisturizer, and works well for bags under my eyes. It&#x27;s very greasy, and it makes my face look wet for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> THEY GET ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS BY OFFERING YOU A FREE BOTTLE IF YOU WRITE A GOOD REVIEW.  THIS STUFF IS CRAP IT IS SIMPLE PRODUCTS YOU CAN PURCHASE OVER THE COUNTER AND MIX UP YOURSELF.  THIS CREAM DID NOTHING FOR MY DARK CIRCLES.  I ENDED UP USING IT ON MY FEET; AFTER MY PEDICURES.  IT DID NOTHING SPECIAL AFTER MY PEDICURES; BUT I DID NOT WANT TO WASTE MONEY.</li>
            <li> I waited a few months to write my review because I wanted to see the full results. Its been 6 months and I love love love this product!! I bought it for dark circles and it has definitely helped. It is even better for fine lines and wrinkles. It&#x27;s is the only eye cream I will buy going forward. It is so inexpensive and it last forever. You have to understand it&#x27;s more of a wax feel instead of cream. That was a little to get use to but that is the only downside to this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I use it all over my face, not just as an eye cream. I do only use it at night as it doesn&#x27;t all sink in to your skin immediately. The parts of my face that do not lay on my pillow at night are still moist in the morning. The moisture that this cream provides is amazing! I am young and do not currently use this cream for wrinkles or dark circles, but I love it as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I love about it is that it is natural and organic. I know that the ingredients are good for me and I feel good about using it. Also, it&#x27;s made in the Poconos and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Well, I was really perplexed while reading through the reviews. As a person who had never had any allergy to the skin care products I previously used, I had not expected this 100% all natural Queen Bee cream would even bring the smallest redness on my face. I was so wrong this time. After reading the label, I did also apply some cream onto my face, not just eye area. However, the next morning (day 1), my eyes puffed, and it kept getting worse throughout the day, but still seemed to be &amp;#34;minor&amp;#34;. Although I immediately stopped using this cream, allergic reactions just evolved like chains. On day 2, I had to go to see a family doctor, and was told to take the max dosage of Benadryl, which I did. But, it did not help at all. On day 3, my whole face was swollen like &amp;#34;there is one lb of water being injected under your face skin&amp;#34; (my husband commented), with rashes all over. My eyes could not open. Thus, my husband took me to the ER, where I got prednisone 50 mg. The ER doctors tried to figure our what exactly caused such bad allergy, but the ingredients listed on the label are obviously incomplete. Well, need to go now, but I hope people are aware of the fact the someone suffered a great deal of allergy from using this product.</li>
            <li> This really is an awsome product!  I was surprised but it is making my fine lines and dark circles disappear but it has taken a few months of use.  I will be buying this again!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this back in February and have been applying this for months - &amp;#34;every night.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read up about all of the great reviews........(i worked two jobs years before).....and i have to say, nothing has been improved regarding my dark circles.  I would say.....it might have gotten worse? (And i have been only working one job since i received this product).  Says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; but the ingredients doesn&#x27;t list anything organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i could give a 5 star review but it really didn&#x27;t help me.......and i can&#x27;t give this item zero stars so i&#x27;ll have to deal with one.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.....</li>
            <li> Sorry, couldn&#x27;t continue, too greasy.</li>
            <li> Very gentle product. No stinging as I&#x27;ve read some eye creams cause. I think it&#x27;s really helped to lighten my dark circles under my eyes and it helps to keep my lashes nice and full as well.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much change from using this product.  It&#x27;s o.k., smells good and goes on pretty smooth.  Probably won&#x27;t get more in the future.</li>
            <li> This product did NOT do anything for dark circles besides the fact that it did NOT smell bad. The balm was more for soothing but that was all it did. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week and already notice a difference in my under eye area. The area is noticeably lighter, I have struggled w/ dark circles due to allergies my entire life. I can wait to see the difference in a month!</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago, every night before bed I put it on and even during the day I put some on if I&#x27;m not leaving the house because it&#x27;s kind of greasy BUT I already see results! YES after only a FEW days I&#x27;m starting to see a little lighter apperarance from my dark eye circles&amp;#62; I have even decided toplace on my whole face to see if it will help with a little sagging here and there and I hope it works! I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to remove dark circles and the seller ships quickly so that&#x27;s a big plus!</li>
            <li> Great product-I used the product consistently for 6 months and can tell a huge difference. The area under my eyes is hydrated and has less noticeable wrinkles.</li>
            <li> In the past year I&#x27;ve been getting dark circles under and around my eyes. I decided to try the Queen Bee product because it&#x27;s all natural and has excellent reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this product under my eyes before bed for 2 weeks now and it seems to be working so far. According to my boyfriend my dark circles look noticeably lighter. I&#x27;m going to keep on using it and will post back updated results in a few month!.</li>
            <li> I am still using my first jar,and I am very pleased with it!. I can definitely already start see good results.  My dark circles are getting  better, and my eyes are looking and feeling more moisturized which makes me happy because I have tried a lot of products without much success. I love that this cream is 100% natural and organic.  I will continue using and promise to get back and let you know how is working, but I am sure it will do great!  I can&#x27;t wait to see my dark circles disappeared since I hate them!.</li>
            <li> I wanted to share that I really like this product. I have never used any type of cream for the dark areas under my eyes before and I wanted to find something natural. After much research, I found the under eye cream Queen Bee product and I can honestly say that I see it working. I use it every night under my eyes since October 2013 and the black areas under my eyes has already decreased.  I don&#x27;t need to use as much cover up under my eyes anymore. I really believe in the natural ingredients used and I will continue to use it for the next few months and buy another jar. I recommend others to try this product. Organic is much safer and better than other creams on the market!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it every day and night on my eyes and face.  I think it has even helped lengthen my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles around my eyes, these are inherited from my mother and grandmother. After a week of using Queen Bee these circles are starting to fade. It is a miracle.I will continue to use it in hopes that they will continue to fade. Thank You</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have finally found a product that would diminish my dark circles, I was very excited after reading the reviews. However when I used the product I was no difference in my under eye circles and it started to clog the pores under my circles giving me little white heads so I had to stop using it. I am very pale so my dark circles are more from that than from lack of sleep. I&#x27;m glad it worked for some people but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell about any long term results/effects, but I love it so far! I have really dry skin, and this has made my face nice and smooth. My skin does feel more hydrated, and slightly plumper. This is also fantastic for eczema!! I will definitely be getting more. :]</li>
            <li> I love this product for my under eyes - don&#x27;t quite know if it has done anything miraculous, but it softens and soothes the sensitive skin there so well and I often use it on other areas of my face and am very happy with it.  A jar lasts a very long time and I cannot imagine going to bed without this on my under eye area - it is relaxing.</li>
            <li> Excellent item!  Work fine in the skin, love it!</li>
            <li> I was advised by my dermatologist to get something with vit. K for under my eyes.  This product is outstanding.  Less than 2 days I started seeing my dark circles disappear and almost no puffiness. All the other reviews are absolutely correct how fantastic this is.</li>
            <li> It is alright as a moisturizer, but did nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvments - zero, null. Does not work for dark circles, or for my skin</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily into the skin.  Great for dry skin like mine</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I was very diligent with this product cause i have very bad dark rings around my eyes aka racoon eyes. And i put this stuff on at night and during the day if i wasn&#x27;t going anywhere.  Within 5 days i saw a dramatic difference. This stuff is greasy and it looks weird when u put it on but hey I&#x27;m happy with the results. I wouldn&#x27;t put this on before make up because it is greasy and it makes it easier for your make up to shift. Gonna order my second pot soon.  This stuff really changed my appearance</li>
            <li> Not really seeing any changes but will continue to use it and hopefully by the time the jar is empty I will have seen a difference.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly It didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Didn&#x27;t get rid of dark circles and made me breakout on the undereye area. (I have sensitive skin) waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and rosacea.  I have been looking for almost 10 years for something and stumbled across this a couple years ago after trying many other products.  I have been using Queen Bee for almost 2 years now and it has significantly reduced both the rosacea and the dark circles (not completely gone, but much much better).  I use it only at night since it&#x27;s really thick and shiny (I wouldn&#x27;t want to have such a shiny face in the day time).  It seems to work better for the rosacea, which started to go down after just a week or two of use.  The dark circles have improved too, just not as much as the rosacea has improved.  For the cost of this product, it is well worth it.  Plus it&#x27;s all natural.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I love how soft my skin feels. I had very dry skin on my face and within a matter of days it feels so smooth. The thing that got me to try this product was that there are no harsh chemicals just sitting on my skin from this product. I am getting my body in  shape and I am very conscious of everything I&#x27;m eating and using. So when I saw this product I had to try it. It works and I can feel good that its not harmful. I am starting to see my dark under eyes starting to fade. My face looks brighter almost. Give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for only 5 days now,and i allready  love the smell,the texture and the fact that&#x27;s chemical free.It&#x27;s  also good for lips too.I&#x27;m coming back with updates about wrinkles too.</li>
            <li> Use it at night and have noticed a significant improvement in dark circles and wrinkles disappearing.  Well pleased at this time.</li>
            <li> I just started using Queen Bee eye cream a little while ago but I am already impressed. I have constant dark under eye circles and I was looking for a natural alternative to use for them. I was very excited to find Queen Bee organic eye cream. The ingredients are natural and gentle, provide moisture to the under eye area, and fade the darkness as well. Definitely a worthwhile buy. I&#x27;m even getting my mom into it for her small facial lines/wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst product i ever spent money on.. If you want to spend money on a petroleum jelly kind of cream which you can get for a dollar else where then buy it.. im suing it on my feet now cuz i don&#x27;t want it to sit there.. please don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sleeping well, dark circles are usually caused by allergies, or sinus infections? At times, you might be suffering from both! You need to treat the underlying cause, if you want to find a permanent solution. Now, and since this is a product review, i would have to state &amp;#34;Queen Beez&#x27;, is the only product i&#x27;ve used so far, that does not contain caffeine (which would actually aggravate a sinus infection) that works! I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> have struggled with dark circles since teen years. have used this for about a month and see no improvement yet, will continue use till jar is empty</li>
            <li> The product is all natural, so that&#x27;s something definitely to keep in mind. It works okay at removing dark circles, at least somewhat. I would recommend it because of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have sooooooooooo many eye creams.  This is more like a petroleum based product than a cream, but the next morning when I awaken after using Queen Bee, my wrinkles are noticably less, my skin is soft and moisturized and I never thought I would say that my dark circles seem less pronounced.  Using my concealing cream is more effective with a little of this cream first.  I just love it!  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I want to begin by saying I have only been using this product for a week and am already noting subtle changes. I have genetic dark under circles, so I have this raccoon look that I am not too fond of (no offense to raccoons). So I am always in the market for something that helps and so far this has been the best! I&#x27;ve tried Avon products such as their banishing cream after reading reviews that state that helped. However, it did little for me and I had issues putting something like that with so many chemicals I couldn&#x27;t pronounce in such a sensitive area like my under eye region. I love Queen Bee. It has all natural  ingredients such as Shea Butter, Olive oil, Coconut oil, etc. I keep the cream by my bed as a reminder to put it on at night. It&#x27;s waxy/ oily but in a smooth way and glides on nicely. Most importantly I feel it&#x27;s working. I am so happy I found this product. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my under eye will look a month from now.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second bottle of this, as liked the first one and missed it after I ran out. I don&#x27;t know that it made a difference in the under eye dark circles, I did not notice a change in that area, but really softens the skin around my eyes. I occasionally get a rough spot under an eye or on my face which this cream really helps to soften and in time remove. And I think it has helped lessen the wrinkles around my eyes as well. I&#x27;d recommend it and plan to always keep it around.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week and on the first night using this cream, I could feel the softness under my eyes.  Since it has only been a week, I can start to see a slight difference on my dark circles.  I will keep using this for a month and update again but i am sure i will see more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even applied this as a lip balm at night and it is great. Not only that but i applied this on a very back burn and it healed my finger great, didn&#x27;t allow my finger to blister and it looked as if it was getting ready to blister.  I also apply this around my eyebrows (which i have had problems with dryness and red irritation) which is now gone. I have recommended this product to many people and I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> If you were to browse all my orders here on Amazon, you will find a ton of different products for dark circle remover and I usually went with the relatively cheap rollers and while they did provide a refreshing feel; none of them really lightened up the dark circles under my eyes.  I have been using this product for a month now and I can see some visible results and that has me so very pleased!  These dark circles I have are one of my biggest confidence issues about my self so I am very excited at the prospect of lessening this problem even further as this product will absolutely have my support for the foreseeable future!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I have used it since we received it. I can&#x27;t say I have noticed much of a difference, other than it feels nice on my skin and it&#x27;s not greasy. My wife, on the other hand, has said she thinks that the dark circles have been lightened a bit, with a few less wrinkles to show for it. We both plan on continuing to use the product, since we can benefit from fewer dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  After reading about the All Natural Queen Bee Eye Cream, I thought I would give it a try.  It&#x27;s so smooth and light weight.  It feels great and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell or rough feel.  It gives a nice cooling sensation that I really enjoy!</li>
            <li> I really need something to help with my hereditary dark circles. I&#x27;m nearing 40 and don&#x27;t have crows feet, but I want to keep the wrinkles at bay while correcting the dark circles. I live in MN, so I also need a heavy duty moisturizer over the cold winter months. I ordered Queen Bee based on the reviews for dark circles and also because it is all natural, and organic. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and am really pleased with the moisturizing effects. This is a very thick cream that is a bit oily and takes awhile to completely absorb. It is perfect for my nighttime routine, but in the morning I have to be careful to only put a very thin layer about 10-15 minutes before I put on my make-up or it will be too oily. I can&#x27;t speak for wrinkles/crows feet as I don&#x27;t have them yet, but I am pleased that my dark circles are lighter. I have extremely sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues, so that is another plus. I&#x27;ve used quite a few very high end creams that cost three to four times this price.  I feel like Queen Bee is just as effective, but without the harsh chemicals that most eye creams contain.  I would recommend this to a friend.  UPDATE:  I keep it on hand for the dry MN winters, but I only use it sparingly when my skin feels really dry since it&#x27;s just too heavy/greasy for me to use very often.</li>
            <li> I truly like this product! I have used it for just about a week ( three to four times a day) but already seen the improvements for my eyes dark circle and lines. They have become lighter and less noticeable. The only drawback from it is the wax form, but it&#x27;s just a minor minus compared to the great benefit it carries.</li>
            <li> The weather has been so dry lately that my face was showing more wrinkles than normal.  I read the good reviews of the Queen Bee Eye Cream and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did. Wow!  It worked so good on my eyes that I&#x27;ve decided to use it on my whole face.  My face feels great again and the wrinkles have diminished.  Thank you for a great and natural product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the eye cream in mid-November.  It&#x27;s very good.  I use it under makeup and at night. When I use it under makeup, I put it on about 20 to 30 minutes before I use a foundation.  That gives it time to absorb.  It leaves my skin soft and softens the lines around my eyes and mouth.  It does not irritate my eyes.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the results.  I was so hopeful that I would be able to see a difference after using this product, but unfortunately, I continue to deal with the dark circles.  Big promise, disappointing return.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference in dark circles under eyes, maybe I&#x27;m beyond repair. I wont purchase again. Too expensive for the ingrediants that are in it</li>
            <li> I’ve had a problem with dark puffy circles under my eyes for many years, which made me look old and tired no matter how much sleep I got.  Over the years I’ve tried many different products and none made any difference whatsoever. For the last two weeks I have been applying Queen Bee liberally under my eyes each night before I go to bed. In just those couple of weeks I’ve seen a noticeable improvement. There is less darkness and less puffiness already.  Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> This eye cream was just what I was looking for; an all natural toxic free cream with vitamin K for dark circle reduction and I absolutely love the sweet vanilla scent it has, it smells delicious. I&#x27;ve been wearing it at night and in the morning under my concealer and it works really well, the skin around my eyes feels softer and not so dry anymore and my makeup looks smoother when I apply my concealer.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because all its ingredients are natural. I apply it in the night and I wake up in the morning without dark circles. I cannot give 5 stars because it is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave a lot of reviews and my expectations were low for this stuff but it is super magical. I use it on my neck, eyes and a little on my forehead.  It is so rich and I have watched as the lines I was getting on my neck have VANISHED.  My eyes look younger and the circles are diminished. My forehead is smoother.  This stuff is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have ben using this product for a week and I notice a slight improvement to the wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This really makes your eyes soft and helps with your eye concealer to go on smooth. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say whether or not my dark circles have faded or if my wrinkles have gotten better ( I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks) but I do love the hydration it gives the eyes!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes for my dark circles, which in my case seems to be from thin skin and allergies.  I used it for about a month and saw no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I got a sample of a different brand with wild yam, arnica, and hydroxyproline in it.  That&#x27;s worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing.  The jar states to use twice a day.  I mainly use at night.  If you do use in the am, I would suggest using a small amount and waiting for a few minutes before applying concealer etc.  I will give the product a chance to sink in.  A little goes a long way.  I think the jar will last a long time.  I also use on my cuticles.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. At all.  After all the good reviews I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; Well, when you get the package queen bee adds a little piece of paper that offers a second free jar upon a &amp;#34;great review&amp;#34; received.  I&#x27;ve been using for 3 months religiously and no improvement.  Maybe my jar is bad lol</li>
            <li> I love this cream, simple natural ingredients, smells great, very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t irritate at all (I apply it all over around the eye), keeps wrinkles around eye kinda relaxed &amp; smoothed for a few hours before it fully absorbed into the skin, after that you&#x27;d need to apply again (I would say at least twice a day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely more PM cream because it&#x27;s oily, but I apply just a little bit under my regular eye cream before I leave home too and it helps to keep around eye area moisturized longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any lasting results, there is no miracle and all my wrinkles and dark circles are still with me&lt;br /&gt;but I did notice that overall my face looks much less tired when I do use this cream vs when I don&#x27;t use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for about 6 weeks for now and I&#x27;d estimate it will last me for another 6 weeks,&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s about $8 per month, so price seems to be right too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line is, yes I do recommend it and I will continue using it until I find something else that I like more :)</li>
            <li> Great product all the women in my family uses it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you .Queen Bee  is just  right for me. Awesome!,,</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dark circles since I was a teenager, I am starting to think it may have something to do with genetics. So needless to say, I have tried many under eye treatments that have proved to be fruitless. I wanted to try something that is paraben free and had all natural ingredients and I stumbled across this after typing in &amp;#34;dark circle eye treatment&amp;#34; on Amazon. I was amazed at all of the great reviews and the the ratings, so I thought it would be worth the money since nothing I have used in the last 6-7 years has helped much. I received this eye cream a few days ago and was surprised at the amount they give you (pleasant surprise) and like the idea of using a waxier treatment instead of a more liquid or lotion consistency. I have been applying it after cleansing before bed and after cleansing and toning in the morning. My experience so far has been positive, the cream has a very faint and pleasant smell as well as it is very moisturizing. Some reviewers have mentioned that the cream is too thick and it is a goo idea to only apply it right before you fall asleep, but I beg to differ. The cream is so smooth and soft when applied to my skin the I even wear my concealer and powder over it during the daytime. My dark circles are something fierce (even after applying mac concealer and foundation, which says alot) so it will probably take at least  few more weeks or even a couple of months of consistent use of this cream to see real results. I will update my review in two months to help out potential buyers and people who also suffer from dark circles constantly searching for the holy grail product.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious!!! and keeps my under eye are very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night generously and i use only a little in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Has worked great so far. I would repurchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I can definitely say that my dark circles have become less visible. This eye cream is less like a cream and more of a wax and is not greasy. A plus is that it has natural ingredients and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a full week now and love it!!!! It has made the skin under my eyes firmer and the dark circles are going away. I just started using it on my entire face and my skin feels like silk. Some people have commented on it feeling greasy, but you just have to make sure to rub it in thoroughly. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to tell about how much help this product has been with the dark circles but it&#x27;s been a huge help with wrinkles around my eyes. Because I&#x27;ve had lifelong dark circles around my eyes (you can see pictures of me as a kid with dark circles and I know my Mom was making sure I got plenty of sleep then),  I now have wrinkles under my eyes from years of using make-up and under eye cover creams that tend to be drying. This product has been wonderful about restoring the moisture around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed with this product becaues it doesnt absorb and makes my undereyes greasy. Don&#x27;t buy this if you intend to wear under makeup as it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use because it is rock solid.  I would not order this again.  Wanted to give this small company a chance.</li>
            <li> use this every night and my dark circles are completely gone and the skin around my eyes is nice and moisturized. I no longer look like a zombie in the morning haha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this under eye cream a few times, and I can already see a difference in my dark circles! I&#x27;ve tried lots of products for this issue, and none have made a difference like this one has. Definetly pick this up- you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> I have hederitary dark circles and I have tried everything to get rid of them but nothing really seemed to work. I found this eye cream and it started reducing my dark circles by the third day of using it day and night. I am confident that it would erase my dark circles completely if i keep using it. This is surely a product that I would recommend, but just be patient and you will see results.</li>
            <li> I put this product on before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning I can see a noticeable reduction of dark circles. The price for this product is a steal, and I would recommend this product to anyone. The product makes you look more awake and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest.  I have been using it over a month and I LOVE this product.  The aroma helps me feel calm.  The product makes my skin feel and look smooth and soft.  I have rec&#x27;d so many compliments on how young I look.  I had no idea others would see such a difference in my skin so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your description cannot capture how great this product really is.  This is a MUST HAVE for any woman who wants to use a natural product that really delivers.  Only a small amount gives you big returns.  You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> its really good moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;forehead, under eye,&lt;br /&gt;I feel different after 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;all natural NO chemical&lt;br /&gt;like it .&lt;br /&gt;write review and get 2 more jar but I have never got them</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me, and because it&#x27;s primarily just beeswax, it will make your pillows greasy the first time you roll over in bed.</li>
            <li> It helped a lot moisturizing the area around the eyes</li>
            <li> Working the night shift, and suffering with itchy eyes from allergies can cause very bad looking eyes.  This cream helps with the bags under eyes after applying every night. Excellent results noticed within 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> They eye cream feels great on my eyes,</li>
            <li> This is a great under eye product that I will order again !</li>
            <li> does not do as advertised, so far, and it has been used for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Work a little but my circles are still here! I will live with them for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Over the last year, I&#x27;ve become allergic to almost everything that can touch my skin. All face wash, moisturizer, makeup, and lotions had to be dermatologically studied. I looked on here for an organic product and stumbled upon this. I&#x27;m already on my second bottle of this product. I love it and my skin is better than ever!!!</li>
            <li> I like using this cream at night as it seems to help rejuvenate my skin &amp; help reduce the appearance of under eye circles quite significantly. I also use it on my forehead at night &amp; around my cheeks too to help prevent wrinkles in these areas. I like the consistency of the product - sometimes I will apply it first thing to my skin &amp; apply other products/moisturizers over it in the daytime. It blends well into my skin when I do this. I was looking for an organic product when I found this on amazon. I like that it is made from beeswax as I am trying to use as many natural organic products in my daily life as possible.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing i love it..... This product really work on my skin . I dont know about others  but for me excellent result . Thank you</li>
            <li> Originally I had written a rave review about this product. Truth be told it does absolutely nothing for the dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s really balmy. I like to use it on my lips at bed time after brushing my teeth to combat the dryness. That&#x27;s pretty much all its good for. Cute jar though...</li>
            <li> The instruction says apply before bed, is it for night only?&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream has so hard texture, is there a good way to use it to help skin better absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;How much should be apply to face? Because it is a bit oily. Apply a thick layer may be not applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did make my skin feel more soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> After about 1 week of applying this cream once a day under my eyes, I can confidently say that this product works. It will not completely remove dark circles, but it definitely reduces the appearance of them.</li>
            <li> I have been using your all natural Queen Bee eye cream for only two days and have began to notice clear results. I have always had dark circles under my eyes and they have began to start fading away! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Queen Bee 100% All-Natural, Organice Under Eye Cream for a few weeks now and my under eye dark circles are fading. The product is very easy to work with. I like that you only have to put it on at night. Also it doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my eyes! It has a pleasant smell as well. I use it on my face as well and noticed my face looks smoother.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0047PPCAW Queen Bee 100% All-Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream - Removes Dark Circles, Facial Lines and Wrinkles Naturally - 1oz (30ml)]]</li>
            <li> I will say that I originally only purchased this item because it had such great reviews. I figured wow, it must be great. I was worried that maybe it would not live up to the hype but I love it!!!! I have moderate dark circles from my hectic schedule as well as heredity. Bee&#x27;s is an amazing moisturizer and helped to lighten the darkness very quickly. You only need a very tiny bit so the 1 oz jar lasts a very long time. I do not have wrinkles but I also use it on my cheeks over old acne scars. I believe that it has helped with the redness in my cheek and helped nourish my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it and will continue to buy!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove dark circles for me but I will say it does make them look less obvious. I put it on every morning under my eyes and you really only need a small amount and just blend it in so your under eyes don&#x27;t look glossy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months every night under my eyes. Although I do not see an improvement in the puffiness, I like the fact that it is organic. I do not experience any stinging sensations.</li>
            <li> Great texture, but this product made me break out. I must say my skin is sensitive, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the skin,</li>
            <li> Queen Bee is my favorite antiage cream for my fine lines and dark circles. I use it everyday on my forehead, on the corner of my mouth and around my eyes. What I can say love it!  My fine lines are disappearing. .</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a product, and based on the positive reviews, I selected Queen Bee Organic Eye Cream.  I received the product in ONE DAY.  As soon as I got it, I placed it under my eyes.  It felt like my eyes were drinking the balm--I know it sounds weird, but that&#x27;s the best I could describe the feeling I had.  It felt so soft to the touch!  Even hours after, my skin is still so soft, not greasy.  I feel like putting it on my heels too!  My hubby is even interested.  Now THAT&#x27;s saying something.  Great product, great service. Much thanks.</li>
            <li> this is some good stuff, I am quite satisfied with the product. It is definitely mostly shea butter though, you can spot the smell and  consistency.</li>
            <li> I like the cream. I have seen a difference, some blotching hoping to see more results in the future. I would buy this again. My mom likes it too. I received a little coupon that said I could get a free one it I contacted the seller. Seller never replied or sent anything, so don&#x27;t fall for that once you get it. I will give it 3 for now. It smells great. It is very oily so you have to use it at bedtime. Using it anywhere near your eyes in the day time will make your vision blurry.</li>
            <li> Age was catching on me and I was hell worried about it. Fine lines and wrinkles had started to make their presence felt on my face. Makeups became common, but I was looking for a better solution. Online searches lead me to Queen Bee and I bought it at runaway price on Amazon. An all-natural product is what you want to apply on your face and Queen Bee is just that. No side effects, winkles gone, smooth skin and my husband say I look young just like a Queen again. So a big thank you Queen Bee and Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It makes absolutely no difference on dark circles, minimizes puffiness around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, wish I did not buy the product. Another wasted product trying to get rid of dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one week and I have noticed a slight improvement so far.  It is very moisturizing and not greasy and very easily absorbed.  Overall I would love to continue to see the results and I do like the cream.  Give it a try.  I have hereditary bags and started to get dark discoloration under eyes also.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. It didn&#x27;t lighten the dark circles under my eyes but around my eyes they got firm.</li>
            <li> I had dark circles for the past 20 years. I have tried so many other products to reduce my dark circles, but nothing worked. I have been using this cream for the past 3 weeks and most of the dark circle is gone. I will make it a 5-star when there is no trace of it.</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t work as expected. I have see so many good comments about this product and that what make me wanted to buy the product. But after a couple months using the product, my dark circles still there. wasted time + money+ effort</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My facial skin dries out very quickly but since using this cream my face has never been more smooth and clear. I&#x27;ve gone through many jars already. I choose to rub  the cream in all over my face not just under my eyes. I know for a fact it lightened my dark circles. Every morning my whole face glows after using this stuff overnight. What I love the most is the ingredient list. I would never put anything on my skin that has ingredients that are foreign to me or that I cannot pronounce. Everything in this cream is natural and proven to do wonders for your skin. Organic Olive Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Shea Butter, Vanilla Essential Oil, Vitamin K. Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that as far as NATURAL under eye creams go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the smell is fantastic and smells good enough to eat....don&#x27;t eat it though.</li>
            <li> I was surprised about the note from the seller asking me to write a review in order to get a jar free, usually this is not a good sign; but I have to say I am pretty please with the product. You have to know that the first ingredient listed is Olive Oil......so I believe it is in fact well overpriced. Overall a very good moisturizer to apply at night, and after a few week my dark circles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is  nothing more than a skin soothing balm . The maker of this product \\&quot;Donna\\&quot; sent a letter along with this saying that you need to have patience to see the results of this product....huh well it still doesn&#x27;t do anything for your eyes !!!! Good luck everyone .</li>
            <li> I want to be truthful with my review and not writing something sweet because i get a free jar. Look at the ingredients. The pri is olive oil, beeswax, more oil ., no active ingredients. I bought it, well the review was great and i wanted to see why.. Used it, in the middle of day i feel loke i just smothered KFC grease on my face. Feels heavy and uncomfy. Didnt remove any dark eyes or eliminate pores. I realised the great reviews were due to the promise of a free jar if u drop a nice comment. Im a real consumer and i pay for something that works.</li>
            <li> iam deep in love with this cram i have combnation skin i use the cream under my eye and all over my face just i avoid the T zone it mois my under eye and the dark circle look lighter than befor  i love the smell of this prouduct and the pacage i will buy it again and again .</li>
            <li> Ive tried so many products and have spent so much money on different skincare but this one jar takes care of it all.  i used this under my eyes and all over my face....This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Absolutely love it and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to go along with the virgin coconut oil and face moisturizer I use.  I live in Northern Colorado and the air is very dry.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily purchase it for the dark circles, but just to keep the area under my eyes and my lips moist.  I purchased a .5 oz jar in June and ran out in September.  I place it not just under the eye but also on my forehead, between the eyes (frown lines), around my lips and smile lines.  I noticed my wrinkles were less noticeable, but the real difference was how moist my skinned stayed.  I didn&#x27;t reorder to see if I would miss it.  I did miss it.  Again, love the moisturizing that I get along with my other products.  Also, it cleared up my eczema that pops up on my chin.  Got to love that.  Cindie Williams</li>
            <li> This product works great, I saw results in a week. I will continue to use the product and  continue to update as well.</li>
            <li> Great product, smells good and works well. Just a few days in and the puffiness/black circles are diminishing already. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great!! I use it on my entire face, it leave you skin feeling soft. I will recomment the product to my friends</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was looking for something to use for under my eyes. i been having dark circles sence  kid! Thought It was time to do something about it, so I decided to try this cream.... (not really a cream, its different but it works)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I been using it for two weeks already, and been noticing great results! Another plus is the price! Cant go wrong with this! Recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I used it in the am and eve. Did not experience any change. It was like putting Vaseline on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> verall, I like the cream.  I think it does a good job of keeping skin moisturized and reducing wrinkles.  However, I do not see an improvement in eye circles.  I do not think this product can remove dark circles, and I am not sure any cream can accomplish this.  So, while I like the cream overall, I believe some of the claims are misleading.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product. I have started to have a problem with puffy/dark circles and since using this at night and in the am I can definitely notice the difference!</li>
            <li> It does moisturize and is a great product to alternate with your stronger eye creams.  As far as using it all the time or are trying to smooth away wrinkles, your not going to get the results you so desire.</li>
            <li> Total value for the price paid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking at the price, I was a bit skeptical in the beginning whether to order this or still keep shopping around for other similar products for my mother. Looking at the reviews, I just ordered it. Within the 2-3 weeks of use, my mother just loves this product. She has been seeing the darkness going away from around her eyes. The price you pay is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I have heriditory of dark circle. I really lost my hope that they recover. I saw this product in amazon and I got hope. so I ordered immediately. i applied once and i felt that it is unlike other creams. it is perfect to apply it is look like candle and we get the cream how much we want. i applied and it is fully safe for eyes. other creams i appled i get burni ng with them. so satisfied and skin under eyes is soft after the wash. This is third day aim using i really got hope that it reduce my dark circle and wrinkles. thank u.</li>
            <li> Product works really good. Reduced puffiness and dark circles in just one week! Definitely will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in lines or wrinkles, but I have noticed that the area under my eyes is lighter than before I began using it.</li>
            <li> lightens dark circles wit continues use. i use it every night before sleep and wash it off every morning . defiantly lightens the dark circles</li>
            <li> Dear company appreciated for the great product that you sell! I would like to explain a little bit more about the product how affect on my face! I have sensitive skin, white, normal to dry and live in Denver, Colorado, which also make my skin more dry. I have always had problems with buying monetizing cream for my skin. Everyone that I was buying produced acne on my skin and then I decided to not use them at all. When I was looking in Amazon i found Queen Bee, all the ingredients were organic, so I decided to give it a try! And I am so HAPPY i did it! I finally found something that works not well, I could say Fantastic to my skin, even my boyfriend noticed the difference after only 2 weeks! I started using it all over on my face, evening time, before bed and now I have SOFT, YOUNG and CLEAR FACE SKIN! I can&#x27;t be happier, finally something for me! Thank you so much! I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my dark circles except made them worse. Can&#x27;t even use it as a moistariser because it&#x27;s very oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to a pricer product.  I smells great, but was not effective for my application.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but I find it to be very hard to put under my eyes.  The product is not easy to spread, if that makes sense.  I was expecting the consistency of something like Vaseline but it is much stiffer.  I cannot say that I have noticed a big difference in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to share my experience of using this cream. Its a very nice cream. Although my dark circles are not deep but they are visible enough. I have been using this cream daily and I can see the difference. It really starts working soon, even my colleague mentioned it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the creme for several weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any improvement. I would not recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for one week and it seems to be working!! I would buy more in future.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the product, and how it keeps your eye area moist all day all night. It feels so smooth to apply on, leaves your skin hydrated. It gives me the fresh look in the morning! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I am using it on my forehead as well and the wrinkles seem like they are getting smaller.&lt;br /&gt;This cream also smells so good!</li>
            <li> It last forever, and it really does moisturize your eyes at night. Smells great too.  I have noticed a difference in dark circles. The consistency is a little waxy but again, you need that extra hydration at night (would not use in the daytime).  I will purchase another when finished.  Service great too...</li>
            <li> I received it very fast, I started using the Queen Bee 100% All-Natural Organic Under Eye Cream to remove my dark circles right away and everyday. I am seeing very good results, I will continue to use it everyday and I strongly recommend this under eye cream to be used everyday to remove dark circles.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell if it works as never had the discipline to use it 30 days in a row</li>
            <li> This product did what it claims. It visibly reduced my under eye darkness and moisturized the area too. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me. I&#x27;ve always had dark circles under my eyes and it&#x27;s not helped. It&#x27;s very greasy/waxy so you have to put it on before bed. And I was very disappointed in this product. Was a complete waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me or my husband...a little greasy and grainy so I used when I went to bed. Maybe just good for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> DID NOT HELP ME AT ALL</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and have noticed a big difference already. I am 28 and have just one or two creases around my eyes that I am working on fading, and also as a preventative. It&#x27;s a very gentle undereye balm that gave me results very quickly. I have used other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made them tear all the time. This one is definitely a keeper! Ordering a few more just so I don&#x27;t run out even though a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SO GOOD FOR THE SKIN, SEEMS TO GIVE YOU A GLOW, WORKS GOOD UNDER MAKEUP, I AM VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Most eye creams I&#x27;ve tried (natural or not) make my eyes water and burn, but not this product. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and makes my skin soft and supple.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> I do like it...it seems to help my dark circles but hasn&#x27;t totally done away with them...my skin is smoother &amp; I do see some improvement...I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> greesy and didn&#x27;t work well.  Good customer service though.</li>
            <li> I saw that so many people love this cream, and it works for them, but it was too thick for my under eyes. It made my puffiness worse when I applied it before bed. I think it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m 58 and my skin is thin now. I guess I need a lighter product at this point.</li>
            <li> my daughter likes it very much. it is not expensive. it is useful for her eyes, she is also lucky ,she got your card.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is natural, sweet and a lot compared with other eye treatment. It did great job for moisture.</li>
            <li> I knew that buying a more natural product would take time to see results. The changes I have seen have been very gradual but after about a week, the dark bruising I have is less noticeable. I have a very fair complexion, and despite getting a full nights&#x27; sleep, I always have the shadows starting from the corner of my eye and fanning downwards. First morning after I applied the cream, I noticed that the skin was smoothed out (no little bumps). The smell is very faint and not off putting in my opinion. There were still some traces of the cream (a bit like vaseline?) but I suspect I over-apply sometimes. It has been a very dry and cold winter so the cream doubles to take care of that itchy, tight feeling in my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will not fix it overnight, but if you are patient and you want a more permanent solution (provided you take care of your skin, of course) then I would recommend this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who have had a bad experience and claim the rest of us are lying for a free jar, or that it is a complete scam on the company&#x27;s part: everyone&#x27;s skin is different and it will not be a guaranteed hit with each customer. I know what I see and feel, and my skin HAS improved since using the cream. I am very much pleased with the results, and knowing that my condition plagues others, I want to let prospective buyers it is worth a TRY. Free jar be damned.</li>
            <li> Gradually they are fading away.  The discoloration around my eyes is also fading.  Puffiness--gone.  I use in morning.  Also acts as lip balm.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I do really like this product but it is on the greasy side. Love the all natural ingredients! I will continue to use :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for dark circles, and I haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement yet. However it is a very good moisturizer that does seem to soften facial lines, and make skin appear a bit more youthful. I like how I can use it around my mouth lines, and then use it as a lip balm, since I don&#x27;t worry about chemicals that aren&#x27;t in the product. I use it at night but not during the day, since I wear mascara which smudges since this product is so slick. I will experiment with powders, etc. so as to not sport the raccoon look, but it would be good to know how to remove this product so it is compatible with the little bit of eye makeup I feel a need to wear.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream because I&#x27;m having an allergic reaction to most of my cosmetics. As a result, my eyelids are inflammed and  have patches of eczema that are itchy and dry. I am able to keep my eye area soothed and moisturized without irritation. There is a slight vanilla scent and it is more like a salve than a lotion or cream. I&#x27;ve also started applying this to my lip line to combat those wrinkles as well. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love the outcome of my product Queen Bee Under Eye Cream.  I have been using this product for more than a month and my bag circles has improved tremendously.  My wrinkles are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really works and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used the eye cream for about a week and all I can say is that I do like it for bedtime. Feels exactly like Crisco so use it sparingly. I do not use it in the day or under makeup ( I&#x27;m 32) because it is greasy and heavy. It does feel smooth and moisturizing, &amp; is loaded with oils with a light scent like cocoa butter. I also received a card with the jar stating that I will receive another jar for free if I share my review. Might be the reason for the volume of reviews!! Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Great Product. I have had issues with dark circles under my eyes since I was child. This product really provided an enriching feeling that gave new color to my skin under my eyes. I intend on using this until it stops working, which I don&#x27;t for see. I recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed. It leaves the eyes really oily looking. It looks like hard oils, like cocoa butter in it&#x27;d solid state. So you rub your finger around and get oil and you rub it on your eyes. Def something only to use at night because of the oily look. Works great if your eyes are really really dry.</li>
            <li> Definitely would not purchase again. Did not see the results noted in positive reviews of this product. Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Initially, posted a generic favorable review because the seller promised to ship the product free after it posted.  In their defense they state &#x27;honest&#x27; feedback...but I wonder why they would send a free product to someone who didn&#x27;t like the product.  But we all like free stuff right?  So I played the &#x27;game&#x27; to see if it worked.  It did.  Consequently, I am greatly concerned by this business practice as a loyal Amazon customer who relies heavily on the product reviews.  Initially, I was suspicious because one eye cream never seems to please everyone and to see so many (600+) great reviews I suspected foul play.  Then easily found it.  Here&#x27;s the deal on the product--it is very moisturizing.  I do like it at night mostly because we live in a dry climate.  It is a disaster to use under makeup as it is greasy and causes everything to run.  Quite frankly you could pull the ingredients from your kitchen cupboards or a grocery store and use them at night at a fraction of the cost.  Nonetheless, the product is a nice moisturizer but that is it.  As for &#x27;stacking the deck&#x27; to ensure great product reviews--Amazon please block this practice so we can trust what we read in the reviews.  I wonder how many of us overpaid the $22 for this eye cream because we saw the *****Stars***** and therefore believed that it works?!?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly three weeks. I guess it is too soon for big changes as my dark circles are still there. but I am positive that it will be better when I have used the eye cream for a longer time. I have very sensitive skin, but this eye cream feels very good under the eye. I like the fact that it is organic too.</li>
            <li> been using it for almost over 3 months. it works so far.. all natural NO chemical and like it.&lt;br /&gt;well, the package says.. write review and get jar but I have never got one</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve had really dark circles on medium-brown skin my entire life, and graduate school is not helping my cause. After about 10 days of use around the eyes at night, and maybe a thin film in the morning, there is a noticeable difference. I also use it as a cream of dry facial patches when they arise. I&#x27;m about 1 month into using it, and I feel so much better about my eye region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a little goes a LONG way. I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent in it a month in.</li>
            <li> For me, not so much. I think it&#x27;s great many have found this product to be what they need, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be beneficial for me.&lt;br /&gt;I know everyone is different, so I won&#x27;t bash it, I have noticed some small changes after a month, but really not that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing those good reviews. But after trying the whole bottle, I have not seen any effect around my eyes at all! It is just some cheap honey wax ingredients. Too sticky and not easy to apply. Feels not good. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect as an under eye cream and can be used as a night cream as well. I have very sensitive, dry skin and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now, but I can already see improvements. Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I have very dark under eye circles and have tried just about everything. This cream is more of an ointment than a cream and has made no improvement in my under eye circles. They almost seem worse. Am a little skeptical about the very positive reviews, as a card was included with the shipment offering free product for a comment on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two months now and have  not seen a bit of difference with my hereditary dark circles. Why do I keep using it? Because it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s better than putting a cream that&#x27;s packed with chemicals. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find something that actually works. I really wish it worked, because my under eye area feels so smooth afterward. Oh well, on to the next cream.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this :) it works great, I&#x27;m happy with it! I will be buying again!! :)</li>
            <li> Blotchy patches on my face have faded enough so as to eliminate the need for concealer before foundation. This product does even more than promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with the effectiveness, price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> love this product.......love the fact that i can feel good about putting this on my face  ....love love This product is absolutely amazing .....</li>
            <li> Finding the solution of the aging facial lines made me do a lot of research online. I didn’t want any chemically formulated product that may cause problems to my skin. This is when I found out about Queen Bee and ordered it from Amazon. It’s been about a quarter that I am using this product and I am really satisfied by the results. No side effects on my skin and the facial lines are no longer prominent. I will surely recommend people to use this all-natural product to fight aging signs.</li>
            <li> Great product. Surprising how such simple ingredients can help so much. I would recommend this product . No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I even bought one for my mother after she noticed a difference in my bags. Will def by again</li>
            <li> This definitely does not help wrinkles. Please read rest of the reviews written before purchasing , I wish I did haha. I saw many five star reviews and bought it right away without actually reading them. It&#x27;s been few weeks and I see no difference. I guess this product has been given 5 stars because some people on here got their cream for free. Anyways if you&#x27;re looking for a wrinkle cream look somewhere else :)</li>
            <li> love that eye cream ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the outcome, got rid of the circle around my eye and leaves my skin with an elastic look.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it less stars because it moisturizes your skin around the eyes very nicely. However, after a month of use...skin does not appear to be better. I took a before and after and nothing is different...just less money in my account -_-</li>
            <li> It looks like it is working. I am trying this product since last 3 weeks and it removed considerable amount dark spots under eye and over eyelid. I was skeptical about the product and but now i am happy to see the changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely looking for some more changes and edit the review if i find it is more helpful.</li>
            <li> I must say, I have always had racoon eyes to the point where everyone always thinks that I am tired when I am not.&lt;br /&gt;I wear glasses and only where contacts when I have on makeup to hide my racoon eyes.  I have tired many products for dark circles and  I started this product 4 days ago. I use it  in the morning after I shower and use it at night.  the first day of using it, I saw a slight difference, and I have been taking pictures everyday to see the difference and it is working only after 4 days. I was so anxious to get rid of it faster that I used alot the second day,  and remembered that my doctor said when using any topical products , the best results is when a thin amount is applied. He was right.&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to right reviews but I am in love right now with this product only after 4 days which is shocking. Smells faboulous and I actually put someon the blemishes on my face which is starting to soften the appearance. Two thumbs up on this one!</li>
            <li> Really like this product. A little goes a long way. Definitely hydrates the eye area and has helped to minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Just did not do what they claimed plus was greasey.  I have tried numerous products claiming to remove dark circles and bags and this one was the worst.</li>
            <li> I received this recently and was really skeptical also.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is indeed a bit waxy, with an oily like consistency that you should leave on overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Its been a few days, and I had nowhere to go, so I&#x27;ve applied it under my eyes alot of times.&lt;br /&gt;Albeit a few days, I did notice my dark circles lighten up a bit, and I shall continue using it! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells good and does exactly what it says. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It helped with puffiness, however I have not seen wrinkle improvement. I would re order this product.</li>
            <li> Be careful, the ingredients are very pore clogging and can give pimples and milia.  I have oily skin and always use oil-free products as much as I can. I guess I fell for the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t do enough research that this product has high clore clogging ingredients.  It gave me a lot of milia in my delicate eye area and those are very hard to get rid of! Now what?  Wait it out - milia don&#x27;t just disappear so easily.</li>
            <li> It works if you use it twice a day, the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it can be a little bit more greasy than lotion, almost like Vaseline. However, 100% reduces puffy eyes and it&#x27;s right away, once before bed and once in the morning.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to reduce dark circles under my eyes. It is greasy so I can only apply it at night and on weekends but I am already seeing reduction in dark circles in only two weeks. I will definitely order this product again and recommend it to my friends as well.</li>
            <li> I have had this about 2 weeks now and really like it. I use it at night. It is greasy and goes on easily and soaks in nicely. I like that it has natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a month on my face and neck and I love the feel of my skin. Queen Bee leaves my face and neck feeling smooth and moisturized and diminishing lines around the eyes. I only use it at bedtime. I love it! Most of all it is Organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how I felt about this cream at first because of the wax-ish consistency. But being a person with VERY sensitive skin, particularly around my eyes, I&#x27;ve learned to really like this. I bought a $47 jar of eye cream a couple weeks ago, and the more I use it, the dryer my skin gets. And it burns when I put it on. So I came back to the Queen Bee. I use it all over the rest of my face too and it feels pretty good. Just can&#x27;t use too much in the morning because it takes a while to absorb and is super shiny. It&#x27;s better at night. I would consider buying again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would help induce dark under eye marks. While using this product I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it twice a day around my eyes! The difference in just a few short weeks is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am VERY impressed with this product!  It is truly a must have for anyone.  It is extremely moisturizing, it is in a jar in solid form, but once touched, it turns to oil.  I have used it on my eyes, but since allergy season is on us, my poor nose has been peeling from me blowing my nose so much.  This wonderful cream has cleared up the peeling very quickly.  I am also enjoying putting it on my lips at night, too.  I can think of many uses for it, and will definitely continue to keep this on hand at all times.  Great price, packaging, fast delivery, its all natural, paraben free, and an impressive all natural ingredient list.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago and have seen results.  It is easy to use and has lightened the area around my eyes.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought it after seeing the reviews and decided to give it a chance. I have to say, this product is not working on me. I didn&#x27;t see any change after using it for around one month. And it feel a bit oil to put around eyes...</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizing benefits of this eye cream. It&#x27;s more of a salve but if u don&#x27;t mind that greasy feel until your skin absorbs it, it&#x27;s no big deal. Smells great. My under eye area does seem brighter after about 10 days of use. I would re come d this product and am sure to use it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Queen Bee eye cream every night for the past 3 weeks and I am pleasantly surprised at the results so far.  Like many other people, I have tried various products in an attempt to reduce my dark circles, however, none seemed to make a difference even after months of use.  It also makes the skin around my eyes silky soft which is another plus.  I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to others that have been searching for help with their dark circles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  not the most pleasant cream I&#x27;ve tried: it has a thick and sort-of greasy texture. I actually use the back of my fingernail to stab at it a bit, to break it off the whole. That said, I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for a couple of months now and I do feel as if the area under my eyes and towards the ridge of my nose are lighter. My skin does feel and look better. I may update this review once I see how the jar I bought as a gift did for someone else.</li>
            <li> Im so glad i purchased this eye cream, first i love the fact that it is natural ingredients nothing else so i know exactly what im putting under my eye, its a big plus. im only 30 and i use this only at night and have noticed great difference, the texture is soft and creamy at the same time. I can see my dark circles fading away, after like 3 weeks of using it. Try it for yourself and you&#x27;ll end up loving it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it will work as other reviews had implied. it does and am glad I choose it.</li>
            <li> I found that this product was soothing and moisturizing. I&#x27;ve had problems with irritating eye creams in the past. No worries here. And it is useful for any other areas needing intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I bought this product and have been using it for approximately two months now. The product does not work very well, but moderate results can be seen after two months for myself. I have had dark circles all of my life, and frankly, I believe that how and if they are able to be fixed depends on how you&#x27;ve gotten them. I have to say that whether or not one is able to see any results also depends on the lighting. For some odd reason, in my own home when looking in the mirror, it is impossible to see any improvements. When I am looking in the mirror in a well-lit room, the improvements seem to be there, but just barely. There also appears to have been a scam involved in the reviews, with the company offering an additional free jar of the product to reviewers who gave good ratings. Shame on the company for that. Lastly, I purchased a second jar of the product only because I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better than this at the moment. Hopefully, I will not have to purchase a third. I might be able to come upon something that actually works the way it should after two months of consistent usage if I am lucky.</li>
            <li> This is very effective on my dark circles. Love it. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I put it on before going to sleep, I feel I look better waking up.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but I did not notice any improvements even when I used it consistently. Needs more Vitamin K maybe? I&#x27;ve used it regularly and I still have so much left; the stuff will last. Would not repurchase though as it did not fix much. Do not expect a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I did NOT get a free product for a review.</li>
            <li> Excellent excellent eye cream. My eyes immiadetely looked different and the black circles are starting to disappear. I absolutely recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li> As many others who have tried this, I too have purchased/used MANY different eye creams ( a small fortune&#x27;s worth) and have never been completely satisfied.  QUEEN BEE ( gotta love her busy bees ) eye cream glides on so smoothly, hydrates well, AND, although I do not have dark circles I can attest my under eye skin is BRIGHTER!&lt;br /&gt;I uses it on/around my lips and on my ear lobes!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I saw some improvement but not total disappearance. I started applying it 2-3 weeks back so its too early to say anything. May be patience is the key !</li>
            <li> The Queen Bee Eye Circle cream arrived quickly before the delivery date. It proved to be a promise keeper by doing exactly what is promised removing my black circles under my eyes and small lines that had just started to appear on the sides of my eyes. This is a small jar and the cream is yellow and feels like grease.  It looks like grease in appearance. I did not like this greasy feeling at first, but you do not need to apply a lot around your eyes.  The cream will last you for a long time until you buy another jar of Queen Bee and I know you will buy another jar. The area under my eyes also appeared smoother looking even on pictures. It truly deserves five stars.</li>
            <li> My dark circles have diminished! I use on my face as a night cream.  It is greasy but soaks into to dry skin leaving it soft with a sheen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week since using this product and I have already seen a difference. I have fine lines around my eyes and have already seen a change in hydration while using this cream.  I love that it is all organic and I love ingredients.  The consistency is also good because it doesn&#x27;t melt easily which is great for humid weather. The container is awesome, doesn&#x27;t leak, and the packaging it came in protected the product.  I will buy again.  Thank you to Queen Bee for making this eye cream!</li>
            <li> I chose this item because it was a best seller and had high ratings, but after three weeks of use there was 0 improvement in my dark circles.  The product itself was also hard to get out of the Jar, it was like trying to pick apart a wax candle.  After using it it also made my skin look and feel -really- oily.</li>
            <li> This product has reduced the puffiness and dark circles on the lower part of my eyes.  I had only 3-4 hrs of sleep and yet I don&#x27;t look as tired.  I have tried one of a men&#x27;s eye cream and it made my eyes look puffy and weird.  This really does help me and it&#x27;s very gentle being that I have sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s only been about a week now and I do see a difference.  So I believe a month from now, it&#x27;ll be even better.  Also it says so on the product that it could be used for your face as well.</li>
            <li> Heard all the reviews about dark circles being improved and was hoping this worked.  So far&lt;br /&gt;has not done anythng but will keep using for awhile to see if there is any improvement.</li>
            <li> in the beginning i wasn&#x27;t sure about it .. but i said &amp;#34;Hey why not , let me try it &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;i choose this product because  it NATURAL&lt;br /&gt;i just love it .. i can&#x27;t wait to buy my second jar &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it religiously every night for 2months+. I think it might be helping a little, but definitely won&#x27;t remove the eye bags completely. Just set your expectations reasonably.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that is helping me with my life long dark circles around my eyes. I thought that I was seeing an improvement after just 3 days, but I wasn&#x27;t sure. Now, I am sure. It&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I thought this product smelled nice, but that is the only positive I have seen with it. I am a 22 year old college student with bags under my eyes and dark circles from genetics of my family and I hoped this product would work for me but it didn&#x27;t. I thought spending more for an organic product would be more beneficial, but it just left a greasy look around my eyes, making me look even worse! I applied it twice a day, morning and night and it only made my eyes more puffy looking. I wish I could be refunded for this product because it was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> After a week of using the product I can see a difference already, dark circles under the eye line starting to show less and less. I really like how the product is all natural and will definitely keep using it. Recommend for anyone trying to eliminate shadows under the eyes w/ a natural product.</li>
            <li> Love it , working great so far!</li>
            <li> I saw zero lessening of my dark circles. Given all the positive reviews, I was definitely expecting something more effective. Very disappointed and wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all to reduce dark circles. It felt greasy going on and I started to get little white bumps under my eyes from using it.</li>
            <li> This product has the texture of vaseline, it is not a cream and does not absorb therefore you are left with a jelly like pomade under your eyes after each use which makes it complicated to add your make up after using the product.  I used the product for one week hoping it was something that might be worth using to treat the dark circles under my eyes and help with the puffiness, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> After 1 week of use, and reading all the fabulous 5 star reviews, I felt duped. I&#x27;m a surfer, &amp; the product feels like surf wax. It has done nothing for my face, except my under eye skin feels stretched with more noticable wrinkles, darker circles &amp; puffier bags. It has done nothing as it &amp;#34;claims&amp;#34;; sounds fishy. I suppose I can use Queen Bees&#x27;s surf Wax on my board vs. my face considering my feet needs moisterizer. However, I prefer a refund. No customer service exist. I will be returning this product. Customers ---Do Not Buy unless you&#x27;re looking for a Surf Wax to rub on your sensitive thin under eye area.</li>
            <li> some reviews said the product was too greasy. but to me is ok, good in the winter time. use it for half month, hope it helps.</li>
            <li> Organic, simple, effective ingredients - nothing more required to carry out a fantastic job hydrating as well as plumping the skin around the eyes (Shea Butter and Cocconut Oil have always been two of my favorites).  In addition, the Vitamin K works wonders by repairing leaky vessels causing those  unsightly dark circles.  Simple and effective!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all  didn&#x27;t work for me not recommended , will never purchase again&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money not good</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is great to use on lips as well.  I definitely noticed improvement with lines and dark circles.  Love the all natural ingredients.  I have used expensive cosmetic counter eye creams and this is just as good as all of them.  Like others have said, it is not the consistency you would expect, but it is awesome!  I use a cotton tip to put it on.</li>
            <li> This is really hard to get onto your finger to apply, its like applying a wax candle.  I think you must have to put in a warm oven before each use?  I never did scrape enough out of jar to try it,  thus the 2stars.  Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! The best part is that it contains all natural ingredients. No synthetic chemicals or fragrances. I am 45 yrs old and I have no wrinkles around my eyes. I think part of it besides good genes is the fact that I&#x27;ve been using this product. I also use it on my face as a moisturizer. Thank you for making this wonderful formula.</li>
            <li> I love this product, better to use at night because of its oily compound. Rids wrinkles at best. I am a Jamaican and the product works really well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference using this product</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> First of all, the texture is not very easy to apply. I have to sometimes use my finger nail to scrape it off to be able to apply. 2nd, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well. It will remain shiny for a long time without absorbing and feel kind of heavy. Doesn&#x27;t really see a different....</li>
            <li> After using this product for several monthes, I see no change in my dark circles. I would not tell any of my friends to buy this. It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefit for what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Gave to a friend, didn&#x27;t like it and saw no benefit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now. My friend said she can see a difference on the shadows under my eyes. I recommend anyone who have dark circles under the eyes, this works well when using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> delivered quickly, did not remove circles</li>
            <li> Volume is huge, it will last for years.</li>
            <li> An overall nice, natural product.  I use it occasionally on my entire face.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream, but does not do well for me under makeup, I just use at night.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement, the cream is quite oily, I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if the effects take longer (I have quite dark circles) took two months of use / No he visto ninguna mejora, la crema es bastante aceitosa, voy a darle un poco mas de tiempo a ver si los efectos tardan más (Tengo bastantes ojeras) llevo dos meses de uso.</li>
            <li> This product did not remove my dark circles, however it did lighten them and I notice a BIG difference with the coverage of my foundation. (I don&#x27;t like a lot of makeup, and after using this product for about a week I required minium coverage to hide the flawed areas...very minium) my skin also has a lighter glow( I&#x27;m also drinking aloe juice once daily). I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, terrible for lightening dark spots, it DOES NOT LIGHTEN DARK CIRCLES.</li>
            <li> I used this a few times. Didnt really seem like it helped me much.</li>
            <li> I love that is is all natural and is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t do the job like other, non natural eye creams would. It seems to clog my pores too and cause milia around my eye.</li>
            <li> did not work as advertised</li>
            <li> Excellent for night and day use! Works for my oily skin too!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the raving reviews given by some purchasers.  However, I am quite disappointed as it did absolutely NOTHING for under eyes dark circle.  The one advantage is it moisturizing properties.  It leaves my skin very soft and is quite light in application. I think its much too pricey though and would recommend it only as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After applying this product under my eyes each night at bedtime for the last week or two, I have already noticed a significant improvement on the dark circles under my eyes! I use it under my eyes to soften the circles before I use my makeup and use it all over my face at night to rejuvenate the skin. In a short amount of time, it has made my face feel like satin to the touch. I&#x27;ve had dark circles all my life and tried everything you can think of but nothing worked until I found this product. My skin has never looked or felt better! Seeing and using this product is believing. I will definitely keep buying this and recomend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me on top of that I got an allergic reaction. I believe some of the reviews are fabricated!</li>
            <li> I use the product for around the eye area and and even other areas of the face.  Queen Bee makes the lines and dark circles less visible.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product I was skeptical about whether it would react with my facial skin.  After four months of almost daily use I am a very satisfied customer.  My skin feels &amp; looks softer and the product has never caused any skin reaction - a testament to its all natural composition.  I highly recommend this product for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream, and frankly works fantastically well as a hand cream too. I don&#x27;t know about dark circles - I had already taken care of that with 5000 units per day of vitamin D - but it is an awesome moisturizer that keeps my eye area looking great all day. It goes on a little greasy looking, but let it absorb for a few minutes, put on makeup and you&#x27;re good to go. It is soothing, clean scented and natural. I love this cream! Some reviews called it waxy - I don&#x27;t get that, because as soon as it touched the warmth of my skin it dissolved into a liquid state. A little goes a long way. Probably last about a year if you use it just on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Too greasy.  Can only use in the winter.</li>
            <li> No results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;save your money</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it as a face moisturizer. a bit oily feeling but that goes away pretty quick.  I have sensitive skin and it can be dry. This helps with both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product about 2 weeks and I really like it.  I can already see the hydration and softening of my fine lines under my eyes and forehead.. I apply it morning and night and wait about an hour before I put on my makeup, so it soaks in my skin and my makeup goes on smoothly. I have small dark circles and puffiness under my eyes which are starting to appear lighter.</li>
            <li> so far im please with the product,i just wish it was a bigger jar for the price,the jar is small,but other than that,it came early and the package was good,&amp;it smells good!</li>
            <li> Love this I am 51 and 2  years ago had pnemonia that left me with very dark circles. I am very light skin and ultra sensitive. The circles have lighten and this has not caused a reaction on my skin. Only 1/4 through the bottle can&#x27;t wait til its empty to see the total effect</li>
            <li> I had went in for a facial this year as a gift i received and explained how sensitive my skin but as usual I woke up with the worst allergic reaction under my eyes! It looked horrible they were swollen, red, and dark like i got punched in the eye and haven&#x27;t slept in days. Needless to say I had to go to a dermatologist and every cream they gave me irritated my skin. Being only 23 years old I was becoming very insecure of how my eyes looked and only felt secure with makeup on which I generally don&#x27;t like to wear as much. Having a bunch of allergy tests done I was allergic to propylene glycol which is in a lot of creams and makeup and was only the situation much worse. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS INGREDIENT in anything to you are putting on your face especially if your skin is very sensitive like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing my research I came across Queen Bee eye cream and am extremely satisfied! I wear it every night and every morning and saw a difference within the first week. It is extremely hydrating and does not irritate the skin with no harsh smell. I no longer have red puffy skin and no dark circles. I did also start taking solaray vitamin k pills daily and I feel this has helped as well (being that vitamin k helps with blood circulation). Working in the beauty industry I&#x27;ve seen the most expensive and exclusive eye creams but only trust this product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a result yet</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any improvements from this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with eye bags from not sleeping well. And let me tell you it works SO WELL! I started putting it on my whole face and I got so many compliments on my skin. People telling me I looked refreshed and younger. Please give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it! Also it is waxy but it didn&#x27;t not break me out or clog pores!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using this wrong. Haha I have hereditary dark circles (I&#x27;m African American so they&#x27;re DARK brown/purplish) so I got this product to get rid of them. Well they didn&#x27;t go away. Still no difference after several months of daily use BUT since  it does say you can apply it all over your face, So I did and now my skin stays moisturized throughout the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll continue to use it as a moisturizer but I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again after I finish it because there are moisturizers out there that work fine for less than half the price of this.</li>
            <li> I bought it for dark circles, but haven&#x27;t used it often enough to comment on progress, but this cream is just so mild, body friendly and pleasant on so many levels that I just love it. It would probably make a great gift. It&#x27;s so rare you can stumble upon something this neutral, mild and gentle when you are sensitive to pretty much EVERYTHING including all-natural/organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason for 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t noticed any immediate reduction in dark circles, but nothing can fix that overnight.</li>
            <li> When I first found out about Queen Bee Eye Cream, I was searching for an all natural cream to get rid of my dark circles and improve the skin under my eyes reversing the age. Upon receiving the package the smell was so light and wonderfull , the cream was very soft and easy to apply. He smell reminded me of baked cookies and the texture was smooth enough to pat all over my face. I loved that Queen Bee isn’t only utilized for eyes but also for wrinkles. The fact that it had so much uses really made me grow to love the product more.  Unlike most creams this has no chemicals and I like knowing that what I am putting on my skin is all naturally made. I found that Queen Bee not only diminished my dark circles and kept my skin glowing and firm, but it also helped me sleep, having insomnia I often find trouble going to bed, after applying this eye cream it helped me want to close my eyes and head right off. The psychological thought that the eye cream also will absorb into my skin faster and with the help of sleep it would be a great combination. I loved everything about this cream and will continue to purchase it. Thank you so much to the Queen Bee team ,and for this great creation!</li>
            <li> I am African American, and have suffered from dark under eye circles for years. Tried this product after reading the great reviews. I used it consistently for weeks until the product was used in its entirety. It did not nothing but made my skin super greasy, which I don&#x27;t need. My skin is oily on a normal basis. I think I should try the over the counter as oppose to this product</li>
            <li> Just a few words about the seller &amp; product: These people are amazingly polite, prompt  &amp; professional!  As for the QUEEN BEE 100% ALL-NATURAL, my girlfriend says she will never use anything else!  She says the difference she sees not just under the eyes but the entire face is like night &amp; day.</li>
            <li> Great all-natural eye bag cream. I usually purchase a product from Origins for a lot more $$ with results not lasting all day. I rubbed it between my fingers to melt it a bit before applying to my face and after 10min felt and saw a tightness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 42 yrs. old and after my 30&#x27;s my eye bags were significant to the point co-workers @ my clinic was saying I looked stressed out and tired looking. I have paid up to $400 for Thermage CT @ Spa but this cream gives me the same results only $ .  Thank you for helping me to look as young as I feel in my 20&#x27;s :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and within three days could see a major reduction in the darkness under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products and methods (like cucumber slices) to get the dark bags under my eyes to go away but the results have been average at best and I usually gave up after a few weeks of little to no results.  With Queen Bee, I started seeing some results almost immediately and major improvements after only 3 days!  Definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dark bags under their eyes.  My wife just used it last night on her face for wrinkles as well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes.  This keeps the under-eye area moist without irritating my eyes.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any amazing color or wrinkle reduction, but it works well as moisturizer for sensitive skin/eyes.</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. it leaves your skin soft. I use it twice a day and I&#x27;m happy with the results so far. its one of my favorite. skin products.</li>
            <li> This product worked as described.  It helped to clear up my eyes and keep them that way.  With repeated use after a month or so, I no longer have issues with the way I look.</li>
            <li> Not all the reviews said it was.</li>
            <li> I do not have dark circles, so cannot tell if this cream works for that. I have been looking for all natural under eye cream for quite some time. This one is perfect, it stays longer and protects the skin from dryness. I am quite happy I found this one!</li>
            <li> I love this cream and it&#x27;s excellent for sensitive eyes like mine. I have very dark genetic under eye circles, I think this cream did help with those a little but the biggest improvement was the skin quality around my eyes. No dryness or wrinkles whatsoever. And it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but didn&#x27;t seem to actually do anything. Also, was very thick and greasy on my skin. Couldn&#x27;t be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT do anything on dark circles!! After a full month of applying it twice a day, no improvement whatsoever. Total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This is a great cream. It feels so nice on my skin. Leaves my skin looking radiant and soft. It&#x27;s too early to talk about long lasting effects, but it definitely does something good to my skin. And yes, very little goes a long way in one application.  Will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Can not read the ingredients inside the product! They get you to GIVE THEM A GREAT  REVIEW by BRIBING you with a FREE BOTTLE of this CANDLE WAX type of I do not know what? I used it for a few days and saw no difference and tossed them into the garbage... If you have already purchased it please do the same.... If you have not purchased please select a brand that is not afraid to print in bold letters what is inside their products. I give this a double negative five!!!&lt;br /&gt;They should be forced to return all the customers their monies and dropped from Amazons Website!</li>
            <li> So I bought this product mainly because of the natural ingredients in it, along with the surprisingly high reviews it got. I am not one to have harsh criticism on products, but I must admit that this eye cream is very exaggerated in terms of its results. First of all it&#x27;s texture is like a lip balm, and I guess if I had anything good to say about it ... It would perhaps be that it&#x27;s hydrating, that&#x27;s about it. Coconut oil would probably give the same results; which honestly I would rather use. My skin is not sensitive and barely ever reacts, but this product clogged my pores big time.</li>
            <li> DIDNT DO ANYTHING! I&#x27;ve suffered with dark circles my entire life. This felt like I was just putting oil under my eye . Coconut oil by itself did more than this.. It didn&#x27;t even get rid of wrinkles or fine lines.. My eyes still look dark and dehydrated ! There&#x27;s really nothing out there I&#x27;ve tried it all. Coconut oil is the closest to a decent improvement .</li>
            <li> product really works!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. It is heavy but I like it, because of this feature, it mixes great with makeup foundation, making under-eye wrinkles less visible throughout the entire day. Even though your under-eye may look a little shiny for the first hour, it will not dry out like other eye creams, which makes our wrinkles more apparent . If you are using eye shadow, just use matting primer on your eye lids.</li>
            <li> I only been using it for 1 week and already see results,,I had a very dark circle in the eyes area and the change its amazing,,,</li>
            <li> I use it on my entire face and neck at bedtime.  My complexion has never been clearer.  I get compliments!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark circles about a week ago and so far not good, but for my mom, it has helped her a lot for her wrinkles, she says she likes it a lot. i am still trying the product hopefully it goes well in a few weeks. i guess its focused more on wrinkles than dark circles/</li>
            <li> This cream works!  I&#x27;m dark skinned, and I have under eye darkness that ages me. I&#x27;ve purchased so many eye creams over the past 2 years: expensive creams like Peter Thomas Roth burned when applied; the Clinique product didn&#x27;t do anything for me; and the Genefique product didn&#x27;t work for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Queen Bee product, I saw results within the first two weeks!  It has lightened my under eye area. My dark circles aren&#x27;t completely gone, but noticeably different. I&#x27;ve actually left the house without concealer, which I would not do before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is great and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my under eye area. I haven&#x27;t been diligent in putting it on at night, but I do apply every morning.  Based on the texture of the product, you don&#x27;t need a lot, and I think I can get at least a year&#x27;s worth of application out of this jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend, and it is a great value.</li>
            <li> Works really well...love it!</li>
            <li> used it for over a month and did not see any improvements.  puffiness and dark circles are still the same.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for eyelash growth.  I&#x27;ve been using it along with rapidlash for the past month or so and my eyelashes are definitely fuller and longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as wrinkles and dark circles...  I&#x27;m not really sure if I see a difference.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.... it doesn&#x27;t really fix the darkness under the eye but it does make your skin&lt;br /&gt;soft and glowing.....</li>
            <li> I like this product and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in dark circles at all. I do like that it hydrates my under eyes but it can look greasy. So I only use this at night. I wouldn&#x27;t say it work miracles. It&#x27;s just something I can use to hydrate under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except it just didn&#x27;t work. Yet another disappointing eye cream claiming to improve dark circles and not actually working.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream.  Goes on smooth and keep eyes hydrated. I have used many eye creams, and this product is a great value and it works!!! I feel like I don&#x27;t have the dryness that I did before using it.  It doesn&#x27;t sting either like other eye creams I&#x27;ve used, and I I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye products and this one I have been very pleased with results.  It moisturizes the sensitive, delicate eye area and reduces typical wrinkling.  It keeps the area hydrated and protected.  For age related facial / eye issues I enjoy the result and noticeable reduction in significant problems that can occur around the eye area!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I&#x27;m very, very happy with the result. I highly recommend it! You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 months. It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve noticed some decrease in dark circles around my eye. It is noticeable and I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d try other cheaper products that have the same effect as this one.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend swears by this product!  She has very dark circles under the eyes and after using Queen Bee for a week or so, she (and I) noticed a dramatic improvement in color and tone, and none of that shiny effect you get with other products.</li>
            <li> After all of the great reviews I was excited to try this product, needless to say I was disappointed. It&#x27;s pretty thick and greasy and does not soak into my skin. I wake up in the morning with grease stains on my pillow from it wiping off in the night and the rest still smeared all over my face. In the morning when I tried putting it on once again it did not soak into my skin so my makeup looked horrible. I will not buy this product again and would not recommend it to anyone. I gave it 2⃣ stars because it had a pleasant smell and that&#x27;s about the only thing I enjoyed about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sleep nearly as many hours as I should, and I struggle with waking in the middle of the night.  As a result, I often see bags under my eyes in the morning.  I started using Queen Bee before I went to bed, and after a couple nights I saw a significant improvement.  I then started using it twice a day, and definitely feel better about my under eye appearance.  I know not everyone has the same level of improvement, but I really love what it&#x27;s done for me.</li>
            <li> I like the extra creaminess of this product.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product long enough to see the full potential of it, but so far so good. I love the smell and it goes on smooth. A little goes a long way! I feel like there may be a slight change in the way my under eyes look. A little smoother and less dark. Overall I recommend this product and will continue using to see the full affects.</li>
            <li> I had a smooth and super FAST! shipping with this company, and their product so far is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I am African American and I have always had dark circles around my eyes from since I can remember. I have just started using it but I love the way it makes my under my eye feels and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, will definitely repurchase again.</li>
