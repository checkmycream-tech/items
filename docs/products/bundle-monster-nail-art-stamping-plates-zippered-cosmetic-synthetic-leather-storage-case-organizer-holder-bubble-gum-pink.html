            <li>I love it, when my collect of stamping plates grows I will be ordering this again!</li>
            <li>perfect, it is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This is a must if you have a nail plate collection, but they are also handy for storing nail stickers/decals.</li>

            <li>Perfect for all my new plates!</li>
            <li>Love being able to sort and store my stamp plates easily and really love the color of this case!</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I tossed it at my brother once and it freaked him out when he had to use more muscle than he thought he needed to pick it up.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The case itself is a synthetic leather which is strong but really pretty :) I love this case!</li>
            <li>I have many different brands of plates in my organizer and all fit great.</li>
            <li>You can fit two plates per square, and showcase all of your plates for easy access and use.</li>
            <li>There is no reason why anyone should not buy this to hold their plates, unless your plates don&#x27;t fit it.</li>
            <li>Most sticker sheets you buy will fit into the slots, and you can trim up the ones that are too large to make them fit.</li>
            <li>Just as described and keeps all my plates clean and organized.  </li>
            <li>Was super excited</li>
            <li>Extremely happy with the pink Bundle Monster nail stamping case.</li>
            <li>The binder gets really heavy when you fill it up with your plates, but I love surprising people with it.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Most of them I have back to back, so I can fit more in.</li>
            <li>Only thing to make this better would have been to have pockets on both sides of the page...like a CD case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very neat way to organize your image plates.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the perfect case to hold all of your small round plates.</li>
            <li>but I like the Black Bundle Monster Zipper Case better.</li>
            <li>I have about seventy image plates, more or less.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this organizer if you don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if the case included some pages with larger pockets to store the slightly larger wheels as well as the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>The vinyl like inserts are heavy duty not thin material that can easily wear out or tear.</li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints and would recommend this to others!</li>
            <li>It fit three of my sets with a few to spare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased directly from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li>I have a few pages left for one more set of image plates too.</li>
            <li>The pages are durable and the outside is a pretty textured pink.</li>
            <li>This is a great little case for the money but keep in mind that it will only hold the small round wheels similar to Konad&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> I like this this but I like the Black Bundle Monster Zipper Case better. I have both now. The next time if I order I will get the Black one. I like it.</li>
            <li> awesome product good construction beautiful case</li>
            <li> Came in EXCELLENT condition! Extremely happy with the pink Bundle Monster nail stamping case. It fit three of my sets with a few to spare. Im ordering another one because I expanded my stamping set collection. There was nothing wrong with it, took awhile to get here- but it was worth the wait. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have many different brands of plates in my organizer and all fit great. I have both round and square plates in mine. Most of them I have back to back, so I can fit more in. I&#x27;ve owned this book a year now and do my nails almost daily and it&#x27;s holding up great!</li>
            <li> I love this case! The color matches what is shown in the picture and it has plenty of room for all of my disks. So far I have no complaints and would recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> Love the color. Was super excited However when I got my plates,  they are way bigger than the slots in the case.</li>

            <li> This is the perfect case to hold all of your small round plates. I store BM, Gals, and MASH in mine. The zipper is heavy-duty as is the case. Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased directly from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> perfect, it is exactly what I was looking for.  All my discs fit in the envelopes perfectly.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This is a great little case for the money but keep in mind that it will only hold the small round wheels similar to Konad&#x27;s. If the wheels are any larger at all they will not fit in the plastic pockets. It would have been nice if the case included some pages with larger pockets to store the slightly larger wheels as well as the smaller ones. But other than that, it&#x27;s a nifty little case to store your nail stamping wheels.</li>
