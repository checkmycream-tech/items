            <li> Purchased for my aunt. She absolutely loves this fragrance. Will order again when she runs out!!</li>
            <li> It was for my aunt &amp; she loved it. Love it but I wish I didn&#x27;t have to write these long reviews. I still need 7 words yikes, double yikes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought I&#x27;d like this more? I should know that ordering a fragrance without smelling it doesn&#x27;t work for me! It&#x27;s a good size and the value was fine getting the spray and lotion but honestly, I&#x27;m not that excited about this scent.</li>
            <li> muy  buen estuche , excelente  para obsequio</li>
            <li> What I said in my review about the Diamonds and Emeralds applies for this one as well. For 20 dollars, It&#x27;s a good smelling set that comes with some pretty good size bottles that will last a while. Worth paying for again if the person I bought it for wanted another.</li>
            <li> estoy muy contenta con mi compra, recomiendo al vendedor... el envio fue rapido y me enviaron exactamente lo que compre</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother as a Christmas gift. She sprayed it as soon as she opened it and I loved the smell. It stayed in the room for a while which shows the products worth. Great for its price.</li>
