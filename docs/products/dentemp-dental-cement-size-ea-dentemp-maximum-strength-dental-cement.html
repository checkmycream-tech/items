    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They say not to drink anything for an hour, which I turned into three: another poster had an excellent idea about doing it before you go to bed.</li>
            <li>I followed the preparation and application directions flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>great-</li>
            <li>The results are amazing!</li>
            <li>The best measurement is the 8+ repairs but that&#x27;s easy to miss.</li>
            <li>Best price  available at the time.</li>
            <li>surprisingly, the web address   on the pkg is no longer operational.</li>
            <li>Yet again, a company has cheapened the product to the point of making ituseless,   while living off the good name they HAD been known</li>
            <li>When they have a good product, why do they have to cheapen it and RUIN it?    </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product I threw it in the BOB</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually pretty awesome after it dries.</li>
            <li>for 2 weeks- when the doc and my own schedule aligned.   </li>
            <li>(I did, and some of it did start crumbling apart) and give it a good chance to set, and you&#x27;ll have a pretty good temporary fix :-).</li>
            <li>You might have better luck using softened paraffin.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got about 4 more applications out of it.</li>
            <li>the pain&#x27;s mostly vanished for the time being, so it&#x27;s probably from the cavity.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s stickier, holds longer and bonds to the tooth MUCH better.</li>
            <li>and they said it was okay to use on all dental appliances.  </li>
            <li>It would be more like four to five</li>
            <li>and it NEVER lasted more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Is it outstanding?</li>
            <li>The concept is good and with the right product you can protect your tooth until you can get to a dentist.</li>
            <li>They realize they had a great product and decided to use the name   and reputation they&#x27;d built to now sell their new inferior formulation while making   sure they were not reachable for those who would take the time to register dissatsifying   experiences.      </li>
            <li>, I had better luck using Super glue!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the selection and good prices.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get the bridge to fit again with this inside.  </li>
            <li>I eat and brush afterwards and have experienced no subsequent problems.</li>
            <li>The upshot was that I should try the dentemp (and get a script from my primary in case of infection).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked in his office, been trained in the most basic dental work and used my fair share of \\&quot;temp\\&quot; dental fix products.</li>
            <li>After one aborted attempt, I successfully made the repair and it has been several weeks since I re-cemented the cap.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the product so very much!</li>
            <li>When I finally got to the dentist on Monday, I was still very comfortable (as though I had no issues at all!)</li>
            <li>Guess I feel a bit ticked off after thinking the new product would be as good as the old   and thereby making my dental appt.</li>
            <li>Buy the dentemp, Put it in right after rinsing your mouth with warm water, rinse after, rub the excess off with your WET finger,  and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hassle of contacting the company may/may not be worth it if FOUR caps of the product from (1) Walmart, (2) Two from Food Lion and (3)</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind on the shelf at my local drug store.  </li>
            <li>The 1 star reviewers are most likely using the new product   while the 5 stars were fortunate to have gotten the last of the good stuff that they no longer make.</li>
            <li>It looks like there&#x27;s a lot of 5s and 1s for these reviews, and that&#x27;s because both sides are right.</li>
            <li>After an hour the cap came right off.  </li>
            <li>I got home and put in on my tooth right away.</li>
            <li>I would still be in tears right now, if it wasn&#x27;t for Dentemp.</li>
            <li>I was worried the new pain was the putty somehow expanding, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like that&#x27;s the case and</li>
            <li>I imagine a full cap would use far far more of it than spackling a hole.    </li>
            <li>I found the product to be very strong and only wore away very gradually over time.</li>
            <li>It was drier than the first.</li>
            <li>I first found dentek at cvs and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and can only guess that some of the negative reviews on the product are either people that can not follow instructions or dental professionals with amazon accounts, LOL.</li>
            <li>The first time, the repair lasted 20 minutes, then fell off.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY.  </li>
            <li>I doubt if one person in ten could tell you how many grams there are in an ounce.</li>
            <li>At first it kept things under control... until I tried to eat and drink.</li>
            <li>I tried the Dentemp first</li>
            <li>The Dentrek doesn&#x27;t last more than a day in the front tooth</li>
            <li>, It lasts long when you follow directions the right way.  ,better  this way</li>
            <li>This is an embarrassing subject but because I know that many people are looking for help with temporary fix to cavities until they can afford to see a dentist, I feel it&#x27;s important to share my experience.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to say that I just read through all the reviews, and I really think both sides are right on the money.</li>
            <li>the new American fraud that so many companies perpetrate against their formerly   loyal clientelle.  </li>
            <li>But, after following the directions to the T, my tooth is temporarily fixed, I was able to eat and no chunk almost falling out (PHEW!).</li>
            <li>so I used another small drop and was good for another 3 days.  </li>
            <li>It tastes ok, but it was almost too dry to even scoop out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, what was once a great product is no longer worth your money at all.      </li>
            <li>But I must say it gave me absolute relief for the weeks</li>
            <li>I have filled it 3 times since because I have not saved enough for the dentist yet.</li>
            <li>So if your your like me and dont have the 200 - 300 dollars to go straight to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>(When fresh it used to last about 2 weeks, just enough time to be able to   set up a dental appt at a time both you and the dentist could manage.)    </li>
            <li>The product has performed much better than I expected however, I think the size of the package is somewhat deceptive.</li>
            <li>My whole jaw on that side, my cheekbone, my ear...</li>
            <li>it was too much.</li>
            <li>It sounds promising until  </li>
            <li>Also, the filling material is much softer than I feel like it should be.</li>
            <li>Save your money, buy the cheap store brands, they are no better, but no worse either   and are generally less costly and more easily available....  or better yet, unless you can reapply this stuff 3 times or more daily, beg your dentist   for an emergency appointment, then hope you aren&#x27;t charged extra for having to be squeezed in   or for having your doc put in some extra hours for your emergency.    </li>
            <li>I was able to eat and drink all the things I normally eat and drink over the rest of the weekend, albeit, carefully.</li>
            <li>So I tried it again and wore my mouth guard to make sure that I did not bite down on the repaired tooth.  </li>
            <li>so I do have to refill it every morning; however, I also used it on a tooth with a typical cavity (on top of the tooth) and it&#x27;s been there for 5 days and is still holding up.</li>
            <li>Even the most minimal action of making a ball (per directions) to apply this to the tooth made the product drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the cause, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how else to be proactive about it when a dentist is too expensive.)</li>
            <li>The detractors are right, it feels cheap and doesn&#x27;t want to apply, but if you can wrestle it and wait a few hours</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve been able to find, it gradually wears away and sometimes the whole chunk comes loose if the contact is loosened enough.</li>
            <li>The product I bought reminded me a lot of the putty people use to fill holes in walls, kinda sticky and pliable but also had to work fast as it seemed to dry out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, follow the directions completely, work fast</li>
            <li>No wonder America is failing economically and the American name   no longer represents quality.     </li>
            <li>I usually have to reapply it within a week or 2 at the most.  </li>
            <li>so if you put it on a dry tooth it will crumble out right away.</li>
            <li>The NEW product however, is NOT the same as the older product.    </li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t kept the old pkg, I wouldn&#x27;t know   WHY this stuff no longer works, but having the two ingredient lists side by side,   </li>
            <li>Not enough time to get in to a dentist for a real repair.  </li>
            <li>I was in so much pain last night and was awake every hour!</li>
            <li>There was immediate pain relief and after about 15 minutes, the pain was completely gone.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve fufilled your legal obligation but not your moral one.</li>
            <li>Some carry the old formulation on the listing, some not, but whether   or not you&#x27;ll actually GET the older product is anyone&#x27;s guess)  </li>
            <li>By the next day I was feeling totally back to normal, and could even chew on that side again though I didn&#x27;t want to chance it much.</li>
            <li>The texture of the putty is so dry that I assumed I had grabbed a really old one at first, and it&#x27;s very hard to apply as it doesn&#x27;t want to stick...particularly irksome when dealing with a top tooth like me, gravity is not your friend.</li>
            <li>As a short lived fix, I think it&#x27;s a very cheap way to get a few extra days to weeks to save up for a dentist (while looking for that new job and medical.)</li>
            <li>I also realized that despite being a tiny amount of putty that made me feel jipped at first, it went a long way for me</li>
            <li>it dried relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Digging down to the bottom of the miniscule little container I found some putty that was almost moist and was able to fashion a bit of a repair.</li>
            <li>clearly shows that the polymer, which was the 1st ingredient is now among the last.    </li>
            <li>What a colossal waste of money.</li>
            <li>The people who said this product is a waste of time and money are right.  </li>
            <li>Even a dentist has to place these types of filling with extra care because they are so hard to keep filled.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was just old, but the next three were the same way - brittle, crumbling etc.</li>
            <li>Heck yeah!&lt;br /&gt;I had cracked a tooth a few weeks ago and today I noticed a chunk of my tooth (possibly filling) was starting to get super loose and almost fell out.</li>
            <li>I tried this product on a simple loose cap despite many poor reviews.  </li>

            <li> By the next day I was feeling totally back to normal, and could even chew on that side again though I didn&#x27;t want to chance it much.</li>
            <li> The texture of the putty is so dry that I assumed I had grabbed a really old one at first, and it&#x27;s very hard to apply as it doesn&#x27;t want to stick...particularly irksome when dealing with a top tooth like me, gravity is not your friend.</li>
            <li> As a short lived fix, I think it&#x27;s a very cheap way to get a few extra days to weeks to save up for a dentist (while looking for that new job and medical.)</li>
            <li> I also realized that despite being a tiny amount of putty that made me feel jipped at first, it went a long way for me</li>
            <li> it dried relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Digging down to the bottom of the miniscule little container I found some putty that was almost moist and was able to fashion a bit of a repair.</li>
            <li> clearly shows that the polymer, which was the 1st ingredient is now among the last.    </li>
            <li> What a colossal waste of money.</li>
            <li> The people who said this product is a waste of time and money are right.  </li>
            <li> Even a dentist has to place these types of filling with extra care because they are so hard to keep filled.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just old, but the next three were the same way - brittle, crumbling etc.</li>
            <li> Heck yeah!&lt;br /&gt;I had cracked a tooth a few weeks ago and today I noticed a chunk of my tooth (possibly filling) was starting to get super loose and almost fell out.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a simple loose cap despite many poor reviews.  </li>
            <li> takes* and stays on long enough to create a barrier to protect the tooth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last long though.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 2 stars was because I realize that the type of cavity I needed to fill is not likely to hold any temporary filling for long.</li>
            <li> AND while disabling their   customer service so you are completely \\&quot;had\\&quot; by a legal con game.  </li>
            <li> This new formulation is as HORRIBLE as the former product was GOOD,   even though the name hasn&#x27;t changed, nor is there any indication that   there has been a change.  </li>
            <li> Personally I was still trying to think of other solutions until a few hours later, when I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the product may work on molars, but I was trying to fill a small whole on the side on my tooth from where my partial deteriorated the tooth.</li>
            <li> I know I haven&#x27;t had it on long,</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter how careful I was, once the pain started there was no going back.</li>
            <li> put some on a piece of paper to see how long it took to set up.  </li>
            <li> This stuff will work for a temporary filling as long as it is not on the sides of the tooth.  </li>
            <li> Its harder to get it to stick to upper teeth.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully and tried several times.</li>
            <li> I went back out and got the product from two other stores in case</li>
            <li> CVS were all equally dry and inadequate.</li>
            <li> The cap stayed on for 3 days then came loose</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to loose a chunk of my tooth, so went looking for a temporary fix til I could get an appointment set up with a dentist.</li>
            <li> This product may not work for everyone depending on what the issue with your teeth is, and I can see how some others would say that it&#x27;s a waste of money which may be due to whatever their dental problem is or they may not have installed the product properly even though they thought they were following the instructions.    </li>
            <li> While my cavity wasn&#x27;t causing pain from pressure, it did from hot and cold food and liquid, and this fix made that disappear completely.</li>
            <li> Relating to a previous reviewer, the product I got had the polymer as the last ingredient.    </li>
            <li> The container is small for the price, and even more disappointing when you open it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not understanding why there are so many bad reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> Stating the amount in the container in grams is not a reasonable way to describe the amount of product you receive.</li>
            <li> One problem with this product is that the material is very thick, which might make it useful for filling holes, but makes it nearly useless as a cement, since it is impossible to spread in a layer thin enough to result in a comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li> However, I was only trying to fill a hole, a small one on a back molar, and I had to change my opinion a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out, definitely wait AT LEAST one hour before eating anything,</li>
            <li> $5 bucks down the drain.  </li>
            <li> When I went down to Walgreen&#x27;s to find it, I found Dentemp O.S. instead and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I was sleep after I bit down on a napkin for 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Just bought this to hold a loose crown and it is completely and utterly useless.</li>
            <li> Regardless, if you have some problems with your teeth and cannot make it to the dentist any time soon, this stuff is worth a try as for $5 or less, you cannot go wrong, and you may find that this product works temporary wonders for any problems that you may have with your teeth!</li>
            <li> It lasted less than one minute.</li>
            <li> I tried both the thin and thick application (it doesn&#x27;t take much and</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mess with it with your tongue</li>
            <li> In a little while I couldn&#x27;t even feel that little remnant of pain.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it twice and it crumbles out within a few hours.</li>
            <li> Of course there were no available dentist</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time buying this product as it does not do what it claims.  </li>
            <li> The bonding recently fell out which exposed a thin front tooth &amp; cavity.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t re-use the waste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> There is always a small amount of waste when you make a repair like this</li>
            <li> It is outrageously expensive, too, for the tiny amount you receive.  </li>
            <li> I would say you are better off using nothing at all than trying this crap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive and makeshift to try and skip the dentist entirely.</li>
            <li> As I was not able to make it to the dentist any time soon, I looked around for a temporary solution and found Dentemp OS.    </li>
            <li> So perhaps the reason I was not able to use this product is because of the placement.</li>
            <li> I finally just threw it away, since pushing the solution into my cavity was uncomfortable and pointless if it was going to fall out almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This stuff to thick  to be used inside small crowns</li>
            <li> Did not work, dry and sadly those who would order need it.</li>
            <li> Not that hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> so I used it   and it lasted about 8 days which wasn&#x27;t bad for 18 month old product.   </li>
            <li> I actually bought this product at walgreens because I was desperate after my bridge came out</li>
            <li> It was also quite painful on my sensitive teeth where the bridge was fitted.  </li>
            <li> (The instructions say do not eat for at least 1 hour.)    </li>
            <li> When I got the dentemp I made a small ball of it between my fingers (think silly putty) and stuck it in the hole, pressed and then bit down.</li>
            <li> I put a very small drop in my cap to try it.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it is very difficult for a cavity on the side of a tooth, especially the front tooth, to hold a filling.</li>
            <li> Seriously, there is no use for this product than to steal your money, and frustrate the hell out of you.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble applying this product, I thought I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> : mess around with it until 5am, until you&#x27;re so frustrated that you don&#x27;t care about the missing filling anymore.</li>
            <li> Enamel is not supposed to be a 1/4\\&quot; thick!) and had no luck with either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adding moisture to the putty made it worse.</li>
            <li> Handling it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I tried it to fix my broken molar.  </li>
            <li> I got it home and the putty is dry, worthless and crumbling.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some grief and a little money and use something else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is useless.  </li>
            <li> sorry it held for the hours</li>
            <li> hope all the people connected to this product get incurable toothaches!  </li>
            <li> I even kept pressure on for an hour (very uncomfortable).  </li>
            <li> Another problem is that the package does not have any pull date, so it is impossible to know whether the product has deteriorated to the point of unusability.</li>
            <li> I happened upon a bad case at the one store.</li>
            <li> Every time I ate food it would pack in and push the teeth apart, very painful.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>

            <li> This product does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve tried it twice and it crumbles out within a few hours. It is outrageously expensive, too, for the tiny amount you receive.  Please don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product at walgreens because I was desperate after my bridge came out and I couldn&#x27;t get the dentist&#x27;s office to call back.  It tastes ok, but it was almost too dry to even scoop out of the bottle.  Once I get it in the bridge it was not at all pliable.  I couldn&#x27;t even get the bridge to fit again with this inside.  It was also quite painful on my sensitive teeth where the bridge was fitted.  I would say you are better off using nothing at all than trying this crap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55, raised as the daughter of a dentist. I&#x27;ve worked in his office, been trained in the most basic dental work and used my fair share of \\&quot;temp\\&quot; dental fix products. DON&#x27;T buy DENTEMP. I recently chipped a cusp off of a tooth and bought this at my local grocery store. I got it home and the putty is dry, worthless and crumbling. I thought maybe it was just old, but the next three were the same way - brittle, crumbling etc. Adding moisture to the putty made it worse. Handling it made it worse. Even the most minimal action of making a ball (per directions) to apply this to the tooth made the product drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digging down to the bottom of the miniscule little container I found some putty that was almost moist and was able to fashion a bit of a repair. It lasted less than one minute. I got a second container. It was drier than the first. I went back out and got the product from two other stores in case I happened upon a bad case at the one store. Nope. All the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a second piece on the tooth and am hoping it *takes* and stays on long enough to create a barrier to protect the tooth. I tried both the thin and thick application (it doesn&#x27;t take much and it&#x27;s not supposed to - three paper sheets thickness is all you need. Enamel is not supposed to be a 1/4\\&quot; thick!) and had no luck with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hassle of contacting the company may/may not be worth it if FOUR caps of the product from (1) Walmart, (2) Two from Food Lion and (3) CVS were all equally dry and inadequate. The concept is good and with the right product you can protect your tooth until you can get to a dentist. But THIS in not that product.</li>
            <li> The stuff crumbles and falls out within a very short time.  You might have better luck using softened paraffin.  What a colossal waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have a molar with a hole on the front side corner. Every time I ate food it would pack in and push the teeth apart, very painful. I first found dentek at cvs and gave it a try. I followed the instructions and it worked for about 3 days before crumbling and falling out. I went to Walgreens and found the dentemp os and gave it a try. The repair lasted for about 4 or 5 weeks before it crumbled out while eating. But I must say it gave me absolute relief for the weeks I had it in. I have filled it 3 times since because I have not saved enough for the dentist yet. I love this stuff and can only guess that some of the negative reviews on the product are either people that can not follow instructions or dental professionals with amazon accounts, LOL. So if your your like me and dont have the 200 - 300 dollars to go straight to the dentist. Buy the dentemp, Put it in right after rinsing your mouth with warm water, rinse after, rub the excess off with your WET finger,  and you will be fine. It needs moisture to cure so if you put it on a dry tooth it will crumble out right away.</li>
            <li> Just bought this to hold a loose crown and it is completely and utterly useless. Not sticky or adhesive in the slightest, wont even stick to the inside of the crown.  Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> Best price  available at the time. Helped me through my root canal</li>
            <li> The reason you see such variation in reviews for this product is because they  have changed their formulation.  I bought some about 18 months ago and it  worked exceedingly well.  Recently I again had need for it.  I had a tiny bit of Dentemp OS left that was still pliable so I used it   and it lasted about 8 days which wasn&#x27;t bad for 18 month old product.   (When fresh it used to last about 2 weeks, just enough time to be able to   set up a dental appt at a time both you and the dentist could manage.)    The NEW product however, is NOT the same as the older product.    The formulation has CHANGED! The pkg had the ingredients in a   completely different order and the consistency and staying power   are astronomically reduced.  Now it lasts about 12 hours per repair.   (That&#x27;s after putting it on just before bedtime and letting it set   for 8 hours before eating anything.)     This new formulation is as HORRIBLE as the former product was GOOD,   even though the name hasn&#x27;t changed, nor is there any indication that   there has been a change.  If I hadn&#x27;t kept the old pkg, I wouldn&#x27;t know   WHY this stuff no longer works, but having the two ingredient lists side by side,   clearly shows that the polymer, which was the 1st ingredient is now among the last.    This is the binding agent.    Sadly, what was once a great product is no longer worth your money at all.      I&#x27;d attempted to contact the company and (not so) surprisingly, the web address   on the pkg is no longer operational. The email address for dentemp os customer service   found online at their parent company is no longer valid either. This can only lead me   to one conclusion.  They realize they had a great product and decided to use the name   and reputation they&#x27;d built to now sell their new inferior formulation while making   sure they were not reachable for those who would take the time to register dissatsifying   experiences.      Yet again, a company has cheapened the product to the point of making ituseless,   while living off the good name they HAD been known for- AND while disabling their   customer service so you are completely \\&quot;had\\&quot; by a legal con game.  This seems to be   the new American fraud that so many companies perpetrate against their formerly   loyal clientelle.  No wonder America is failing economically and the American name   no longer represents quality.     Save your money, buy the cheap store brands, they are no better, but no worse either   and are generally less costly and more easily available....  or better yet, unless you can reapply this stuff 3 times or more daily, beg your dentist   for an emergency appointment, then hope you aren&#x27;t charged extra for having to be squeezed in   or for having your doc put in some extra hours for your emergency.    Guess I feel a bit ticked off after thinking the new product would be as good as the old   and thereby making my dental appt. for 2 weeks- when the doc and my own schedule aligned.   Now, after getting this, I realize I&#x27;ll be buying 1 of these (or some generic brand) per   day until the timeof my appointment unless (hopefully) my dentist gets a cancellation.    When they have a good product, why do they have to cheapen it and RUIN it?    Look over the various reports on this here on Amazon. (There are different packaging options   of the same product.  Some carry the old formulation on the listing, some not, but whether   or not you&#x27;ll actually GET the older product is anyone&#x27;s guess)  Now you know why you see   a 5 star and a 1 star populace.  The 1 star reviewers are most likely using the new product   while the 5 stars were fortunate to have gotten the last of the good stuff that they no longer make.</li>
            <li> It looks like there&#x27;s a lot of 5s and 1s for these reviews, and that&#x27;s because both sides are right. The container is small for the price, and even more disappointing when you open it up. The texture of the putty is so dry that I assumed I had grabbed a really old one at first, and it&#x27;s very hard to apply as it doesn&#x27;t want to stick...particularly irksome when dealing with a top tooth like me, gravity is not your friend. It also sounds like they should take the \\&quot;replacing crowns\\&quot; off the label.    However, I was only trying to fill a hole, a small one on a back molar, and I had to change my opinion a few hours after application. After I finally wrestled with getting the putty to stay (I stuck with the instructions, flossing and brushing well but leaving my mouth moist) it dried relatively quickly. They say not to drink anything for an hour, which I turned into three: another poster had an excellent idea about doing it before you go to bed. While my cavity wasn&#x27;t causing pain from pressure, it did from hot and cold food and liquid, and this fix made that disappear completely. By the next day I was feeling totally back to normal, and could even chew on that side again though I didn&#x27;t want to chance it much. I also realized that despite being a tiny amount of putty that made me feel jipped at first, it went a long way for me and I&#x27;ve got about 4 more applications out of it. I imagine a full cap would use far far more of it than spackling a hole.    Today is day three, and I woke up with a lot of pain in that tooth. I actually came online now to look for solutions to remove the putty and reapply it (I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the cause, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how else to be proactive about it when a dentist is too expensive.) From what I&#x27;ve been able to find, it gradually wears away and sometimes the whole chunk comes loose if the contact is loosened enough. I was worried the new pain was the putty somehow expanding, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like that&#x27;s the case and the pain&#x27;s mostly vanished for the time being, so it&#x27;s probably from the cavity.    I just wanted to say that I just read through all the reviews, and I really think both sides are right on the money. As a short lived fix, I think it&#x27;s a very cheap way to get a few extra days to weeks to save up for a dentist (while looking for that new job and medical.) It&#x27;s way too expensive and makeshift to try and skip the dentist entirely. The detractors are right, it feels cheap and doesn&#x27;t want to apply, but if you can wrestle it and wait a few hours it&#x27;s actually pretty awesome after it dries. Personally I was still trying to think of other solutions until a few hours later, when I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a simple loose cap despite many poor reviews.  I should have paid attention.  This stuff is useless.  I am an engineer with over 40 years of experience, including the use of adhesives.  I followed the preparation and application directions flawlessly.  I even kept pressure on for an hour (very uncomfortable).  The crown fell off immediately after.  Save yourself some grief and a little money and use something else.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble applying this product, I thought I was doing something wrong. I still needed to use it after I ran out, and for an extra 20¢ at the pharmacy I bought Dentek Temparin Max instead, and that stuff works great- it&#x27;s stickier, holds longer and bonds to the tooth MUCH better. Do yourself a favor and get yourself that stuff instead.</li>
            <li> Friday afternoon before my overseas vacation and my tooth broke. Of course there were no available dentist so I thought that this product would help fix my tooth until I got home.  I Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time buying this product as it does not do what it claims.  I tried it to fix my broken molar.  The first time, the repair lasted 20 minutes, then fell off.  So I tried it again and wore my mouth guard to make sure that I did not bite down on the repaired tooth.  That fix lasted 3 hours.  Not enough time to get in to a dentist for a real repair.  $5 bucks down the drain.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago to fix two gold crowns that came off my teeth. This was supposed to have been a temporary fix but the product excelled itself. I eat anything I want as I did when the crowns had been put in by the dentist.</li>
            <li> It lasted about hour and then fell out</li>
            <li> One of my caps came off and I bought this product and FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY.  It did not work.  After an hour the cap came right off.  A friend of mine suggested I use Fixodent as a temporary measure.  I called Fixodent and they said it was okay to use on all dental appliances.  I bought the travel size of Fixodent for $1.99.  I put a very small drop in my cap to try it.  The cap stayed on for 3 days then came loose so I used another small drop and was good for another 3 days.  I&#x27;ll use Fixodent until my dentist can see me. For caps forget Dentemp ($5) for a temporary fix and get the Fixodent ($2), it works.</li>
            <li> I suffered from some enamel loss on my front teeth and had bonding placed on the back surface years ago. The bonding recently fell out which exposed a thin front tooth &amp; cavity. As I was not able to make it to the dentist any time soon, I looked around for a temporary solution and found Dentemp OS.    I placed some of the Dentemp OS on the back of the tooth which hardened and lasted for 2-3 weeks. I found the product to be very strong and only wore away very gradually over time. This product was literally non-removable once it had hardened and only eventually fell out when I sneezed.    At which time I reapplied the product and it lasted for another 2-3 weeks before falling out again when sneezing. I&#x27;ve now repeated another application which I fully expect will last another 2-3 weeks. This product works so well I haven&#x27;t been in a rush to get to the dentist but I do plan to go eventually.    This product may not work for everyone depending on what the issue with your teeth is, and I can see how some others would say that it&#x27;s a waste of money which may be due to whatever their dental problem is or they may not have installed the product properly even though they thought they were following the instructions.    Regardless, if you have some problems with your teeth and cannot make it to the dentist any time soon, this stuff is worth a try as for $5 or less, you cannot go wrong, and you may find that this product works temporary wonders for any problems that you may have with your teeth!</li>
            <li> I have a wisdom tooth that has a cavity on the side of it. I was in so much pain last night and was awake every hour! I called my dentist immediately this morning, and even with an emergency, I can&#x27;t get in until Wednesday morning. I looked at home remedies on Google and came across a product similar to this one. When I went down to Walgreen&#x27;s to find it, I found Dentemp O.S. instead and decided to try it. I got home and put in on my tooth right away. The results are amazing! There was immediate pain relief and after about 15 minutes, the pain was completely gone. I know I haven&#x27;t had it on long, but it has definitely been holding up about 6 hours now. I would still be in tears right now, if it wasn&#x27;t for Dentemp. I appreciate the product so very much!</li>
            <li> The product has performed much better than I expected however, I think the size of the package is somewhat deceptive. Stating the amount in the container in grams is not a reasonable way to describe the amount of product you receive. I doubt if one person in ten could tell you how many grams there are in an ounce. The best measurement is the 8+ repairs but that&#x27;s easy to miss. You&#x27;ve fufilled your legal obligation but not your moral one. If you could put the \\&quot;8+ repairs\\&quot; in a box and not run the type over two different parts of the background, it would be easier to notice. Frankly,I doubt that there are actually 8+ repairs in the container. I could not make the same repair that I did another seven times. It would be more like four to five and my problem was re-cementing a cap. There is always a small amount of waste when you make a repair like this and you can&#x27;t re-use the waste. After one aborted attempt, I successfully made the repair and it has been several weeks since I re-cemented the cap. I eat and brush afterwards and have experienced no subsequent problems.</li>
            <li> The people who said this product is a waste of time and money are right.  I tried it to reattach a temporary crown on a molar.  It lasted for about 15 minutes before falling off, although I followed the directions scrupulously.  It just fell off while I was talking -- didn&#x27;t eat or drink.  (The instructions say do not eat for at least 1 hour.)    Relating to a previous reviewer, the product I got had the polymer as the last ingredient.    One problem with this product is that the material is very thick, which might make it useful for filling holes, but makes it nearly useless as a cement, since it is impossible to spread in a layer thin enough to result in a comfortable fit.  In addition, it does not seem to like to adhere to the crown material.  Nor to the tooth for that matter.    Another problem is that the package does not have any pull date, so it is impossible to know whether the product has deteriorated to the point of unusability.</li>
            <li> I lost a filling just before the weekend and knew I would have to wait till the following Monday to call the dentist. Saturday morning I woke up in a lot of pain. I was taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen and 1500 mg of Tylenol every 8 hours and 4 hours, respectively. At first it kept things under control... until I tried to eat and drink. It didn&#x27;t matter how careful I was, once the pain started there was no going back. My whole jaw on that side, my cheekbone, my ear...it was too much. I called the number for the 24 hr nurse on my health card for any advice. The upshot was that I should try the dentemp (and get a script from my primary in case of infection). My husband picked up the dentemp and I went on-line to read the reviews. I was quite disheartened and if I had seen these beforehand I probably wouldn&#x27;t have used it.  When I got the dentemp I made a small ball of it between my fingers (think silly putty) and stuck it in the hole, pressed and then bit down. Within two minutes the pain was GONE! I could feel where it had hurt and was grateful. In a little while I couldn&#x27;t even feel that little remnant of pain. Thre was no numbness in any of the surrounding areas, the pain simply did not exist!   I was able to eat and drink all the things I normally eat and drink over the rest of the weekend, albeit, carefully. When I finally got to the dentist on Monday, I was still very comfortable (as though I had no issues at all!) When she saw the hole in my tooth, she exclaimed on the level of pain this must have produced. I don&#x27;t think I would have managed with my sanity intact if it weren&#x27;t for dentemp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this garbage!  It sounds promising until  you realize IT NEVER DRIES OR HARDENS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some on a piece of paper to see how long it took to set up.  Well... it NEVER DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the makers of this should be sued and made to refund everyones money PLUS fork out for pain &amp; suffering!  It&#x27;s a shame that someone is making money from others PAIN and selling something that doesn&#x27;t even work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope all the people connected to this product get incurable toothaches!  See how they like it.  Make them use this junk.</li>
            <li> This stuff will work for a temporary filling as long as it is not on the sides of the tooth.  Tried this product to hold a crown on... sorry it held for the hours I was sleep after I bit down on a napkin for 1 hour. Next morning crown popped back off. This stuff to thick  to be used inside small crowns, I had better luck using Super glue! GEL.  The company making this is getting a fortune.. 5.00 for 2 grams?  The actual Dental cement cost 14.00 for  20 oz.. NEVER AGAIN...</li>
            <li> Not that hard to apply.  It sticks on quite well..  I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last long though.  I usually have to reapply it within a week or 2 at the most.  Its harder to get it to stick to upper teeth.  Also, the filling material is much softer than I feel like it should be.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  It wasn&#x27;t sticky enough to hold my toothe in place.  It may work for someone who is gluing a filling into the toothe.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> i use it for a crown that comes out at times , dr was a crook an wanted to take out entire tooth, ive been using this product  every couple of months, It lasts long when you follow directions the right way.  ,better  this way them losing  entire tooh  for a croook.  i reccommend the product.</li>
            <li> This is an embarrassing subject but because I know that many people are looking for help with temporary fix to cavities until they can afford to see a dentist, I feel it&#x27;s important to share my experience. So here it is... I purchased Dentemp and it&#x27;s competitor, Dentrek. I am in the process of getting dental implants and needed to fill 3 cavities to hold my 3 front teeth together for the next 40 days until my procedure. Perhaps the product may work on molars, but I was trying to fill a small whole on the side on my tooth from where my partial deteriorated the tooth. I tried the Dentemp first and it NEVER lasted more than 3 hours. I followed the directions carefully and tried several times. It just didn&#x27;t stay in. That being said, it is very difficult for a cavity on the side of a tooth, especially the front tooth, to hold a filling. Even a dentist has to place these types of filling with extra care because they are so hard to keep filled. So perhaps the reason I was not able to use this product is because of the placement. I then fried Dentrek and it will last all day before coming out. The Dentrek doesn&#x27;t last more than a day in the front tooth so I do have to refill it every morning; however, I also used it on a tooth with a typical cavity (on top of the tooth) and it&#x27;s been there for 5 days and is still holding up. This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. The reason I gave it 2 stars was because I realize that the type of cavity I needed to fill is not likely to hold any temporary filling for long.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product I threw it in the BOB and you never know when you might need something like this item. Thanks Amazon for the selection and good prices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not understanding why there are so many bad reviews on this product. Is it outstanding? No. Did it temporarily fix the issue and made the issue a bit easier to deal with til getting it taken care of? Heck yeah!&lt;br /&gt;I had cracked a tooth a few weeks ago and today I noticed a chunk of my tooth (possibly filling) was starting to get super loose and almost fell out. I didn&#x27;t want to loose a chunk of my tooth, so went looking for a temporary fix til I could get an appointment set up with a dentist. The product I bought reminded me a lot of the putty people use to fill holes in walls, kinda sticky and pliable but also had to work fast as it seemed to dry out fairly quickly. But, after following the directions to the T, my tooth is temporarily fixed, I was able to eat and no chunk almost falling out (PHEW!). All I can say is, follow the directions completely, work fast so it doesn&#x27;t dry out, definitely wait AT LEAST one hour before eating anything, don&#x27;t mess with it with your tongue (I did, and some of it did start crumbling apart) and give it a good chance to set, and you&#x27;ll have a pretty good temporary fix :-).</li>
            <li> Awful! This is a terrible product. Did not work, dry and sadly those who would order need it. Remove from your stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently lost a filling and was looking for a temporary solution until I can see my dentist next week.  This product was the only one of it&#x27;s kind on the shelf at my local drug store.  I followed the instructions and the temporary filling fell out within minutes three different times. I finally just threw it away, since pushing the solution into my cavity was uncomfortable and pointless if it was going to fall out almost immediately. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I finally figured out how to use this product: mess around with it until 5am, until you&#x27;re so frustrated that you don&#x27;t care about the missing filling anymore. Seriously, there is no use for this product than to steal your money, and frustrate the hell out of you.</li>
