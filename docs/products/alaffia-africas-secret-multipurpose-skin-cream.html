            <li>This lotion is a superb moisturizer without causing my skin to breakout!</li>

            <li>I am a stickler for beautiful skin, and I am always in search for the best skin care out there.</li>
            <li>After using this, though it doesn&#x27;t smell good after applying it has no smell whatsoever on the skin, so you can add any fragrance to yourself and smell wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great night&lt;</li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>They were nice.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering a great product and at great price.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty strongly, not a terrible smell but not the best either.</li>
            <li>The best part about this product besides the price are the all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>When I read the ingredients I was amazed by how many amazing products are in this.</li>
            <li>It does have a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s such great lotion!</li>
            <li>and it really was great to help protect from wind burn while skiing and outdoor activities.</li>
            <li>So you do need to work with it, but it so concentrated, and better to use as a night treatment.  </li>
            <li>Like a nail head amount, softened with some water so it will spread over the face, is perfect, same with the neck and chest.  </li>
            <li>I recommend getting this and using it sparingly and watch the magic</li>

            <li>I recommend getting this and using it sparingly and watch the magic</li>
            <li>I love this shea cream</li>
            <li>I was gifted some of this</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry hands and heels of the feet.</li>
            <li>This cream is wonderful for dry winter skin!</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad (like honey, very light smell)</li>
            <li>Most shea butters do not work on my skin, but the combination of different ingredients in this product works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice consistency and smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>This product has a significant bee smell, though I find it absorbs or disasters quickly as well.</li>
            <li>but the cream actually seemed good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big believer in bee products and this item has a good blend.</li>
            <li>Seriously Alaffia skin products are the best!</li>
            <li>and they are smooth and pretty now.  </li>
            <li>First of all I had many scars from handling my cat who has encephalitis and she can get fiesty from the disease, it has really reduced the scares by 90%.  </li>
            <li>I will then lightly rinse with fairly warm water just to help it soak in and pat dry.</li>
            <li>My daughter has the MOST sensitive skin you&#x27;ll ever encounter</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you can tell, and it will not absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much, you can tell, and it will not absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this much at first.</li>
            <li>First week I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but after a week I would wet my hands with warm water, and use a pin head size working the water into it, and then spread on face, repeating for neck, chest and hands.  </li>
            <li>and I just tried it for the first time after taking a shower.  </li>
            <li>Many products seem to claim exoteric ingredients and only include them to the extent required to market them.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, it has convinced me bee-products are extremely healthy for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>The circles under my eyes lightened a bit too, and my skin looked much clearer, glowed more and looked very clean, soft, and much less lines.  </li>
            <li>Smell is amazing and you only have to use a tiny bit</li>
            <li>But aside from this, my whole skin has transformed.  </li>
            <li>suggest applying it very sparingly because it is sooo concentrated.  </li>
            <li>suggest applying it very sparingly because it is sooo concentrated.  </li>
            <li>I am really hoping this will continue to get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li>It is really moisturizing though</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>but it goes away fairly fast.  </li>
            <li>The learning curve is real.</li>
            <li>I just take a small amount, rub it into my palms until it&#x27;s warm and then message into face and neck.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell, but I would not want anything added to take away from the &#x27;naturalness&amp;#34</li>
            <li>it is a tad too oily for my face but will probably be fabulous for someone who is suffering from very dry skin on the face.</li>
            <li>This is a hidden secret I&#x27;ve never heard about, but I&#x27;m so happy I found it!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty waxy, so after showering I take a pea sized amount, rub between my hands to make spreadable, run through towell dried hair, spread over hands, and lastly pat on top of moisturized face.</li>
            <li>I am curious to see how this product does in the winter, and even with this one bottle, I am sure I will have some left to try.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin firm, glowing, clear, even, and I love it.</li>
            <li>The product smells very ~natural~.</li>
            <li>This was the last puzzle piece that really got rid of the rash!</li>
            <li>During that time of the month, I usually get a few demon pimples, but since using this product, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, and I swear my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li>It was clear and radiant.</li>
            <li>My sister also has extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it, mostly because of the smell (not terrible, just personally didn&#x27;t care alot for it).</li>
            <li>When I actually started using it for my face, I found I really like it.</li>
            <li>The blend of extracts of herbs and bee products makes this a completely organic product.  </li>
            <li>though I am 57, people have no idea how old I am.  </li>
            <li>though I am 57, people have no idea how old I am.  </li>
            <li>I recently found this while on a search at Whole Foods for something that may work to help my struggling acne.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and acne prone.</li>
            <li>It feels a bit gritty and smells a bit weird when first applying to your skin, but as you rub it in it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and leaves skin soft and dry yet moisturized.</li>
            <li>I also use it around my eyes, as I live in a very dry, high desert climate.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on inflammation, cuts and dry skin.</li>
            <li>These are natural anti-bacterials especially the honey.  </li>
            <li>I get any flare-ups, but so far it hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>I do agree that the smell at first is a little put offish.  </li>
            <li>Next it has other components like Neem oil, coconut oil and boabob oil which also are very healing.  </li>
            <li>For the record, I&#x27;ve tried a full facial application several times, stunningly no breakouts, just prefer to to keep sunscreen in the mix.</li>
            <li>The only draw back is it does not have a fragrance, it has a very herbal fragrance, so the way I fixed this is to buy a bottle of vanilla oil and added just a little and mixed it.  </li>
            <li>My mom has very dry (and a bit sensitive) skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My mom has very dry (and a bit sensitive) skin</li>
            <li> ; of the product, so I can live with the odd smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and supple for hours, especially dry skin.</li>
            <li> This combo helped, but the affected area would always be really dry and flaky, and the dermatitis would occasionally return.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;A must-have for those dry winter months especially if you suffer from chapped and dry skin!</li>
            <li> I am a man, and this product makes my hands soft, keeps my hair parted and conditioned, and complements my ordinary facial moisturizer (which includes sunscreen).</li>
            <li> It sat for a long time.</li>
            <li> In the morning my eyes had tightened up considerably no lines and none of the &amp;quot;creepy&amp;quot; look on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I did buy it again, in spite of the smell which doesn&#x27;t smell strange anymore to me!</li>
            <li> I had a patch of dry, itchy, inflamed skin by my mouth for months that just would not go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a thick wax with high oil content.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has keratosis pilaris (little dry bumps) and she has been using this on those areas and tells me that it is helping immensely!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can say alot about this since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I was having serious issues with my excema and dryness from pregnancy related hormone changes and this product helped tremendously without irritating.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days and can already tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have used it to heal cracked skin that would not heal with any other product.</li>
            <li> I usually put some on my finger and dab tiny dots around my face.  </li>
            <li> Other Shea butter products tend to cause pimples for me.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what is up the the other reviews...</li>

            <li> A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. product! My daughter has the MOST sensitive skin you&#x27;ll ever encounter and she can use this on her face and body. My sister also has extremely sensitive skin and I gave a jar to her for xmas and she LOVES it. My mom has very dry (and a bit sensitive) skin and she&#x27;s hooked now too.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product. I work in a holistic/functional medicine office and I tell people about it all of the time.</li>
            <li> I loooooove this stuff. My mother calls it a &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34;. Leaves our skin glowing.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for dry winter skin! It does have a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s such great lotion!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can say alot about this since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it, mostly because of the smell (not terrible, just personally didn&#x27;t care alot for it). I will probably give it a try again, cause it has good ingredients and I don&#x27;t want to waste it.  Update: About a year later! I didn&#x27;t use this much at first. It sat for a long time. When I actually started using it for my face, I found I really like it. I used it all winter and it really was great to help protect from wind burn while skiing and outdoor activities. I did buy it again, in spite of the smell which doesn&#x27;t smell strange anymore to me! I was sad that the price went up. I just take a small amount, rub it into my palms until it&#x27;s warm and then message into face and neck. I will then lightly rinse with fairly warm water just to help it soak in and pat dry. I don&#x27;t break out and my face feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> Works very well on inflammation, cuts and dry skin. I have used it to heal cracked skin that would not heal with any other product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product! Smell is amazing and you only have to use a tiny bit and it goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;A must-have for those dry winter months especially if you suffer from chapped and dry skin! I use It for my body it is a tad too oily for my face but will probably be fabulous for someone who is suffering from very dry skin on the face. It has a really nice consistency and smells good enough to eat! Excellent for dry hands and heels of the feet. This product is definitely a winter must-have for me and a all season hand and feet moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I do agree that the smell at first is a little put offish.  Once it seeps into your skin it&#x27;s hardly noticeable, trust me, if I smelled horrible my boyfriend would let me know.  It is an oily texture, so best to use just a dab. I usually put some on my finger and dab tiny dots around my face.  I haven&#x27;t used it for my body, but plan on trying it out after an unrelated allergic reaction goes away, especially to see if it helps with the scarring.  During that time of the month, I usually get a few demon pimples, but since using this product, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, and I swear my skin looks great.  I am curious to see how this product does in the winter, and even with this one bottle, I am sure I will have some left to try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing. I use it on my heels and toes and they are smooth and pretty now.  I also use it around my eyes, as I live in a very dry, high desert climate.  This product has a delicious, almost coconut-y scent to it.  The best part about this product besides the price are the all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> The blend of extracts of herbs and bee products makes this a completely organic product.  It has Royal jelly, Propolis, pollen and honey, which alone do AMAZING THINGS TO THE SKIN.  These are natural anti-bacterials especially the honey.  This combination as firms and nourishes with the royal jelly alone containing 136 vitamins and minerals.  Next it has other components like Neem oil, coconut oil and boabob oil which also are very healing.  Neem actually evens out the skin tone.  The texture of it was quite surprising but I got the hang of it.  It&#x27;s like a thick wax with high oil content.  First week I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but after a week I would wet my hands with warm water, and use a pin head size working the water into it, and then spread on face, repeating for neck, chest and hands.  So you do need to work with it, but it so concentrated, and better to use as a night treatment.  In the morning my eyes had tightened up considerably no lines and none of the &amp;quot;creepy&amp;quot; look on my hands.  The circles under my eyes lightened a bit too, and my skin looked much clearer, glowed more and looked very clean, soft, and much less lines.  The only draw back is it does not have a fragrance, it has a very herbal fragrance, so the way I fixed this is to buy a bottle of vanilla oil and added just a little and mixed it.  Problem solved.  I would advise using this, an absolutely amazing organic product that will treat your skin like a queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months later I would like to bring everyone up to speed.  After using this, though it doesn&#x27;t smell good after applying it has no smell whatsoever on the skin, so you can add any fragrance to yourself and smell wonderful.  But aside from this, my whole skin has transformed.  First of all I had many scars from handling my cat who has encephalitis and she can get fiesty from the disease, it has really reduced the scares by 90%.  And the skin on my face, it has totally firmed it and reduced the lines by 95%, and my eyes...omg...the bags under my eyes have reduced 100%, and my eye skin looks like I did in my 20s, though I am 57, people have no idea how old I am.  It&#x27;s amazing this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest applying it very sparingly because it is sooo concentrated.  Like a nail head amount, softened with some water so it will spread over the face, is perfect, same with the neck and chest.  If you use too much, you can tell, and it will not absorb quickly.  It also forms a protective seal over the skin, that you can tell is there if you add water to your face later, you can feel you have the layer there, it&#x27;s awesome so you are hydrated for hours.  I recommend getting this and using it sparingly and watch the magic work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hop they will add fragrance, but I do believe it is the raw shea butter, which I understand has a very raw smell, just ignore once it&#x27;s on your skin it has no smell to it.my eyes...omg...the bags under my eyes have reduced 100%, and my eye skin looks like I did in my 20s, though I am 57, people have no idea how old I am.

            <li> I recently found this while on a search at Whole Foods for something that may work to help my struggling acne. When I read the ingredients I was amazed by how many amazing products are in this. I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and I can say my acne is improving! Yay! I noticed results after one night of use. I am really hoping this will continue to get rid of my acne. It&#x27;s a great night&lt;br /&gt;cream, but because it is so thick I do not recommend if for the day. This is a hidden secret I&#x27;ve never heard about, but I&#x27;m so happy I found it!!! Acne has been such a struggle for me!</li>
            <li> It feels a bit gritty and smells a bit weird when first applying to your skin, but as you rub it in it feels amazing. Leaves skin soft and supple for hours, especially dry skin. I was having serious issues with my excema and dryness from pregnancy related hormone changes and this product helped tremendously without irritating.</li>
            <li> I am a stickler for beautiful skin, and I am always in search for the best skin care out there. I visited my sister and noticed her skin was glowing. It was clear and radiant. I asked her what she was using, and she told me about Africa&#x27;s Secret. Most shea butters do not work on my skin, but the combination of different ingredients in this product works great on my skin. I had a few pimples on my face, and after washing my face with DHC oil cleanser, I moisturized with Africa&#x27;s secret. In the morning, ALL my pimples were gone! Unbelievable! I love this shea cream and I will not be without it. My skin is so smooth and beautiful!</li>
            <li> It smells pretty strongly, not a terrible smell but not the best either. It is really moisturizing though so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of this product. Feels great on my skin. I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell, but I would not want anything added to take away from the &#x27;naturalness&amp;#34; of the product, so I can live with the odd smell.</li>
            <li> I had a patch of dry, itchy, inflamed skin by my mouth for months that just would not go away. I found out it was seborrheic dermatitis. I started using tea tree oil facial cleanser and 1:1 ACV to water as a facial toner. This combo helped, but the affected area would always be really dry and flaky, and the dermatitis would occasionally return. I happened to have a jar of Africa&#x27;s Secret at home so I decided to try it out of desperation. This was the last puzzle piece that really got rid of the rash! Now, I continue to use tea tree oil cleanser and ACV toner, and apply Africa&#x27;s Secret to any dry or itchy spots as needed. It works like magic! I keep a jar in my purse in case I get any flare-ups, but so far it hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> This is great lotion for any skin type! My skin is sensitive and acne prone. This lotion is a superb moisturizer without causing my skin to breakout! I&#x27;ve used it all over my body and face. The smell is not bad (like honey, very light smell) so I&#x27;m not sure what is up the the other reviews... And the smell goes away in 5 min. Seriously Alaffia skin products are the best!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It smells like barf but it makes my skin firm, glowing, clear, even, and I love it. Absolutely amazing. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days and can already tell a difference.  I believe it to be a good product.  The smell isn&#x27;t the best but it goes away fairly fast.  That&#x27;s shea butter for you.</li>
            <li> Love it! My kids have psoriasis, this helps ease the itch and clears their skin. Has a not so pleasant smell but it works miracles.</li>
            <li> One of the jars had a broken seal with a finger print.  The company agreed to my returning it.  They were nice.  I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the product...probably an organic smell...but the cream actually seemed good.</li>
            <li> I was gifted some of this and I just tried it for the first time after taking a shower.  It smells like… I don&#x27;t know… like I need to take a shower really badly.  It smells like I haven&#x27;t showered in a week.  I have to toss it.  Maybe I got one that went bad or something but this isn&#x27;t going to work, unless I&#x27;m going on a bad date that I want to repel or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big believer in bee products and this item has a good blend. The consistency is of an oily nature, and though I realize some people may like for their skin to have a shiny appearance, I find that difficult to wear during the daytime, so this is a nighttime product for me. My daughter has keratosis pilaris (little dry bumps) and she has been using this on those areas and tells me that it is helping immensely! Thanks for offering a great product and at great price.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful. I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. Ugh</li>
            <li> Great stuff. The learning curve is real. I am a man, and this product makes my hands soft, keeps my hair parted and conditioned, and complements my ordinary facial moisturizer (which includes sunscreen). It&#x27;s pretty waxy, so after showering I take a pea sized amount, rub between my hands to make spreadable, run through towell dried hair, spread over hands, and lastly pat on top of moisturized face. For the record, I&#x27;ve tried a full facial application several times, stunningly no breakouts, just prefer to to keep sunscreen in the mix. Other Shea butter products tend to cause pimples for me. Absorbs fast and leaves skin soft and dry yet moisturized. The product smells very ~natural~. Many products seem to claim exoteric ingredients and only include them to the extent required to market them. This product has a significant bee smell, though I find it absorbs or disasters quickly as well. I definitely recommend this product, it has convinced me bee-products are extremely healthy for skin and hair.</li>
