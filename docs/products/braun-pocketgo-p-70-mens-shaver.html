            <li>/&gt;Battery life is excellent.</li>
            <li>So I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this travel shaver.</li>

            <li>This is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>However, for travel and back-up, it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>A set of batteries lasted me for almost 2 months, which I found impressive.</li>
            <li>Best shaves occur when you hold the head as perpendicular to the area being shaved as you can.  </li>
            <li>Excellent look, feel, price, design, and performance.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>

            <li>It is the best.</li>

            <li>Battery life was excellent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the trade-off of this razor; that is, I&#x27;d rather have no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Battery usage is excellent.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of travel shavers over the years and this is THE best.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li>Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li>This is simply awesome for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>All in all, a well thought out, efficient shaver at a very attractive price.</li>
            <li>The best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was prompt, packaged well and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Best of all it is a Braun which is a quality product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a perfect travel razor.</li>
            <li>The PocketGo renders an excellent shave used with shave cream/shave soap.</li>
            <li>and I did a bit of research and figured that within budget this would probably be the best one.</li>
            <li>but it turned out to be perfect for trimming my mustache and goatee, and</li>
            <li>Awesome!!</li>
            <li>This shaver is perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Awesome for traveling.</li>
            <li>This shaver works wonderfully with my lifestyle.</li>
            <li>P-70 Men&#x27;s Shaver is the best of both worlds, it feels well made and designed by someone</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful razor!</li>
            <li>All in all, a razor that is perfectly designed for its intended purpose (travel).</li>
            <li>The best it can do is leave me looking patchy if I use it twice a day.   </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the best that can be said about it.</li>
            <li>They have worked flawlessly and I still use them.  </li>
            <li>Excellent value.  </li>
            <li>That version had a trimmer that slid up and was perfect for the hairs you always miss on your neck.  </li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>start to cut more of your face than they do your beard !!!</li>
            <li>for more then triple the price!!!</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, but once you figure out how to angle the shaver, it will give you a very good shave.  </li>
            <li>I have earler versions of this razor, and they are very good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>It does not do a very good job on the neck, otherwise it gives a close  shave.</li>
            <li>But if you miss a couple of days of shaving (like the weekend), don&#x27;t expect it to do a very good job getting \\&quot;long\\&quot; hairs.</li>
            <li>For those times, this inexpensive razor does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT, TRIMMER IS EXCELLENT.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is built incredibly.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product.  </li>
            <li>The swivel case is ideal when it goes into your travel kit and it protects the foil well.  </li>
            <li>Both are pocket size, excellent shavers, great for travel and inexpensive to buy.  </li>
            <li>He needs a girl friend with good vision and a pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li>Good shave, too!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent travel shaver (rotating cover) but not as good as the Panasonic ES4815s which I reviewed [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>He loved the great shaving job it did, the fact that you can wash the head, and--most of all--it fits perfectly in his shaving bag.  </li>
            <li>It works great, and the design is nifty.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the design, size, and price are great (hence 2 stars and not 1).  </li>
            <li>What a great idea.  </li>
            <li>I brought it on vacation and used it every day for 4 days and it was just great.</li>
            <li>Great shaver at a great price</li>
            <li>Works great on the go.  </li>
            <li>Great idea unless you are hit with everything when you walk through the door.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li>Also great for travel.    </li>
            <li>It is every bit as convenient and works great.</li>
            <li>This a great razor.</li>
            <li>Battery use is great and, of course, one cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>Great buy keep one in your car, in your briefcase.</li>
            <li>Great price, too.</li>
            <li>Recommend as a great portable razor if you shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I found this at a great price</li>
            <li>I agree, its a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>The side trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but you can&#x27;t expect salon quality trimming from a travel shaver.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>It delivers great results for about $20.</li>
            <li>FOR AN INEXPENSIVE, POCKET SIZE SHAVER THIS IS A GREAT BUY.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product that I wouldn&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>This razor is great for the price for keeping in my briefcase for an evening meeting or get-together.    </li>
            <li>Based on its reliability and performance I bought this one and am happy with it.</li>
            <li>However, I definitely am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>This Braun electric razor does a great job at helping me look nicer through the work week.</li>
            <li>is great.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Still shaves great.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor based on the great reviews I read here.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>However it has done a great job for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>Accidentally dropped it onto a ceramic tile floor, after being happy with it for a couple of years.)</li>
            <li>The amazon.com price was excellent at under $20 for a shaver that is well thought out and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>The Braun P70/370 is the best and an amazing deal at $15 or $20.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the lesson is that one should not believe something is great just because it has hundreds of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>For $15, a great shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked out great for us.</li>
            <li>The swiveling cover is great because it&#x27;s not a separate piece to misplace.</li>
            <li>And a  great shave for this type of shaver.</li>
            <li>It is compact, convenient and does a great job as a travel shaver.    </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never without a great shave.</li>
            <li>It still works great.    </li>
            <li>It still works great, but that&#x27;s not an exercise I would recommend.    </li>

            <li>He saved up a 3 day beard to test it out and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This shaver is well built and intelligently thought out.  </li>
            <li>Great price when you compare to the rechargables.</li>
            <li>Great design and I like the idea that the cap is attached to the shaver...</li>
            <li>I use this shaver for travel and it does a great job</li>
            <li>Happy with this electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I had to sell them on ebay with great losses.</li>
            <li>Great to throw in your travel bag for the road.</li>
            <li>Yes, I say, \\&quot;we\\&quot; because it shaves his face so close and so smooth!!!</li>
            <li>Very, very nice.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for almost three years and have found it very kind to my tender face.</li>
            <li>This Braun shaver comes in very handy in keeping him groomed.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice foil shaver, which happens to run on AAA batteries.  </li>
            <li>This one is very good and handy for all travel purpose.</li>
            <li>the design is truly remarkable.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor specifically to get me through a 2 month trip, and it worked flawlessly, even better then the Remington</li>
            <li>good item, happy with purachase, affordable and does the work it is meant for that price</li>
            <li>Have owned many electric shaver in my life and this is one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I bought 8 for staff members and plan on buying more for some of our best customers this fall.</li>
            <li>This PocketGo Shaver is perfect size for travel and does a great job on a light beard.  </li>
            <li>However, he said that his shave with the Braun is just as good as any he has ever had with any of his rechargeable or electric shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- good quality &lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many electric razors and this one is incredible</li>
            <li>It looks good and feels good in my hand.   </li>
            <li>Word to the wise - TRY IT OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING IT, don&#x27;t toss it in your suitcase and assume it works.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I need to touch up with going to the blade to look good.  </li>
            <li>I have a Panasonic shaver that cost me $70 that doesnt do as good a job as this Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a good year</li>
            <li>Well designed, quality construction, and it gives a surprisingly good shave.  </li>
            <li>Works good for a battery powered back-and-forth shaver.  </li>
            <li>No, but it does a really good job in between shaves.  </li>
            <li>I use it primarily while camping, for this it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Shave was good and close.  </li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the good and the not-so-good.  </li>
            <li>this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good portable shaver.  </li>
            <li>Exceptionally good value for the money...</li>
            <li>The shave and feel is not as good.</li>
            <li>its still a good buy though, comparable to shavers at $100</li>
            <li>if you just skim it along the hair it does a good job on thinning it out.</li>
            <li>One concern that was brought to my attention is that it uses AA batteries that always need to be replaced, well I have had this unit for about a month now and the batteries are still good.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a good answer...</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price with features this good.  </li>
            <li>I also loved the protective cap.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a really good razor.         </li>
            <li>This Braun razor does an amazingly good job.  </li>
            <li>then you can believe on a set of good batteries and give a quality shave.</li>
            <li>Handy, close shaving, battery powered portable that is great to keep in the car or travel pack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have for a travel, and even at home.</li>
            <li>It still is in good condition and mechanically works well.  </li>
            <li>Good shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>This razor has good battery life and shaves as well as any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Seller did a good job getting the product to me.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s good to go, no matter where you happen to be.</li>
            <li>It works as good as my $99.00 Norelco.  </li>
            <li>How can they make something so good for this price?</li>
            <li>But is a light weight &amp; handy shaver, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>The P-70 is one of the best foil shavers I&#x27;ve ever used and overall one of the best designed products I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>people who like to be entirely shorn, this shaver is perfect, and you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s cordlessness is awesome.</li>
            <li>It works remarkably well, cleans easily, has great battery life and earns my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li>For a cheap but very good product nothing can beat this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my father and he is very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I will still use the 8975 for most of my shaving needs, but the 370 will be a great touch-up and travel shaver.</li>
            <li>Very cheap and crappy!</li>
            <li>For best results, you need to keep fresh batteries in it.  </li>
            <li>I do not understand how it got so many great reviews...</li>
            <li>Both of us are very pleased with the razor.  </li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>If I wanted a portable shaver for myself and saw the P-70 advertised at $22 or so, I&#x27;d have been perfectly ok with it upon arrival, but not for $125!  </li>
            <li>I love it and my skin is loving it too!</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly; it is more than it purports  itself to be!</li>
            <li>Actually it is better than others!  </li>
            <li>But still it is impressive for the first try.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>It gives a great shave and is easy on the batteries.  </li>
            <li>This one now (PocketGo P-70) is great, shaves close and and makes my skin feel smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li>aka free control 1775 for $40; great shave</li>
            <li>However, considering its cost this is an amazing value, I use it on all by trips and continue to be amazed at it</li>
            <li>Amazing buy.</li>
            <li>but I got two with free shipping for $15 each and am happy to have them.  </li>
            <li>It really is the best electric shaver I have seen.  </li>
            <li>Needed something handy and compact for a touchup.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this shaver twice for my son when he was in Iraq, he liked it and he ask me to purchased it for him</li>
            <li>Lots of nice features--beard/sideburns trimmer, immersible in water, etc.  </li>
            <li>Also, the pop-up trimmer is kind of a joke, but so is the one on my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice design with an effective, attached screen protector, and cleaning brush(my</li>
            <li>This is a OK unit compared to 5615 which was superior in every way.</li>
            <li>the size and weight are nice too.</li>
            <li>He stated that he liked the shaver&#x27;s shave, the fact that it used batteries rather than a recharger, and he liked it for its price.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item and an extra one for my dad without even trying it, based on the great price and excellent reviews.  </li>
            <li>Nice item, just not for me.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure if this shaver would be any good when ordering.</li>
            <li>Brush in handle is nice touch.</li>
            <li>AAs were a nice touch.</li>
            <li>If you find something you really like, I find it&#x27;s best to buy a spare.</li>
            <li>Honestly, for 15 bucks you should buy this shaver for yourself and friends.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid much more for electric shavers that weren&#x27;t nearly as good as this shaver.</li>
            <li>its painless and effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cover rotates around nicely.</li>
            <li>Sure, not quite as good as my full-size 7526</li>
            <li>The quality of this shaver is superior to many shavers I have seen on the market.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice shave also.  </li>
            <li>Nice portable shaver.</li>
            <li>* Kind of noisy.  </li>
            <li>Nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to carry a recharging cord (you don&#x27;t need access to an outlet) and it flips around into it&#x27;s own \\&quot;case\\&quot;</li>
            <li>That and it holds its own cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>For more then 30 years Braun razors have met the challange and given me good service.   </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, you could not shave a balloon with this thing.</li>
            <li>He got it, gave it a test run (as did many of his squad-platoon), and he loved it.</li>
            <li>This has been the absolute best shaver.  </li>
            <li>And the swivel design that protects the screen is a nice innovation.</li>
            <li>Pros: you can use your own rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Compact design with a nice integrated protective cover</li>
            <li>It is handy and just kind of cute to look at.  </li>
            <li>Does not work perfectly but is is a good travel shaver that takes double a batteries</li>
            <li>I prefer using a blade but this shaver is great for weekends and quick shaves.</li>
            <li>this exellently priced refurb also on Amazon), but great for travel, quick on-the-go reshave before evening, or \\&quot;emergency.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for camping, business travel, or just as a spare razor to keep in the office for a quick shave or touch up.</li>
            <li>great, very well thought out and good for traveling,</li>
            <li>This razor is also very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>It shaves as well as a razor 10 times it price, is easy to use, easy to clean and all in all a best buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great design but as useful as a boat anchor when the screen deteriorates.</li>
            <li>Self contained with brush fitting nicely into the case.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, has an &#x27;off&#x27; locking mechanism (won&#x27;t accidentally turn on in my luggage), close and smooth shave, feels good in my hand, and a trimmer is included.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The trimmer is handy, and it does a respectable job on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is feature rich and gives a good, close shave on two AA batteries, which can be found anywhere.  </li>
            <li>The design is excellent because the foil is very well protected against damage in luggage and the lock system is secure so it will not accidentally turn ON when squished in your luggage.</li>
            <li>and he said at first was great but approx.</li>
            <li>The new version has been improved over what was ,and is a very  good product.</li>
            <li>The Braun gives a great, quick shave and is incredibly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I also have a very light beard.</li>
            <li>this razor is VERY comfortable.  </li>
            <li>For day-to-day shaves it does an adequate job and will keep you looking good.  </li>
            <li>the Braun&#x27;s trimmer is effective and easy to use and, unlike that on the Norelco, has never nicked my skin.  </li>
            <li>Priced excellently, this is a significant improvement over the older models.  </li>
            <li>Based on the positive reviews, the great price and f*r*e*e shipping, I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li>Perfect time for me to shave is right out of a hot shower.</li>
            <li>I use a Gillette blade razor for most shaving, but like a power shaver for touch-up and trimming, etc.</li>
            <li>It is probably best used for a travel razor, but you won&#x27;t like it as your daily shaver.  </li>
            <li>After checking many sites, I chose the Braun 370.  </li>
            <li>He has commented on several occasions that this was an excellent shaver.  </li>
            <li>But shave is like most electrics...</li>
            <li>Love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to plug it in.</li>
            <li>I use this for touching up after I shave with a razor.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this Braun 370 PocketGo battery shaver for my hubby and we love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love, just love this shaver.</li>
            <li>The shave is so close be sure to use aftershave gel/lotion.</li>
            <li>This is simply one of the best buys I have ever made.</li>
            <li>I use the trimmer feature to catch the \\&quot;ones that got away\\&quot; and I&#x27;ve been perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Have used this for many years.  </li>
            <li>so I am guessing that it works OK.</li>
            <li>It cost more to ship that cutterblock than to buy another Pocketgo.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Braun razor on a whim and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I figured I would never be able to use one.</li>
            <li>It does a better job than my $90.00 razor.</li>
            <li>Good quality, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>(I prefer blades for the most part).  </li>
            <li>Even after reading all the excellent reviews, it still vastly exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like most shavers the motor hums and when it hits a spot of whiskers it sort of makes that grinding noise, which gives you the impression it is doing something.  </li>
            <li>and it becomes a top of the line shaver.</li>
            <li>It collects most of the cut hair inside the foil, but some drops out, so if you are shaving with a suit on, be prepared to brush off a bit afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in some ways its even better...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so there is no reason to pay more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the construction of this shaver,</li>
            <li>The flip top cover prevents it from turning by accident.</li>
            <li>I would recommend NiMh rechargeable batteries though for longer life and more power.</li>
            <li>After returning home, I continued using it for about 7 more years before needing to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I got more than I paid for.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully my dad will fare better</li>
            <li>It will never be as close as the shave that you can get with a razor, but it is close enough to be perfectly acceptable.</li>
            <li>This one is more compact, lighter, and has a built-in protective, \\&quot;swing-away\\&quot; cap that also keeps it from accidentally being switched on.  </li>
            <li>nothing* better than this.  </li>
            <li>For around $15, you owe it to yourself to give this a try before spending a LOT more on a Braun Series 7.  </li>
            <li>There is no need to spend more for a razor.</li>
            <li>If your like me and easily able to get ingrown hairs, don&#x27;t touch this thing.</li>
            <li>That solved the problem for many years... that is up to now.  </li>
            <li>It just works perfect, i use it daily.</li>
            <li>Your Cordless triple head or twin bank razor will cut 10 times better than this and a lot faster.</li>
            <li>I was looking to use something more compact to carry when traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy one more soon so that I can use it in my office.  </li>
            <li>I think better will be to use it every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to get those by moving the skin</li>
            <li>so they stand up :) and holding the shaver just off the skin.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to return my Braun 190 and buy 2 more</li>
            <li>I got one for me, one for my brother, and I&#x27;m going to get one for some more family members.    </li>
            <li>This thing is ok.  </li>
            <li>If your&#x27;re going to be gone longer, just toss more batteries in the bag.  </li>
            <li>There may well be ones that provide a better shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this braun 370 shaver one year ago, im totally satisfied with the job this shaver does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought 2</li>
            <li>closer shave, more irritation.  </li>
            <li>IN FACT, I PLAN TO BUY TWO MORE TO GIVE AS HOLIDAY GIFTS..</li>
            <li>One thing is you cant be using this shaver to save time because you would be done with a better shave sooner if you used a razor.  </li>
            <li>Beyond that, the foil design won&#x27;t be able to shave well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much more.</li>
            <li>otherwise it would have kept going :)</li>
            <li>It shaves better than the Braun I paid over $100.00 for just 4 months ago which I now wish I could return.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more and send as gifts.</li>
            <li>Love the Braun shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the cutter and foil would cost more than that.</li>
            <li>It removed the stubble that the Panasonic left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, gotta go and order two more of these before the price goes up.  :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be happier if it were a bit more compact for travel, but I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>hop in the shower, lather up your face with the soap provided in the room, do several passes in this manner in the shower and have you have an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>Its a OK device for below $20.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Very well designed and the shave is great.</li>
            <li>Still use it and love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver about a month ago and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this item snd recommend it to anyone on the go.</li>
            <li>I love the using AA batteries for power.  </li>
            <li>but I just wish it shaved better.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s just ok:  </li>
            <li>and you sure can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>How many times can you shave before the batteries have to be replaced? &lt;</li>
            <li>anyone can speak to these issues, I&#x27;d be most grateful.</li>
            <li>all those areas, underarm hair was the most troublesome...</li>
            <li>More than that</li>
            <li>It was much better than carrying a blade razor and shaving cream (and the shaving cream would be confiscated at the airport these days if you leave it in your carry-on bag).     </li>
            <li>Did OK in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I am blade shaver, but there are times when using an electric razor is just more convenient.  </li>
            <li>One of those things where it would be ok to lose, and not lose money.  </li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>functions on batteries is better in that regard which I also purchased</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the cover.  </li>
            <li>I have a top of the line Braun razor as well.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, you can use</li>
            <li>I have been extremely satisfied with the Braun and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>Better than the $100</li>
            <li>What more can one ask?</li>
            <li>Sure wish it worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with a blade for many years.  </li>
            <li>And I have a light beard, the kind many said this shaver is suited for.</li>
            <li>Looked at many brands, checked spec&#x27;s,  purchased the Braun 370,  and shipped it to him.</li>
            <li>okay shaver but dropped it once and stopped working.</li>
            <li>The screen and blade are much better than what you would expect at this price.  </li>
            <li>I love the thing.</li>
            <li>And the results are more than satisfactory for me.    </li>
            <li>Since most of the time the cap gets lost during travel, while it&#x27;s in your bag, and that&#x27;s how the head stands to get damaged.</li>
            <li>- sometimes I think it&#x27;s better than my full-size Braun.  </li>
            <li>This is more shaving time during a week than most men will use.</li>
            <li>This item was a gift and the recipient is quite pleased with the \\&quot;PocketGo\\&quot; Men&#x27;s Shaver.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to many a freshman :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Talking about the M-90, I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Best for short growth.</li>
            <li>If you use it every day, you&#x27;ll be happy with the decent shave.  </li>
            <li>It is a great price and highly  recommended.</li>
            <li>Great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and painless and works better than one of the Norelco electrics I bought for $80+!</li>
            <li>First, the good:  </li>
            <li>The design is remarkably well thought out, it is very compact and travels well.  </li>
            <li>It seemed great as a shaver to keep in my bag to complement my new Braun home shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong, but I would not pay more than $30 for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to keep in your bag or glove box for those days you forget or don&#x27;t have time to shave before leaving the house, or for when you are taking a quick trip and don&#x27;t want to bring your bulkier electric razor.</li>
            <li>It is easy to throw this into the travel bag as the flip top protects the blades.  </li>
            <li>Super handy.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is still a nice compact shaver that&#x27;s great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Lots of reviewers say this is as good or better than a REAL cordless razor.. think again.</li>
            <li>My youngest son, a US Marine stationed in Irag, needed a shaver that was battery powered, light but sturdy,  and that could do a nice job on his light beard once a day.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is very easy and the attached brush saves me from searching.</li>
            <li>I also gifted it to relatives and they liked it very much.</li>
            <li>You get a close, comfortable shave every time, it is easy to clean and the built-in head cover works nice.</li>
            <li>This puppy runs great, shaves OK, and can go for more than a week on one set of double A&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It shaves as closely as my Norelco did, I believe, and is actually more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The portability, the convenience, the design, quality, and more importantly, the function.  </li>
            <li>I have been shaving since 1953 With out a doubt, this 10.00 shaver has given me,the most comfortable, and closest shaves</li>
            <li>If you shave every day you really should invest in a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this shaver, works surprisingly well for the price and the fact that it is a travel model.</li>
            <li>Much easier than shaving, good battery life.</li>
            <li>Portable, waterproof, fairly good shave, and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Battery operated, so you can bring it anywhere, easy to clean, and it does a very fine job with the shaving.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly worth the price and maybe a good bit more than that just to have a shaver at the office to get a quick trim before going out or before an important meeting.</li>
            <li>gives a very comfortable and clean shave.</li>
            <li>The most positive feature,  its Handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and after about 6 uses, it seems to give a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li>I travel most of the time and this little shaver is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s size makes it easily carried</li>
            <li>Cleaning is also easy, with or without water.</li>
            <li>I was leaving for an extended trip to a location where I wouldn&#x27;t have easy access to electricity.  </li>
            <li>It is incredibly easy to use, and you can&#x27;t lose it.</li>
            <li>But no, it is only a couple more dollars today than I paid three years ago and still a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>My face gets irritated easily</li>
            <li>out batteries on this thing isn&#x27;t just easy, it hints at how this should be handled by every device.&lt;br /&gt;The flip cover for the foil can&#x27;t be lost or dropped, the blade itself gave a close shave,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>The foil comes off easily for cleaning and you just rinse out the cutters (never use a brush on the foil).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such a great bargain for $12.98, that I bought three more to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>It is confortable, easy to handle, practical, versatile.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend that if you&#x27;re in the market for a battery operated shaver, choose the Braun 370.</li>
            <li>This shaver is excellent for those with light beards and for those requiring only quick shaves.</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Works very well and gives a good, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver is very good at removing all kinds of hair in non-facial areas, but it should come with a stick because my arms are not that long</li>
            <li>When I went for more than three days between shaves, it didn&#x27;t give as clean a shave on my neck--though my face shaved fine.  </li>
            <li>To Go albeit at pricing more reflective of true value.  </li>
            <li>This shaver has provided me great shaves for many years in many remote locations including Kilimanjaro, Switzerland, and hiking the Wonderland Trail around Mt Rainier.  </li>
            <li>May not be the best for those with heavy beard, but good enough, and simply amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>i thought what the heck...shaves almost as good as my new Braun FreeControl at home.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do the job of my blade and foam but for the purpose it&#x27;s intended it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>It shaves fine for me</li>
            <li>and it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>with NiMH rechargeables and the PocketGo works just fine with them.  </li>
            <li>But it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that its the best on the market but for a low budget or a first shaver it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li>If anyone else has this problem, it&#x27;s not that cumbersome to wear gloves and, as you can see, I can type just fine with them on.</li>
            <li>This is the best battery-powered pocket shaver I&#x27;ve found for less the twenty shekels.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine if you just want to control the stubble a bit</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more than adequate for that too.</li>
            <li>While it worked, it gave as good a shave as any rotary or vibrator type I have ever owned( I&#x27;ve been using   electric since I was very young)</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to change batteries.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Excellent Buy with tight budget.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to use, light weight, easy to clean......</li>
            <li>I bought 2 for home and in the car, they work fine for a light beard.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the improvements made to the P70 over my older models.</li>
            <li>the plus side, it is well designed for travel, has a nice safety lock in a closed position to keep it from turning on, cleans fairly easily, and has a good battery life for its two batteries.</li>
            <li>All in all, for what I paid for this, or even at 2 or 3 times what I paid, this is one of the best little shavers I&#x27;ve ever used and owned.</li>
            <li>This little shaver is awesome.</li>
            <li>to my surprise, this little, inexpensive shaver gives me the best shave that I ever had.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little shaver and had great features.</li>
            <li>I called Amazon and they confirmed to me that the price I&#x27;d paid for the P-70 was the correct price.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It shaves so close and comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially ideal for travel, although I&#x27;m using mine for everyday home use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean under running water, or you can just pop off the foil and shake it out for a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; cleaning.</li>
            <li>sideburns trimmer isn&#x27;t really too handy.  </li>
            <li>probably on your way to an important meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- extremely cheap &lt;br</li>
            <li>And that it is available for $20.00 was a bonus.  </li>
            <li>This filled the bill.  </li>
            <li>It is not as smooth as the 7-series</li>
            <li>When using it, you get the impression it is working because of the sound it makes.      </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why nobody can make a cheap shaver that works as well as the Shaveman, but the bottom line is they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The folks at Braun did a fantastic job with the design where you cannot turn on the thing if it is locked with the cover over.</li>
            <li>Essentially, this shaver is a great back-up for when I can&#x27;t shave with a blade.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, and it&#x27;s designed so it won&#x27;t accidentally turn on.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and ultra-convenient.  </li>
            <li>I would not use this as a primary shaver.</li>
            <li>If used under water, it leaks its oils used to keep the machine parts running smooth.</li>
            <li>Takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>East to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It seems like a great concept, but once you touch it to your neck, you&#x27;ll get ingrown hairs that will last for a week, and it misses 1/2 of the hairs in between the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Light weight.</li>
            <li>I have a relatively light beard.</li>
            <li>A CLOSE AND COMFORTABLE SHAVE.</li>
            <li>My Norelco is a great shaver also but just too big.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a great shaver</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver at a very low price.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a cheap travel razor, this is it.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, batteries available most anywhere and one doesn&#x27;t have to worry about voltage converters for travel outside of the U.S. (see my review of Kensington 33117</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave as the advanced shavers but considering the extremely cheap price, you cannot beat it.</li>
            <li>and I find no replacements are available.    </li>
            <li>* Easy to clean -</li>
            <li>Is it comfortable to use? &lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light,</li>
            <li>One great feature is that it won&#x27;t turn on unless its flipped open for use; so no worries at the airport.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s cheap, I can just leave it in my car without worrying about being stolen and use it</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>After reviewing all the ones I found available, I chose the Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>For the money, the Braun is a great buy and you can get replacement heads so it will last.  </li>
            <li>However, this product is available at Walgreens for a cheaper price than what I bought it for here.</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy with the snap in brush and running the head under water.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s cheap, but it&#x27;s cheap with a reason.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it in our RV where we may not have 120 volts for a corded shaver or charger, and its compact size and light weight are also advantages.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for my desk and briefcase.  </li>
            <li>The shave is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is waterproof and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Alkaline batteries also work well, however the lower voltage rechargeable batteries still provide the power to shave smoothly.      </li>
            <li>Still a good deal for the money and easier to pack than my old unit.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave everytime - ideal for late for the office situations and overniters.</li>
            <li>I have loved my 10 year old Braun foil shaver, but it&#x27;s no longer available.  </li>
            <li>This gives an incredibly comfortable smooth shave, quick to use, easy to clean, washable, good battery life so far (3 weeks strong with daily use &amp; still going), can be slipped into your bag/briefcase, easy for touch ups, great for travel as no separate plugs needed, the spin-over foil protection also stops it being switched on by accident.    </li>
            <li>Neck was not so good and had to resort to using my old shaver to get some of the missed hairs.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that the Braun 370 is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>and then I bought one for myself and it&#x27;s been a good value so far</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;m happy with it, and can&#x27;t help wondering why people spend so much more for other shavers.</li>
            <li>The overall design is very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this shaver, although, my 99 cents shaver did the same until I lost it :).</li>
            <li>The shave is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not spend much more money on a different shaver that I most likely would not have been happy with.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works pretty good but do not expect a fast shave.    </li>
            <li>For the price, this is the best little shaver around!</li>
            <li>own an earlier version of this shaver also, still working fine, but the newer version does give a better shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this model and the previous Braun AA shaver for many years, and find they are great for traveling, and weekend use at home.</li>
            <li>but then I&#x27;m not sure what a perfect shaver would look like</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about of month--still with the original set of batteries.</li>
            <li>WORTH the money!</li>
            <li>and it is still on the original batteries.</li>
            <li>The result is two-fold: the whiskers aren&#x27;t flattened against the skin (allowing a closer shave on fewer passes) and irritation is significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say we got our money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>This shaver is ultimately just &#x27;ok&#x27; -- ok for short trips or stuffing in the glove box, not so good for day-to-day use or getting an all-around good, close shave.    </li>
            <li>Ideal for travel because it is small, easy to clean, has no annoying cord to keep track of, and is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- clean shave</li>
            <li>If all you care about is getting a clean shave than this is IT.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and clean for an electric, we all know the closest shaves are with a blade and foam.  </li>
            <li>I can use it while at my laptop or while reading to clean up my chin and neck.</li>
            <li>but besides that it&#x27;s an ease to clean with the mini brush</li>
            <li>Bought this to keep my face clean shaved between hair cuts.....</li>
            <li>Luckily I found them all, but it did take a while to figure out where they fit in.  </li>
            <li>Plus you can just wash it under the tap to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I have had mine as my regular shaver for more than three years and it has always been effective and reliable.  </li>
            <li>And can be rinsed clean.</li>
            <li>A breeze to clean.</li>
            <li>Also, if you use it a couple of times and don&#x27;t clean expect to be cleaning your clothes too since during operation</li>
            <li>This razor just can not give me a clean shave under any circumstance.   </li>
            <li>Originally purchased for under $20 in 2008 to introduce my child with special needs to the world of shaving.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this razor is much lighter and more compact than most, so it has a different heft, and it works best when held nearly perpendicular to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Well made, good heft, clever cover and switch, shaves very close.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased it almost two years ago as strictly a &#x27;travel&#x27; shaver to use on trips, but it quickly became my &#x27;every day&#x27; shaver because of the quality of the shave and ease of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s pretty much waterproof</li>
            <li>It generally does an excellent job and has held up over the last 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I was looking for an electric shaver to replace manual shaving, I might try a full size rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good value that I bought two; one for travel and one for the office.</li>
            <li>It is what it is.. a good back up or travel razor.</li>
            <li>I use rechargeable batteries and keep it where I can do a quick clean up.  </li>
            <li>It misses patches and requires many passes to get much of anything at all.  </li>
            <li>and it not only gives me a good shave</li>
            <li>Its definately good as a travel shaver, but i may not like the irritation if i have to use it daily.</li>
            <li>I keep one set in the charger and one set in the shaver and switch them every couple of days, so it is always shaving at full power.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>So much so, that I&#x27;m going to buy two more today.</li>
            <li>Just about as good as any I&#x27;ve ever had, although again it maybe takes a bit longer than say the Shick TR3 twin-foil which is my current wet shaver of choice (another great deal at about $35 BTW).</li>
            <li>I was, like so many others, ready to praise this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The design is really cool</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s cool:  </li>
            <li>I guess they say that you get waht you pay for, and I think that is true in this case.  </li>
            <li>God, it can hurt your skin so badly, I really don&#x27;t understand why it could get so many 5&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Super clean shave.</li>
            <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t give a good shave.</li>
            <li>, it is perfect when I&#x27;m working late and want to get rid of five-o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>It has good power, gives a nice shave, and is still small.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough for quick touch-ups when you&#x27;re in a hurry</li>
            <li>AA batteries are really ideal for a travel shaver as well, they&#x27;re an international standard and cheap and available everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I liked my old Braun shaver, and since this will only see occasional service, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Fantastic little shaver, great for roadtrips or storing at the office for when you forget.  </li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s floating head rechargeable shaver was my favorite for many years as long as replacement screens and combs were available.</li>
            <li>This morning, while enjoying another great shave I was curious to look on Amazon again and see if perhaps the low price I paid for it was some kind of computer error, as it does as good of a job as shavers costing ten times as much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of shaving, this little guy does almost as good a job (and better in some hard-to-get areas like my neck) as the Norelco.</li>
            <li>The 3 AA unit performed like my home rechargeable shaver (not Braun), but this one takes a little more time and work to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>performing it&#x27;s task in providing a quick shave anywhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great for travelling or quick touchups at the office.  </li>
            <li>It recharges quickly as well.</li>
            <li>very lite, very compact, amazingly close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this to do quick shaves and it does just that.  </li>
            <li>Super razor for the price</li>
            <li>Received the shaver in the mail quickly and appeared to be as advertised.</li>
            <li>End result is that I used the shaver for quick touch-ups</li>
            <li>I have a older version of the Braun which I have  used for many years to remove the 5 oclock shadow.  </li>
            <li>For a quick shave or touch up that might take some people with thinner hairs</li>
            <li>Main benefit:  no charger or power cords to worry about &amp; no need to make sure it&#x27;s charged.  </li>
            <li>But with a musician&#x27;s schedule there are times when I have to grab a quick shave en route to a gig.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which reminds me: I gotta grab a quick shave before I head out.</li>
            <li>They asked for many more and I shipped same.</li>
            <li>The design and the idea is great, but the cut is below average.  </li>
            <li>First, the Braun includes a trimmer-an important feature for me.  </li>
            <li>Child has major sensory issues as well as intellectual disability, so the need was for something safe, easy to use and that would not cause sensory overload.    </li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to carry and gives a near razor quality shave.</li>
            <li>The various reviews I read generally had very good things to say about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, fast, effective and easy to  clean and it only uses 2 AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>The quality of shave is very high for a travel razor which is great on a long trip.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new shaver and decided to gamble the $14 the Braun 370 PocketGo costs, and am I ever glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This battery-operated shaver shaves as well as my new Norelco rotary razor that retails for about $100 more.  </li>
            <li>When these wore out - the foil that touches you face will go before the razor will but a replacement will cost you more than a new razor</li>
            <li>I read the previous reviews, bought one and agree 100% with all of the great things</li>
            <li>The unit is small and light weight making it great for travel.  </li>
            <li>It shaves better than my electric shaver at home, although not as well as pretty much any blade razor.    </li>
            <li>That is when I found that Braun had the same excellent head on a shaver (PocketGo) where I could use store-bought long life alkaline batteries.</li>
            <li>But for a throw-away back up, it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Both it and this model are very lightweight and small, which is what makes it so perfect to keep in a travel kit.</li>
            <li>Very compact and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with electric shavers, you probably know exactly what we&#x27;re talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and unlike many in its price range it actually works and works well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have purchased it, but unfortunately it really is only good for a quick clean-up of a relatively short growth.  </li>
            <li>While this little jewel is never going to win an award for &lt;br /&gt;delivering</li>
            <li>This is one great little shaver.</li>
            <li>It is a great little shaver to use on the go.</li>
            <li>This little battery powered shaver is great for road trips when you&#x27;re going to be away from power cords for a while.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver for commuting, to keep in your briefcase, or to leave at the office.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still a great little razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for emergency to get things in control, but I use razors as my everyday.</li>
            <li>I got this thing for free by spending hotel points, but I like it so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;The design is solid, feels substantial, and amazingly for the price tag is fully immersible which means it can be used with shave cream, shave soap etc.</li>
            <li>Very compact and light.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it to give it a try....</li>
            <li>(Also a success, just posted a review of that one.)</li>
            <li>Compact and powerful.  </li>
            <li>I like this shaver as a portable , handy item that fits in my medical bag, or overnight kit, in the car, etc.</li>
            <li>Price is nice-most replacement screens cost more than the complete shaver.  </li>
            <li>It offers a great shave, it is well built, and 2 AA batteries last for weeks.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes to use a normal razor first and then clean-up and get really close shave using the Shaver.</li>
            <li>It wasnt worth the money in my opinion, but then again you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Although I always shave prior to a shower, it&#x27;s nice to know that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several electric shavers over the years (Braun and Panasonic) from different price ranges and the Braun PocketGo P-70 shaves as good or better than any of the others.</li>
            <li>A fresh set of AA&#x27;s probably lasts me between 10-15 shaves before I begin to notice that they need replacing ...</li>
            <li>Among the hundreds of enthusiastic reviewiers, I noticed one that gave one star and said the shaver doesn&#x27;t do its job and only hurt his face.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful, compact razor.  </li>
            <li>in fact, I now own my third one.  </li>
            <li>The pop-out hair trimmer is useful for light-duty trimming between hair cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is probably worth twice</li>
            <li>(I find 4 is good), so it&#x27;s not particularly fast.    </li>
            <li>Nice simple battery access that is sealed away from water.</li>
            <li>As such, it&#x27;s a good, very compact Braun shaver (with trimmer)</li>
            <li>The P70 is a more substantial unit and address the problem the old one had of accidently being turned on while being jared around in my vehicles.</li>
            <li>But there are rare times I don&#x27;t have time  for that.  </li>
            <li>You can get fresh AA&#x27;s literally anywhere.</li>
            <li>I keep the batteries out, so they are always fresh.</li>
            <li>good portability, but rough on skin</li>
            <li>I also own an earlier model of this shaver-about 3 years old--and it gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li>It does the job as good or better than the much more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to close it completely or the batteries will die.</li>
            <li>, you may want to look elsewhere because the single foil doesn&#x27;t catch longer hairs exceptionally well ...</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job, even dry, and that&#x27;s a plus when in a hurry as I often am.</li>
            <li>My old pocket shaver from braun worked great but needed a new film cover, was cheaper to buy new shaver.  </li>
            <li>At first I was reluctant to do that, but I eventually found out that it works quite well to clean the shaver, with no ill effects.    </li>
            <li>This is a marvellous little razor and just as good as any full size electric.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, I think it does as good a job as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Battery life seems good since I&#x27;d be recharging by now with my other</li>
            <li>but the service was exceptionaly good, I recieved it much before the schedule date and it is exactly the same as shown on web!</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>As it turned out, my friend was right.  </li>
            <li>Oh, right.</li>
            <li>And, the price is right.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>So I use gloves, just as I&#x27;m wearing gloves to type right now.</li>
            <li>my higher end one (which does NOT do a better job shaving) is in a case that came with it and required frequent recharging.     </li>
            <li>It is very well designed to protect the foil and be kept clean.   </li>
            <li>I am very disapointed with this razors ability to provide me with a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to clean.</li>
            <li>a great little shaver!</li>
            <li>What a great little razor!  </li>
            <li>This little guy is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>This little shaver is amazing!</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the trimmer is very lightweight...doesn&#x27;t do a great job, but hey, my old one didn&#x27;t have one at all!</li>
            <li>Great design, as usual, from Braun.  </li>
            <li>I have a light beard and normally use a Norelco at home.</li>
            <li>The shaver design is cool as it&#x27;s very compact, has no cords and runs for up to a month on a set of batteries if using it every day for a couple of minutes per day.    </li>
            <li>I normally use a Norelco and the Braun shaves as close as that but not as comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the oomph nor the really nice sideburn trimmer that would make it a good choice for daily chopping of a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>A very economical shaver that works as good as more expensive shavers</li>
            <li>The trimmer is tiny but perfect for those little repairs when you are on the road.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the quality and performance of this little unit.</li>
            <li>But as a second razor or for occasional use, it&#x27;s pretty near to perfect.    </li>
            <li>Cuts great for 2-3 months maximum until cheap frail head begins to wear thin and blades  </li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to clean with running water.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a rotorary action in my shaver, but this inexpensive Chinese shaver is good for travel.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt waste too many batteries, and if u use rechargeable batteries you will save even more.</li>
            <li>Great shaver &amp; it works better than my expensive Braun.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to clean.</li>
            <li>How quickly do you have to replace the whole unit/or blade that goes with it?</li>
            <li>Since mine has only light duty I can&#x27;t comment on battery life (still on the originals) or how it performs as a primary shaver.  </li>
            <li>This was strong enough for his full face beard.</li>
            <li>I found this little gadget when my rotary-head Norelco razor was dropping hints of its impending demise and thought I&#x27;d pick up the Braun until I found another really good razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a good little shaver to pack in my suitcase for travel.  </li>
            <li>The rotary-head Norelco was probably better at shaving a 3- or 4-day old beard, but the Braun has been perfectly fine for daily or every-other-day use.  </li>
            <li>swivel cap (protects shave head), safety lock switch button, secure battery compartment, side burn trimmer, cleaning brush and last but not least, you can clean the shave head by running water through it!</li>
            <li>This new model also allows you to clean it by rinsing with water.  </li>
            <li>Now, with a potential target demographic of 100 million customers, you would think the shaving companies would be a wee bit more interested than they appear to be where it comes to a portable electric shaver that you can keep &amp; recharge in the car.  </li>
            <li>The M90 looks pretty much exactly like the P-70, but guess what?  </li>
            <li>do a great job for users having thick beards.  </li>
            <li>Of course I had to try it out first.</li>
            <li>The first shave was as close as an $80.00 Panasonic or an $40.00 Braun.</li>
            <li>I bought my first \\&quot;PocketGo\\</li>
            <li>I went through one set of batteries (2 AA, the unit is not rechargeable) after the first month or so.</li>
            <li>First time electric shaver user.</li>
            <li>I use more often than my standard Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to shaving first with the Norelco, then doing a touch-up pass with one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just ordered ten more in case they stop making them.</li>
            <li>2 double A&#x27;s, not the closest tightest shave, but on the go, does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>First it comes with Duracell batteries, which after a month I still have not had to change.</li>
            <li>Its small size is great since I do not have the room in my bathroom for a whole charging station and razor to sit.</li>
            <li>Powerful and very comparable to my Norelco three head shaver...</li>
            <li>on flat surfaces with flat hairs, great...</li>
            <li>I wore out the first one (purchased in 1989).</li>
            <li>Wet shave feature is a nice option</li>
            <li>Pick up some electric razor pre-shave gel (my personal favorite is Lectric Shave Ultra) and be ready to be wowed!</li>
            <li>First they tell me to throw it away</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun!</li>
            <li>I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 only because the trim attachment could be better.</li>
            <li>As most people say, you can actually use it on an every day basis!</li>
            <li>Overall he says it&#x27;s ok, but perhaps would work best as a backup, especially if you have coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>If you think you must use a blade to get a perfect, close shave, you&#x27;re wrong.  </li>
            <li>I have never used an electric razor before and this is my first time.  </li>
            <li>it is a big design improvement and shaves even better.  </li>
            <li>The first thing to give out on it is screen.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I bought was a pair of AA NiMH batteries with the highest mA hour rating.  </li>
            <li>After only a couple of uses, I have not had any problem with irritation and the shave is OK.  </li>
            <li>For the first couple of days it agitated my skin</li>
            <li>Sure enough it was and the product is all it is described to be!!!</li>
            <li>I have just taken my first trip using it.</li>
            <li>I am a first time electric shave user.</li>
            <li>Even after my first try there was almost no irritation.</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the reviews, and the ones I don&#x27;t agree with I will simply ignore and not bring attention to their sinful lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My only suggestion to Braun is to make the bottom square so it will stand on end better in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>and I was glad to find that it works just as well on rechargeable AAs and gets about the same number of shaves on a charge that my Norelco did.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s slightly bigger and it has better</li>
            <li>Very noisy!  </li>
            <li>And the electric motor will wear out quicker with the higher voltage.</li>
            <li>I had a Titanium Turbo for a year before this razor and was very satisfied with its ability to cut my tougher than average beard.   </li>
            <li>It arrived on-time (thanks Amazon!)</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for in an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It might cut short stubble OK, but it just won&#x27;t cut a three day growth of my graying blond beard at all.  </li>
            <li>but you could get a better shave if you clicked you heels together and wished for your facial hair to fall out.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty well and it is pretty hand since it is cordless and runs on batteries.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than the refill kit for a Braun 360, and you can wash it with hot water.  </li>
            <li>, you have a shaver ready to rock and roll!    </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s about the same as my $100 unit (maybe better)</li>
            <li>If the shave sucked, I would be the first to tell you.  </li>
            <li>, how can something so unbelievably cheap be getting such rave reviews, but it&#x27;s all true.  </li>
            <li>Braun makes the best razors but they are expensive.  </li>
            <li>I bought ten more on line to save on shipping.  </li>
            <li>This newer version looks decidedly better but the trimmer slides sideways, not up, and is a pain to use - a definite step backwards -</li>
            <li>of Nov 2011, everything is as it was when I first started using it in 09.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it as an everyday shaving device, but it is good for &#x27;touch ups&#x27; here and there between shaves with a manual razor.</li>
            <li>Two minor things; the trimmer would work better if it was at a larger angle.i had to make sure my thumb was not on switch while shaving as I unintentionally turned razor off by mistake a couple of times.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly smaller shaving area and may not shave as quickly, but I don&#x27;t think the difference is significant.  </li>
            <li>The battery life on this thing is incredible, I&#x27;ve used it at least twice a week for the last 3 weeks to shave my entire face/throat, and the original batteries are still going strong.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only had to recharge them once so far, which seems amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those rare cases of getting more than you expected.</li>
            <li>Though it wasn&#x27;t always easy to find replacements in local stores, I&#x27;m sure the internet will solve this problem for me in the future.  </li>
            <li>It is almost as good as my much more expensive Panasonic rechargeable in use at home.</li>
            <li>It really struggles if I let my stubble grow out for more than a day, since I have fairly coarse beard hair.  </li>
            <li>You should own this shaver, if not for a primary, at least for a back-up.</li>
            <li>The construction is solid, the result is good, the battery last longer than others.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver after reading the mostly positive reviews of it here.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver before my vacation based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>but if you order just the cutter and screen, the cost is pretty close to what the whole thing cost.  </li>
            <li>my husband has burn up so many plugging them in and letting them charge too long</li>
            <li>In fact, it worked so well that I decided to get a \\&quot;real Braun shaver\\&quot; and bought a higher end model.</li>
            <li>More importantly, this shaver enabled my child to become independent in shaving within a very short time.  </li>
            <li>It will not cut light hairs, and works best on heavy thick beards.</li>
            <li>Even my old Norelco that was falling apart was full when I opened it up.      </li>
            <li>This shaver is quite small and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Does it provide a darn good shave on a thick beard, yes - very much so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s self-contained foil protector and trimmer are good features not available on most other travel razors.</li>
            <li>Great little gadget!!!</li>
            <li>While out on a week-long mission, as some guys are trying to either dry shave or make do with bottles of water, I&#x27;ve been able to whip out this shaver and get touched up for the day.    </li>
            <li>This shaver works pretty well, shaves reasonably close and is a very functional design.</li>
            <li>PocketGo renders a highly respectable dry shave.  </li>
            <li>The  battery life is very good with 2 double AAs (easily get a few months if you shave like I do with wet razor first).    </li>
            <li>This little gem is easy to use, well made (I dropped it on cement), and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>It certainly blows away anything Norelco has to offer.  </li>
            <li>Given all of this, I&#x27;d certainly buy this razor again.</li>
            <li>spots on my face, it will not shave certain areas unless I concentrate on them</li>
            <li>and I am in pure shock because I bought this unit from Amazon for $11.99.  </li>
            <li>The blade is super sharp and the motor is strong.</li>
            <li>not only is this easy for him to use, but it also works very well.</li>
            <li>It works just fine and the batteries last longer than I thought.</li>
            <li>I just took it to Costa Rica and it was still running fine after 15 days of shaves on the same set of 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, its a nice little razor.  </li>
            <li>It is very good if you shave every day, however, if you miss a day, it will have a hard time on the neck, and you may be left with</li>
            <li>It gets my mustache area very well, but I can always feel some fine left over chin stubble.  </li>
            <li>It was my first purchase of a foil razor, vice a rotary, and I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>At first I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is a great little razor that performs like the bigger electric razors.</li>
            <li>Use it for travel to bring in my carry-on luggage and still use it every day as it gets those areas which a large Panasonic (nice but more expensive) doesn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>After much detective work, I settled on this, the Braun Model P-70.  </li>
            <li>Really suprised me on how well it works, You just have to remember its a shaver not a razor.</li>
            <li>My husband had mentioned that he would really like a battery operated shaver for his birthday.  </li>
            <li>Seller was on time and very responsive to my emails.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Braun battery operated shavers for years and have found them to be very reliable and convenient to use while traveling.</li>
            <li>Portable, fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>All you have to do when you receive it, is pop the batteries in, and it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li>This shaver passes security and works very well.</li>
            <li>I like this shaver so much, and it&#x27;s so inexpensive, that I bought two this time around.</li>
            <li>Travels very well.      </li>
            <li>They will think you spent a lot more.</li>
            <li>It has performed very well.    </li>
            <li>I just rubbed my chin to feel how smooth this shaver left it.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really know what to expect</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.[[ASIN:B00007M9SU Braun 370 PocketGo Battery Operated Shaver]]</li>
            <li>But doing so irritated my skin too much.</li>
            <li>and I ended up looking like I needed a shave for much of the trip.</li>
            <li>now use it as my daily shaver and it does better than my former daily shaver, a Panasonic wet/dry, which cost 3 times more.</li>
            <li>The shaver also seems to be really well made.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close, closer than my Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It even gets the neck hairs very well.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to like it,</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve spent a lot more than 10 or 11 bucks on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product use is intended for the very tender underams of a pre-teen.</li>
            <li>I tried it once almost 10 years ago and it had really irritated my skin then.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It works really well.</li>
            <li>This pocket shaver works very well.</li>
            <li>Spend some money and get a real razor.</li>
            <li>They really help if I am going out after work or going to the gym.     </li>
            <li>Otherwise I really like the shaver for the cost and the way it stores.    </li>
            <li>Cheap enough ($10 ea)</li>
            <li>He says it shaves really well for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>real problem</li>
            <li>I would only recomend this to someone who has a light beard.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Finally, although it&#x27;s washable, the instructions tell you to coat the shaving screen with a light machine oil or cooking oil after each washing.   </li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using it this whole time and traveling with it as part of his carry-on luggage</li>
            <li>The ability to shave in the shower is a real bonus and does improve the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>I enjoy having a smaller electric for travel.</li>
            <li>but at the cost they are selling the whole shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits very well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;Uses</li>
            <li>it really gets kinda ragged when I used this.</li>
            <li>He loves it very compact.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and does not hurt his face being a teen with teen issues</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far from being worthy as a main use shaver.</li>
            <li>According to him, he has a lot more stubble left after a shave than with his old Remington.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as close a shave like a good razor gives but not too far from it (and don&#x27;t forget this is an inexpensive travel shaver so some of Braun&#x27;s more expensive shavers are probably closer yet)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A fresh set of batteries will last through a week long vacation but it is wise to keep an extra set.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this shaver from a local drug store before heading out of town.  </li>
            <li>For me this shaver works better than any other at any price.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a battery-powered Norelco, and it is a much better buy at only a slightly higher price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 other models of this shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than all the other electric full-sized shavers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for travel use but now use it daily for over a month now.    </li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that you can clean it in running water.</li>
            <li>IT IS SMALL, HANDY, DOES THE JOB, AND THE PRICE IS ABSOLUTELY A GIFT.  </li>
            <li>but if you need a clean, proper shave you will not get it with this.</li>
            <li>But I like it so much, I am using it as my main razor.</li>
            <li>It does get nice and close for a long lasting shave.</li>
            <li>This small razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>This model is now called the Braun Mobile Shaver - M90 and its suitable for folks with not so heavy beard growth.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Norelco rotary shavers in the past (someone told me that foil shavers cause more skin irritation) and have never gotten a good shave with them, so for the past number of years, I have been using a Mach3.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shaver, but it&#x27;s difficult to give it a better rating than 2 stars (which is mostly for the design itself).</li>
            <li>Using it as I do it doesn&#x27;t have to cut a full day&#x27;s growth of beard, only a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li>As long as the PocketGo is clean, it shaves VERY close.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as clean as a normal shave, but does the trick if you only have one day&#x27;s growth, maybe two.</li>
            <li>* Small, portable and easy to travel with or for a quick shave in the car.    </li>
            <li>These are surprisingly good little razors -- especially when you consider the price.</li>
            <li>If you order the P-70, you&#x27;ll be wasting your money when its &#x27;new version&#x27; costs $22!  </li>
            <li>Very few have given me both a clean &amp; comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Men&#x27;s Shaver]]), the PocketGo P-70 gives a 10x better shave in half the time.  </li>
            <li>Since it does not need any charging circuitry and has a plastic case the shaver weighs less than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the older model for a few years now and its time to get the newer, more modern looking unit.  </li>
            <li>I typically pay more money for a pack of razor blades.</li>
            <li>Clever design - no cap to lose.  </li>
            <li>I used to have the older model of this shaver before it broke.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is decent, provided you don&#x27;t use it as an every day shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cleverly designed unit, from the rotating foil guard, the pop-out trimmer, to the built-in cleaning brush and water-tight battery compartment.</li>
            <li>I have taken it on many trips and the batteries last and last.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to replace an older Braun razor that was not specifically designed for travel.  </li>
            <li>missing parts supplied click stops to the rotating shell, which gave good quality feel, but had nothing to do with actual shaving.    </li>
            <li>Sure you have to go back over your face several times</li>
            <li>if you only use this as a travel shaver you will find it useful and very convenient.</li>
            <li>Got this after my older version of the Braun 370 broke.</li>
            <li>(Can&#x27;t complain about the older one breaking...</li>
            <li>I ordered the 370 water resistant version on amazon but ended up receiving the older non water resistant version which was the one I had been using until it broke.  </li>
            <li>The silver one also has a nicer look and feel, although the trimmer on the older one is easier to use for me.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is, it probably makes more sense to replace the entire shaver than to replace a foil at around $8.</li>
            <li>Battery operated and has a cleaning brush and a clever cover for the blade</li>
            <li>i had the older model of this shaver (braun 375) for 2-3 years before the shaving foil broke.</li>
            <li>Thinking, naturally, that if it lasted me a month it will have still been a sound investment as it was priced so incredibly low.      </li>
            <li>While the price and size of this shaver is okay, it just didn&#x27;t shave that well unless I went over the same area several times.</li>
            <li>Shave was decent on my face.</li>
            <li>The head on the P70 is also a stronger unit then the one on my older model.   </li>
            <li>It will even do a decent job hitting that unruly hair that us over 50 get in those places we would rather not have hair; nose and ears.  </li>
            <li>If I could find a decent shaver I might shave twice a week maybe, just to get around the \\&quot;toothpaste in the beard\\&quot; problem.  </li>
            <li>My main gripe is the lack of a built-in rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, again particularly at this price.</li>
            <li>It does a remarkably good job of shaving plain and simple.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>No need to buy those highly priced shavers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as a portable or home shaver.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend ...</li>
            <li>A high seller rating and the feeling of a hefty quality build.  </li>
            <li>Even my Remington, which was given to me on my graduateion from high school in 1955 (yes, 1955) gave a comparable shave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>During that trip, I grew to love this little shaver.  </li>
            <li>Spending 100-200 bucks will buy you some extras gismos for gadget-heads, but little meaningful gains.  </li>
            <li>I really love this little braun.</li>
            <li>I had to use the brush to clean my old one, and the brush against the screen (a big no-no!) is what did it in.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I took the Braun 370 on my last vacation, and the AA batteries easily lasted for two weeks&#x27; worth of shaves while I was away.  </li>
            <li>This bad boy is really awesome.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it a few months ago for a trip overseas and was absolutely blown away by its performance, so much so that it is now my primary razor.  </li>
            <li>It trims very close for an electric, and is even lighter than my old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recomended to anyone who wants to start using electric shavers, and to anyone who want to change an old shaver.</li>
            <li>Pretty good shave - heavy dark beards might not fare so well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this razor; instead of spending $20 on this, spend $40 on a much better one.</li>
            <li>(I just love the guy that rated it 4 stars because it missed a few hairs)  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s true, and not unexpected for an $18 shaver.</li>
            <li>that price, nothing better if you don&#x27;t care about cut some missing hairs.</li>
            <li>The finished shave was almost as smooth as a regular razor, the difference was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>use it everyday in between razor shaves: mostly just on my mustache while letting the beard scruff grow in.</li>
            <li>I normally use a blade and, when on trips over 1 week, do take a blade and shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>Unless you normally travel with a bottle of Wesson Oil, that&#x27;s an inconvenience.</li>
            <li>I sort of thought the price was too good to be true although I don&#x27;t see why shavers are so expensive generally speaking.  </li>
            <li>It is very portable, has the cover built-in, can be used dry or wet, runs on regular 2 AA batteries, and surprisingly for its size (and price)</li>
            <li>I was excited about this little shaver at first.  </li>
            <li>But the other three worked fine.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller version which will turn on in your brief case unless you tape it the has a cap which is easy to misplace or drop in the car.  </li>
            <li>Braun calls it a travel razor; right now, it&#x27;s my only razor.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ordering a third right now.  </li>
            <li>This cheapy little shaver is very well made,but does not feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is cheap compared with other electric shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am not sure that I would use the PocketGo as an everyday device I can see why many would and in fact many are doing so.</li>
            <li>It shaves as well, or better than some high dollar Braun and Panasonic shavers I have owned in the past.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing new.</li>
            <li>We live in Taiwan, and it is HUMID.  </li>
            <li>(the shaver won&#x27;t just quit on you, it gives you plenty of warning that you&#x27;ll be needing a new set of batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new model has the added advantage of the head being washable under a sink.</li>
            <li>Would you recommend it for the tender underams of someone new to shaving?</li>
            <li>and it works like it was new.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a new one to have in my car for emergencies.</li>
            <li>The new NiZn rechargable AA&#x27;s are 1.6 volts (and come out of the charger at 1.85).</li>
            <li>Go figure ,20 bucks for a new one over 5 years,I&#x27;ll probably be writting another review in about another 5 years.</li>
            <li>I saw this new model in Hong Kong while traveling on business.  </li>
            <li>Flew home to the USA, opened the new packaged unit and tried it.  </li>
            <li>Bring an extra set of batteries and you&#x27;re probably good for a couple of weeks at least.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller and doesn&#x27;t cut as well, but I guess I don&#x27;t really use it much anyway.    </li>
            <li>Anyone buying this to replace an older razor might hang on to the old case and the cleaning brush as well.         </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand how the designers, who obviously put so much though into this thing, let it come to market while this ineffective.</li>
            <li>This shaver fit all the criteria and has lasted through multiple use/abuse on a daily basis-until today-three years later(The foil has split on one corner).  </li>
            <li>I get as good results with the Braun 370 as I did with two previous (and much more expensive)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this little shaver!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little shaver if you only have a day or two&#x27;s growth (depending on your facial hair of course).  </li>
            <li>This little shaver works so well that I&#x27;m tempted to use it to replace my older Norelco as my primary shaver.</li>
            <li>I love how this product is small, lightweight and compact...</li>
            <li>Higher end models from norelco does just as well of a job for me compared with this low cost shaver.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is also less user friendly than the older model.  </li>
            <li>much better than I hoped for and rivaling more expensive options!  </li>
            <li>I have this unit probably  for last 2 years, I also had first generation of this unit which was 5615.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I subsequently received an email from Amazon saying \\&quot;For health and safety reasons, we don&#x27;t want the original item back, so please dispose of it at your convenience.\\</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m still on the first set of double A batteries !</li>
            <li>Not usually using an electric or being used to one</li>
            <li>It still after over a year,gives me the same close shaves as when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;ve changed it, but it looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>If you had electric shavers before, a lot of people will agree that there is little difference (at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced) between an electric foil shaver worth $100 and this portable one which is worth less than $</li>
            <li>I have a rechargeable shaver, which is &gt;5 years old, and I new I needed to get a new one or grow a beard again.  </li>
            <li>This afternoon, I shaved over the stubble and got down to smooth skin....</li>
            <li>After shaving with blades for the past 12 years I have always been hesitant to even try an electric but this little thing is great.</li>
            <li>I use the razor, as my primary shaver, everyday and would highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you&#x27;re ready for a new experience (or just need a new shaver) check out Braun&#x27;s line and reviews on various sites.</li>
            <li>This shaver is now in the trash along with my old one and I am off to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nearly a year since I first posted the remarks above on this razor</li>
            <li>Fortunately it was not too expensive, but I think you are better off paying a few more bucks and getting a proper shaver</li>
            <li>This is one case where the item does not live up to the reviews which is rare for Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty scared that if you don&#x27;t push it correctly, it might be easy to break and it is kind of hard to use, especially if you have really thick</li>
            <li>With all the positive reviews, it may just be the type of facial hair I have is incompatible with this razor.  </li>
            <li>However, the real proof in the pudding for me was when I removed the grill to clean it after having it for several months and there was only a tiny bit of whisker in there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Takes widely available AA batteries that last a long time&lt;br /&gt;Durable (3 years so far and still going)&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>On my last trip, I swapped my much more expensive travel razor for this remarkable little gem.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the new modern looks of the P70</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as fast and just a little more inconsistent than my dry shaver of choice, the Remington MS2 line, so I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for it at home now that I&#x27;m done testing.</li>
            <li>Personal items like razors have a feel that some will find more or less to their liking and some people who&#x27;ve grown used to a rotary-head razor might not care for this foil head on the Braun.  </li>
            <li>My only grip is that I&#x27;ve had two of these recent models (the 370) and the foils broke quite quickly on both.</li>
            <li>Am I the only one who thinks the new Braun pocket travel shaver is inferior to the old Braun Pocket Twist model?!?!?!  </li>
            <li>no mess!</li>
            <li>You cannot get a closer shave unless you shave against the grain with a regular razor, which will almost certainly give you razor burn.</li>
            <li>For no obvious reason, it has large gaps on either side of the screen, so shavings tend to just fall out during use.    </li>
            <li>I invite suggestions for a new shaver that shaves nearly as well as blade, has a rechargeable/replaceable battery that will run for hours and produces no black powder from comb to foil wear and tear.</li>
            <li>I find that it takes a little longer to get that smooth feel, but the convenience and price make up for this.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get a couple of these Braun P-70s at a ridiculously low single-digit price through Amazon a few months ago, and the quality and reliability is so good that it&#x27;s become my everyday go-to shaver.</li>
            <li>small light and portable and a decent shave too.</li>
            <li>Sharp and quick.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased two units believing portable shavers may not last very long or the possibility that I may break or lose it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot beleive I only spent 14 dollars on such a great little razor.</li>
            <li>This shaver is not as powerful as the more expensive plug-in type shavers</li>
            <li>However, for me it shaves very efficiently and comfortably and in addition to using it for travel I frequently use it late in the day to give me a clean-shaven look before going out to dinner, parties, etc.  </li>
            <li>I still have it and it works great, I am just afraid that because it is that old that it will give out just when you need it.</li>
            <li>Batteries last forever, the shave is very close, and the cutter and foil have lasted far longer than competing products.  </li>
            <li>Completely self contained with case, brush and trimmer built in.</li>
            <li>Completely waterproof.</li>
            <li>off\\&quot; if left on for 3 hours straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite surprised</li>
            <li>But one thing I can tell you up front is that I have a Norelco 8825 XL rotary whose replacement heads alone (which need replacing every six moths or so) cost twice as much as this entire razor.</li>
            <li>But it hasn&#x27;t worked for me so far.</li>
            <li>I am looking for replacement foil and cutter block for my old 5615...</li>
            <li>This very low priced shaver does just as well as electric shavers that cost five times as much.</li>
            <li>This razor is very portable, batteries last for weeks/months at a time.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>The shaver completely misses the hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li>On flatter areas of my face, I get as smooth a shave as I would with a regular wet shave razor and foam, without the irritation I get from my sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that even with months between trips, I can simply slip in a set of back-up batteries and be ready.</li>
            <li>I keep one of these in my car to use nearly every day</li>
            <li>(He used to have an old plug in shaver just like this one) and I will send the unopened one to a friend&#x27;s husband in Iraq.  </li>
            <li>After receiving I tried it out that evening and was totally surprised at the quality shave I received.</li>
            <li>However, the old unit used 3 AA and this uses 2 AA.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly sensitive neck and this shaver did not cause any razor burn whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Shaving was about as fast as a regular electric shaver.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric razors all of my adult life, and almost all of them have been Braun models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d not recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these in early October.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this shaver, I recently purchased a second one that I&#x27;ve tucked away still sealed in its packaging for that time when the one that I&#x27;m currently using finally lives out its life (e.g. the foil and/or blades need replacing).</li>
            <li>I bought this razor when my old one died.  </li>
            <li>I have no irritation after shaving, which I could not say about my old razor.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re deployed, you&#x27;re not always near an outlet.</li>
            <li>i have a sensitive skin..  </li>
            <li>He ended up shaving his sore face with his old shaver.  </li>
            <li>My old model got chewed up by a dog...</li>
            <li>The twist open feature is convenient, but would be better if it locked open and closed.  </li>
            <li>Might work well for light beards, avoid it if you have a heavy, fast-growing beard.</li>
            <li>old son who has been shaving since 14.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Positives are the low price, the trimmer, and the fact that it shaves really well.</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old one because my roommate broke it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 yrs old and have been shaving for quite some time.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like to directly touch anything electrical.</li>
            <li>There are probably better electrics out there, but they are bigger and heavier, and they cost at least 5 times as much as this one.</li>
            <li>Not heavy like a brick, but not flimsy or chintzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This only makes economic sense if you use rechargables for all your AA needs.</li>
            <li>Whenever I am running late for work, which is most days, I get this razor out of my glove box and shave on the way to work.  </li>
            <li>My (30 year old) travel Norelco broke and I needed a replacement.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one because I keep two travel kits ready to go.</li>
            <li>At that moment I was hoping I had packed the old unit in my toiletry kit when I checked out of the hotel.</li>
            <li>It has all the effect of rubbing a roll-on deodorant on my face as far as hair removal goes.</li>
            <li>Recently my job began requiring much longer days</li>
            <li>and I frequently found myself sporting quite a shadow with no opportunity to lather up.  </li>
            <li>Even so, calling it a shaver is very misleading as it simply doesn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li>After doing this for about a week, my face has completely cleared up and with no signs of irritation.</li>
            <li>Do not expect this shaver to get all the coarse or dense hairs that a straight razor does.  </li>
            <li>If you are a frequent traveler then I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver after my old battery powered Remington wore out.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2, one for me, and one for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I found the early version of P-70 in a bin at Wal-Mart for $17</li>
            <li>complete -</li>
            <li>a bit challenging on the neck to get those few stray hairs, but overall I would not hesitate to recommend this.</li>
            <li>This shaver may be OK for your 14 year-old nephew, but for a man with a heavy beard, it is inadequate, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li>good enough, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Maybe grizzly men with thick wiry stubble would need something more heavy-duty, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 months now</li>
            <li>What kind of game is this?</li>
            <li>the down motion does not seem to cut any beard, it made no effect on my 1 day old stubble and it got cleared( not completely) once I started more of upward moion.  </li>
            <li>This little 370 gives almost as good of a shave as my more expensive Braun (8975)!</li>
            <li>It works all right, but is slow and can easily miss long hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the closest shave, but it&#x27;s very adequate for the small price I paid.</li>
            <li>: close shave, dry or wet use, cleans easily, blade protection with automatic off, cleaner brush housed on shaver, 2 AA battery use.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a large Norelco, but for the price this seemed like it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>so one stays in the suitcase with NO MESS,</li>
            <li>As the batteries wear down, the shave isn&#x27;t as good, but it&#x27;s hard to tell when you have reached the point of needing to change the batteries.  </li>
            <li>With the price less than 16.00 on Amazon, this rasor not only beat any razor within the price range, but also beat shavers cost more than double.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I had intended to give one of these away as a gift, but when my older, high-end Braun conked out shortly after I received the P-70s, I decided to keep both, to have one as a backup.</li>
            <li>This is my second one that runs on AA batteries, my first one was purchased in Germany back in 1992.</li>
            <li>I think the single head design allows it to get into tight areas much better than a dual head model.</li>
            <li>He rubbed over his face as usual and it left more hair than it cut.  </li>
            <li>Its a decent deat for $10 especially since its washable.</li>
            <li>So being realistic, it only cost $15.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these types of pocket shavers before and this one is vastly improved from older models.</li>
            <li>So I bought this double head foil Eltron at the drug store for $10 and go figure, it gives a decent shave with a fraction of the irritation...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for every type of guys, especially if you&#x27;re always on the go!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase.  </li>
            <li>As with other shavers I&#x27;ve had, it seems you have to keep going over certain spots several times to get a \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; feeling (I even have to do this with certain places with my razors).  </li>
            <li>Also, after more than 2 months of daily use and a serious cleaning, the shaver looks now like new.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave very close, nor does it catch medium or long hairs.    </li>
            <li>Was on vacation recently and somehow managed to lose my razor I normally take with me.  </li>
            <li>For 20 years I wore a full face beard and didn&#x27;t shave, just mowed every few months.  </li>
            <li>but I still keep (and use) this little shaver for times when I need a quick shave or something to take with me on a trip.</li>
            <li>It is hardly a shaver to be satisfied with, but for a short vacation it could be sufficient.</li>
            <li>While it is good for trimming down sideburns and working on the &#x27;stache, it doesn&#x27;t stick out far enough from the side to keep from getting the foil shaver portion buzzing and tickling against your face, at least not for me.</li>
            <li>The price is so low that I&#x27;d still be money ahead, compared to disposable blades, even if I had to buy a new PocketGo every six months or so.</li>
            <li>I not only live the shorn lifestyle, but am shed-free in terms of skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an inexpensive battery powered shaver to replace my very old Braun that recently died: I now shave with a blade.</li>
            <li>Granted the Remington was a dual foil as opposed to the single, but I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it made that much difference.</li>
            <li>The new Braun 370 PocketGo works just as well as the older one, and the batteries still last for a long time.</li>
            <li>You wont find it on the M-50 model, but they have added that back to the P-70 model, but I still miss the little brush that came attached to the bottom of the original version.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time electric razor user and wanted to try one before I spent a couple of hundred dollars for a razor that may not work for me!  </li>
            <li>Of my first two, I dropped one in the water and the other on a tile floor...</li>
            <li>This model is a little larger than previous models, but the shave is exceptional for such a convenient shaver.</li>
            <li>more expensive sibling with some irritation not present in the higher end model.</li>
            <li>This little shaver is amazingly powerful considering it runs on just AA battery power.</li>
            <li>My last Braun was more then 15 yrs old before it quit working and a tough unit it was indead.  </li>
            <li>What I like about this cheap shaver is that it is durable and lasts at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they kept some of the design the same as their old model.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that when it&#x27;s locked for travel it cannot be turned on accidentally and the foil is completely covered so it cannot be damaged.</li>
            <li>I bought a Pulsonic and returned it a month later because it shaves as close as my old Norelco Spectra 8891xl, which I rate a 7/10.    </li>
            <li>Not often am I pleasently surprised by an item at the low end of the cost scale, but this one hits the mark.  </li>
            <li>The foil screen popped out of the shaver head and it took me nearly a minute to set the screen back on the four pins that held it in place.  </li>
            <li>I used the old unit (which I&#x27;ve had 3 of them over 12+ years) and left it on the bathroom counter on purpose as I checked out.  </li>
            <li>I tried it out and it barely scraped the surface of my stubble.</li>
            <li>So, over the next 12 years, I ended up tried just about everything from top of the line Disposables, expensive safety and straight razors and even laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But most importantly -- it&#x27;s a poor shave.</li>
            <li>Leaves a lot of stubble behind even after spending more time on my face (and leaving razor burn).  </li>
            <li>The thing that makes this problem worse is many people would be using this shaver as a traveler and may not find out how ineffective it is until they are on the road.</li>
            <li>I love the size and the design of this P-70, (except for the poor side burn trimmer design).  </li>
            <li>(A P-70 was also a World War II aircraft but as far as I am aware, that P-70 is not available from Amazon.)    </li>
            <li>LITTLE RASCAL RIGHT HERE BY MY COMPUTER DESK</li>
            <li>This one really has some energy and so far I haven&#x27;t worn down the batteries.  </li>
            <li>This gives the shaver a very fast, very clean cutting speed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver for travel or everyday use and at this price you could buy a new one every year!</li>
            <li>the long hair cutter is considerable smaller and sideways, rather than in parallel to the main one.</li>
            <li>This little gem is still available from Amazon, which surprises me, because I worry that sooner or later Braun is going to decide that it&#x27;s stealing sales from the company&#x27;s more expensive razors and pull it off the market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Higher end shavers may use li-ion but since two lower end shavers cost less than one higher end</li>
            <li>The shave that you get with this machine is no worse than the result that you get with other electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t add much to the other reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big, not too small, but juuuust right!</li>
            <li>The new top slides &#x27;over&#x27; the shaving head which means no more \\&quot;lost\\&quot; or \\&quot;cracked (broken)\\&quot; tops (and no longer too messy to pack)!</li>
            <li>I guess my facial hair is too coarse, because it is completely ineffective for me.  </li>
            <li>When my older alkaline-powered model died, I spent some time researching and decided on the P-70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>powerful enough for heavier beard growth, when I skip a few days, I need to use a razor</li>
            <li>I tried several expensive electric razors before and honestly, this one out performs them and costs 1/3 of what I paid for them.</li>
            <li>At less than $20, it&#x27;s easier just to purchase an entire new unit rather than swapping out pieces on a used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver!!!</li>
            <li>But I find that both my higher-end Braun and my Norelco&#x27;s shave longer on a single charge than this one on a new set of batteries.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It renders a nearly high end shave, offers wet shave versatility for a laughably low price and could be used nearly daily if you wished to.</li>
            <li>little shaver looked a bit flimsy at first.</li>
            <li>I needed a very particular present for a friend; I had overheard a conversation stating a portable shaver to keep in the car would be extremely desirable...</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin a little more irritated than my much more expense Panasonic, but not so bad that I would hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li>but if you have average beard growth and you shave every 1-2 days, there is absolutely *</li>
            <li>The only difference is that it is not as gentle on the skin as some other razors.</li>
            <li>It takes too long to shave; it is loud; it doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the shaving foil screen is not available as a replacement part.</li>
            <li>I have light facial hair growth but THICK, COARSE, and rapid scalp growth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The wet shave option opens up a new dimension.  </li>
            <li>It is now Nov 2014 and requesting a new one because this one, though still working, it getting a bit rough.</li>
            <li>I have always preferred a \\&quot;Screen\\&quot; type razor because it causes much less irritation than a rotary and shaves much closer.  </li>
            <li>I just used this as a travel shaver, and it worked really well, for the month and a half</li>
            <li>Typical modern day made-to-break junk then they want you to purchase another.</li>
            <li>At first, you may need to use the shaver a few times to properly cut your folicles to match the foil shaver.</li>
            <li>That being said, for ocassional touch-up or regular use (with 1-day beard growth), it certainly can&#x27;t be beat at this price -- given that it costs less than just the replacement blades alone for a corded/rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this little guy a try mostly bacause of the small size, being operated by AA and very low price.  </li>
            <li>at least down to five o&#x27;clock shadow whisker length, this is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>This one not only shaves just as close as the others, I use high capacity rechargeable batteries in it, and so far, two weeks later I&#x27;m still shaving everyday.</li>
            <li>My skin had only very slight irritation the first time I tried it and</li>
            <li>a \\&quot;back up\\&quot;,vacation razor or for a quick touch up for late night meetings.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t know how long the batteries will last but even if I only get a few shaves, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most differences that I expected to find annoying in this device have proved easy to get used to.         </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m aware that most shavers leave a little stubble behind that needs to be mowed with a blade.</li>
            <li>This little gem does both very well.</li>
            <li>but this inexpensive well designed little beauty works very well.  </li>
            <li>not chew my skin up as much as rotary shavers&lt;br /&gt;Has a little pop out trimmer for sideburns, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this little one is as good as the expensive one.</li>
            <li>Ordered a new one and will keep the other one as backup/work shaver as it still works, only would like after 5 years or so to exchange the blade.  </li>
            <li>Since I was in transit and my previous shaver had more or less run itself down, I opted insetad to buy this puppy.  </li>

            <li> All in all, a well thought out, efficient shaver at a very attractive price.</li>
            <li> The best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was prompt, packaged well and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> Best of all it is a Braun which is a quality product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a perfect travel razor.</li>
            <li> The PocketGo renders an excellent shave used with shave cream/shave soap.</li>
            <li> and I did a bit of research and figured that within budget this would probably be the best one.</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be perfect for trimming my mustache and goatee, and</li>
            <li> Awesome!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> Great buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome for traveling.</li>
            <li> This shaver works wonderfully with my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> P-70 Men&#x27;s Shaver is the best of both worlds, it feels well made and designed by someone</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful razor!</li>
            <li> All in all, a razor that is perfectly designed for its intended purpose (travel).</li>
            <li> The best it can do is leave me looking patchy if I use it twice a day.   </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the best that can be said about it.</li>
            <li> They have worked flawlessly and I still use them.  </li>
            <li> Excellent value.  </li>
            <li> That version had a trimmer that slid up and was perfect for the hairs you always miss on your neck.  </li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> start to cut more of your face than they do your beard !!!</li>
            <li> for more then triple the price!!!</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but once you figure out how to angle the shaver, it will give you a very good shave.  </li>
            <li> I have earler versions of this razor, and they are very good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> It does not do a very good job on the neck, otherwise it gives a close  shave.</li>
            <li> But if you miss a couple of days of shaving (like the weekend), don&#x27;t expect it to do a very good job getting \\&quot;long\\&quot; hairs.</li>
            <li> For those times, this inexpensive razor does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT, TRIMMER IS EXCELLENT.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is built incredibly.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product.  </li>
            <li> The swivel case is ideal when it goes into your travel kit and it protects the foil well.  </li>
            <li> Both are pocket size, excellent shavers, great for travel and inexpensive to buy.  </li>
            <li> He needs a girl friend with good vision and a pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li> Good shave, too!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent travel shaver (rotating cover) but not as good as the Panasonic ES4815s which I reviewed [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> He loved the great shaving job it did, the fact that you can wash the head, and--most of all--it fits perfectly in his shaving bag.  </li>
            <li> It works great, and the design is nifty.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the design, size, and price are great (hence 2 stars and not 1).  </li>
            <li> What a great idea.  </li>
            <li> I brought it on vacation and used it every day for 4 days and it was just great.</li>
            <li> Great shaver at a great price</li>
            <li> Works great on the go.  </li>
            <li> Great idea unless you are hit with everything when you walk through the door.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li> Also great for travel.    </li>
            <li> It is every bit as convenient and works great.</li>
            <li> This a great razor.</li>
            <li> Battery use is great and, of course, one cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> Great buy keep one in your car, in your briefcase.</li>
            <li> Great price, too.</li>
            <li> Recommend as a great portable razor if you shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I found this at a great price</li>
            <li> I agree, its a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> The side trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but you can&#x27;t expect salon quality trimming from a travel shaver.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> It delivers great results for about $20.</li>
            <li> FOR AN INEXPENSIVE, POCKET SIZE SHAVER THIS IS A GREAT BUY.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product that I wouldn&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> This razor is great for the price for keeping in my briefcase for an evening meeting or get-together.    </li>
            <li> Based on its reliability and performance I bought this one and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> However, I definitely am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This Braun electric razor does a great job at helping me look nicer through the work week.</li>
            <li> is great.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Still shaves great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor based on the great reviews I read here.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> However it has done a great job for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Accidentally dropped it onto a ceramic tile floor, after being happy with it for a couple of years.)</li>
            <li> The amazon.com price was excellent at under $20 for a shaver that is well thought out and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> The Braun P70/370 is the best and an amazing deal at $15 or $20.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the lesson is that one should not believe something is great just because it has hundreds of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> For $15, a great shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked out great for us.</li>
            <li> The swiveling cover is great because it&#x27;s not a separate piece to misplace.</li>
            <li> And a  great shave for this type of shaver.</li>
            <li> It is compact, convenient and does a great job as a travel shaver.    </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never without a great shave.</li>
            <li> It still works great.    </li>

            <li> Great price when you compare to the rechargables.</li>
            <li> Great design and I like the idea that the cap is attached to the shaver...</li>
            <li> I use this shaver for travel and it does a great job</li>
            <li> Happy with this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I had to sell them on ebay with great losses.</li>
            <li> Great to throw in your travel bag for the road.</li>
            <li> Yes, I say, \\&quot;we\\&quot; because it shaves his face so close and so smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Very, very nice.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for almost three years and have found it very kind to my tender face.</li>
            <li> This Braun shaver comes in very handy in keeping him groomed.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice foil shaver, which happens to run on AAA batteries.  </li>
            <li> This one is very good and handy for all travel purpose.</li>
            <li> the design is truly remarkable.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor specifically to get me through a 2 month trip, and it worked flawlessly, even better then the Remington</li>
            <li> good item, happy with purachase, affordable and does the work it is meant for that price</li>
            <li> Have owned many electric shaver in my life and this is one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought 8 for staff members and plan on buying more for some of our best customers this fall.</li>
            <li> This PocketGo Shaver is perfect size for travel and does a great job on a light beard.  </li>
            <li> However, he said that his shave with the Braun is just as good as any he has ever had with any of his rechargeable or electric shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- good quality &lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors and this one is incredible</li>
            <li> It looks good and feels good in my hand.   </li>
            <li> Word to the wise - TRY IT OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING IT, don&#x27;t toss it in your suitcase and assume it works.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I need to touch up with going to the blade to look good.  </li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic shaver that cost me $70 that doesnt do as good a job as this Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a good year</li>
            <li> Well designed, quality construction, and it gives a surprisingly good shave.  </li>
            <li> Works good for a battery powered back-and-forth shaver.  </li>
            <li> No, but it does a really good job in between shaves.  </li>
            <li> I use it primarily while camping, for this it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Shave was good and close.  </li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the good and the not-so-good.  </li>
            <li> this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good portable shaver.  </li>
            <li> Exceptionally good value for the money...</li>
            <li> The shave and feel is not as good.</li>
            <li> its still a good buy though, comparable to shavers at $100</li>
            <li> if you just skim it along the hair it does a good job on thinning it out.</li>
            <li> One concern that was brought to my attention is that it uses AA batteries that always need to be replaced, well I have had this unit for about a month now and the batteries are still good.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a good answer...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price with features this good.  </li>
            <li> I also loved the protective cap.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a really good razor.         </li>
            <li> This Braun razor does an amazingly good job.  </li>
            <li> then you can believe on a set of good batteries and give a quality shave.</li>
            <li> Handy, close shaving, battery powered portable that is great to keep in the car or travel pack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have for a travel, and even at home.</li>
            <li> It still is in good condition and mechanically works well.  </li>
            <li> Good shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> This razor has good battery life and shaves as well as any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Seller did a good job getting the product to me.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s good to go, no matter where you happen to be.</li>
            <li> It works as good as my $99.00 Norelco.  </li>
            <li> How can they make something so good for this price?</li>
            <li> But is a light weight &amp; handy shaver, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> The P-70 is one of the best foil shavers I&#x27;ve ever used and overall one of the best designed products I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> people who like to be entirely shorn, this shaver is perfect, and you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s cordlessness is awesome.</li>
            <li> It works remarkably well, cleans easily, has great battery life and earns my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> For a cheap but very good product nothing can beat this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my father and he is very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I will still use the 8975 for most of my shaving needs, but the 370 will be a great touch-up and travel shaver.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and crappy!</li>
            <li> For best results, you need to keep fresh batteries in it.  </li>
            <li> I do not understand how it got so many great reviews...</li>
            <li> Both of us are very pleased with the razor.  </li>
            <li> He is very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted a portable shaver for myself and saw the P-70 advertised at $22 or so, I&#x27;d have been perfectly ok with it upon arrival, but not for $125!  </li>
            <li> I love it and my skin is loving it too!</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly; it is more than it purports  itself to be!</li>
            <li> Actually it is better than others!  </li>
            <li> But still it is impressive for the first try.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> It gives a great shave and is easy on the batteries.  </li>
            <li> This one now (PocketGo P-70) is great, shaves close and and makes my skin feel smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li> aka free control 1775 for $40; great shave</li>
            <li> However, considering its cost this is an amazing value, I use it on all by trips and continue to be amazed at it</li>
            <li> Amazing buy.</li>
            <li> but I got two with free shipping for $15 each and am happy to have them.  </li>
            <li> It really is the best electric shaver I have seen.  </li>
            <li> Needed something handy and compact for a touchup.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this shaver twice for my son when he was in Iraq, he liked it and he ask me to purchased it for him</li>
            <li> Lots of nice features--beard/sideburns trimmer, immersible in water, etc.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pop-up trimmer is kind of a joke, but so is the one on my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice design with an effective, attached screen protector, and cleaning brush(my</li>
            <li> This is a OK unit compared to 5615 which was superior in every way.</li>
            <li> the size and weight are nice too.</li>
            <li> He stated that he liked the shaver&#x27;s shave, the fact that it used batteries rather than a recharger, and he liked it for its price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item and an extra one for my dad without even trying it, based on the great price and excellent reviews.  </li>
            <li> Nice item, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure if this shaver would be any good when ordering.</li>
            <li> Brush in handle is nice touch.</li>
            <li> AAs were a nice touch.</li>
            <li> If you find something you really like, I find it&#x27;s best to buy a spare.</li>
            <li> Honestly, for 15 bucks you should buy this shaver for yourself and friends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid much more for electric shavers that weren&#x27;t nearly as good as this shaver.</li>
            <li> its painless and effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cover rotates around nicely.</li>
            <li> Sure, not quite as good as my full-size 7526</li>
            <li> The quality of this shaver is superior to many shavers I have seen on the market.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice shave also.  </li>
            <li> Nice portable shaver.</li>
            <li> * Kind of noisy.  </li>
            <li> Nice for the price.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to carry a recharging cord (you don&#x27;t need access to an outlet) and it flips around into it&#x27;s own \\&quot;case\\&quot;</li>
            <li> That and it holds its own cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> For more then 30 years Braun razors have met the challange and given me good service.   </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, you could not shave a balloon with this thing.</li>
            <li> He got it, gave it a test run (as did many of his squad-platoon), and he loved it.</li>
            <li> This has been the absolute best shaver.  </li>
            <li> And the swivel design that protects the screen is a nice innovation.</li>
            <li> Pros: you can use your own rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compact design with a nice integrated protective cover</li>
            <li> It is handy and just kind of cute to look at.  </li>
            <li> Does not work perfectly but is is a good travel shaver that takes double a batteries</li>
            <li> I prefer using a blade but this shaver is great for weekends and quick shaves.</li>
            <li> this exellently priced refurb also on Amazon), but great for travel, quick on-the-go reshave before evening, or \\&quot;emergency.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for camping, business travel, or just as a spare razor to keep in the office for a quick shave or touch up.</li>
            <li> great, very well thought out and good for traveling,</li>
            <li> This razor is also very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> It shaves as well as a razor 10 times it price, is easy to use, easy to clean and all in all a best buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great design but as useful as a boat anchor when the screen deteriorates.</li>
            <li> Self contained with brush fitting nicely into the case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, has an &#x27;off&#x27; locking mechanism (won&#x27;t accidentally turn on in my luggage), close and smooth shave, feels good in my hand, and a trimmer is included.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The trimmer is handy, and it does a respectable job on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is feature rich and gives a good, close shave on two AA batteries, which can be found anywhere.  </li>
            <li> The design is excellent because the foil is very well protected against damage in luggage and the lock system is secure so it will not accidentally turn ON when squished in your luggage.</li>
            <li> and he said at first was great but approx.</li>
            <li> The new version has been improved over what was ,and is a very  good product.</li>
            <li> The Braun gives a great, quick shave and is incredibly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I also have a very light beard.</li>
            <li> this razor is VERY comfortable.  </li>
            <li> For day-to-day shaves it does an adequate job and will keep you looking good.  </li>
            <li> the Braun&#x27;s trimmer is effective and easy to use and, unlike that on the Norelco, has never nicked my skin.  </li>
            <li> Priced excellently, this is a significant improvement over the older models.  </li>
            <li> Based on the positive reviews, the great price and f*r*e*e shipping, I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li> Perfect time for me to shave is right out of a hot shower.</li>
            <li> I use a Gillette blade razor for most shaving, but like a power shaver for touch-up and trimming, etc.</li>
            <li> It is probably best used for a travel razor, but you won&#x27;t like it as your daily shaver.  </li>
            <li> After checking many sites, I chose the Braun 370.  </li>
            <li> He has commented on several occasions that this was an excellent shaver.  </li>
            <li> But shave is like most electrics...</li>
            <li> Love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to plug it in.</li>
            <li> I use this for touching up after I shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this Braun 370 PocketGo battery shaver for my hubby and we love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, just love this shaver.</li>
            <li> The shave is so close be sure to use aftershave gel/lotion.</li>
            <li> This is simply one of the best buys I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer feature to catch the \\&quot;ones that got away\\&quot; and I&#x27;ve been perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years.  </li>
            <li> so I am guessing that it works OK.</li>
            <li> It cost more to ship that cutterblock than to buy another Pocketgo.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Braun razor on a whim and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I figured I would never be able to use one.</li>
            <li> It does a better job than my $90.00 razor.</li>
            <li> Good quality, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> (I prefer blades for the most part).  </li>
            <li> Even after reading all the excellent reviews, it still vastly exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like most shavers the motor hums and when it hits a spot of whiskers it sort of makes that grinding noise, which gives you the impression it is doing something.  </li>
            <li> and it becomes a top of the line shaver.</li>
            <li> It collects most of the cut hair inside the foil, but some drops out, so if you are shaving with a suit on, be prepared to brush off a bit afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in some ways its even better...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so there is no reason to pay more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the construction of this shaver,</li>
            <li> The flip top cover prevents it from turning by accident.</li>
            <li> I would recommend NiMh rechargeable batteries though for longer life and more power.</li>
            <li> After returning home, I continued using it for about 7 more years before needing to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I got more than I paid for.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully my dad will fare better</li>
            <li> It will never be as close as the shave that you can get with a razor, but it is close enough to be perfectly acceptable.</li>
            <li> This one is more compact, lighter, and has a built-in protective, \\&quot;swing-away\\&quot; cap that also keeps it from accidentally being switched on.  </li>
            <li> nothing* better than this.  </li>
            <li> For around $15, you owe it to yourself to give this a try before spending a LOT more on a Braun Series 7.  </li>
            <li> There is no need to spend more for a razor.</li>
            <li> If your like me and easily able to get ingrown hairs, don&#x27;t touch this thing.</li>
            <li> That solved the problem for many years... that is up to now.  </li>
            <li> It just works perfect, i use it daily.</li>
            <li> Your Cordless triple head or twin bank razor will cut 10 times better than this and a lot faster.</li>
            <li> I was looking to use something more compact to carry when traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy one more soon so that I can use it in my office.  </li>
            <li> I think better will be to use it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to get those by moving the skin</li>
            <li> so they stand up :) and holding the shaver just off the skin.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to return my Braun 190 and buy 2 more</li>
            <li> I got one for me, one for my brother, and I&#x27;m going to get one for some more family members.    </li>
            <li> This thing is ok.  </li>
            <li> If your&#x27;re going to be gone longer, just toss more batteries in the bag.  </li>
            <li> There may well be ones that provide a better shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this braun 370 shaver one year ago, im totally satisfied with the job this shaver does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought 2</li>
            <li> closer shave, more irritation.  </li>
            <li> IN FACT, I PLAN TO BUY TWO MORE TO GIVE AS HOLIDAY GIFTS..</li>
            <li> One thing is you cant be using this shaver to save time because you would be done with a better shave sooner if you used a razor.  </li>
            <li> Beyond that, the foil design won&#x27;t be able to shave well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much more.</li>
            <li> otherwise it would have kept going :)</li>
            <li> It shaves better than the Braun I paid over $100.00 for just 4 months ago which I now wish I could return.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more and send as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the Braun shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the cutter and foil would cost more than that.</li>
            <li> It removed the stubble that the Panasonic left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, gotta go and order two more of these before the price goes up.  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be happier if it were a bit more compact for travel, but I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> hop in the shower, lather up your face with the soap provided in the room, do several passes in this manner in the shower and have you have an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Its a OK device for below $20.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Very well designed and the shave is great.</li>
            <li> Still use it and love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about a month ago and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item snd recommend it to anyone on the go.</li>
            <li> I love the using AA batteries for power.  </li>
            <li> but I just wish it shaved better.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s just ok:  </li>
            <li> and you sure can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> How many times can you shave before the batteries have to be replaced? &lt;</li>
            <li> anyone can speak to these issues, I&#x27;d be most grateful.</li>
            <li> all those areas, underarm hair was the most troublesome...</li>
            <li> More than that</li>
            <li> It was much better than carrying a blade razor and shaving cream (and the shaving cream would be confiscated at the airport these days if you leave it in your carry-on bag).     </li>
            <li> Did OK in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I am blade shaver, but there are times when using an electric razor is just more convenient.  </li>
            <li> One of those things where it would be ok to lose, and not lose money.  </li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> functions on batteries is better in that regard which I also purchased</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the cover.  </li>
            <li> I have a top of the line Braun razor as well.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, you can use</li>
            <li> I have been extremely satisfied with the Braun and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> Better than the $100</li>
            <li> What more can one ask?</li>
            <li> Sure wish it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a blade for many years.  </li>
            <li> And I have a light beard, the kind many said this shaver is suited for.</li>
            <li> Looked at many brands, checked spec&#x27;s,  purchased the Braun 370,  and shipped it to him.</li>
            <li> okay shaver but dropped it once and stopped working.</li>
            <li> The screen and blade are much better than what you would expect at this price.  </li>
            <li> I love the thing.</li>
            <li> And the results are more than satisfactory for me.    </li>
            <li> Since most of the time the cap gets lost during travel, while it&#x27;s in your bag, and that&#x27;s how the head stands to get damaged.</li>
            <li> - sometimes I think it&#x27;s better than my full-size Braun.  </li>
            <li> This is more shaving time during a week than most men will use.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift and the recipient is quite pleased with the \\&quot;PocketGo\\&quot; Men&#x27;s Shaver.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to many a freshman :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Talking about the M-90, I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Best for short growth.</li>
            <li> If you use it every day, you&#x27;ll be happy with the decent shave.  </li>
            <li> It is a great price and highly  recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and painless and works better than one of the Norelco electrics I bought for $80+!</li>
            <li> First, the good:  </li>
            <li> The design is remarkably well thought out, it is very compact and travels well.  </li>
            <li> It seemed great as a shaver to keep in my bag to complement my new Braun home shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong, but I would not pay more than $30 for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to keep in your bag or glove box for those days you forget or don&#x27;t have time to shave before leaving the house, or for when you are taking a quick trip and don&#x27;t want to bring your bulkier electric razor.</li>
            <li> It is easy to throw this into the travel bag as the flip top protects the blades.  </li>
            <li> Super handy.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is still a nice compact shaver that&#x27;s great for travel.  </li>
            <li> Lots of reviewers say this is as good or better than a REAL cordless razor.. think again.</li>
            <li> My youngest son, a US Marine stationed in Irag, needed a shaver that was battery powered, light but sturdy,  and that could do a nice job on his light beard once a day.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is very easy and the attached brush saves me from searching.</li>
            <li> I also gifted it to relatives and they liked it very much.</li>
            <li> You get a close, comfortable shave every time, it is easy to clean and the built-in head cover works nice.</li>
            <li> This puppy runs great, shaves OK, and can go for more than a week on one set of double A&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It shaves as closely as my Norelco did, I believe, and is actually more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The portability, the convenience, the design, quality, and more importantly, the function.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving since 1953 With out a doubt, this 10.00 shaver has given me,the most comfortable, and closest shaves</li>
            <li> If you shave every day you really should invest in a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver, works surprisingly well for the price and the fact that it is a travel model.</li>
            <li> Much easier than shaving, good battery life.</li>
            <li> Portable, waterproof, fairly good shave, and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Battery operated, so you can bring it anywhere, easy to clean, and it does a very fine job with the shaving.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly worth the price and maybe a good bit more than that just to have a shaver at the office to get a quick trim before going out or before an important meeting.</li>
            <li> gives a very comfortable and clean shave.</li>
            <li> The most positive feature,  its Handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and after about 6 uses, it seems to give a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li> I travel most of the time and this little shaver is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s size makes it easily carried</li>
            <li> Cleaning is also easy, with or without water.</li>
            <li> I was leaving for an extended trip to a location where I wouldn&#x27;t have easy access to electricity.  </li>
            <li> It is incredibly easy to use, and you can&#x27;t lose it.</li>
            <li> But no, it is only a couple more dollars today than I paid three years ago and still a great bargain.  </li>
            <li> My face gets irritated easily</li>
            <li> out batteries on this thing isn&#x27;t just easy, it hints at how this should be handled by every device.&lt;br /&gt;The flip cover for the foil can&#x27;t be lost or dropped, the blade itself gave a close shave,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The foil comes off easily for cleaning and you just rinse out the cutters (never use a brush on the foil).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such a great bargain for $12.98, that I bought three more to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> It is confortable, easy to handle, practical, versatile.</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend that if you&#x27;re in the market for a battery operated shaver, choose the Braun 370.</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent for those with light beards and for those requiring only quick shaves.</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Works very well and gives a good, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is very good at removing all kinds of hair in non-facial areas, but it should come with a stick because my arms are not that long</li>
            <li> When I went for more than three days between shaves, it didn&#x27;t give as clean a shave on my neck--though my face shaved fine.  </li>
            <li> To Go albeit at pricing more reflective of true value.  </li>
            <li> This shaver has provided me great shaves for many years in many remote locations including Kilimanjaro, Switzerland, and hiking the Wonderland Trail around Mt Rainier.  </li>
            <li> May not be the best for those with heavy beard, but good enough, and simply amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> i thought what the heck...shaves almost as good as my new Braun FreeControl at home.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the job of my blade and foam but for the purpose it&#x27;s intended it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> It shaves fine for me</li>
            <li> and it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> with NiMH rechargeables and the PocketGo works just fine with them.  </li>
            <li> But it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that its the best on the market but for a low budget or a first shaver it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> If anyone else has this problem, it&#x27;s not that cumbersome to wear gloves and, as you can see, I can type just fine with them on.</li>
            <li> This is the best battery-powered pocket shaver I&#x27;ve found for less the twenty shekels.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if you just want to control the stubble a bit</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more than adequate for that too.</li>
            <li> While it worked, it gave as good a shave as any rotary or vibrator type I have ever owned( I&#x27;ve been using   electric since I was very young)</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to change batteries.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent Buy with tight budget.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to use, light weight, easy to clean......</li>
            <li> I bought 2 for home and in the car, they work fine for a light beard.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the improvements made to the P70 over my older models.</li>
            <li> the plus side, it is well designed for travel, has a nice safety lock in a closed position to keep it from turning on, cleans fairly easily, and has a good battery life for its two batteries.</li>
            <li> All in all, for what I paid for this, or even at 2 or 3 times what I paid, this is one of the best little shavers I&#x27;ve ever used and owned.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is awesome.</li>
            <li> to my surprise, this little, inexpensive shaver gives me the best shave that I ever had.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little shaver and had great features.</li>
            <li> I called Amazon and they confirmed to me that the price I&#x27;d paid for the P-70 was the correct price.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It shaves so close and comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially ideal for travel, although I&#x27;m using mine for everyday home use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean under running water, or you can just pop off the foil and shake it out for a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; cleaning.</li>
            <li> sideburns trimmer isn&#x27;t really too handy.  </li>
            <li> probably on your way to an important meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - extremely cheap &lt;br</li>
            <li> And that it is available for $20.00 was a bonus.  </li>
            <li> This filled the bill.  </li>
            <li> It is not as smooth as the 7-series</li>
            <li> When using it, you get the impression it is working because of the sound it makes.      </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why nobody can make a cheap shaver that works as well as the Shaveman, but the bottom line is they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The folks at Braun did a fantastic job with the design where you cannot turn on the thing if it is locked with the cover over.</li>
            <li> Essentially, this shaver is a great back-up for when I can&#x27;t shave with a blade.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, and it&#x27;s designed so it won&#x27;t accidentally turn on.  </li>
            <li> and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and ultra-convenient.  </li>
            <li> I would not use this as a primary shaver.</li>
            <li> If used under water, it leaks its oils used to keep the machine parts running smooth.</li>
            <li> Takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> East to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a great concept, but once you touch it to your neck, you&#x27;ll get ingrown hairs that will last for a week, and it misses 1/2 of the hairs in between the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Light weight.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively light beard.</li>
            <li> A CLOSE AND COMFORTABLE SHAVE.</li>
            <li> My Norelco is a great shaver also but just too big.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a great shaver</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver at a very low price.  </li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a cheap travel razor, this is it.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, batteries available most anywhere and one doesn&#x27;t have to worry about voltage converters for travel outside of the U.S. (see my review of Kensington 33117</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave as the advanced shavers but considering the extremely cheap price, you cannot beat it.</li>
            <li> and I find no replacements are available.    </li>
            <li> * Easy to clean -</li>
            <li> Is it comfortable to use? &lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light,</li>
            <li> One great feature is that it won&#x27;t turn on unless its flipped open for use; so no worries at the airport.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s cheap, I can just leave it in my car without worrying about being stolen and use it</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> After reviewing all the ones I found available, I chose the Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> For the money, the Braun is a great buy and you can get replacement heads so it will last.  </li>
            <li> However, this product is available at Walgreens for a cheaper price than what I bought it for here.</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy with the snap in brush and running the head under water.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s cheap, but it&#x27;s cheap with a reason.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it in our RV where we may not have 120 volts for a corded shaver or charger, and its compact size and light weight are also advantages.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for my desk and briefcase.  </li>
            <li> The shave is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is waterproof and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Alkaline batteries also work well, however the lower voltage rechargeable batteries still provide the power to shave smoothly.      </li>
            <li> Still a good deal for the money and easier to pack than my old unit.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave everytime - ideal for late for the office situations and overniters.</li>
            <li> I have loved my 10 year old Braun foil shaver, but it&#x27;s no longer available.  </li>
            <li> This gives an incredibly comfortable smooth shave, quick to use, easy to clean, washable, good battery life so far (3 weeks strong with daily use &amp; still going), can be slipped into your bag/briefcase, easy for touch ups, great for travel as no separate plugs needed, the spin-over foil protection also stops it being switched on by accident.    </li>
            <li> Neck was not so good and had to resort to using my old shaver to get some of the missed hairs.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that the Braun 370 is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> and then I bought one for myself and it&#x27;s been a good value so far</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;m happy with it, and can&#x27;t help wondering why people spend so much more for other shavers.</li>
            <li> The overall design is very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this shaver, although, my 99 cents shaver did the same until I lost it :).</li>
            <li> The shave is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did not spend much more money on a different shaver that I most likely would not have been happy with.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works pretty good but do not expect a fast shave.    </li>
            <li> For the price, this is the best little shaver around!</li>
            <li> own an earlier version of this shaver also, still working fine, but the newer version does give a better shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model and the previous Braun AA shaver for many years, and find they are great for traveling, and weekend use at home.</li>
            <li> but then I&#x27;m not sure what a perfect shaver would look like</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about of month--still with the original set of batteries.</li>
            <li> WORTH the money!</li>
            <li> and it is still on the original batteries.</li>
            <li> The result is two-fold: the whiskers aren&#x27;t flattened against the skin (allowing a closer shave on fewer passes) and irritation is significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say we got our money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> This shaver is ultimately just &#x27;ok&#x27; -- ok for short trips or stuffing in the glove box, not so good for day-to-day use or getting an all-around good, close shave.    </li>
            <li> Ideal for travel because it is small, easy to clean, has no annoying cord to keep track of, and is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- clean shave</li>
            <li> If all you care about is getting a clean shave than this is IT.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and clean for an electric, we all know the closest shaves are with a blade and foam.  </li>
            <li> I can use it while at my laptop or while reading to clean up my chin and neck.</li>
            <li> but besides that it&#x27;s an ease to clean with the mini brush</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep my face clean shaved between hair cuts.....</li>
            <li> Luckily I found them all, but it did take a while to figure out where they fit in.  </li>
            <li> Plus you can just wash it under the tap to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I have had mine as my regular shaver for more than three years and it has always been effective and reliable.  </li>
            <li> And can be rinsed clean.</li>
            <li> A breeze to clean.</li>
            <li> Also, if you use it a couple of times and don&#x27;t clean expect to be cleaning your clothes too since during operation</li>
            <li> This razor just can not give me a clean shave under any circumstance.   </li>
            <li> Originally purchased for under $20 in 2008 to introduce my child with special needs to the world of shaving.  </li>
            <li> First of all, this razor is much lighter and more compact than most, so it has a different heft, and it works best when held nearly perpendicular to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Well made, good heft, clever cover and switch, shaves very close.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased it almost two years ago as strictly a &#x27;travel&#x27; shaver to use on trips, but it quickly became my &#x27;every day&#x27; shaver because of the quality of the shave and ease of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s pretty much waterproof</li>
            <li> It generally does an excellent job and has held up over the last 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I was looking for an electric shaver to replace manual shaving, I might try a full size rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good value that I bought two; one for travel and one for the office.</li>
            <li> It is what it is.. a good back up or travel razor.</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries and keep it where I can do a quick clean up.  </li>
            <li> It misses patches and requires many passes to get much of anything at all.  </li>
            <li> and it not only gives me a good shave</li>
            <li> Its definately good as a travel shaver, but i may not like the irritation if i have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I keep one set in the charger and one set in the shaver and switch them every couple of days, so it is always shaving at full power.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> So much so, that I&#x27;m going to buy two more today.</li>
            <li> Just about as good as any I&#x27;ve ever had, although again it maybe takes a bit longer than say the Shick TR3 twin-foil which is my current wet shaver of choice (another great deal at about $35 BTW).</li>
            <li> I was, like so many others, ready to praise this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The design is really cool</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s cool:  </li>
            <li> I guess they say that you get waht you pay for, and I think that is true in this case.  </li>
            <li> God, it can hurt your skin so badly, I really don&#x27;t understand why it could get so many 5&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Super clean shave.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t give a good shave.</li>
            <li> , it is perfect when I&#x27;m working late and want to get rid of five-o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> It has good power, gives a nice shave, and is still small.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good enough for quick touch-ups when you&#x27;re in a hurry</li>
            <li> AA batteries are really ideal for a travel shaver as well, they&#x27;re an international standard and cheap and available everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I liked my old Braun shaver, and since this will only see occasional service, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little shaver, great for roadtrips or storing at the office for when you forget.  </li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s floating head rechargeable shaver was my favorite for many years as long as replacement screens and combs were available.</li>
            <li> This morning, while enjoying another great shave I was curious to look on Amazon again and see if perhaps the low price I paid for it was some kind of computer error, as it does as good of a job as shavers costing ten times as much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of shaving, this little guy does almost as good a job (and better in some hard-to-get areas like my neck) as the Norelco.</li>
            <li> The 3 AA unit performed like my home rechargeable shaver (not Braun), but this one takes a little more time and work to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> performing it&#x27;s task in providing a quick shave anywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great for travelling or quick touchups at the office.  </li>
            <li> It recharges quickly as well.</li>
            <li> very lite, very compact, amazingly close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do quick shaves and it does just that.  </li>
            <li> Super razor for the price</li>
            <li> Received the shaver in the mail quickly and appeared to be as advertised.</li>
            <li> End result is that I used the shaver for quick touch-ups</li>
            <li> I have a older version of the Braun which I have  used for many years to remove the 5 oclock shadow.  </li>
            <li> For a quick shave or touch up that might take some people with thinner hairs</li>
            <li> Main benefit:  no charger or power cords to worry about &amp; no need to make sure it&#x27;s charged.  </li>
            <li> But with a musician&#x27;s schedule there are times when I have to grab a quick shave en route to a gig.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which reminds me: I gotta grab a quick shave before I head out.</li>
            <li> They asked for many more and I shipped same.</li>
            <li> The design and the idea is great, but the cut is below average.  </li>
            <li> First, the Braun includes a trimmer-an important feature for me.  </li>
            <li> Child has major sensory issues as well as intellectual disability, so the need was for something safe, easy to use and that would not cause sensory overload.    </li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to carry and gives a near razor quality shave.</li>
            <li> The various reviews I read generally had very good things to say about it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, fast, effective and easy to  clean and it only uses 2 AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> The quality of shave is very high for a travel razor which is great on a long trip.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new shaver and decided to gamble the $14 the Braun 370 PocketGo costs, and am I ever glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This battery-operated shaver shaves as well as my new Norelco rotary razor that retails for about $100 more.  </li>
            <li> When these wore out - the foil that touches you face will go before the razor will but a replacement will cost you more than a new razor</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews, bought one and agree 100% with all of the great things</li>
            <li> The unit is small and light weight making it great for travel.  </li>
            <li> It shaves better than my electric shaver at home, although not as well as pretty much any blade razor.    </li>
            <li> That is when I found that Braun had the same excellent head on a shaver (PocketGo) where I could use store-bought long life alkaline batteries.</li>
            <li> But for a throw-away back up, it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Both it and this model are very lightweight and small, which is what makes it so perfect to keep in a travel kit.</li>
            <li> Very compact and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with electric shavers, you probably know exactly what we&#x27;re talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and unlike many in its price range it actually works and works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have purchased it, but unfortunately it really is only good for a quick clean-up of a relatively short growth.  </li>
            <li> While this little jewel is never going to win an award for &lt;br /&gt;delivering</li>
            <li> This is one great little shaver.</li>
            <li> It is a great little shaver to use on the go.</li>
            <li> This little battery powered shaver is great for road trips when you&#x27;re going to be away from power cords for a while.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for commuting, to keep in your briefcase, or to leave at the office.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still a great little razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for emergency to get things in control, but I use razors as my everyday.</li>
            <li> I got this thing for free by spending hotel points, but I like it so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;The design is solid, feels substantial, and amazingly for the price tag is fully immersible which means it can be used with shave cream, shave soap etc.</li>
            <li> Very compact and light.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it to give it a try....</li>
            <li> (Also a success, just posted a review of that one.)</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful.  </li>
            <li> I like this shaver as a portable , handy item that fits in my medical bag, or overnight kit, in the car, etc.</li>
            <li> Price is nice-most replacement screens cost more than the complete shaver.  </li>
            <li> It offers a great shave, it is well built, and 2 AA batteries last for weeks.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes to use a normal razor first and then clean-up and get really close shave using the Shaver.</li>
            <li> It wasnt worth the money in my opinion, but then again you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Although I always shave prior to a shower, it&#x27;s nice to know that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several electric shavers over the years (Braun and Panasonic) from different price ranges and the Braun PocketGo P-70 shaves as good or better than any of the others.</li>
            <li> A fresh set of AA&#x27;s probably lasts me between 10-15 shaves before I begin to notice that they need replacing ...</li>
            <li> Among the hundreds of enthusiastic reviewiers, I noticed one that gave one star and said the shaver doesn&#x27;t do its job and only hurt his face.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful, compact razor.  </li>
            <li> in fact, I now own my third one.  </li>
            <li> The pop-out hair trimmer is useful for light-duty trimming between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is probably worth twice</li>
            <li> (I find 4 is good), so it&#x27;s not particularly fast.    </li>
            <li> Nice simple battery access that is sealed away from water.</li>
            <li> As such, it&#x27;s a good, very compact Braun shaver (with trimmer)</li>
            <li> The P70 is a more substantial unit and address the problem the old one had of accidently being turned on while being jared around in my vehicles.</li>
            <li> But there are rare times I don&#x27;t have time  for that.  </li>
            <li> You can get fresh AA&#x27;s literally anywhere.</li>
            <li> I keep the batteries out, so they are always fresh.</li>
            <li> good portability, but rough on skin</li>
            <li> I also own an earlier model of this shaver-about 3 years old--and it gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li> It does the job as good or better than the much more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to close it completely or the batteries will die.</li>
            <li> , you may want to look elsewhere because the single foil doesn&#x27;t catch longer hairs exceptionally well ...</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job, even dry, and that&#x27;s a plus when in a hurry as I often am.</li>
            <li> My old pocket shaver from braun worked great but needed a new film cover, was cheaper to buy new shaver.  </li>
            <li> At first I was reluctant to do that, but I eventually found out that it works quite well to clean the shaver, with no ill effects.    </li>
            <li> This is a marvellous little razor and just as good as any full size electric.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, I think it does as good a job as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Battery life seems good since I&#x27;d be recharging by now with my other</li>
            <li> but the service was exceptionaly good, I recieved it much before the schedule date and it is exactly the same as shown on web!</li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> As it turned out, my friend was right.  </li>
            <li> Oh, right.</li>
            <li> And, the price is right.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> So I use gloves, just as I&#x27;m wearing gloves to type right now.</li>
            <li> my higher end one (which does NOT do a better job shaving) is in a case that came with it and required frequent recharging.     </li>
            <li> It is very well designed to protect the foil and be kept clean.   </li>
            <li> I am very disapointed with this razors ability to provide me with a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to clean.</li>
            <li> a great little shaver!</li>
            <li> What a great little razor!  </li>
            <li> This little guy is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> This little shaver is amazing!</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the trimmer is very lightweight...doesn&#x27;t do a great job, but hey, my old one didn&#x27;t have one at all!</li>
            <li> Great design, as usual, from Braun.  </li>
            <li> I have a light beard and normally use a Norelco at home.</li>
            <li> The shaver design is cool as it&#x27;s very compact, has no cords and runs for up to a month on a set of batteries if using it every day for a couple of minutes per day.    </li>
            <li> I normally use a Norelco and the Braun shaves as close as that but not as comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the oomph nor the really nice sideburn trimmer that would make it a good choice for daily chopping of a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> A very economical shaver that works as good as more expensive shavers</li>
            <li> The trimmer is tiny but perfect for those little repairs when you are on the road.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the quality and performance of this little unit.</li>
            <li> But as a second razor or for occasional use, it&#x27;s pretty near to perfect.    </li>
            <li> Cuts great for 2-3 months maximum until cheap frail head begins to wear thin and blades  </li>
            <li> It is simple and easy to clean with running water.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a rotorary action in my shaver, but this inexpensive Chinese shaver is good for travel.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt waste too many batteries, and if u use rechargeable batteries you will save even more.</li>
            <li> Great shaver &amp; it works better than my expensive Braun.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to clean.</li>
            <li> How quickly do you have to replace the whole unit/or blade that goes with it?</li>
            <li> Since mine has only light duty I can&#x27;t comment on battery life (still on the originals) or how it performs as a primary shaver.  </li>
            <li> This was strong enough for his full face beard.</li>
            <li> I found this little gadget when my rotary-head Norelco razor was dropping hints of its impending demise and thought I&#x27;d pick up the Braun until I found another really good razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver to pack in my suitcase for travel.  </li>
            <li> The rotary-head Norelco was probably better at shaving a 3- or 4-day old beard, but the Braun has been perfectly fine for daily or every-other-day use.  </li>
            <li> swivel cap (protects shave head), safety lock switch button, secure battery compartment, side burn trimmer, cleaning brush and last but not least, you can clean the shave head by running water through it!</li>
            <li> This new model also allows you to clean it by rinsing with water.  </li>
            <li> Now, with a potential target demographic of 100 million customers, you would think the shaving companies would be a wee bit more interested than they appear to be where it comes to a portable electric shaver that you can keep &amp; recharge in the car.  </li>
            <li> The M90 looks pretty much exactly like the P-70, but guess what?  </li>
            <li> do a great job for users having thick beards.  </li>
            <li> Of course I had to try it out first.</li>
            <li> The first shave was as close as an $80.00 Panasonic or an $40.00 Braun.</li>
            <li> I bought my first \\&quot;PocketGo\\</li>
            <li> I went through one set of batteries (2 AA, the unit is not rechargeable) after the first month or so.</li>
            <li> First time electric shaver user.</li>
            <li> I use more often than my standard Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to shaving first with the Norelco, then doing a touch-up pass with one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just ordered ten more in case they stop making them.</li>
            <li> 2 double A&#x27;s, not the closest tightest shave, but on the go, does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> First it comes with Duracell batteries, which after a month I still have not had to change.</li>
            <li> Its small size is great since I do not have the room in my bathroom for a whole charging station and razor to sit.</li>
            <li> Powerful and very comparable to my Norelco three head shaver...</li>
            <li> on flat surfaces with flat hairs, great...</li>
            <li> I wore out the first one (purchased in 1989).</li>
            <li> Wet shave feature is a nice option</li>
            <li> Pick up some electric razor pre-shave gel (my personal favorite is Lectric Shave Ultra) and be ready to be wowed!</li>
            <li> First they tell me to throw it away</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun!</li>
            <li> I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 only because the trim attachment could be better.</li>
            <li> As most people say, you can actually use it on an every day basis!</li>
            <li> Overall he says it&#x27;s ok, but perhaps would work best as a backup, especially if you have coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> If you think you must use a blade to get a perfect, close shave, you&#x27;re wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before and this is my first time.  </li>
            <li> it is a big design improvement and shaves even better.  </li>
            <li> The first thing to give out on it is screen.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I bought was a pair of AA NiMH batteries with the highest mA hour rating.  </li>
            <li> After only a couple of uses, I have not had any problem with irritation and the shave is OK.  </li>
            <li> For the first couple of days it agitated my skin</li>
            <li> Sure enough it was and the product is all it is described to be!!!</li>
            <li> I have just taken my first trip using it.</li>
            <li> I am a first time electric shave user.</li>
            <li> Even after my first try there was almost no irritation.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews, and the ones I don&#x27;t agree with I will simply ignore and not bring attention to their sinful lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only suggestion to Braun is to make the bottom square so it will stand on end better in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> and I was glad to find that it works just as well on rechargeable AAs and gets about the same number of shaves on a charge that my Norelco did.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s slightly bigger and it has better</li>
            <li> Very noisy!  </li>
            <li> And the electric motor will wear out quicker with the higher voltage.</li>
            <li> I had a Titanium Turbo for a year before this razor and was very satisfied with its ability to cut my tougher than average beard.   </li>
            <li> It arrived on-time (thanks Amazon!)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It might cut short stubble OK, but it just won&#x27;t cut a three day growth of my graying blond beard at all.  </li>
            <li> but you could get a better shave if you clicked you heels together and wished for your facial hair to fall out.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty well and it is pretty hand since it is cordless and runs on batteries.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the refill kit for a Braun 360, and you can wash it with hot water.  </li>
            <li> , you have a shaver ready to rock and roll!    </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s about the same as my $100 unit (maybe better)</li>
            <li> If the shave sucked, I would be the first to tell you.  </li>
            <li> , how can something so unbelievably cheap be getting such rave reviews, but it&#x27;s all true.  </li>
            <li> Braun makes the best razors but they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> I bought ten more on line to save on shipping.  </li>
            <li> This newer version looks decidedly better but the trimmer slides sideways, not up, and is a pain to use - a definite step backwards -</li>
            <li> of Nov 2011, everything is as it was when I first started using it in 09.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it as an everyday shaving device, but it is good for &#x27;touch ups&#x27; here and there between shaves with a manual razor.</li>
            <li> Two minor things; the trimmer would work better if it was at a larger angle.i had to make sure my thumb was not on switch while shaving as I unintentionally turned razor off by mistake a couple of times.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly smaller shaving area and may not shave as quickly, but I don&#x27;t think the difference is significant.  </li>
            <li> The battery life on this thing is incredible, I&#x27;ve used it at least twice a week for the last 3 weeks to shave my entire face/throat, and the original batteries are still going strong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had to recharge them once so far, which seems amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those rare cases of getting more than you expected.</li>
            <li> Though it wasn&#x27;t always easy to find replacements in local stores, I&#x27;m sure the internet will solve this problem for me in the future.  </li>
            <li> It is almost as good as my much more expensive Panasonic rechargeable in use at home.</li>
            <li> It really struggles if I let my stubble grow out for more than a day, since I have fairly coarse beard hair.  </li>
            <li> You should own this shaver, if not for a primary, at least for a back-up.</li>
            <li> The construction is solid, the result is good, the battery last longer than others.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after reading the mostly positive reviews of it here.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver before my vacation based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> but if you order just the cutter and screen, the cost is pretty close to what the whole thing cost.  </li>
            <li> my husband has burn up so many plugging them in and letting them charge too long</li>
            <li> In fact, it worked so well that I decided to get a \\&quot;real Braun shaver\\&quot; and bought a higher end model.</li>
            <li> More importantly, this shaver enabled my child to become independent in shaving within a very short time.  </li>
            <li> It will not cut light hairs, and works best on heavy thick beards.</li>
            <li> Even my old Norelco that was falling apart was full when I opened it up.      </li>
            <li> This shaver is quite small and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Does it provide a darn good shave on a thick beard, yes - very much so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s self-contained foil protector and trimmer are good features not available on most other travel razors.</li>
            <li> Great little gadget!!!</li>
            <li> While out on a week-long mission, as some guys are trying to either dry shave or make do with bottles of water, I&#x27;ve been able to whip out this shaver and get touched up for the day.    </li>
            <li> This shaver works pretty well, shaves reasonably close and is a very functional design.</li>
            <li> PocketGo renders a highly respectable dry shave.  </li>
            <li> The  battery life is very good with 2 double AAs (easily get a few months if you shave like I do with wet razor first).    </li>
            <li> This little gem is easy to use, well made (I dropped it on cement), and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> It certainly blows away anything Norelco has to offer.  </li>
            <li> Given all of this, I&#x27;d certainly buy this razor again.</li>
            <li> spots on my face, it will not shave certain areas unless I concentrate on them</li>
            <li> and I am in pure shock because I bought this unit from Amazon for $11.99.  </li>
            <li> The blade is super sharp and the motor is strong.</li>
            <li> not only is this easy for him to use, but it also works very well.</li>
            <li> It works just fine and the batteries last longer than I thought.</li>
            <li> I just took it to Costa Rica and it was still running fine after 15 days of shaves on the same set of 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, its a nice little razor.  </li>
            <li> It is very good if you shave every day, however, if you miss a day, it will have a hard time on the neck, and you may be left with</li>
            <li> It gets my mustache area very well, but I can always feel some fine left over chin stubble.  </li>
            <li> It was my first purchase of a foil razor, vice a rotary, and I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> At first I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> It is a great little razor that performs like the bigger electric razors.</li>
            <li> Use it for travel to bring in my carry-on luggage and still use it every day as it gets those areas which a large Panasonic (nice but more expensive) doesn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> After much detective work, I settled on this, the Braun Model P-70.  </li>
            <li> Really suprised me on how well it works, You just have to remember its a shaver not a razor.</li>
            <li> My husband had mentioned that he would really like a battery operated shaver for his birthday.  </li>
            <li> Seller was on time and very responsive to my emails.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Braun battery operated shavers for years and have found them to be very reliable and convenient to use while traveling.</li>
            <li> Portable, fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> All you have to do when you receive it, is pop the batteries in, and it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li> This shaver passes security and works very well.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver so much, and it&#x27;s so inexpensive, that I bought two this time around.</li>
            <li> Travels very well.      </li>
            <li> They will think you spent a lot more.</li>
            <li> It has performed very well.    </li>
            <li> I just rubbed my chin to feel how smooth this shaver left it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really know what to expect</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.[[ASIN:B00007M9SU Braun 370 PocketGo Battery Operated Shaver]]</li>
            <li> But doing so irritated my skin too much.</li>
            <li> and I ended up looking like I needed a shave for much of the trip.</li>
            <li> now use it as my daily shaver and it does better than my former daily shaver, a Panasonic wet/dry, which cost 3 times more.</li>
            <li> The shaver also seems to be really well made.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close, closer than my Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It even gets the neck hairs very well.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like it,</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve spent a lot more than 10 or 11 bucks on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product use is intended for the very tender underams of a pre-teen.</li>
            <li> I tried it once almost 10 years ago and it had really irritated my skin then.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It works really well.</li>
            <li> This pocket shaver works very well.</li>
            <li> Spend some money and get a real razor.</li>
            <li> They really help if I am going out after work or going to the gym.     </li>
            <li> Otherwise I really like the shaver for the cost and the way it stores.    </li>
            <li> Cheap enough ($10 ea)</li>
            <li> He says it shaves really well for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> real problem</li>
            <li> I would only recomend this to someone who has a light beard.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Finally, although it&#x27;s washable, the instructions tell you to coat the shaving screen with a light machine oil or cooking oil after each washing.   </li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it this whole time and traveling with it as part of his carry-on luggage</li>
            <li> The ability to shave in the shower is a real bonus and does improve the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having a smaller electric for travel.</li>
            <li> but at the cost they are selling the whole shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits very well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;Uses</li>
            <li> it really gets kinda ragged when I used this.</li>
            <li> He loves it very compact.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and does not hurt his face being a teen with teen issues</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from being worthy as a main use shaver.</li>
            <li> According to him, he has a lot more stubble left after a shave than with his old Remington.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as close a shave like a good razor gives but not too far from it (and don&#x27;t forget this is an inexpensive travel shaver so some of Braun&#x27;s more expensive shavers are probably closer yet)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A fresh set of batteries will last through a week long vacation but it is wise to keep an extra set.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shaver from a local drug store before heading out of town.  </li>
            <li> For me this shaver works better than any other at any price.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a battery-powered Norelco, and it is a much better buy at only a slightly higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 other models of this shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than all the other electric full-sized shavers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for travel use but now use it daily for over a month now.    </li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that you can clean it in running water.</li>
            <li> IT IS SMALL, HANDY, DOES THE JOB, AND THE PRICE IS ABSOLUTELY A GIFT.  </li>
            <li> but if you need a clean, proper shave you will not get it with this.</li>
            <li> But I like it so much, I am using it as my main razor.</li>
            <li> It does get nice and close for a long lasting shave.</li>
            <li> This small razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> This model is now called the Braun Mobile Shaver - M90 and its suitable for folks with not so heavy beard growth.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco rotary shavers in the past (someone told me that foil shavers cause more skin irritation) and have never gotten a good shave with them, so for the past number of years, I have been using a Mach3.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shaver, but it&#x27;s difficult to give it a better rating than 2 stars (which is mostly for the design itself).</li>
            <li> Using it as I do it doesn&#x27;t have to cut a full day&#x27;s growth of beard, only a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> As long as the PocketGo is clean, it shaves VERY close.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as clean as a normal shave, but does the trick if you only have one day&#x27;s growth, maybe two.</li>
            <li> * Small, portable and easy to travel with or for a quick shave in the car.    </li>
            <li> These are surprisingly good little razors -- especially when you consider the price.</li>
            <li> If you order the P-70, you&#x27;ll be wasting your money when its &#x27;new version&#x27; costs $22!  </li>
            <li> Very few have given me both a clean &amp; comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s Shaver]]), the PocketGo P-70 gives a 10x better shave in half the time.  </li>
            <li> Since it does not need any charging circuitry and has a plastic case the shaver weighs less than most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the older model for a few years now and its time to get the newer, more modern looking unit.  </li>
            <li> I typically pay more money for a pack of razor blades.</li>
            <li> Clever design - no cap to lose.  </li>
            <li> I used to have the older model of this shaver before it broke.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is decent, provided you don&#x27;t use it as an every day shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cleverly designed unit, from the rotating foil guard, the pop-out trimmer, to the built-in cleaning brush and water-tight battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I have taken it on many trips and the batteries last and last.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace an older Braun razor that was not specifically designed for travel.  </li>
            <li> missing parts supplied click stops to the rotating shell, which gave good quality feel, but had nothing to do with actual shaving.    </li>
            <li> Sure you have to go back over your face several times</li>
            <li> if you only use this as a travel shaver you will find it useful and very convenient.</li>
            <li> Got this after my older version of the Braun 370 broke.</li>
            <li> (Can&#x27;t complain about the older one breaking...</li>
            <li> I ordered the 370 water resistant version on amazon but ended up receiving the older non water resistant version which was the one I had been using until it broke.  </li>
            <li> The silver one also has a nicer look and feel, although the trimmer on the older one is easier to use for me.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is, it probably makes more sense to replace the entire shaver than to replace a foil at around $8.</li>
            <li> Battery operated and has a cleaning brush and a clever cover for the blade</li>
            <li> i had the older model of this shaver (braun 375) for 2-3 years before the shaving foil broke.</li>
            <li> Thinking, naturally, that if it lasted me a month it will have still been a sound investment as it was priced so incredibly low.      </li>
            <li> While the price and size of this shaver is okay, it just didn&#x27;t shave that well unless I went over the same area several times.</li>
            <li> Shave was decent on my face.</li>
            <li> The head on the P70 is also a stronger unit then the one on my older model.   </li>
            <li> It will even do a decent job hitting that unruly hair that us over 50 get in those places we would rather not have hair; nose and ears.  </li>
            <li> If I could find a decent shaver I might shave twice a week maybe, just to get around the \\&quot;toothpaste in the beard\\&quot; problem.  </li>
            <li> My main gripe is the lack of a built-in rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, again particularly at this price.</li>
            <li> It does a remarkably good job of shaving plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> No need to buy those highly priced shavers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as a portable or home shaver.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend ...</li>
            <li> A high seller rating and the feeling of a hefty quality build.  </li>
            <li> Even my Remington, which was given to me on my graduateion from high school in 1955 (yes, 1955) gave a comparable shave.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> During that trip, I grew to love this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> Spending 100-200 bucks will buy you some extras gismos for gadget-heads, but little meaningful gains.  </li>
            <li> I really love this little braun.</li>
            <li> I had to use the brush to clean my old one, and the brush against the screen (a big no-no!) is what did it in.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I took the Braun 370 on my last vacation, and the AA batteries easily lasted for two weeks&#x27; worth of shaves while I was away.  </li>
            <li> This bad boy is really awesome.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it a few months ago for a trip overseas and was absolutely blown away by its performance, so much so that it is now my primary razor.  </li>
            <li> It trims very close for an electric, and is even lighter than my old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recomended to anyone who wants to start using electric shavers, and to anyone who want to change an old shaver.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shave - heavy dark beards might not fare so well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this razor; instead of spending $20 on this, spend $40 on a much better one.</li>
            <li> (I just love the guy that rated it 4 stars because it missed a few hairs)  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s true, and not unexpected for an $18 shaver.</li>
            <li> that price, nothing better if you don&#x27;t care about cut some missing hairs.</li>
            <li> The finished shave was almost as smooth as a regular razor, the difference was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday in between razor shaves: mostly just on my mustache while letting the beard scruff grow in.</li>
            <li> I normally use a blade and, when on trips over 1 week, do take a blade and shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> Unless you normally travel with a bottle of Wesson Oil, that&#x27;s an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I sort of thought the price was too good to be true although I don&#x27;t see why shavers are so expensive generally speaking.  </li>
            <li> It is very portable, has the cover built-in, can be used dry or wet, runs on regular 2 AA batteries, and surprisingly for its size (and price)</li>
            <li> I was excited about this little shaver at first.  </li>
            <li> But the other three worked fine.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller version which will turn on in your brief case unless you tape it the has a cap which is easy to misplace or drop in the car.  </li>
            <li> Braun calls it a travel razor; right now, it&#x27;s my only razor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ordering a third right now.  </li>
            <li> This cheapy little shaver is very well made,but does not feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is cheap compared with other electric shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am not sure that I would use the PocketGo as an everyday device I can see why many would and in fact many are doing so.</li>
            <li> It shaves as well, or better than some high dollar Braun and Panasonic shavers I have owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing new.</li>
            <li> We live in Taiwan, and it is HUMID.  </li>
            <li> (the shaver won&#x27;t just quit on you, it gives you plenty of warning that you&#x27;ll be needing a new set of batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new model has the added advantage of the head being washable under a sink.</li>
            <li> Would you recommend it for the tender underams of someone new to shaving?</li>
            <li> and it works like it was new.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a new one to have in my car for emergencies.</li>
            <li> The new NiZn rechargable AA&#x27;s are 1.6 volts (and come out of the charger at 1.85).</li>
            <li> Go figure ,20 bucks for a new one over 5 years,I&#x27;ll probably be writting another review in about another 5 years.</li>
            <li> I saw this new model in Hong Kong while traveling on business.  </li>
            <li> Flew home to the USA, opened the new packaged unit and tried it.  </li>
            <li> Bring an extra set of batteries and you&#x27;re probably good for a couple of weeks at least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller and doesn&#x27;t cut as well, but I guess I don&#x27;t really use it much anyway.    </li>
            <li> Anyone buying this to replace an older razor might hang on to the old case and the cleaning brush as well.         </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand how the designers, who obviously put so much though into this thing, let it come to market while this ineffective.</li>
            <li> This shaver fit all the criteria and has lasted through multiple use/abuse on a daily basis-until today-three years later(The foil has split on one corner).  </li>
            <li> I get as good results with the Braun 370 as I did with two previous (and much more expensive)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this little shaver!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little shaver if you only have a day or two&#x27;s growth (depending on your facial hair of course).  </li>
            <li> This little shaver works so well that I&#x27;m tempted to use it to replace my older Norelco as my primary shaver.</li>
            <li> I love how this product is small, lightweight and compact...</li>
            <li> Higher end models from norelco does just as well of a job for me compared with this low cost shaver.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is also less user friendly than the older model.  </li>
            <li> much better than I hoped for and rivaling more expensive options!  </li>
            <li> I have this unit probably  for last 2 years, I also had first generation of this unit which was 5615.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I subsequently received an email from Amazon saying \\&quot;For health and safety reasons, we don&#x27;t want the original item back, so please dispose of it at your convenience.\\</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m still on the first set of double A batteries !</li>
            <li> Not usually using an electric or being used to one</li>
            <li> It still after over a year,gives me the same close shaves as when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;ve changed it, but it looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> If you had electric shavers before, a lot of people will agree that there is little difference (at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced) between an electric foil shaver worth $100 and this portable one which is worth less than $</li>
            <li> I have a rechargeable shaver, which is &gt;5 years old, and I new I needed to get a new one or grow a beard again.  </li>
            <li> This afternoon, I shaved over the stubble and got down to smooth skin....</li>
            <li> After shaving with blades for the past 12 years I have always been hesitant to even try an electric but this little thing is great.</li>
            <li> I use the razor, as my primary shaver, everyday and would highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you&#x27;re ready for a new experience (or just need a new shaver) check out Braun&#x27;s line and reviews on various sites.</li>
            <li> This shaver is now in the trash along with my old one and I am off to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nearly a year since I first posted the remarks above on this razor</li>
            <li> Fortunately it was not too expensive, but I think you are better off paying a few more bucks and getting a proper shaver</li>
            <li> This is one case where the item does not live up to the reviews which is rare for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty scared that if you don&#x27;t push it correctly, it might be easy to break and it is kind of hard to use, especially if you have really thick</li>
            <li> With all the positive reviews, it may just be the type of facial hair I have is incompatible with this razor.  </li>
            <li> However, the real proof in the pudding for me was when I removed the grill to clean it after having it for several months and there was only a tiny bit of whisker in there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Takes widely available AA batteries that last a long time&lt;br /&gt;Durable (3 years so far and still going)&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> On my last trip, I swapped my much more expensive travel razor for this remarkable little gem.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the new modern looks of the P70</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as fast and just a little more inconsistent than my dry shaver of choice, the Remington MS2 line, so I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for it at home now that I&#x27;m done testing.</li>
            <li> Personal items like razors have a feel that some will find more or less to their liking and some people who&#x27;ve grown used to a rotary-head razor might not care for this foil head on the Braun.  </li>
            <li> My only grip is that I&#x27;ve had two of these recent models (the 370) and the foils broke quite quickly on both.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who thinks the new Braun pocket travel shaver is inferior to the old Braun Pocket Twist model?!?!?!  </li>
            <li> no mess!</li>
            <li> You cannot get a closer shave unless you shave against the grain with a regular razor, which will almost certainly give you razor burn.</li>
            <li> For no obvious reason, it has large gaps on either side of the screen, so shavings tend to just fall out during use.    </li>
            <li> I invite suggestions for a new shaver that shaves nearly as well as blade, has a rechargeable/replaceable battery that will run for hours and produces no black powder from comb to foil wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I find that it takes a little longer to get that smooth feel, but the convenience and price make up for this.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a couple of these Braun P-70s at a ridiculously low single-digit price through Amazon a few months ago, and the quality and reliability is so good that it&#x27;s become my everyday go-to shaver.</li>
            <li> small light and portable and a decent shave too.</li>
            <li> Sharp and quick.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased two units believing portable shavers may not last very long or the possibility that I may break or lose it.  </li>
            <li> I cannot beleive I only spent 14 dollars on such a great little razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not as powerful as the more expensive plug-in type shavers</li>
            <li> However, for me it shaves very efficiently and comfortably and in addition to using it for travel I frequently use it late in the day to give me a clean-shaven look before going out to dinner, parties, etc.  </li>
            <li> I still have it and it works great, I am just afraid that because it is that old that it will give out just when you need it.</li>
            <li> Batteries last forever, the shave is very close, and the cutter and foil have lasted far longer than competing products.  </li>
            <li> Completely self contained with case, brush and trimmer built in.</li>
            <li> Completely waterproof.</li>
            <li> off\\&quot; if left on for 3 hours straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite surprised</li>
            <li> But one thing I can tell you up front is that I have a Norelco 8825 XL rotary whose replacement heads alone (which need replacing every six moths or so) cost twice as much as this entire razor.</li>
            <li> But it hasn&#x27;t worked for me so far.</li>
            <li> I am looking for replacement foil and cutter block for my old 5615...</li>
            <li> This very low priced shaver does just as well as electric shavers that cost five times as much.</li>
            <li> This razor is very portable, batteries last for weeks/months at a time.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> The shaver completely misses the hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li> On flatter areas of my face, I get as smooth a shave as I would with a regular wet shave razor and foam, without the irritation I get from my sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that even with months between trips, I can simply slip in a set of back-up batteries and be ready.</li>
            <li> I keep one of these in my car to use nearly every day</li>
            <li> (He used to have an old plug in shaver just like this one) and I will send the unopened one to a friend&#x27;s husband in Iraq.  </li>
            <li> After receiving I tried it out that evening and was totally surprised at the quality shave I received.</li>
            <li> However, the old unit used 3 AA and this uses 2 AA.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly sensitive neck and this shaver did not cause any razor burn whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Shaving was about as fast as a regular electric shaver.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors all of my adult life, and almost all of them have been Braun models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these in early October.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this shaver, I recently purchased a second one that I&#x27;ve tucked away still sealed in its packaging for that time when the one that I&#x27;m currently using finally lives out its life (e.g. the foil and/or blades need replacing).</li>
            <li> I bought this razor when my old one died.  </li>
            <li> I have no irritation after shaving, which I could not say about my old razor.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re deployed, you&#x27;re not always near an outlet.</li>
            <li> i have a sensitive skin..  </li>
            <li> He ended up shaving his sore face with his old shaver.  </li>
            <li> My old model got chewed up by a dog...</li>
            <li> The twist open feature is convenient, but would be better if it locked open and closed.  </li>
            <li> Might work well for light beards, avoid it if you have a heavy, fast-growing beard.</li>
            <li> old son who has been shaving since 14.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Positives are the low price, the trimmer, and the fact that it shaves really well.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old one because my roommate broke it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 yrs old and have been shaving for quite some time.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like to directly touch anything electrical.</li>
            <li> There are probably better electrics out there, but they are bigger and heavier, and they cost at least 5 times as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Not heavy like a brick, but not flimsy or chintzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This only makes economic sense if you use rechargables for all your AA needs.</li>
            <li> Whenever I am running late for work, which is most days, I get this razor out of my glove box and shave on the way to work.  </li>
            <li> My (30 year old) travel Norelco broke and I needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one because I keep two travel kits ready to go.</li>
            <li> At that moment I was hoping I had packed the old unit in my toiletry kit when I checked out of the hotel.</li>
            <li> It has all the effect of rubbing a roll-on deodorant on my face as far as hair removal goes.</li>
            <li> Recently my job began requiring much longer days</li>
            <li> and I frequently found myself sporting quite a shadow with no opportunity to lather up.  </li>
            <li> Even so, calling it a shaver is very misleading as it simply doesn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li> After doing this for about a week, my face has completely cleared up and with no signs of irritation.</li>
            <li> Do not expect this shaver to get all the coarse or dense hairs that a straight razor does.  </li>
            <li> If you are a frequent traveler then I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after my old battery powered Remington wore out.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2, one for me, and one for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I found the early version of P-70 in a bin at Wal-Mart for $17</li>
            <li> complete -</li>
            <li> a bit challenging on the neck to get those few stray hairs, but overall I would not hesitate to recommend this.</li>
            <li> This shaver may be OK for your 14 year-old nephew, but for a man with a heavy beard, it is inadequate, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> good enough, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Maybe grizzly men with thick wiry stubble would need something more heavy-duty, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 months now</li>
            <li> What kind of game is this?</li>
            <li> the down motion does not seem to cut any beard, it made no effect on my 1 day old stubble and it got cleared( not completely) once I started more of upward moion.  </li>
            <li> This little 370 gives almost as good of a shave as my more expensive Braun (8975)!</li>
            <li> It works all right, but is slow and can easily miss long hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the closest shave, but it&#x27;s very adequate for the small price I paid.</li>
            <li> : close shave, dry or wet use, cleans easily, blade protection with automatic off, cleaner brush housed on shaver, 2 AA battery use.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a large Norelco, but for the price this seemed like it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> so one stays in the suitcase with NO MESS,</li>
            <li> As the batteries wear down, the shave isn&#x27;t as good, but it&#x27;s hard to tell when you have reached the point of needing to change the batteries.  </li>
            <li> With the price less than 16.00 on Amazon, this rasor not only beat any razor within the price range, but also beat shavers cost more than double.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I had intended to give one of these away as a gift, but when my older, high-end Braun conked out shortly after I received the P-70s, I decided to keep both, to have one as a backup.</li>
            <li> This is my second one that runs on AA batteries, my first one was purchased in Germany back in 1992.</li>
            <li> I think the single head design allows it to get into tight areas much better than a dual head model.</li>
            <li> He rubbed over his face as usual and it left more hair than it cut.  </li>
            <li> Its a decent deat for $10 especially since its washable.</li>
            <li> So being realistic, it only cost $15.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these types of pocket shavers before and this one is vastly improved from older models.</li>
            <li> So I bought this double head foil Eltron at the drug store for $10 and go figure, it gives a decent shave with a fraction of the irritation...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for every type of guys, especially if you&#x27;re always on the go!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase.  </li>
            <li> As with other shavers I&#x27;ve had, it seems you have to keep going over certain spots several times to get a \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; feeling (I even have to do this with certain places with my razors).  </li>
            <li> Also, after more than 2 months of daily use and a serious cleaning, the shaver looks now like new.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very close, nor does it catch medium or long hairs.    </li>
            <li> Was on vacation recently and somehow managed to lose my razor I normally take with me.  </li>
            <li> For 20 years I wore a full face beard and didn&#x27;t shave, just mowed every few months.  </li>
            <li> but I still keep (and use) this little shaver for times when I need a quick shave or something to take with me on a trip.</li>
            <li> It is hardly a shaver to be satisfied with, but for a short vacation it could be sufficient.</li>
            <li> While it is good for trimming down sideburns and working on the &#x27;stache, it doesn&#x27;t stick out far enough from the side to keep from getting the foil shaver portion buzzing and tickling against your face, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> The price is so low that I&#x27;d still be money ahead, compared to disposable blades, even if I had to buy a new PocketGo every six months or so.</li>
            <li> I not only live the shorn lifestyle, but am shed-free in terms of skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive battery powered shaver to replace my very old Braun that recently died: I now shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> Granted the Remington was a dual foil as opposed to the single, but I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it made that much difference.</li>
            <li> The new Braun 370 PocketGo works just as well as the older one, and the batteries still last for a long time.</li>
            <li> You wont find it on the M-50 model, but they have added that back to the P-70 model, but I still miss the little brush that came attached to the bottom of the original version.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time electric razor user and wanted to try one before I spent a couple of hundred dollars for a razor that may not work for me!  </li>
            <li> Of my first two, I dropped one in the water and the other on a tile floor...</li>
            <li> This model is a little larger than previous models, but the shave is exceptional for such a convenient shaver.</li>
            <li> more expensive sibling with some irritation not present in the higher end model.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is amazingly powerful considering it runs on just AA battery power.</li>
            <li> My last Braun was more then 15 yrs old before it quit working and a tough unit it was indead.  </li>
            <li> What I like about this cheap shaver is that it is durable and lasts at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they kept some of the design the same as their old model.</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that when it&#x27;s locked for travel it cannot be turned on accidentally and the foil is completely covered so it cannot be damaged.</li>
            <li> I bought a Pulsonic and returned it a month later because it shaves as close as my old Norelco Spectra 8891xl, which I rate a 7/10.    </li>
            <li> Not often am I pleasently surprised by an item at the low end of the cost scale, but this one hits the mark.  </li>
            <li> The foil screen popped out of the shaver head and it took me nearly a minute to set the screen back on the four pins that held it in place.  </li>
            <li> I used the old unit (which I&#x27;ve had 3 of them over 12+ years) and left it on the bathroom counter on purpose as I checked out.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out and it barely scraped the surface of my stubble.</li>
            <li> So, over the next 12 years, I ended up tried just about everything from top of the line Disposables, expensive safety and straight razors and even laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But most importantly -- it&#x27;s a poor shave.</li>
            <li> Leaves a lot of stubble behind even after spending more time on my face (and leaving razor burn).  </li>
            <li> The thing that makes this problem worse is many people would be using this shaver as a traveler and may not find out how ineffective it is until they are on the road.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the design of this P-70, (except for the poor side burn trimmer design).  </li>
            <li> (A P-70 was also a World War II aircraft but as far as I am aware, that P-70 is not available from Amazon.)    </li>
            <li> LITTLE RASCAL RIGHT HERE BY MY COMPUTER DESK</li>
            <li> This one really has some energy and so far I haven&#x27;t worn down the batteries.  </li>
            <li> This gives the shaver a very fast, very clean cutting speed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver for travel or everyday use and at this price you could buy a new one every year!</li>
            <li> the long hair cutter is considerable smaller and sideways, rather than in parallel to the main one.</li>
            <li> This little gem is still available from Amazon, which surprises me, because I worry that sooner or later Braun is going to decide that it&#x27;s stealing sales from the company&#x27;s more expensive razors and pull it off the market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Higher end shavers may use li-ion but since two lower end shavers cost less than one higher end</li>
            <li> The shave that you get with this machine is no worse than the result that you get with other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t add much to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big, not too small, but juuuust right!</li>
            <li> The new top slides &#x27;over&#x27; the shaving head which means no more \\&quot;lost\\&quot; or \\&quot;cracked (broken)\\&quot; tops (and no longer too messy to pack)!</li>
            <li> I guess my facial hair is too coarse, because it is completely ineffective for me.  </li>
            <li> When my older alkaline-powered model died, I spent some time researching and decided on the P-70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> powerful enough for heavier beard growth, when I skip a few days, I need to use a razor</li>
            <li> I tried several expensive electric razors before and honestly, this one out performs them and costs 1/3 of what I paid for them.</li>
            <li> At less than $20, it&#x27;s easier just to purchase an entire new unit rather than swapping out pieces on a used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver!!!</li>
            <li> But I find that both my higher-end Braun and my Norelco&#x27;s shave longer on a single charge than this one on a new set of batteries.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It renders a nearly high end shave, offers wet shave versatility for a laughably low price and could be used nearly daily if you wished to.</li>
            <li> little shaver looked a bit flimsy at first.</li>
            <li> I needed a very particular present for a friend; I had overheard a conversation stating a portable shaver to keep in the car would be extremely desirable...</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin a little more irritated than my much more expense Panasonic, but not so bad that I would hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li> but if you have average beard growth and you shave every 1-2 days, there is absolutely *</li>
            <li> The only difference is that it is not as gentle on the skin as some other razors.</li>
            <li> It takes too long to shave; it is loud; it doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the shaving foil screen is not available as a replacement part.</li>
            <li> I have light facial hair growth but THICK, COARSE, and rapid scalp growth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The wet shave option opens up a new dimension.  </li>
            <li> It is now Nov 2014 and requesting a new one because this one, though still working, it getting a bit rough.</li>
            <li> I have always preferred a \\&quot;Screen\\&quot; type razor because it causes much less irritation than a rotary and shaves much closer.  </li>
            <li> I just used this as a travel shaver, and it worked really well, for the month and a half</li>
            <li> Typical modern day made-to-break junk then they want you to purchase another.</li>
            <li> At first, you may need to use the shaver a few times to properly cut your folicles to match the foil shaver.</li>
            <li> That being said, for ocassional touch-up or regular use (with 1-day beard growth), it certainly can&#x27;t be beat at this price -- given that it costs less than just the replacement blades alone for a corded/rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this little guy a try mostly bacause of the small size, being operated by AA and very low price.  </li>
            <li> at least down to five o&#x27;clock shadow whisker length, this is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> This one not only shaves just as close as the others, I use high capacity rechargeable batteries in it, and so far, two weeks later I&#x27;m still shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> My skin had only very slight irritation the first time I tried it and</li>
            <li> a \\&quot;back up\\&quot;,vacation razor or for a quick touch up for late night meetings.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t know how long the batteries will last but even if I only get a few shaves, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most differences that I expected to find annoying in this device have proved easy to get used to.         </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m aware that most shavers leave a little stubble behind that needs to be mowed with a blade.</li>
            <li> This little gem does both very well.</li>
            <li> but this inexpensive well designed little beauty works very well.  </li>
            <li> not chew my skin up as much as rotary shavers&lt;br /&gt;Has a little pop out trimmer for sideburns, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this little one is as good as the expensive one.</li>
            <li> Ordered a new one and will keep the other one as backup/work shaver as it still works, only would like after 5 years or so to exchange the blade.  </li>
            <li> Since I was in transit and my previous shaver had more or less run itself down, I opted insetad to buy this puppy.  </li>
            <li> ;  Actually, finding a men&#x27;s portable electric shaver was far more difficult than I would&#x27;ve expected.  </li>
            <li> An odd characteristic is that the trimmer slides out easily but requires a stiff push to retract.         </li>
            <li> It is small and light (half the size and weight of a Norelco) and has a flip over guard to protect the heads so it doesn&#x27;t require a separate case.  </li>
            <li> And I have not found it to be very hard to keep clean, and my batteries have never fallen out.</li>
            <li> B000052Y6Z Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave, Original, 3 fl oz]] and see if that helps the \\&quot;left behind hair\\&quot; problem.</li>
            <li> I had no major complaints about the series of expensive razors that preceded it, but this is just, all things considered, a better razor.  </li>
            <li> the price this shaver is sold for, it would be ridiculous to spend money to replace a part that might cost almost as much as the complete machine.  </li>
            <li> After multiple, multiple, swipes in multiple directions there was always hair remaining whether I used it dry or in the shower.</li>
            <li> My final tip is to not leave your facial hair growing for too long before you shave.</li>
            <li> Initially it would not run long enough.</li>
            <li> The latest version of the PocketGo shaver P-70 seems to have the same problem as the Remington shavers - an irritating black powder coming off the blades and getting all over my face and towels.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the cost of a few refills for a decent blade razor.  </li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s simplicity, this powerfull little razor is extremely well designed and very reasonably priced to make it affordable to everyone.</li>
            <li> the other in the bathroom (with NO MESS).      </li>
            <li> Yet this little shaver requires 2 to 3 times the normal shaving effort and time.  </li>
            <li> I like them both, but I found that using the same batteries, the newer version vibrates faster than the old black one.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, for my thicker-haired beard (which admittedly has foiled most every foil head electric razor), the fine foil holes in the cutting surface is not nearly wide enough to admit my whiskers for chopping.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have only used it on a few trips and after a very modest amount of use the screen is wearing out</li>
            <li> It is much easier on my skin than the manual razors I&#x27;ve been using for the past quarter century.  </li>
            <li> Its small yet very efficient.  </li>
            <li> This item is most convenient especially the ability to wash the cutting blade daily in the sink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, portable and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I caved and looked for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> hairs that goes flat along your skin will not be cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batteries last long</li>
            <li> This one is a bit bigger but not nearly as efficient.</li>
            <li> but long enough to know that this well built razor is a winner.</li>
            <li> I especially like it on long road trips camping, not having to worry about recharging.</li>
            <li> How long it will last, I have no idea.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard, and I normally shave with a blade.  </li>
            <li> battery life is too short - several reviewers cite the AA vs. charger feature as a big advantage for the car and foreign travel.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used alkaline AA batteries, and at a rate of 1 set every 1 1/2 months, the cost is less than what you have to pay on blades and shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I have only used it as a dry shaver</li>
            <li> I went through all of the shavers Amazon featured (even called up Panasonic to get further details) but where portability is concerned, it appears to only center around the shaver itself and not the charger.  </li>
            <li> As a travel razor, I found the razor a bit oversized for my toilet kit.  </li>
            <li> This single foil shaver simply gets the job done.</li>
            <li> the extension for long hairs is a bit awkward to use and the top part only works well with shorts hairs.</li>
            <li> My original PocketGo had a neat little slide out trimmer for those hard to reach areas and hairs you miss that are too long.</li>
            <li> Disposable AA cells are expensive, and rechargeable AA&#x27;s are less convenient than simply being able to plug in the shaver or place it in a dock.    </li>
            <li> This small shaver is cleverly designed and needs no case.</li>
            <li> One day in a hurry in a large drug store I realized I could either go home and shave and be late or buy something portable and hope it worked.</li>
            <li> WOW, is all I can say about this little Braun gem.</li>
            <li> The only negative to this shaver is that if your hair grows in along the skin and not straight out (mainly the neck area), it does take several passes to get to it.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, it&#x27;s a nice widget otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Most inconvenient.</li>
            <li> No....you toss it in the garbage and learn that cheap is expensive.</li>
            <li> I wet shave using two different types of blade</li>
            <li> each set of batteries goes a long time.</li>
            <li> have no idea how long the foils will hold up and, if I can figure out how, I&#x27;ll update this review when once I do know.</li>
            <li> long hairs</li>
            <li> The Braun 370 was recommended to me by a friend who is a long time electric shaver user.  </li>
            <li> I expected something much smaller and lighter.</li>
            <li> No telling how long they&#x27;ll be around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 3rd one got wet and quit working.</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy duty beard trimmer but for someone whose everyday maintenance shave is about 3-5 minutes this works exceeding well.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Braun 370 to replace a 20 year old Aramis travel shaver (now dead).</li>
            <li> (Braun is 4.5 inches long when stowed)</li>
            <li> And it only uses two AA batteries and at the rate that they discharge its not much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Strange long hairs on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only about a half-inch wide and slides out a half-inch from the body of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> The built-in cover protects the shaving head when closed and swings open to unlock the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to shave close and it does not like long whiskers.</li>
            <li> The batteries last longer than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> I expected a shaver that would actually \\&quot;shave\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I also used a electric eyebrow shaver to the trim the hairs that were too long for the razor to cut.</li>
            <li> As has been noted elsewhere, this razor goes for a long time before needing battery replacement.  </li>
            <li> I buy this to replace my old Braun shaver (bought 7 years ago and still working well, but lost a few weeks ago).</li>
            <li> And you can be on any length trip as long as you can get a pair of AAs</li>
            <li> It has replaceable AA batteries that lasts long with each replacement set.  </li>
            <li> There is a small cleaning brush in the base--a nice touch; but, again, difficult to get a grip on to slide it out.  </li>
            <li> In short, the simple, functional design of this little razor has won me over completely; I&#x27;ve had it for half a year, it hasn&#x27;t skipped a beat, and I still like it.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint: Replacement parts (foil and blade) cost as much as a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Maybe I misunderstood its purpose and it was meant only for removing the odd tiny bit of hair here and there.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver, however, for traveling in the new age where we can&#x27;t carry our usual complement of supplies when flying.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE COMPACT ELECTRIC RAZOR IS EVERY BIT AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THE EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the only advantage this shaver has over other electric shavers though:    </li>
            <li> I did buy and try several other portable shavers--this one beat them all.  </li>
            <li> To my delight he gets a decent shave with this little shaver AND it costs much, much less than the blades.  </li>
            <li> Altough it is larger than other pocket shavers I have seen I will still give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s not as small as I thought it would be, and is a little noisier than my norelco, but the features in this thing are</li>
            <li> The only other deficit is a the crudeness of the trimmer...</li>
            <li> and I could only shave every other day until I discovered electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> Note: being that my facial skin was hard, my facial hair difficulty breaking the surface and with either lay flat against my face or curl back under.</li>
            <li> Also, this razor works both dry and in the shower with shaving cream, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> I recommend you let it air dry before replacing the foil/cover.  </li>
            <li> So I just wanted a dry shaver backup...</li>
            <li> When closed, it protects the shaving head very well, but the head is somewhat delicate and care must be used when cleaning not to damage it or to dislodge the foil from the frame.</li>
            <li> he has a fairly heavy beard and the more expensive shaver he has did not work as well.</li>
            <li> $100 big heavy recent make Panasonic wet/dry shaver with accessory charger and cord when I made trips</li>
            <li> I am still amazed at how long the batteries last before they run down.  </li>
            <li> That makes it fine for occasional use, but it would be expensive if you needed to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a single shave out of this shaver.</li>
            <li> what I can gather no one shaver can get every single hair (neck being perhaps the toughest spot) but a single wipe with a blade can get those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it because i can pick out single hairs.  </li>
            <li> I find the single foil allows me to shave without shaving cream, something else I don&#x27;t have to bring.  </li>
            <li> however my other shaver, a high end rechargeable Braun, is not much better.    </li>
            <li> With a tough beard and sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve had more than my share of uncomfortable experiences using electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it misses some hair at the neck area (which caused the only irritation since I really pushed hard to shave those few hair in the neck).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely self contained, waterproof, has a built in trimmer that retracts and even has a small attached brush for cleaning the foil blades.</li>
            <li> The foil gets pretty warm/hot after about 30 seconds, I have to blow on it to keep it from irritating my face.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I got this shaver because I was tired of spending a lot of time shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> I bought two before, and a repeated cuz the first one was broken by my fault.</li>
            <li> (We&#x27;re into the third or 4th type of blade and cream removals are leaving the skin red and raw.)</li>
            <li> but it might be wearing out; however, I plan on getting another soon to replace it for when it finally breaks down.</li>
            <li> Im an over the road truck driver and a road trip biker, I need a small compact razor that fits into my shaving kit is easy to use and tough enough to stand the abuse of ridding around for thousands of miles in heavy trucks and motorcycle saddle bags.   </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s not going to be easy.  </li>
            <li> It will be difficult to cut your neck hairs, you will need a trimmer first, then keep your hairs short with this Braun, don&#x27;t allow that your beard grow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try the PocketGo because of the glowing reviews I read here and because it has similar specs as the the Braun 190 for 25 dollars less.  </li>
            <li> And the Braun 370 cuts closer dry than the Panasonic cuts wet.</li>
            <li> Review after review praising this shaver, people running out to buy extras, and it not only destroyed my face but wouldn&#x60;t cut half the hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my partner, who previously used only disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Braun 370 dimensions:  4.75\\&quot; high x 2.25\\&quot; wide x 1.125\\&quot; thick at center.  </li>
            <li> (minus the strip down the middle).  </li>
            <li> At first, it was a little hard to open the battery compartment (as I take them out when the shaver is in storage) but that got easier after a few openings.  </li>
            <li> have not compared the Pocket Twist to other shavers in a long time.</li>
            <li> Since it flips into a case I expected it to contain all the loose hairs inside.</li>
            <li> I do one hand of my saving blade so that it can remove hair left out on hard to remove places between your chin and neck, it takes less than 2 minute for the complete shave.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bigger than a stack of playing cards, but</li>
            <li> But my schedule has left me with little time and an inconsistent day.  </li>
            <li> My beard grows out at an angle and this little Braun is the only one that picks up ALL the hairs.</li>
            <li> little razor cuts closer than a Panasonic portable wet/dry razor that I recently bought on Amazon, (see my review).</li>
            <li> Bought this little shaver several years ago in Berlin when BA lost my luggage in Heathrow.</li>
            <li> Do you think this little shaver would do well for very coarse underarm hair?</li>
            <li> Hard to believe it sells for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment about it is the precision trimmer as it is placed at a different angle</li>
            <li> Con: small long hair cutter, only functions for 60 minutes on 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no way</li>
            <li> I never really had a desire to use a foil shaver until I saw the price for this one.  </li>
            <li> My job as a US Army Broadcast Journalist takes me to some rough parts of the world.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bulky, and it&#x27;s just heavy enough to not have a chintzy feel.</li>
            <li> Another advantage is that you can use this shaver on wet skin, and can also wash it under running water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Has a relatively wide shaving head, which I like.</li>
            <li> You can get it wet,  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday for two weeks on a trip to China using the included alkaline batteries and it still has plenty of juice left.  </li>
            <li> Not very sustainable for the environment</li>
            <li> Now my wife is asking me why I spent $120 on the Panasonic -</li>
            <li> Rotating cover that automatically locks the razor and protects the foil when closed and lets you shave when opened.  </li>
            <li> This is a quality unit and I reccomend it to any one that want&#x27;s a compact razor that can stand up to rough treatment, run for longer</li>
            <li> however, you can get this thing wet, take it apart and wash it etc.  </li>
            <li> However, it is intended to be a touch-up shaver, not really a daily-use one.</li>
            <li> I could shave with a razor and shaving cream three or four times while this things tries to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a piece of junk...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However this thing couldn&#x27;t shave the bum fluff off a teenager.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t mind spending about 20 minutes with it while it tries again and again to cut the same few hairs over and over and over.</li>
            <li> that was it - regular blade shaving was starting to get very irritating in those sensitive areas (neck and around the mouth) probably due to the fact that stubble seems to turn into wire with age.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is decent for small spots w/ very little hairs</li>
            <li> Closed you don&#x27;t need any other case for it.</li>
            <li> (However I am still on my first cutting block and foil after several years&#x27; use.)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not do well with long hairs (e.g., I had difficulty shaving a 3-day beard with it).  </li>
            <li> my opinion, the only negative is that it is about half as big again as the Aramis.</li>
            <li> This little guy gives me just as close a shave as the Panasonic - and with less time going back and forth.</li>
            <li> Of those, let&#x27;s further round it down to about 100 million who drive cars.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the trick is to keep the skin as taut as possible, while moving the shaver in a circular motion WITH VERY LITTLE PRESSURE.</li>
            <li> The blades are still sharp.</li>
            <li> Extreme mechanophobia users beware.</li>
            <li> And those other razors have features telling you when the battery will run out.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers complain that it doesn&#x27;t get every hair-</li>
            <li> I got this for when my other razor needs recharging</li>
            <li> last shaver screen bought it from excessive unprotected exposure.)  </li>
            <li> Has plenty of power and is small enough to stow away with ease.</li>
            <li> This razor works extremely well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time the method has failed me, although I should have heeded the warnings.  </li>
            <li> But, it is not exactly a travel shaver.  </li>
            <li> Since AA batteries can be found anywhere, you can use this shaver with the confidence that it will never become obsolete when its built-in battery stops being operational (which seemed to happen way too soon with the other electric shavers I owned, by the way.)</li>
            <li> finally opened it up the other day, and a small spring and parts shot across the room.</li>
            <li> I bought it and was skeptical at first about its abilities.</li>
            <li> I especially like the small battery operated Brauns.</li>
            <li> But for the money and compared to other companies I give it 1 star</li>
            <li> I would have had to recharge my other shaver.  </li>
            <li> EDIT Since using it nothing to add other than in this newer model</li>
            <li> The other reviewer is correct...</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s your experience with how sharp the blade stays?  </li>
            <li> bought this shaver for use on other body parts than my face.</li>
            <li> I bought it for $20 and it shaves extremely close, works extremely well, and have had no complaints yet and probably will not.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and give a resectable shave for a unit at this price.</li>
            <li> It is a bit slower than a rechargeable and will miss long or heavy beard growth.</li>
            <li> But it does that well, with none of the neck irritation I remember from other electrics.  </li>
            <li> Worked 4 times then head broke due to flimsy construction.</li>
            <li> , it seems my face takes a little more heat when I am done using the Braun instead of a blade, but nothing bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s narrow little head isn&#x27;t as efficient as my big Braun.</li>
            <li> adequate for cutting longer hair&lt;br /&gt;Dead</li>
            <li> Not sure about frequent use, but for a few days, it has my vote!</li>
            <li> It is probably not a good choice for your main razor or for shaving every day:  the shaving head is just too small for that.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sells this produce for about HALF the price as other vendors.</li>
            <li> The other Braun pocket shaver which is black but also</li>
            <li> It is small and compact and uses standard batteries with little power drain.</li>
            <li> About the same as my dull Norelco shaving heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one area where I find that this (and all flat foils) are a little weak is on the upper lip around the nose.</li>
            <li> Only drawback I found was that it is not for anyone with a \\&quot;heavy, tough, daily growth\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I still got some stubble left and a few small nicks despite using the pre-shave gel.may</li>
            <li> I did not bother contacting amazon about this because for $15 it&#x27;s frankly not worth my time.  </li>
            <li> I never liked electric razors, because I find that they don&#x27;t give a close enough shave.  </li>
            <li> Its not clear if the AA batteries for the Braun 370 are proprietary or does this product run on ordinary batteries bought in a grocery store?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> give the clipper on the side average marks as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, in fact, quite the opposite.  </li>
            <li> Got tired of the old shavers with built-in charging systems for NiCad.</li>

            <li> I had to live out of a suitcase for approximately forty days a little less than a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Now each time I have a trip, it comes along to keep the luggage weight down.</li>
            <li> I give it 2-1/2 stars (rounded down to 2).</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t replace it for any other shaver!</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, I&#x27;m afraid of electrical devices near my face, so I use a regular shaver for that and store it in a separate drawer with other non-electrical items so it doesn&#x27;t become corrupt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might just be because I have sensitive skin, but this thing seriously hurt my face!</li>
            <li> so it was very difficult to trim my moustache quickly.</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to my expectation of quality I usually get from Braun.</li>
            <li> The brush is really too small and when the shaver head is exposed, the cover blocks access to the brush; it&#x27;s the only aspect of this design which seems awkward.  </li>
            <li> but then my beard isn&#x27;t too heavy, which may be a problem for some other people.  </li>
            <li> I read through a handful of other users&#x27; reviews, and I see where you&#x27;re all coming from when you talk about \\&quot;leaving a few hairs behind\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Since they can be purchased for $20 or less, I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> one less liquid hassle.</li>
            <li> So I find this to work for those trips of 4 days or less.</li>
            <li> Even though I just changed the blades/foil on my previous razor ([[ASIN:B000G1EQ1W</li>

            <li> but they use an ablative carbon steel that leaves the black carbon lubricant on your face after each shave.     </li>
            <li> Yeah, it broke after a month and a half;</li>
            <li> When travelling, the less you bring the happier</li>
            <li> but then it costs less than twenty dollars.  </li>
            <li> It costs less than twenty bucks, you can take in anywhere, and it shaves well</li>
            <li> What eles could you want with less than 16.00?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my 370 a year and a half</li>
            <li> but I find it to be less than satsifactory in terms of closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li> It arrived today and to say I was disappointed would be a huge understatement.  </li>
            <li> His last one he left charging all the time and the internal battery went bad.</li>
            <li> My only minor gripe is that the trimmer is situated such that it&#x27;s a little difficult for me to use, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to push the trimmer back into the shaver body once it&#x27;s out.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Panasonic shaver that just quit working after a few years, so I replaced it with the Braun 370.  </li>
            <li> I have had this little shaver for over a month</li>
            <li> The little brush fits neatly under the shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this little shaver 3 years ago for a 6-month trip around the world.</li>
            <li> This little guy works as well as any electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> We were camping in our travel trailer, and this little shaver comes with batteries, so he opened it and used it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed that they can sell this little shaver so inexpensively.  </li>
            <li> I am in the cateogry of individuals who went a little nuts and probably over-tried and over-analyzed every razor out there for a period of time.</li>
            <li> Purchased this little razor from Amazon in Feb 2008.</li>
            <li> This little machine is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This thing has little bitty holes in the screen instead of slots.  </li>
            <li> For someone of my propensity, having this little fella in my bookbag has saved my butt from a bunch of demerits.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is somewhat disappointing: it is slightly curved, not flat, and is positioned 90 degrees to the shaving foil, so trimming a beard or mustache is awkward and not so precise.</li>
            <li> The screens lasted approximately 3 months each when used on a daily basis (I bought 2).</li>
            <li> I like the ability to use replaceable AA batteries rather than just a hard-wired-in NiCd battery pack with a cord to lug around with you just in case the battery goes dead.  </li>
            <li> And I plan on getting a few backups.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.    </li>
            <li> If I skipped a day or two shaving over the weekend, this razor was near useless for the job come Monday morning.</li>
            <li> DSad has had a stroke and has had trouble shaving since then.</li>
            <li> (His 3-head full-size electric shaver never really fit.)  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to find him something he could take in his car but not have to worry with the dead battery and worry with charging</li>
            <li> two AA runs it well for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Thin hair (in individual hair</li>
            <li> My old shaver failed.</li>
            <li> I just take my time, don&#x27;t jam the razor into my face, and shave carefully and slowly like I would with a blade.  </li>
            <li> Replacement cutting block and foil are either not available or cost twice as much as the shaver.</li>
            <li> I am 75 eys old with a very tough beard.</li>
            <li> Only the very small \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; attachment works, and is in such an awkward position on the razor that it is hardly angled to do a proper job.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous shavers mentioned, you can even use it in the SHOWER!    </li>
            <li> Turns out I get less skin irritation with this shaver than with a rotary or a blade!</li>
            <li> Just throw in a couple plain AA batteries</li>
            <li> This is annoying because, when you want to use the brush, it&#x27;s because you want to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> This razor definitely leaves hairs behind, but I guess that&#x27;s usual.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a little small but it works.</li>
            <li> I WAS DOUBTFUL ABOUT HOW GOOD A SHAVE I WOULD GET FROM AN INEXPENSIVE COMPACT SHAVER.I HAVE USED SEVERAL COMPACT SHAVERS IN THE PAST AND WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR PERFORMANCE..</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, this is the closest shave I have gotten from an electric razor (and I have owned 2 previous Braun shavers within the last 15 years, both of them the expensive models with rechargeable batteries.)</li>
            <li> It shaves with the premium razors but it is much less expensive and smaller.</li>
            <li> I canned the other expensive rechargeables since the battery often will not last the amount it claims to last, and now you have a $80 - 100 shaver that&#x27;s useless since it will no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> My rechargable starts to slow down after a couple of uses and, of course, needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li> Run the thing across your face until it&#x27;s raw, ain&#x27;t gonna happen.  </li>
            <li> I use to use lather and a safety razor but my skin was always raw</li>
            <li> But for the price just impossible to complain about that too much.</li>
            <li> Having course, curly facial hair, I constantly had to deal with painful ingrown hairs and irritation.  </li>
            <li> I returned the Panasonic Vortex after 3 weeks when I bought this funky little gizmo!  </li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE SHAVER IS A DYNAMO!  </li>
            <li> I have a reasonably thick growth, and found that anything after a day was impossible to remove consistently with this shaver</li>
            <li> I have used this little gem for at least 35 shaves . .  </li>
            <li> No more</li>
            <li> I could not get past the pain to continue using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a small, inexpensive razor this is the one to choose.</li>
            <li> I also plan on using rechargeable batteries soon (I am not sure if this shaver works with NiMH batteries though,) which would make the cost per shave almost negligible.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Operation was getting a bit sporadic this past year.</li>
            <li> For the money, there is no better travel shaver out there.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 Norelco shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> Then I realized that it was leaving LOTS of uncut facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It is small works vary well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price if not more</li>
            <li> Unbelievably well designed, has a quality feel that belies its under $20 pricetag, and works like a dream.</li>
            <li> * Small, compact, portable design.  </li>
            <li> I have given up looking for another expensive razor and have ordered a second Braun 370 to keep in my desk at work.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Small, close shave and works on 2AA</li>
            <li> Trimmer is small, but its the price you pay for a compact shaver.</li>
            <li> no more losing cap.  </li>
            <li> I paid in the past $200-300 for some of them and found them not really better.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is rather small</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to fail any time soon, but if it does I will look for this same shaver again.  </li>
            <li> approximately* 153 million males in the U.S., of which, for my proposes, I shall generously round that down to about 125 million of shaving age.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me I have very heavy facial hair.  </li>
            <li> By that, I mean that I wash and scrub off dead skin before leaving home so as to minimize hair and skin-cell leavings.</li>
            <li> it glides around every curve and misses very few hairs compare to 95% of all others.</li>
            <li> The on/off slide button is flat and difficult to move.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up (actually slide out) trimmer is a little awkward to use until you get used to it, since it sticks out from the side.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have thick facial hair and this thing is useless.</li>
            <li> Shaves my beard well - however I still prefer a blade shave in the morning but usually feel like I need a \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; in late afternoon if I am doing anything.</li>
            <li> They either didn&#x27;t cut all of the hair, which lead to ingrown hairs or really irritated my face, which lead to ingrown hairs :(&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> One set of batteries usually lasts me at least 3 weeks using this device and this is with me using it for about 5 minutes every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never have hard time replacing rechargeable batteries again when they wear out.</li>
            <li> and I find it to leave some of those hairs that are hard to get on the neck.</li>
            <li> The blades on the head will dull and the foil over the blades will wear out with use.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is hard for me to believe.</li>
            <li> I knew that this was an inexpensive travel razor, and that I shouldn&#x27;t have high hopes, but I am disappointed with its performance.</li>
            <li> I complained that something was &#x27;off&#x27; with the price differential between the two items and, at this point, realized I was just going to have to return it.  </li>
            <li> I never liked the hassle of bringing my full-sized Braun and charger with me (if you don&#x27;t bring the charger and the shaver somehow turns and on and discharges...</li>
            <li> and it is too late to return the darn thing.    </li>
            <li> I use mine for late afternoon touch-ups.    </li>
            <li> The only disadvantage to this shaver is that I believe the cutting block is not replaceable, butat</li>
            <li> In this case, at least for me, the inexpensive price tag does not equate to the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I keep one of these in my car for those times when I have a meeting late in the day and</li>
            <li> Shaves well, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Buy one for the car or office for late afternoon touch ups.....</li>
            <li> But I decided to try this one for use on five o&#x27;clock shadow late in the day, and it works well.  </li>
            <li> Hair in delicate places&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun has a built-in trimmer which, because of its size, I expected to be relatively useless:  </li>
            <li> I saw this cheap, compact, neat-looking unit and figured the worst that could happen was wasting eighteen bucks.</li>
            <li> So I kept forgetting to shave and was forced to plant a blade at work.  </li>
            <li> Thick hair (in terms of density, not diameter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I have a mohawk with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not that they are unreliable; I&#x27;ve never had one fail.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a week, not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It finally failed due to my abuse in how I packed it for travel.</li>
            <li> Also he finds it difficult to charge other razors.</li>
            <li> However, if you have arthritis or other hand/grip problems, you may find this razor difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I usually use a blade, but I got tired of keeping track of the blades and cream in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Its very small and curved</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very small and slides out perpendicular to the side of the razor.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a seriously substantial difference, wouldn&#x27;t you say?  </li>
            <li> A replacement foil costs $10 plus shipping also, which is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> even worse than \\&quot;hair in delicate places.\\</li>
            <li> When the unit is closed for travel, it can&#x27;t accidentally turn on in your travel luggage and leave you with an un-powered unit when you desperately need a shave.  </li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> It was like sharp cutting or something.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the small trimmer</li>
            <li> My beard is tough also.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard to shave</li>
            <li> and I have a tough beard.    </li>
            <li> I used to think I was just using poor quality razors</li>
            <li> Floating heads and all that super-engineering is unnecessary complication.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a poor connection somewhere.</li>
            <li> I can handle a poor shave for a couple days but not for weeks.</li>
            <li> It is not great for a two day growth</li>
            <li> Thin hair (in terms of density, not diameter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> weakness of ANY battery powered shaver is the decreased head speed as the battery discharges.</li>
            <li> This Braun 370 will just surprise you by painfully pulling your hairs as it runs down...</li>
            <li> (Edit: After an in-depth cleaning, I verified that the cutting block is indeed replaceable, or at least removable.)</li>
            <li> After some searching I found replacement foils, but I&#x27;m a little disappointed about two failing (one after &lt; 7 days use).</li>
            <li> One bad thing is the awkward sideburn trimmer other than that, you should definately buy one.      </li>
            <li> Not happy!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now completely useless.  </li>
            <li> but after drying shave the difficult parts ( under the chin and on the lip with the Braun.</li>
            <li> It is also somewhat difficult to retract.     </li>
            <li> but I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not perfect,</li>
            <li> You might be sorry.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: May 2012 - The razor is leaking when I use in the shower; ruined some expensive rechargeables.</li>
            <li> For $15, how can you go wrong.</li>
            <li> So, I thought for the price how could I go wrong.  </li>
            <li> --boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Then it gradually got shorter and shorter runs until it was useless within a year.</li>
            <li> It just does a poor job!</li>
            <li> needless to say, no travel razor</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The head of the shaver kept falling off so it was useless.</li>
            <li> Again, I was wrong:  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who needs a travel electric razor, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> No rechargable batteries that have questionable life.  </li>
            <li> At $150 this is too expensive and you should get the newer P-90 for $23:</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard, and before this razor I had basically resigned myself to a life of permanent five o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> This is a very frustrating product to use.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is virtually useless because it is awkward to open, awkward to close, and very awkward to use!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to slide in and out and awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> I probably ran this thing over my face for 30 minutes and nothing happened other than horrible burning skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I was dubious because a previous Braun battery shaver I owned was terrible, but not so with the P-70!</li>
            <li> I had read previous reviews and thought it would perform longer than it did ......... disappointed !!</li>
            <li> I brought this after using a Norelco Rotary for years, and found this disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Case rotates to cover or expose the cutting head.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is inconvenient to use.    </li>
            <li> it was already  nicking &amp;  cutting my face up.</li>
            <li> The shaver goes from cutting the hairs, to pulling the hairs, to grabbing the hairs.</li>
            <li> Boy, what a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> As a result I bought this Braun and tossed it in my bag, figuring at the worst I&#x27;d be out a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> A must have for those Warriors who can&#x27;t get the cream and razors out in bad conditions.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d had one before, but said that he was disappointed in the shave he received.  </li>
            <li> If you like shaving with an electric, you will not be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Convenient and inexpensive but disappointed that three out of four</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve grown disappointed with the quality of electric shaves.</li>
            <li> And I hate electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I hate to shave, hence the beard</li>
            <li> Cleaning brush built into the base.  </li>
            <li> WTF?!!!</li>
            <li> WORST shaver, Calling it a shaver is not even close to what it does not do.</li>
            <li> This razor is completely awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst performing electric I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it felt awfully close to a blade shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is horrible.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know it&#x27;s insane</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Beware of ordering this shaver.  I needed a very particular present for a friend; I had overheard a conversation stating a portable shaver to keep in the car would be extremely desirable... I thought, &amp;#34;Ah-hah! Present dilemma solved!&amp;#34;  Actually, finding a men&#x27;s portable electric shaver was far more difficult than I would&#x27;ve expected.  There are *approximately* 153 million males in the U.S., of which, for my proposes, I shall generously round that down to about 125 million of shaving age.  Of those, let&#x27;s further round it down to about 100 million who drive cars.  Now, with a potential target demographic of 100 million customers, you would think the shaving companies would be a wee bit more interested than they appear to be where it comes to a portable electric shaver that you can keep &amp; recharge in the car.  Nope.  Doesn&#x27;t look that way.  I went through all of the shavers Amazon featured (even called up Panasonic to get further details) but where portability is concerned, it appears to only center around the shaver itself and not the charger.  You still need the charger to plug into the wall; no one appears to offer a car-charger cable with their shaver as-sold.  After much detective work, I settled on this, the Braun Model P-70.  It was obviously designed with portability in mind and was battery operated (not what I was hoping for, but I thought I&#x27;d go with it).  The various reviews I read generally had very good things to say about it.  It also hit more-or-less the correct price point of $124.50, so I ordered it.  It arrived today and to say I was disappointed would be a huge understatement.  It looked just like in the Amazon photo, but in reality it in no way had the look and feel of an item costing $125.  It doesn&#x27;t even come in a box, nor does it come with a travel case - it comes on a piece of cardboard with a plastic bubble over it and looks like it ought to be hanging on a hook alongside the disposable razors at your local drug store. It was shippedto me in a padded envelope.  I immediately looked it up on the Amazon site and this time I noticed a blurb just below the lines of text describing the shaver&#x27;s features.  It stated: &amp;#34;There is a newer version of this item.&amp;#34; and gave a link to the &amp;#34;Braun M90 Mobile Shaver.&amp;#34;  Wish I&#x27;d noticed that before...  The M90 looks pretty much exactly like the P-70, but guess what?  The price of the M90 is $21.93.  That&#x27;s a seriously substantial difference, wouldn&#x27;t you say?  I called Amazon and they confirmed to me that the price I&#x27;d paid for the P-70 was the correct price.  I complained that something was &#x27;off&#x27; with the price differential between the two items and, at this point, realized I was just going to have to return it.  But now I&#x27;m in a bind big-time.  I have to find a portable shaver present for my friend&#x27;s birthday (tomorrow!) and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s not going to be easy.  Not happy!  If I wanted a portable shaver for myself and saw the P-70 advertised at $22 or so, I&#x27;d have been perfectly ok with it upon arrival, but not for $125!  There&#x27;s absolutely no way I&#x27;d give this to someone as a proper gift.  If you order the P-70, you&#x27;ll be wasting your money when its &#x27;new version&#x27; costs $22!  So, as I said, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Really suprised me on how well it works, You just have to remember its a shaver not a razor.</li>
            <li> Clever design - no cap to lose.  Easy to clean.  Pretty good shave - heavy dark beards might not fare so well.</li>
            <li> It comes with two AA-size alkaline batteries. I use two standard AA-size Ni-MH rechargeable batteries instead. I&#x27;ll never have hard time replacing rechargeable batteries again when they wear out.</li>
            <li> WORST shaver, Calling it a shaver is not even close to what it does not do.</li>
            <li> The foil on this shaver broke the 1st time I used it.  I wound up getting cut.  It&#x27;s now completely useless.  I didn&#x27;t get a single shave out of this shaver.</li>
            <li> While it worked, it gave as good a shave as any rotary or vibrator type I have ever owned( I&#x27;ve been using   electric since I was very young) so why only one star?  Be aware that the shaving foil screen is not available as a replacement part. The screens lasted approximately 3 months each when used on a daily basis (I bought 2). I also have a very light beard. It&#x27;s a great design but as useful as a boat anchor when the screen deteriorates.</li>
            <li> I have had a Braun P-70 for 6 months and used it every day with rechargeable batteries.  The blades are still sharp. The shave is clean and smooth. Batteries last 14 days before needing a charge. Completely self contained with case, brush and trimmer built in. Excellent engineering and design. Completely waterproof. People who have a problem with this shaver have other problems, or a vivid imagination. Replacement blades are $20 but should last 18 months according to Braun.</li>
            <li> I have had this little shaver for over a month and I am still fairly impressed with it. After shaving with blades for the past 12 years I have always been hesitant to even try an electric but this little thing is great. It shaves so close and comfortable it makes me want to see how well the more expensive Braun&#x27;s perform. It is definitely worth it to give it a try....especially if you are on the fence....Do It!!!!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a couple of these Braun P-70s at a ridiculously low single-digit price through Amazon a few months ago, and the quality and reliability is so good that it&#x27;s become my everyday go-to shaver. I use a Gillette blade razor for most shaving, but like a power shaver for touch-up and trimming, etc. Anyway, I had intended to give one of these away as a gift, but when my older, high-end Braun conked out shortly after I received the P-70s, I decided to keep both, to have one as a backup. The blade is super sharp and the motor is strong. After several months, the battery power does not seem to have diminished at all. I love how this product is small, lightweight and compact...the design is truly remarkable. It&#x27;s especially ideal for travel, although I&#x27;m using mine for everyday home use and it&#x27;s more than adequate for that too. It&#x27;s also easy to clean under running water, or you can just pop off the foil and shake it out for a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; cleaning. All in all, for what I paid for this, or even at 2 or 3 times what I paid, this is one of the best little shavers I&#x27;ve ever used and owned.</li>
            <li> This razor is completely awful. The actual razor doesn&#x27;t cut/trim any hair at all. Only the very small \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; attachment works, and is in such an awkward position on the razor that it is hardly angled to do a proper job. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this razor; instead of spending $20 on this, spend $40 on a much better one.</li>
            <li> I brought this after using a Norelco Rotary for years, and found this disappointing.  I need to use a razor to touch up what this shaver misses, and I have to work at shaving with this razor.  It is small and compact and uses standard batteries with little power drain. It is probably best used for a travel razor, but you won&#x27;t like it as your daily shaver.  It will not cut light hairs, and works best on heavy thick beards.</li>
            <li> My husband had mentioned that he would really like a battery operated shaver for his birthday.  After checking many sites, I chose the Braun 370.  He has commented on several occasions that this was an excellent shaver.  He&#x27;d had one before, but said that he was disappointed in the shave he received.  However, he said that his shave with the Braun is just as good as any he has ever had with any of his rechargeable or electric shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend that if you&#x27;re in the market for a battery operated shaver, choose the Braun 370.</li>
            <li> While this little jewel is never going to win an award for &lt;br /&gt;delivering the closest possible shave, it should be praised &lt;br /&gt;for doing what it was designed to do......do a marvelous job &lt;br /&gt;of performing it&#x27;s task in providing a quick shave anywhere. &lt;br /&gt;     In it&#x27;s simplicity, this powerfull little razor is extremely well designed and very reasonably priced to make it affordable to everyone.</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent for those with light beards and for those requiring only quick shaves. At first, you may need to use the shaver a few times to properly cut your folicles to match the foil shaver. I was a razor-only guy before giving this thing a shot. Higher end models from norelco does just as well of a job for me compared with this low cost shaver. Thicker bearded users should try shavers above the $120 range (without the semi-useful LCD feature if possible).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros:  &lt;br /&gt;Uses two alkaline or rechargeable AA batteries without having to shell out for a mid-range model that uses a proprietary battery costing 15-25 to replace (or no replacement at all).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great for travelling or quick touchups at the office.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, so if it gets lost or it breaks, not a big loss.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:  &lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t do a great job for users having thick beards.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No way to trim into desired styles.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Included sideburns trimmer isn&#x27;t really too handy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;May hurt if dropped on your toe.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;May hum \\&quot;please turn me off\\&quot; if left on for 3 hours straight. Extreme mechanophobia users beware. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this shaver for over a year now and it is still going strong. I had originally purchased two units believing portable shavers may not last very long or the possibility that I may break or lose it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To this point, I must say that cleaning the unit is a breeze with the included snap-on brush (occassionally I have to remove the foil and dust it out for a deeper cleansing). My final tip is to not leave your facial hair growing for too long before you shave. I shave almost every night and occassionally in the morning as well. Perfect time for me to shave is right out of a hot shower. Give this low cost shaver a shot.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an occasional use travel shaver tp keep in an overnight bag. Of course I had to try it out first. The first shave was as close as an $80.00 Panasonic or an $40.00 Braun. Very impressive! Im&#x27;, getting a second one for, well, just because. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this to take to places that don&#x27;t have 110 volts.  It works great, and the design is nifty.  The shaver folds up in such a way as to protect the metal screen.  Overall it&#x27;s a little bigger than a stack of playing cards, but about the same thickness.  It&#x27;s a bit noisier than a reconditioned Braun (~$40) I bought at the same time.  (Also a success, just posted a review of that one.)</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after reading all the rave reviews.  It does not perform well and I cannot recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is too short - several reviewers cite the AA vs. charger feature as a big advantage for the car and foreign travel.  But I find that both my higher-end Braun and my Norelco&#x27;s shave longer on a single charge than this one on a new set of batteries.  And those other razors have features telling you when the battery will run out.  This Braun 370 will just surprise you by painfully pulling your hairs as it runs down... probably on your way to an important meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most importantly -- it&#x27;s a poor shave. It&#x27;s the worst performing electric I have ever used.  Leaves a lot of stubble behind even after spending more time on my face (and leaving razor burn).  If you shave every day you really should invest in a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the design, size, and price are great (hence 2 stars and not 1).  I will put this in my office desk and use it for occaisional touch ups or emergencies.  It&#x27;s far from being worthy as a main use shaver.</li>
            <li> I travel for a living.  My son in the U.S. Air force recommended this to leave in my suitcase.  I have always preferred a \\&quot;Screen\\&quot; type razor because it causes much less irritation than a rotary and shaves much closer.  I bought my first \\&quot;PocketGo\\&quot; Braun for about 12 dollars at Walgreens.  I am still amazed at how long the batteries last before they run down.  No need to plug it in and recharge, just replace the two AA cells and away you go. I even took it to Italy this summer and saved fooling aroung with the converters and plugs for the 220 volt wall sockets.  What a great idea.  My original PocketGo had a neat little slide out trimmer for those hard to reach areas and hairs you miss that are too long. You wont find it on the M-50 model, but they have added that back to the P-70 model, but I still miss the little brush that came attached to the bottom of the original version.  This is still the best travel razor money can buy.  (I just love the guy that rated it 4 stars because it missed a few hairs)  He needs a girl friend with good vision and a pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent travel shaver (rotating cover) but not as good as the Panasonic ES4815s which I reviewed [[ASIN:B0009DT34W Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve Compact Mens Shaver With Double Blades, Blue/Silver]].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this little shaver! I never liked the hassle of bringing my full-sized Braun and charger with me (if you don&#x27;t bring the charger and the shaver somehow turns and on and discharges...you&#x27;re in blade city). This small shaver is cleverly designed and needs no case. It isn&#x27;t noisy and provides a close shave. The little brush fits neatly under the shaver. I brought it on vacation and used it every day for 4 days and it was just great. Bring an extra set of batteries and you&#x27;re probably good for a couple of weeks at least. Great shaver at a great price</li>
            <li> Product as described.  Works great on the go.  Seller was on time and very responsive to my emails.  Would definately buy from again.</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful.  But shave is like most electrics...good enough, but not great.  Perfect for travel when you don&#x27;t want to bring a razor and shaving cream. Definitely a space saver for TSA requirements.</li>
            <li> - extremely cheap &lt;br /&gt;- good quality &lt;br /&gt;- clean shave</li>
            <li> Perfect for the man on the go... put it in the car and never worry on your way to work.</li>
            <li> I am a blade man.  Always have been.  And I hate electric razors.  Always have.  But my schedule has left me with little time and an inconsistent day.  So I kept forgetting to shave and was forced to plant a blade at work.  Great idea unless you are hit with everything when you walk through the door.  Long story short, I caved and looked for an electric razor.  I bought this one based on price and reviews.  It really is the best electric shaver I have seen.  And that it is available for $20.00 was a bonus.  Does it shave as well as a blade?  No.  Does it provide a darn good shave on a thick beard, yes - very much so.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor specifically to get me through a 2 month trip, and it worked flawlessly, even better then the Remington I use at home.  I went through one set of batteries (2 AA, the unit is not rechargeable) after the first month or so.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not as powerful as the more expensive plug-in type shavers but it&#x27;s good enough for quick touch-ups when you&#x27;re in a hurry and it&#x27;s great for travel. Love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to plug it in.</li>
            <li> I use this for touching up after I shave with a razor. It works just fine and the batteries last longer than I thought. I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a marvellous little razor and just as good as any full size electric. I am 75 eys old with a very tough beard.I wet shave using two different types of blade but after drying shave the difficult parts ( under the chin and on the lip with the Braun.It is a great price and highly  recommended.I bought one for my son as  well,Malcolm B</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this Braun 370 PocketGo battery shaver for my hubby and we love it. Yes, I say, \\&quot;we\\&quot; because it shaves his face so close and so smooth!!! Like a baby&#x27;s you know what. He uses it for touch ups. No more wolf&#x60;n it over the weekend! Love, love, love, just love this shaver. The shave is so close be sure to use aftershave gel/lotion.</li>
            <li> This is simply one of the best buys I have ever made. I&#x27;ve used it every day for 18 months and it&#x27;s performed excellently. Other reviewers complain that it doesn&#x27;t get every hair- that&#x27;s true, and not unexpected for an $18 shaver. I use the trimmer feature to catch the \\&quot;ones that got away\\&quot; and I&#x27;ve been perfectly satisfied. It recharges quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive battery powered shaver to replace my very old Braun that recently died: I now shave with a blade. I liked my old Braun shaver, and since this will only see occasional service, it is perfect. I like the size and the fact that the blade guard is built in: nothing to lose. It shaves as well as a big electric razor. The trimmer is somewhat disappointing: it is slightly curved, not flat, and is positioned 90 degrees to the shaving foil, so trimming a beard or mustache is awkward and not so precise. It is also somewhat difficult to retract.     Having said that, I&#x27;d buy this item again because of its size and price. I&#x27;d use rechargeable batteries if I shave with it often.</li>
            <li> I used to have the older model of this shaver before it broke.  Some things that annoy me about this model are the brush placement and the trimmer.    The brush used to be on the end of rotating cap, but now it&#x27;s on the battery cap.  This is annoying because, when you want to use the brush, it&#x27;s because you want to clean the blades.  If the blades are exposed, then that means the rotating cap covers the battery cap, and you have to pull it aside to get at the brush.  The trimmer is also less user friendly than the older model.  It&#x27;s smaller and doesn&#x27;t cut as well, but I guess I don&#x27;t really use it much anyway.    Overall, this is still a nice compact shaver that&#x27;s great for travel.  I just wish they kept some of the design the same as their old model.</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent as a foil shaver! If you had electric shavers before, a lot of people will agree that there is little difference (at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced) between an electric foil shaver worth $100 and this portable one which is worth less than $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movable cap makes the shaver into a case itself and the functionality is excellent which also includes the feature that allows it to be washed under the faucet. The brush is conveniently placed on the bottom of the shaver which snaps into place. The only negative comment about it is the precision trimmer as it is placed at a different angle then the foil shaver itself at a 90 degree angle facing horizontally. I&#x27;m pretty scared that if you don&#x27;t push it correctly, it might be easy to break and it is kind of hard to use, especially if you have really thick sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is excellent. I&#x27;ve used the same double A batteries for a month using it about a minute every time I use it and it&#x27;s still going! Highly recommended for every type of guys, especially if you&#x27;re always on the go!</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely manner and it works well for my father.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years.  Needed something handy and compact for a touchup.  This filled the bill.  The price is right but if you order just the cutter and screen, the cost is pretty close to what the whole thing cost.  I always have a spare.</li>
            <li> I purchase this shaver twice for my son when he was in Iraq, he liked it and he ask me to purchased it for him so I am guessing that it works OK.</li>
            <li> I dropped the cutter block in the sink and couldnt fish it out, so i tried buying it online.  That alone costs $10 plus shipping.  It cost more to ship that cutterblock than to buy another Pocketgo.  A replacement foil costs $10 plus shipping also, which is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> First time electric shaver user. It does not cut as close as a manual bladed razor would. The foil gets pretty warm/hot after about 30 seconds, I have to blow on it to keep it from irritating my face. It feels well made. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as an everyday shaving device, but it is good for &#x27;touch ups&#x27; here and there between shaves with a manual razor. Also great for travel.    Since they can be purchased for $20 or less, I would recommend them. If I was looking for an electric shaver to replace manual shaving, I might try a full size rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> much better than I hoped for and rivaling more expensive options!  In fact I bought a second and may give them out as presents</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard, and before this razor I had basically resigned myself to a life of permanent five o&#x27;clock shadow. Regular razors give me razor burn, and electric shavers with the three circular blades arranged in a triangle just don&#x27;t work for me. I used to think I was just using poor quality razors and I bought myself a $100+ electric shaver from Philips, but I was not impressed. When that one suddenly broke, I found myself in need of another razor, but I was in no mood to spend lots of money. I bought this Braun razor on a whim and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC! And only $20?! You cannot get a closer shave unless you shave against the grain with a regular razor, which will almost certainly give you razor burn. Also, this razor works both dry and in the shower with shaving cream, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun battery operated shavers for years and have found them to be very reliable and convenient to use while traveling. Well my last Braun needed replacement and I found this one on Amazon. It is every bit as convenient and works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a blade for 26 years and during that time only tried an electric shaver 3 times (a Remington a Philips and something else). After each electric shave my skin was so irritated I figured I would never be able to use one. I could not get past the pain to continue using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shopping for one as a gift I read reviews for shavers from the big players (Braun, Remington, Philips/Norelco) and thought \\&quot;hey, for $20 may be I&#x27;ll give it another try\\&quot;. So I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this travel shaver. My skin had only very slight irritation the first time I tried it and that was it - regular blade shaving was starting to get very irritating in those sensitive areas (neck and around the mouth) probably due to the fact that stubble seems to turn into wire with age. It&#x27;s not quite as close a shave like a good razor gives but not too far from it (and don&#x27;t forget this is an inexpensive travel shaver so some of Braun&#x27;s more expensive shavers are probably closer yet)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I can gather no one shaver can get every single hair (neck being perhaps the toughest spot) but a single wipe with a blade can get those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re ready for a new experience (or just need a new shaver) check out Braun&#x27;s line and reviews on various sites. My guess is that if the reviews are above a 4 out of 5 you probably can&#x27;t go too wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this as a daily (shavers are basically a daily touchup kinda thing). I love it and my skin is loving it too!</li>
            <li> This a great razor. It does a better job than my $90.00 razor. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> One day in a hurry in a large drug store I realized I could either go home and shave and be late or buy something portable and hope it worked. I bought the BraunPocketGo and some batteries. In the parking lot of my destination I put in the batteries, turned it on and hoped for the best. And the best is what I got. For a small, inexpensive razor this is the one to choose. Even a two day beard will finally fall given a bit of patience. It&#x27;s size makes it easily carried but it has a heft and grip that say that it&#x27;s not a toy. Battery use is great and, of course, one cannot beat the price. It doesn&#x27;t do the job of my blade and foam but for the purpose it&#x27;s intended it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors and this one is incredible it glides around every curve and misses very few hairs compare to 95% of all others.</li>
            <li> very lite, very compact, amazingly close shave. I use more often than my standard Braun shaver.  Great buy keep one in your car, in your briefcase. Good quality, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I got this for when my other razor needs recharging and I forget, or when I need to run around the house to get or take care of something.   I like that it&#x27;s portable and can go anyplace.  It looks good and feels good in my hand.   It shaves fine for me but then my beard isn&#x27;t too heavy, which may be a problem for some other people.  I like it!</li>
            <li> As a travel razor, I found the razor a bit oversized for my toilet kit.  However, for me it shaves very efficiently and comfortably and in addition to using it for travel I frequently use it late in the day to give me a clean-shaven look before going out to dinner, parties, etc.  It&#x27;s self-contained foil protector and trimmer are good features not available on most other travel razors.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my father and he is very satisfied.  Work with two AA batteries.  Using 2400 Ni-Mh batteries works for a month between recharges.</li>
            <li> I bought this little shaver 3 years ago for a 6-month trip around the world. Now each time I have a trip, it comes along to keep the luggage weight down. I&#x27;m quite surprised how well it&#x27;s held up. The design is excellent... swivel cap (protects shave head), safety lock switch button, secure battery compartment, side burn trimmer, cleaning brush and last but not least, you can clean the shave head by running water through it! It&#x27;s no power shaver but each set of batteries goes a long time. Considering I got it for [...]buckaroos, I&#x27;m keeping it till it dies.     Next trip... 4 weeks in SE Asia.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver, especially for the price.  Not perfect, but then I&#x27;m not sure what a perfect shaver would look like (I prefer blades for the most part).  I&#x27;m not a heavily-bearded person but I&#x27;ve used it at home and traveling and it works quite well for me.  As with other shavers I&#x27;ve had, it seems you have to keep going over certain spots several times to get a \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; feeling (I even have to do this with certain places with my razors).  The one set of batteries has lasted several weeks (and they&#x27;re even the rechargeables).  Lots of nice features--beard/sideburns trimmer, immersible in water, etc.  All in all I would highly recommend it, again particularly at this price.</li>
            <li> I have a 7-series Braun, which is one of the more expensive shavers out in the market. But this little one is as good as the expensive one. It is not as smooth as the 7-series but it does the job! Great price, too. Recommended for traveling.</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly good little razors -- especially when you consider the price. Even after reading all the excellent reviews, it still vastly exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how long the foils will hold up and, if I can figure out how, I&#x27;ll update this review when once I do know. But one thing I can tell you up front is that I have a Norelco 8825 XL rotary whose replacement heads alone (which need replacing every six moths or so) cost twice as much as this entire razor. You do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shaving, this little guy does almost as good a job (and better in some hard-to-get areas like my neck) as the Norelco. I&#x27;ve taken to shaving first with the Norelco, then doing a touch-up pass with one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one area where I find that this (and all flat foils) are a little weak is on the upper lip around the nose. The triangular heads and round foils of the rotary can get in much closer. Also, the pop-up trimmer is kind of a joke, but so is the one on my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially ordered three (one each for office, car and travel bag) based on the reviews here, figuring \\&quot;what the heck, they&#x27;re dirt cheap\\&quot;. I just ordered ten more in case they stop making them.</li>
            <li> It is a gift for the price, but there are only three problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) hairs that goes flat along your skin will not be cut.&lt;br /&gt;2) long hairs neither.&lt;br /&gt;3) It will be difficult to cut your neck hairs, you will need a trimmer first, then keep your hairs short with this Braun, don&#x27;t allow that your beard grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that price, nothing better if you don&#x27;t care about cut some missing hairs. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after reading the mostly positive reviews of it here.  This is one case where the item does not live up to the reviews which is rare for Amazon. When using it, you get the impression it is working because of the sound it makes.      Like most shavers the motor hums and when it hits a spot of whiskers it sort of makes that grinding noise, which gives you the impression it is doing something.  The problem for me is it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove much actual facial hair, if any! I can see and feel the evidence of that on my face. However, the real proof in the pudding for me was when I removed the grill to clean it after having it for several months and there was only a tiny bit of whisker in there.  Even my old Norelco that was falling apart was full when I opened it up.      This shaver is now in the trash along with my old one and I am off to buy a new one.  I sort of thought the price was too good to be true although I don&#x27;t see why shavers are so expensive generally speaking.  The thing that makes this problem worse is many people would be using this shaver as a traveler and may not find out how ineffective it is until they are on the road. So not only do you show up at the out of town meeting with stubble but it may be weeks or months later and it is too late to return the darn thing.    Word to the wise - TRY IT OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING IT, don&#x27;t toss it in your suitcase and assume it works.  You might be sorry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very close, nor does it catch medium or long hairs.    For no obvious reason, it has large gaps on either side of the screen, so shavings tend to just fall out during use.    I don&#x27;t know why nobody can make a cheap shaver that works as well as the Shaveman, but the bottom line is they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver as a portable , handy item that fits in my medical bag, or overnight kit, in the car, etc. Nice design with an effective, attached screen protector, and cleaning brush(my last shaver screen bought it from excessive unprotected exposure.)  Price is nice-most replacement screens cost more than the complete shaver.  Good shave, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this low-priced shaver after reading the rave reviews. But it hasn&#x27;t worked for me so far. It takes too long to shave; it is loud; it doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave. The search continues...</li>
            <li> It rivals a $200 shaver. All you have to do is add a digital display, a touch-less pad, a self cleaning solution and so on and it becomes a top of the line shaver. If all you care about is getting a clean shave than this is IT. Portable, fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I have this unit probably  for last 2 years, I also had first generation of this unit which was 5615. This is a OK unit compared to 5615 which was superior in every way. Like any big corporation, Braun got a hit with the 5615 and then they totally screwed up the dynamics of 5615 and came with PocketGo 370. I am looking for replacement foil and cutter block for my old 5615...</li>
            <li> This very low priced shaver does just as well as electric shavers that cost five times as much. I have been very happy with my purchase. It does not cut as close as a razor, but I have yet to find an electric razor that does.</li>
            <li> 2 double A&#x27;s, not the closest tightest shave, but on the go, does a fantastic job! no mess!</li>
            <li> This razor is very portable, batteries last for weeks/months at a time.  It is very good if you shave every day, however, if you miss a day, it will have a hard time on the neck, and you may be left with some longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is entirely waterproof, however, it is advisable to use a bit of machine oil on the blades if used in water a lot.  One problem I have had with the razor is hair collection.  It collects most of the cut hair inside the foil, but some drops out, so if you are shaving with a suit on, be prepared to brush off a bit afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main pros are price, portability, and usability.  Recommend as a great portable razor if you shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I bought this shaver when it was selling from Amazon for $17.  It&#x27;s still going strong, but I would not pay more than $30 for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: May 2012 - The razor is leaking when I use in the shower; ruined some expensive rechargeables. Still works, but I don&#x27;t trust it in the shower anymore. May call Braun and see if they&#x27;ll do anything.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m aware that most shavers leave a little stubble behind that needs to be mowed with a blade. I bought this shaver, however, for traveling in the new age where we can&#x27;t carry our usual complement of supplies when flying. It does a pretty good job, even dry, and that&#x27;s a plus when in a hurry as I often am. I can now leave the shave cream at home -- one less liquid hassle. The batteries are a plus too as I don&#x27;t need to bother with yet another charger. So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver several months ago and have used it on trips of 2 days to one week. I usually use a blade, but I got tired of keeping track of the blades and cream in my travel bag. So I found this at a great price and I find it to leave some of those hairs that are hard to get on the neck. But for me they don&#x27;t really show for a few days. So I find this to work for those trips of 4 days or less. Otherwise I need to touch up with going to the blade to look good.  It does not use up batteries at all. And I have not found it to be very hard to keep clean, and my batteries have never fallen out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of travel razors but none compare to the Braun P-70. It&#x27;s such a good value that I bought two; one for travel and one for the office. It offers a great shave, it is well built, and 2 AA batteries last for weeks. I especially like the fact that when it&#x27;s locked for travel it cannot be turned on accidentally and the foil is completely covered so it cannot be damaged. Cleaning is also easy, with or without water. No need to spend $50-100 for a travel razor when you can get the qaulity of Braun for about $20.</li>
            <li> First it comes with Duracell batteries, which after a month I still have not had to change. It shaves close and clean for an electric, we all know the closest shaves are with a blade and foam.  Its small size is great since I do not have the room in my bathroom for a whole charging station and razor to sit. It is simple and easy to clean with running water.  I find it comparable to some of the fancier shavers out there and I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a second travel shaver to use so I wouldn&#x27;t have to repack my \\&quot;kit\\&quot; every time I leave for a business trip.  I agree, its a great shaver.  Powerful and very comparable to my Norelco three head shaver...in some ways its even better...on flat surfaces with flat hairs, great...a bit challenging on the neck to get those few stray hairs, but overall I would not hesitate to recommend this.</li>
            <li> This cheapy little shaver is very well made,but does not feel cheap at all. Works off of 2AA batteries. Shaves my beard well - however I still prefer a blade shave in the morning but usually feel like I need a \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; in late afternoon if I am doing anything. I can use it while at my laptop or while reading to clean up my chin and neck. Easy to clean, easy to change batteries. I have two.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes to use a normal razor first and then clean-up and get really close shave using the Shaver. This little guy is simply amazing! I&#x27;ve been using Braun for years, but always had issues especially when traveling where the darn things would turn on. And you always need that recharger cable -- another pain in the butt.    The folks at Braun did a fantastic job with the design where you cannot turn on the thing if it is locked with the cover over. The  battery life is very good with 2 double AAs (easily get a few months if you shave like I do with wet razor first).    Alright, stop reading all the reviews and just order this. For $15, how can you go wrong.</li>
            <li> I never really had a desire to use a foil shaver until I saw the price for this one.  I&#x27;m very glad I decided to try it.  All you have to do when you receive it, is pop the batteries in, and it&#x27;s ready to go.  The finished shave was almost as smooth as a regular razor, the difference was barely noticeable.  The side trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but you can&#x27;t expect salon quality trimming from a travel shaver. The only negative to this shaver is that if your hair grows in along the skin and not straight out (mainly the neck area), it does take several passes to get to it.  It takes some getting used to, but once you figure out how to angle the shaver, it will give you a very good shave.  I&#x27;m glad I did not spend much more money on a different shaver that I most likely would not have been happy with.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this one, go ahead and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I needed a convenient mini-shaver since i would sleep over at my girlfriends place all the time so I looked on Amazon and found this puppy. Damn this shaver does it&#x27;s job. I have a Panasonic shaver that cost me $70 that doesnt do as good a job as this Braun. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a good year and I have yet to change the batteries on it and it works perfectly fine. The trimmer is decent for small spots w/ very little hairs but besides that it&#x27;s an ease to clean with the mini brush and it works great. I won&#x27;t replace it for any other shaver!</li>
            <li> My job as a US Army Broadcast Journalist takes me to some rough parts of the world.  While out on a week-long mission, as some guys are trying to either dry shave or make do with bottles of water, I&#x27;ve been able to whip out this shaver and get touched up for the day.    Keep in mind, though, the shaver&#x27;s performance depends on your face.  That&#x27;s why I only gave it four stars.  It gets my mustache area very well, but I can always feel some fine left over chin stubble.  The shaver completely misses the hairs on my neck.  Essentially, this shaver is a great back-up for when I can&#x27;t shave with a blade.    It&#x27;s easy to clean, and it&#x27;s designed so it won&#x27;t accidentally turn on.  Battery life is decent, provided you don&#x27;t use it as an every day shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome. It delivers great results for about $20. The batteries last long and it is easy to clean. I love it.</li>
            <li> Yes it is. Not hyperbole. This is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  Comfortable and ultra-convenient.  The design is sturdy and ergonomic. Cuts as close as any \\&quot;premium\\&quot; electric shaver so there is no reason to pay more.  Floating heads and all that super-engineering is unnecessary complication. This shaver does the job and it does it well.  Not to say that it is as close as a blade razor but that is beside the point.  If you like shaving with an electric, you will not be disappointed with this one. And it is a steal at the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this Braun P-70 on a whim after receiving an AmEx cash card for Christmas. Having never owned or used an electric razor, I was unsure what to expect. I read through a handful of other users&#x27; reviews, and I see where you&#x27;re all coming from when you talk about \\&quot;leaving a few hairs behind\\&quot;. This razor definitely leaves hairs behind, but I guess that&#x27;s usual. Personally, it only leaves hairs on my throat, which is \\&quot;shapely\\&quot; I guess I could say? Even a regular shave with a razor and foam leaves hairs on my throat, so for me it&#x27;s nothing new. On flatter areas of my face, I get as smooth a shave as I would with a regular wet shave razor and foam, without the irritation I get from my sensitive skin.    The battery life on this thing is incredible, I&#x27;ve used it at least twice a week for the last 3 weeks to shave my entire face/throat, and the original batteries are still going strong. It&#x27;s a cleverly designed unit, from the rotating foil guard, the pop-out trimmer, to the built-in cleaning brush and water-tight battery compartment. I&#x27;m pleased with the construction of this shaver, the size and weight are nice too. It&#x27;s not bulky, and it&#x27;s just heavy enough to not have a chintzy feel. Feels like a solid, quality unit. I guess I should try it with a pre-shave lotion such as [[ASIN:B000052Y6Z Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave, Original, 3 fl oz]] and see if that helps the \\&quot;left behind hair\\&quot; problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this after airport security confiscated the blade out of my razor. This shaver passes security and works very well. The flip top cover prevents it from turning by accident. And it has a sideburn trimmer.</li>
            <li> The shaver did not function or turn on when I received it. I returned it to Amazon for a refund and bought a Panasonic from Amazon as a replacement</li>
            <li> FOR AN INEXPENSIVE, POCKET SIZE SHAVER THIS IS A GREAT BUY.  I KEEP IT IN MY BRIEFCASE AND SHAVE ON THE WAY TO WORK OR JUST FOR A TOUCH UP BEFORE MEETINGS.  BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT, TRIMMER IS EXCELLENT.  CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> This little guy works as well as any electric razor I have ever used. For 11 dollars it&#x27;s a bargain. I would recommend NiMh rechargeable batteries though for longer life and more power.</li>
            <li> The Braun 370 was recommended to me by a friend who is a long time electric shaver user.  He stated that he liked the shaver&#x27;s shave, the fact that it used batteries rather than a recharger, and he liked it for its price.  So, I thought for the price how could I go wrong.  As it turned out, my friend was right.  I strongly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE COMPACT ELECTRIC RAZOR IS EVERY BIT AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THE EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC RAZOR I PURCHASED JUST MONTHS AGO. HAD NO IDEA THAT TEN BUCKS COULD BUY THE CLOSEST SMOOTHEST SHAVE I HAVE HAD IN YEARS. I KEEP THAT LITTLE RASCAL RIGHT HERE BY MY COMPUTER DESK AND USE IT EVERY MORNING.ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN, IT IS A TWELVE!</li>
            <li> I would not use this as a primary shaver. It&#x27;s narrow little head isn&#x27;t as efficient as my big Braun. However, for travel and back-up, it is wonderful. Has plenty of power and is small enough to stow away with ease. I also like the fact that even with months between trips, I can simply slip in a set of back-up batteries and be ready. A rechargeble just isn&#x27;t well suited to this role.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands &amp; types of electric razors over the years. Very few have given me both a clean &amp; comfortable shave. This little gem does both very well. I would hihgly recommend the Braun 370 to anyone. Now I need to find it&#x27;s counterpart in a corded razor.</li>
            <li> This razor works extremely well. My beard grows out at an angle and this little Braun is the only one that picks up ALL the hairs. It is my second one - I wore out the first one (purchased in 1989).</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shaver from a local drug store before heading out of town.  I was leaving for an extended trip to a location where I wouldn&#x27;t have easy access to electricity.  During that trip, I grew to love this little shaver.  After returning home, I continued using it for about 7 more years before needing to replace it.  I replaced the blades &amp; foil a couple times.  Though it wasn&#x27;t always easy to find replacements in local stores, I&#x27;m sure the internet will solve this problem for me in the future.  I like this shaver so much, and it&#x27;s so inexpensive, that I bought two this time around.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new shaver and decided to gamble the $14 the Braun 370 PocketGo costs, and am I ever glad I did.  I feel like I got more than I paid for.  Well designed, quality construction, and it gives a surprisingly good shave.  I like the ability to use replaceable AA batteries rather than just a hard-wired-in NiCd battery pack with a cord to lug around with you just in case the battery goes dead.  I&#x27;m in the process of replacing all of the disposable batteries in my battery devices (like remotes, flashlights, etc.) with NiMH rechargeables and the PocketGo works just fine with them.  This little shaver works so well that I&#x27;m tempted to use it to replace my older Norelco as my primary shaver.</li>
            <li> I keep one of these in my car to use nearly every day and I have used one on trips to countries that have no electricity. The product is easy to use and easy to keep clean. I have purchased two and have considered buying some for friends. It is a great product that I wouldn&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and an extra one for my dad without even trying it, based on the great price and excellent reviews.  This is the first time the method has failed me, although I should have heeded the warnings.  This shaver is built incredibly.  It is handy and just kind of cute to look at.  But that is it. I guess my facial hair is too coarse, because it is completely ineffective for me.  Hopefully my dad will fare better (He used to have an old plug in shaver just like this one) and I will send the unopened one to a friend&#x27;s husband in Iraq.  Nice item, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for travel.  It&#x27;s a great shaver.  I have used it every day since it arrived several weeks ago.  But, it is not exactly a travel shaver.  Yes it operates on batteries.  But it is almost the same size and weight as my regular shaver.  Braun 370 dimensions:  4.75\\&quot; high x 2.25\\&quot; wide x 1.125\\&quot; thick at center.  I expected something much smaller and lighter.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week, not very happy with this product. If used under water, it leaks its oils used to keep the machine parts running smooth. If used without water, leaves lot of scratchy skin. But is a light weight &amp; handy shaver, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep my face clean shaved between hair cuts..... Works of if your facial hair is very low but dont expect it to cut longer hairs......It wasnt worth the money in my opinion, but then again you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure if this shaver would be any good when ordering. After receiving I tried it out that evening and was totally surprised at the quality shave I received. I&#x27;m ordering my second shaver today. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Works good for a battery powered back-and-forth shaver.  I prefer a rotorary action in my shaver, but this inexpensive Chinese shaver is good for travel.  Brush in handle is nice touch.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these razors. One for myself and one for son. He uses his exclusively. I use mine for late afternoon touch-ups.    I still like using my soap brush and Mach 5 every morning, because you cannot beat the closeness of a razor blade shave.    This razor is great for the price for keeping in my briefcase for an evening meeting or get-together.    I would recommend buying this razor for emergency or occasional usage. It does suite my needs for a daily shaver.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun travel shaver from several years ago. It finally failed due to my abuse in how I packed it for travel. Based on its reliability and performance I bought this one and am happy with it. However, the old unit used 3 AA and this uses 2 AA. The power difference is noticeable. The 3 AA unit performed like my home rechargeable shaver (not Braun), but this one takes a little more time and work to get a good shave. Still a good deal for the money and easier to pack than my old unit.</li>
            <li> This shaver works pretty good but do not expect a fast shave.    Takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my skin feeling smooth.  Does not work perfectly but is is a good travel shaver that takes double a batteries</li>
            <li> This little shaver is amazingly powerful considering it runs on just AA battery power. I have taken it on many trips and the batteries last and last. I also find myself using it at home since it just flips open and my higher end one (which does NOT do a better job shaving) is in a case that came with it and required frequent recharging.     Here is the bottom line: BUY IT</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I got this shaver because I was tired of spending a lot of time shaving with a blade. Not only time, but also money (those blades and the shaving gel cost quite a bit, and the cost adds up overtime.) My skin was also getting irritated from shaving every morning with a razor. I decided to give this shaver a try, and have been using it for about 3 months now. Here are my impressions:    The shave that you get with this machine is no worse than the result that you get with other electric shavers. It will never be as close as the shave that you can get with a razor, but it is close enough to be perfectly acceptable. As a matter of fact, this is the closest shave I have gotten from an electric razor (and I have owned 2 previous Braun shavers within the last 15 years, both of them the expensive models with rechargeable batteries.) That&#x27;s not the only advantage this shaver has over other electric shavers though:    This shaver uses 2 off-the-shelf AA batteries. A set of batteries lasted me for almost 2 months, which I found impressive. Since AA batteries can be found anywhere, you can use this shaver with the confidence that it will never become obsolete when its built-in battery stops being operational (which seemed to happen way too soon with the other electric shavers I owned, by the way.) So far I have used alkaline AA batteries, and at a rate of 1 set every 1 1/2 months, the cost is less than what you have to pay on blades and shaving gel. I also plan on using rechargeable batteries soon (I am not sure if this shaver works with NiMH batteries though,) which would make the cost per shave almost negligible.    Another advantage is that you can use this shaver on wet skin, and can also wash it under running water. At first I was reluctant to do that, but I eventually found out that it works quite well to clean the shaver, with no ill effects.    The only disadvantage to this shaver is that I believe the cutting block is not replaceable, butat the price this shaver is sold for, it would be ridiculous to spend money to replace a part that might cost almost as much as the complete machine.  (Edit: After an in-depth cleaning, I verified that the cutting block is indeed replaceable, or at least removable.) Also, after more than 2 months of daily use and a serious cleaning, the shaver looks now like new. I would give it 6 stars if I could.)    Yes, I like this shaver a lot. And I plan on getting a few backups.</li>
            <li> This is my second one that runs on AA batteries, my first one was purchased in Germany back in 1992. I still have it and it works great, I am just afraid that because it is that old that it will give out just when you need it. This one now (PocketGo P-70) is great, shaves close and and makes my skin feel smooth with no irritation. Although I always shave prior to a shower, it&#x27;s nice to know that it is waterproof. I have had mine for about a month and still on the same set of batteries, usage is 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li> For day-to-day shaves it does an adequate job and will keep you looking good.  It isn&#x27;t a $200 shaver--so don&#x27;t expect a $200 shave.  If you use it every day, you&#x27;ll be happy with the decent shave.  When I went for more than three days between shaves, it didn&#x27;t give as clean a shave on my neck--though my face shaved fine.  I have a fairly sensitive neck and this shaver did not cause any razor burn whatsoever.  Best shaves occur when you hold the head as perpendicular to the area being shaved as you can.  Shaving was about as fast as a regular electric shaver.    East to use, easy to clean.  Wet shave feature is a nice option--I didn&#x27;t really see any advantage when I wet shave, but the wet shave does make cleaning the shaver easier.  Runs forever on one set of batteries.  Travels very well.      Yeah, I was skeptical that a shaver under $20 would give me anything more than severe razor burn--boy was I wrong.  In this case, at least for me, the inexpensive price tag does not equate to the quality of the shave.  I did buy and try several other portable shavers--this one beat them all.  I&#x27;d buy another one in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace an older Braun razor that was not specifically designed for travel.  This one is more compact, lighter, and has a built-in protective, \\&quot;swing-away\\&quot; cap that also keeps it from accidentally being switched on.  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and after about 6 uses, it seems to give a pretty good shave.  My only minor gripe is that the trimmer is situated such that it&#x27;s a little difficult for me to use, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to push the trimmer back into the shaver body once it&#x27;s out.  However, I definitely am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to keep my face nicer in between my regular shaves. I use a standard razor and shave cream to get a close shave. This Braun electric razor does a great job at helping me look nicer through the work week. I like it&#x27;s size and the fact the the lid is incorporated in the razor is great. I also like how the razor takes standard AA batteries. It is a great little razor that performs like the bigger electric razors.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little shaver and had great features. I find that I have to go over and over in order to get a close shave which causes burns. It&#x27;s great for emergency to get things in control, but I use razors as my everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric razors for about 15 years now and I have NEVER had a shaver work as well as this one.  I purchased it a few months ago for a trip overseas and was absolutely blown away by its performance, so much so that it is now my primary razor.  Even though I just changed the blades/foil on my previous razor ([[ASIN:B000G1EQ1W Braun Series 5 (8995) Men&#x27;s Shaver]]), the PocketGo P-70 gives a 10x better shave in half the time.  I have never had a closer shave in my life.  If you typically wait 3+ days between shaves, you may want to look elsewhere because the single foil doesn&#x27;t catch longer hairs exceptionally well ... but if you have average beard growth and you shave every 1-2 days, there is absolutely *nothing* better than this.  For around $15, you owe it to yourself to give this a try before spending a LOT more on a Braun Series 7.  Pick up some electric razor pre-shave gel (my personal favorite is Lectric Shave Ultra) and be ready to be wowed!</li>
            <li> I bought this elsewhere while traveling but I agree with everyone else.  It shaves better than my electric shaver at home, although not as well as pretty much any blade razor.    AA batteries are really ideal for a travel shaver as well, they&#x27;re an international standard and cheap and available everywhere.  There&#x27;s no extra pieces like a charger to carry around and keep track of and no need for plug adapters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors all of my adult life, and almost all of them have been Braun models. When my older alkaline-powered model died, I spent some time researching and decided on the P-70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great little shaver! It trims very close for an electric, and is even lighter than my old one. I especially like the fact that you can clean it in running water. I had to use the brush to clean my old one, and the brush against the screen (a big no-no!) is what did it in. This one, just rinse, shake, and go. Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two included AAs were a nice touch. I opened the package, slapped in the batteries, and off I went across my jaw. Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this electric razor for about 8 years. Great design, as usual, from Braun.  &lt;br /&gt;Operation was getting a bit sporadic this past year. Seemed like a poor connection somewhere. Found that it improved a lot when I started keeping the shaver in the drybox. We live in Taiwan, and it is HUMID.  &lt;br /&gt;I finally opened it up the other day, and a small spring and parts shot across the room. Luckily I found them all, but it did take a while to figure out where they fit in.  &lt;br /&gt;Found a corroded contact and polished it up. I was just reassembling when that spring took off again, along with its plastic retainer bit. Couldn&#x27;t find them this time. Oh well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Assembled the remains and now it shaves with improved vigor.  &lt;br /&gt;The missing parts supplied click stops to the rotating shell, which gave good quality feel, but had nothing to do with actual shaving.    &lt;br /&gt;Did you see something flying across the room? That was my quality feel.  &lt;br /&gt;Still shaves great. Will buy again in a heartbeat if one crosses my path. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just noticed that I have to affirm that \\&quot;I am over the age of 13\\&quot; before I submit this review. Oh, right. A person under 13 wouldn&#x27;t know anything about shavers. Makes sense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time electric razor user and wanted to try one before I spent a couple of hundred dollars for a razor that may not work for me!  I ordered the Braun PocketGo P-70 and what a surprise!  There is no need to spend more for a razor. This one does everything I&#x27;ll ever need!  It&#x27;s convenient, fast, effective and easy to  clean and it only uses 2 AA batteries.  I recommend it highly; it is more than it purports  itself to be!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t add much to the other reviews. Just wanted to add my voice to the obvious approval. For the money, there is no better travel shaver out there.</li>
            <li> My shaving routine has me using a foil shaver and then following that up with a Gillette Mach3. The P-70 is one of the best foil shavers I&#x27;ve ever used and overall one of the best designed products I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s completely self contained, waterproof, has a built in trimmer that retracts and even has a small attached brush for cleaning the foil blades. Plus the cover is built-in. I read the previous reviews, bought one and agree 100% with all of the great things said about this shaver. I&#x27;m thinking about buying an extra for a spare. If you find something you really like, I find it&#x27;s best to buy a spare. No telling how long they&#x27;ll be around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If your like me and easily able to get ingrown hairs, don&#x27;t touch this thing. It seems like a great concept, but once you touch it to your neck, you&#x27;ll get ingrown hairs that will last for a week, and it misses 1/2 of the hairs in between the ingrown hairs. I&#x27;d not recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave everytime - ideal for late for the office situations and overniters.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 Norelco shavers in the past. My 3rd one got wet and quit working. I didn&#x27;t want to pay $40 to $100 for another electric. Quite by chance, I discovered this Braun. I couldn&#x27;t believe the low price. I bought it and was skeptical at first about its abilities. My beard is tough also. It does a remarkably good job of shaving plain and simple. I can&#x27;t believe it runs on 2 AA batteries and I can&#x27;t believe it can be cleaned under running water. The overall design is very nice. Somebody put some thought into the design. I will be buying another one to put away.</li>
            <li> Over the years I found that rotary shavers did not give me a close enough shave. The Remington floating head did give a close shave but they use an ablative carbon steel that leaves the black carbon lubricant on your face after each shave.     Braun&#x27;s floating head rechargeable shaver was my favorite for many years as long as replacement screens and combs were available. When that line was dropped, the replacement shaver had an inferior rechargeable battery. Initially it would not run long enough. Then it gradually got longer and longer runs. Then it gradually got shorter and shorter runs until it was useless within a year. What a waste of money.    That is when I found that Braun had the same excellent head on a shaver (PocketGo) where I could use store-bought long life alkaline batteries. That solved the problem for many years... that is up to now.  The latest version of the PocketGo shaver P-70 seems to have the same problem as the Remington shavers - an irritating black powder coming off the blades and getting all over my face and towels.  Cleaning the shaver screen and comb and with soap and water has no effect.    I invite suggestions for a new shaver that shaves nearly as well as blade, has a rechargeable/replaceable battery that will run for hours and produces no black powder from comb to foil wear and tear.</li>
            <li> No need to buy those highly priced shavers. It just works perfect, i use it daily. I do one hand of my saving blade so that it can remove hair left out on hard to remove places between your chin and neck, it takes less than 2 minute for the complete shave.  I also gifted it to relatives and they liked it very much.</li>
            <li> This is one great little shaver. I was dubious because a previous Braun battery shaver I owned was terrible, but not so with the P-70! It is almost as good as my much more expensive Panasonic rechargeable in use at home. If you need a battery powered shaver look no further, this one is the buy of the year (maybe the decade).</li>
            <li> The Braun PocketGo P-70 mens shaver works well. I would recommend it for a \\&quot;back up\\&quot;,vacation razor or for a quick touch up for late night meetings.</li>
            <li> I just used this as a travel shaver, and it worked really well, for the month and a half I had it. Yeah, it broke after a month and a half; cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I cannot beleive I only spent 14 dollars on such a great little razor. I bought this to do quick shaves and it does just that.  Do I get as close of a shave as I do in the shower? No, but it does a really good job in between shaves.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this razor.  It works on two AA batteries and it is also waterproof.  Great little gadget!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver works pretty well, shaves reasonably close and is a very functional design. When closed, it protects the shaving head very well, but the head is somewhat delicate and care must be used when cleaning not to damage it or to dislodge the foil from the frame. I use it primarily while camping, for this it is excellent.</li>
            <li> It shaves. Remember, you get what you pay for. Lots of reviewers say this is as good or better than a REAL cordless razor.. think again. It is what it is.. a good back up or travel razor. But as for competing with the big guys..forget it. Your Cordless triple head or twin bank razor will cut 10 times better than this and a lot faster. But for a throw-away back up, it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> i got this shaver for my father who is in his eighties and struggles with shaving at times. not only is this easy for him to use, but it also works very well. he has a fairly heavy beard and the more expensive shaver he has did not work as well. the price got me to try it and the quality will bring me back for another.</li>
            <li> I have earler versions of this razor, and they are very good.  Bought this as a gift, and decided to get one for myself.  Priced excellently, this is a significant improvement over the older models.  I use rechargeable batteries and keep it where I can do a quick clean up.  This new model also allows you to clean it by rinsing with water.  Excellent look, feel, price, design, and performance.</li>
            <li> It is hardly a shaver to be satisfied with, but for a short vacation it could be sufficient. I would&#x27;t buy it again knowing what I now know.</li>
            <li> Maybe grizzly men with thick wiry stubble would need something more heavy-duty, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 months now and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I stuck two 2500mA nickel metal hydride batteries in it and I&#x27;ve only had to recharge them once so far, which seems amazing.  Sure you have to go back over your face several times and it misses hairs on the outskirts, but all electric shavers do that.  Spending 100-200 bucks will buy you some extras gismos for gadget-heads, but little meaningful gains.  Plus you can just wash it under the tap to clean it.  Honestly, for 15 bucks you should buy this shaver for yourself and friends.  They will think you spent a lot more.</li>
            <li> It just does a poor job! Don&#x27;t waste your money.    I have a light beard and normally use a Norelco at home. I was looking to use something more compact to carry when traveling. It just doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I prefer this \\&quot;travel\\&quot; shaver to the much more expensive cordless shaver I have at home. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about of month--still with the original set of batteries. It is a great little shaver to use on the go. Seems to be very solidly built. Super razor for the price and you can wash it out with water.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these in early October. When it arrived it would not work at all in spite of trying numerous batteries. I contacted Amazon asking for a replacement. I subsequently received an email from Amazon saying \\&quot;For health and safety reasons, we don&#x27;t want the original item back, so please dispose of it at your convenience.\\&quot; Now, three weeks later, Amazon has sent me another email saying that if I don&#x27;t return the defective shaver they are going to charge my account. First they tell me to throw it away and then they tell me to return it three weeks later. How can I return it if I&#x27;ve thrown it away? What kind of game is this? Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I travel most of the time and this little shaver is perfect. For me this shaver works better than any other at any price.</li>
            <li> The cheapest, but one of the best shaver!  Yes, this is cheap compared with other electric shaver. But it works just fine. Actually it is better than others!  I&#x27;ll probably buy one more soon so that I can use it in my office.  This one is not only for travel but can be used as a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion.  Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product.  I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase.  I may even give these as gifts !</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver, works surprisingly well for the price and the fact that it is a travel model.</li>
            <li> This shaver arrived to me just 5 days ago. It&#x27;s very good. I recommend it to anyone. I think better will be to use it every day. Thanks to Braun!</li>
            <li> I purchased a PocketGo P-70 from Amazon a couple of months ago.  It has performed very well.    This razor can run for 2-3 weeks on a pair of 2000mAh rechargable NiMH batteries.  It is much easier on my skin than the manual razors I&#x27;ve been using for the past quarter century.  To my surprise, it also shaves about as closely as a manual razor.    Why only four stars?  It does miss flat-lying whiskers.  I&#x27;ve been able to get those by moving the skin so they stand up :) and holding the shaver just off the skin.    The price is so low that I&#x27;d still be money ahead, compared to disposable blades, even if I had to buy a new PocketGo every six months or so.</li>
            <li> I keep one of these in my car for those times when I have a meeting late in the day and the shadow is starting to show. The batteries seem to last forever...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Marine Corps son to use in the field while stationed in Afghanistan.  Received the shaver in the mail quickly and appeared to be as advertised.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor based on the great reviews I read here. After using it for a couple months I finally just gave up. It was my first purchase of a foil razor, vice a rotary, and I had high hopes. After multiple, multiple, swipes in multiple directions there was always hair remaining whether I used it dry or in the shower. I would get cuts along my neck even after having used it for months. If I skipped a day or two shaving over the weekend, this razor was near useless for the job come Monday morning. Portability and size and the price are all big plusses, but in the end I was buying a razor and this did not do the job well.</li>
            <li> I bought a Pulsonic and returned it a month later because it shaves as close as my old Norelco Spectra 8891xl, which I rate a 7/10.    I needed a closer shave so I bought a Braun 190 aka free control 1775 for $40; great shave but the foil is flimsy and feels like it will tear soon.  The PocketGo has a sturdy foil.  I&#x27;m going to return my Braun 190 and buy 2 more PocketGos.      I decided to try the PocketGo because of the glowing reviews I read here and because it has similar specs as the the Braun 190 for 25 dollars less.  It ROCKS!  Unlike the previous shavers mentioned, you can even use it in the SHOWER!    I got one for me, one for my brother, and I&#x27;m going to get one for some more family members.    WTF?!!! It shaves closer than the Pulsonic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Buy 10 of these instead of one Pulsonic.  For an extra close shave look for William&#x27;s Lectric Shave Ultra.  I found a bottle at my local pharmacy for $2.49.    I&#x27;m amazed.    I just rubbed my chin to feel how smooth this shaver left it.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have a smaller version which will turn on in your brief case unless you tape it the has a cap which is easy to misplace or drop in the car.  This is the best I have seen</li>
            <li> This thing is ok.  It really struggles if I let my stubble grow out for more than a day, since I have fairly coarse beard hair.  It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s pretty much waterproof - I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> DSad has had a stroke and has had trouble shaving since then. Also he finds it difficult to charge other razors. This razor is easy to use, light weight, easy to clean......all one handed. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This little battery powered shaver is great for road trips when you&#x27;re going to be away from power cords for a while.  Rechargable shavers are heavier and they need to be plugged in every couple of days.  This puppy runs great, shaves OK, and can go for more than a week on one set of double A&#x27;s.  If your&#x27;re going to be gone longer, just toss more batteries in the bag.  It&#x27;s still lighter and cheaper than a recharable!</li>
            <li> Shaver worked well.Two minor things; the trimmer would work better if it was at a larger angle.i had to make sure my thumb was not on switch while shaving as I unintentionally turned razor off by mistake a couple of times.This is the third battery powered razor that I have owned.It is the best.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a bargain. I have been using mine for years as a daily shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Strong points: &lt;br /&gt;- Case rotates to cover or expose the cutting head. This is the best protection for the shaver&#x27;s foil head I have seen on any shaver. It is incredibly easy to use, and you can&#x27;t lose it. Closed you don&#x27;t need any other case for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Runs on any AA batteries. As a travel shaver you don&#x27;t have to worry about carrying a charger - you can just replace the batteries. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- A year or so ago I teamed the 370 with a NiMH battery charger and 4 NiMH AA batteries. Now I have a rechargeable shaver with replaceable batteries. When the ones in the shaver run out I replace them with fully charged ones from the charger. No waiting to recharge. The NiMH batteries work about as well as the AA batteries did. (I got the NiMH batteries and charger on sale somewhere for about $8 - I have seen similar bargains since.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Batteries typically last me for 1- 2 months (longer for alkalines than the rechargeable NiMH batteries). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Light weight. Since it does not need any charging circuitry and has a plastic case the shaver weighs less than most. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Shaves well, at least for me. I have a relatively light beard. I get as good results with the Braun 370 as I did with two previous (and much more expensive) Braun foil shavers &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Weak points: &lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer works, but tends to fold in on itself. It folds out at a 90 degree angle. Unless you hold the shaver parallel to where you are shaving, the trimmer will fold back into the shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Replacement cutting block and foil are either not available or cost twice as much as the shaver. (However I am still on my first cutting block and foil after several years&#x27; use.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Does not have the bells and whistles of \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; shavers - self cleaning, etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other: &lt;br /&gt;- Has a relatively wide shaving head, which I like. Some shavers have a muchnarrower head, which I did not like on the one like this I once had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have not compared the Pocket Twist to other shavers in a long time. There may well be ones that provide a better shave. However it has done a great job for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even if you only use this as a travel shaver you will find it useful and very convenient.</li>
            <li> Never used an electric razor, read the reviews, $12, why not..  &lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier. No irritation whatsoever. Much easier than shaving, good battery life. Very, very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. I&#x27;ve paid much more for electric shavers that weren&#x27;t nearly as good as this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this braun 370 shaver one year ago, im totally satisfied with the job this shaver does. It doesnt waste too many batteries, and if u use rechargeable batteries you will save even more. &lt;br /&gt;Highly recomended to anyone who wants to start using electric shavers, and to anyone who want to change an old shaver. &lt;br /&gt;When i used manual shavers i always hurt myself and bleed, but not with the Braun 370. its painless and effective. I really love this little braun.</li>
            <li> With all the positive reviews, it may just be the type of facial hair I have is incompatible with this razor.  It misses patches and requires many passes to get much of anything at all.  I have tried wet/dry +/- shaving cream.   All combos lead to similar results.</li>
            <li> I owned an earlier version of this razor for some time.  I eventually had to relinquish it to my girlfriend as she ws constantly using it to shave her legs.  So I bought the newer version for myself.  Needless to say, since I purchased two of them, that I think this is an outstanding product.  I regularly shave with a blade, but keep this shaver in my car for touch-ups in the evening, or when I&#x27;m in a big rush in the morning.  It shaves as well, or better than some high dollar Braun and Panasonic shavers I have owned in the past.  It certainly blows away anything Norelco has to offer.  It shaves close with no irritation.  I think the single head design allows it to get into tight areas much better than a dual head model. &lt;br /&gt;Hey, look...we&#x27;re talking about $12.00 here.  That&#x27;s the cost of a few refills for a decent blade razor.  You should own this shaver, if not for a primary, at least for a back-up.</li>
            <li> Got this after my older version of the Braun 370 broke. (Can&#x27;t complain about the older one breaking... Accidentally dropped it onto a ceramic tile floor, after being happy with it for a couple of years.) The new Braun 370 PocketGo works just as well as the older one, and the batteries still last for a long time. Your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;m happy with it, and can&#x27;t help wondering why people spend so much more for other shavers.</li>
            <li> I kept a smaller Braun in the car for years (it fell apart). &lt;br /&gt;Cover rotates around nicely.</li>
            <li> This has been a revelation for me. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. It shaves with the premium razors but it is much less expensive and smaller. I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 only because the trim attachment could be better. I strongly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really know what to expect and I have never owned a Braun anything, so for ~$15 i thought what the heck...shaves almost as good as my new Braun FreeControl at home.  not as close as a razor, but what electric is?  i like that the accessories are on it and it takes AA batteries so you don&#x27;t need a plug.  easy to use, easy to carry and gives a near razor quality shave.</li>
            <li> The amazon.com price was excellent at under $20 for a shaver that is well thought out and gives a nice close shave.  This is not a heavy duty beard trimmer but for someone whose everyday maintenance shave is about 3-5 minutes this works exceeding well.  I highly recommend it as a portable or home shaver.  Great product.  Pro: close shave, dry or wet use, cleans easily, blade protection with automatic off, cleaner brush housed on shaver, 2 AA battery use.  Con: small long hair cutter, only functions for 60 minutes on 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Based on the positive reviews, the great price and f*r*e*e shipping, I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  We were camping in our travel trailer, and this little shaver comes with batteries, so he opened it and used it immediately.  He loved the great shaving job it did, the fact that you can wash the head, and--most of all--it fits perfectly in his shaving bag.  (His 3-head full-size electric shaver never really fit.)  It&#x27;s not too big, not too small, but juuuust right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several electric shavers over the years (Braun and Panasonic) from different price ranges and the Braun PocketGo P-70 shaves as good or better than any of the others. I had originally purchased it almost two years ago as strictly a &#x27;travel&#x27; shaver to use on trips, but it quickly became my &#x27;every day&#x27; shaver because of the quality of the shave and ease of use. A fresh set of AA&#x27;s probably lasts me between 10-15 shaves before I begin to notice that they need replacing ...and when I say &#x27;begin to notice&#x27;, it&#x27;s because it takes awhile for a set of AA&#x27;s to gradually discharge to the point that this shaver becomes unusable (the shaver won&#x27;t just quit on you, it gives you plenty of warning that you&#x27;ll be needing a new set of batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this shaver, I recently purchased a second one that I&#x27;ve tucked away still sealed in its packaging for that time when the one that I&#x27;m currently using finally lives out its life (e.g. the foil and/or blades need replacing). At less than $20, it&#x27;s easier just to purchase an entire new unit rather than swapping out pieces on a used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver!!!</li>
            <li> When travelling, the less you bring the happier you will be.  This lightweight is self-contained, shaves close and uses AA batteries.  Being waterproof is an additional plus</li>
            <li> my husband has burn up so many plugging them in and letting them charge too long and I wanted to find him something he could take in his car but not have to worry with the dead battery and worry with charging&lt;br /&gt;HE loves this and you can get batteries anywhere...</li>
            <li> WORTH the money! Highly recommend ... I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 so one stays in the suitcase with NO MESS, the other in the bathroom (with NO MESS).      The new top slides &#x27;over&#x27; the shaving head which means no more \\&quot;lost\\&quot; or \\&quot;cracked (broken)\\&quot; tops (and no longer too messy to pack)!</li>
            <li> Bought this for 2 week vacation in Turkey.  Battery life was excellent. Shave was good and close.  Wet/dry made it convenient. Very satisfied.[[ASIN:B00007M9SU Braun 370 PocketGo Battery Operated Shaver]]</li>
            <li> My boss got one of these for his birthday, and was showing it off. I have always used Norelco rotary shavers in the past (someone told me that foil shavers cause more skin irritation) and have never gotten a good shave with them, so for the past number of years, I have been using a Mach3. After seeing his 370, I decided to try one... since it was such a low price, I figured I had nothing to lose. Turns out I get less skin irritation with this shaver than with a rotary or a blade! In fact, it worked so well that I decided to get a \\&quot;real Braun shaver\\&quot; and bought a higher end model. This little 370 gives almost as good of a shave as my more expensive Braun (8975)! I will still use the 8975 for most of my shaving needs, but the 370 will be a great touch-up and travel shaver. As most people say, you can actually use it on an every day basis! I&#x27;m going to buy another one just to store away for later!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor when my old one died.  I immediately noticed the good and the not-so-good.  First, the good:  this razor is VERY comfortable.  I have no irritation after shaving, which I could not say about my old razor.  This razor is also very easy to hold.  Now, the not-so-good:  the shave is not as close as I&#x27;d like.  I realize there&#x27;s probably a trade-off here: closer shave, more irritation.  I&#x27;m very happy with the trade-off of this razor; that is, I&#x27;d rather have no irritation.  I do find that when I&#x27;m going out at night, I shave again, which is no big deal for me.  Given all of this, I&#x27;d certainly buy this razor again.</li>
            <li> Gives me about 85% of a close shave. I still have to use my safety razor to touch up the stiffer areas of my shave. A bit noisy but that con is offset by the price. Battery usage is excellent. Two AA batteries last about 3 weeks. Wish the electronic engineers of this company could train the digital camera makers on how to extend battery usage.</li>
            <li> Great shaver &amp; it works better than my expensive Braun. Buy one for the car or office for late afternoon touch ups.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he has mixed feelings about this shaver. According to him, he has a lot more stubble left after a shave than with his old Remington. Granted the Remington was a dual foil as opposed to the single, but I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it made that much difference. (Of course I&#x27;m a woman so what do I know about shaving facial hair?) Anyway, eventhough it&#x27;s not as close a shave as he&#x27;d prefer, he likes the convenience of not having to charge it. When you&#x27;re deployed, you&#x27;re not always near an outlet. Overall he says it&#x27;s ok, but perhaps would work best as a backup, especially if you have coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> I WAS DOUBTFUL ABOUT HOW GOOD A SHAVE I WOULD GET FROM AN INEXPENSIVE COMPACT SHAVER.I HAVE USED SEVERAL COMPACT SHAVERS IN THE PAST AND WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR PERFORMANCE.. THE BRAUN \\&quot; POCKET TO GO \\&quot; GAVE ME A CLOSE AND COMFORTABLE SHAVE. IN FACT, I PLAN TO BUY TWO MORE TO GIVE AS HOLIDAY GIFTS..</li>
            <li> If you think you must use a blade to get a perfect, close shave, you&#x27;re wrong.  This little gem is easy to use, well made (I dropped it on cement), and does a fantastic job.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of travel shavers over the years and this is THE best. It has good power, gives a nice shave, and is still small. The design is excellent because the foil is very well protected against damage in luggage and the lock system is secure so it will not accidentally turn ON when squished in your luggage. I just took it to Costa Rica and it was still running fine after 15 days of shaves on the same set of 2 AA batteries. You don&#x27;t have to carry a lot of spare batteries. The quality of shave is very high for a travel razor which is great on a long trip. I can handle a poor shave for a couple days but not for weeks. I have tried the Eltron 3030 (a toy) and Panasonic and others. The Braun P70/370 is the best and an amazing deal at $15 or $20. I am getting a spare or two in case it goes out of production.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for travel.  It fits in my Dopp Kit.  My Norelco is a great shaver also but just too big.  This PocketGo Shaver is perfect size for travel and does a great job on a light beard.  It is not great for a two day growth but then it costs less than twenty dollars.  Would I sell a friend on this product?  ...you bet.    Big Mac</li>
            <li> With the price of razors going through the roof, I was amazed to find a quality electric shaver for under $ 20.00. I have used this little gem for at least 35 shaves . .  and it not only gives me a good shave, I&#x27;m still on the first set of double A batteries !</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before and this is my first time.  One thing is you cant be using this shaver to save time because you would be done with a better shave sooner if you used a razor.  the down motion does not seem to cut any beard, it made no effect on my 1 day old stubble and it got cleared( not completely) once I started more of upward moion.  I finished shaving about an hour ago and my face is still itchy and red and I still got some stubble left and a few small nicks despite using the pre-shave gel.may be i have a sensitive skin..  Its definately good as a travel shaver, but i may not like the irritation if i have to use it daily.May be it takes time to get used to it?   for the price( around $10) this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Among the hundreds of enthusiastic reviewiers, I noticed one that gave one star and said the shaver doesn&#x27;t do its job and only hurt his face. Just our luck that the same thing would happen to us.  My husband tried to shave with this darn thing and said he had to go over the same spot multiple times and still it would just hurt his face and cut nothing! He ended up shaving his sore face with his old shaver.  Now my problem is how to get rid of a used shaver. Can I return it? Who would buy a used shaver and that doesn&#x27;t even work well? My husband told me that we should never give this product as a present. Anyway, the lesson is that one should not believe something is great just because it has hundreds of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I got this thing for free by spending hotel points, but I like it so much I thought I&#x27;d review it here.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday in between razor shaves: mostly just on my mustache while letting the beard scruff grow in. It&#x27;s quick and painless and works better than one of the Norelco electrics I bought for $80+! Perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Good portable shaver.  Will cut up to two days of growth. Beyond that, the foil design won&#x27;t be able to shave well.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful, compact razor.  Self contained with brush fitting nicely into the case.  Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I prefer using a blade but this shaver is great for weekends and quick shaves.</li>
            <li> Beware !! --- Cuts great for 2-3 months maximum until cheap frail head begins to wear thin and blades  start to cut more of your face than they do your beard !!!</li>
            <li> small light and portable and a decent shave too. no cords or docking modules. two AA runs it well for a few weeks it seems. a well  designed and  sturdy product .</li>
            <li> a product comes along that is design perfection combined with performance. This is it. Can&#x27;t say much more. I have 4 of them.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the car glove compartment for use when I forget or don&#x27;t have time to shave. It&#x27;s bailed me out several times. Sure, not quite as good as my full-size 7526 Braun(get this exellently priced refurb also on Amazon), but great for travel, quick on-the-go reshave before evening, or \\&quot;emergency.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I ordered the 370 water resistant version on amazon but ended up receiving the older non water resistant version which was the one I had been using until it broke.  I did not bother contacting amazon about this because for $15 it&#x27;s frankly not worth my time.  I did buy the newer (silver) one at a CVS as well.  I like them both, but I found that using the same batteries, the newer version vibrates faster than the old black one.  The silver one also has a nicer look and feel, although the trimmer on the older one is easier to use for me.  For $15, a great shaver. Only thing is, it probably makes more sense to replace the entire shaver than to replace a foil at around $8.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement for a battery powered Braun I bought 12 years ago...it is a big design improvement and shaves even better.  The swivel case is ideal when it goes into your travel kit and it protects the foil well.  My only issue is that the trimmer is very lightweight...doesn&#x27;t do a great job, but hey, my old one didn&#x27;t have one at all! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> What a great little razor!  I&#x27;ve traveled with one for years...in fact, I now own my third one.  It&#x27;s certainly not that they are unreliable; I&#x27;ve never had one fail.  Of my first two, I dropped one in the water and the other on a tile floor...needless to say, no travel razor I know of is built to withstand that!  It works remarkably well, cleans easily, has great battery life and earns my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I had the predecessor to this model for almost ten years; with a pair of lithium AA batteries it would last seemingly forever. Both it and this model are very lightweight and small, which is what makes it so perfect to keep in a travel kit. This new model has the added advantage of the head being washable under a sink. My old model got chewed up by a dog... otherwise it would have kept going :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had $130 shavers before bought for me for Christmas.  All those fancy fancy ones with the 3 rotating blades.  What I like about this cheap shaver is that it is durable and lasts at least 6 months.  The first thing to give out on it is screen.  Once there is a hole in it don&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;ll hurt your face.  But then again this was when I was using it in Iraq.  Ever since I&#x27;ve been home I&#x27;ve had the same one for 2 years now.  I like it because i can pick out single hairs.  It&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Battery operated and has a cleaning brush and a clever cover for the blade but it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this little shaver at first.  I have loved my 10 year old Braun foil shaver, but it&#x27;s no longer available.  I love the size and the design of this P-70, (except for the poor side burn trimmer design).  It seemed great as a shaver to keep in my bag to complement my new Braun home shaver.  Then I realized that it was leaving LOTS of uncut facial hair.  I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, in fact, quite the opposite.  Yet this little shaver requires 2 to 3 times the normal shaving effort and time.  The design and the idea is great, but the cut is below average.  I personally would not likely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It might just be because I have sensitive skin, but this thing seriously hurt my face! It was like sharp cutting or something. Very cheap and crappy!</li>
            <li> Works very well and gives a good, comfortable shave.  The twist open feature is convenient, but would be better if it locked open and closed.  Exceptionally good value for the money...Amazon sells this produce for about HALF the price as other vendors.</li>
            <li> i had the older model of this shaver (braun 375) for 2-3 years before the shaving foil broke. it&#x27;s such a great shaver i got another one.</li>
            <li> This is simply awesome for an electric shaver. I have one the car and in my desk at work.  Such quality for the money. It shaves better than the Braun I paid over $100.00 for just 4 months ago which I now wish I could return. I will purchase more and send as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the Braun shave. I especially like the small battery operated Brauns. This model is a little larger than previous models, but the shave is exceptional for such a convenient shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver at a very low price.  I previously had a Panasonic shaver that just quit working after a few years, so I replaced it with the Braun 370.  The 370 seems to shave just as well as the Panasonic, but it has a couple of well thought out additional features.  First, the Braun includes a trimmer-an important feature for me.  Second, the cap that protects the head is part of the shaver and cannot be removed.  This means that you can&#x27;t lose it and it can&#x27;t fall off in transit.  Finally, the rotating head cover also prevents the shaver from accidentally being turned on.  All in all, a well thought out, efficient shaver at a very attractive price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this shaver, although, my 99 cents shaver did the same until I lost it :).</li>
            <li> The best shaver I have ever owned.  The quality of this shaver is superior to many shavers I have seen on the market.  (I&#x27;ve owned Norelco, Remington and Wahl.)  The first thing I bought was a pair of AA NiMH batteries with the highest mA hour rating.  It goes for weeks with out a recharge.  Got tired of the old shavers with built-in charging systems for NiCad.</li>
            <li> I am amazed that they can sell this little shaver so inexpensively.  I have had mine as my regular shaver for more than three years and it has always been effective and reliable.  This morning, while enjoying another great shave I was curious to look on Amazon again and see if perhaps the low price I paid for it was some kind of computer error, as it does as good of a job as shavers costing ten times as much.  But no, it is only a couple more dollars today than I paid three years ago and still a great bargain.  For best results, you need to keep fresh batteries in it.  If I use regular alkaline AA batteries, they will last a week or two.  But what I do now is to use rechargeable batteries.  I keep one set in the charger and one set in the shaver and switch them every couple of days, so it is always shaving at full power.  I highly recommend this shaver for travel or everyday use and at this price you could buy a new one every year!</li>
            <li> good item, happy with purachase, affordable and does the work it is meant for that price</li>
            <li> The delivery was prompt, packaged well and in perfect condition.  The unit is small and light weight making it great for travel.  And, the price is right.</li>
            <li> Have owned many electric shaver in my life and this is one of the best I have used. Puchased two just in case.</li>
            <li> This bad boy is really awesome.  I kid you not.  I had to live out of a suitcase for approximately forty days a little less than a year ago.  Since I was in transit and my previous shaver had more or less run itself down, I opted insetad to buy this puppy.  Thinking, naturally, that if it lasted me a month it will have still been a sound investment as it was priced so incredibly low.      That was ten months ago.      I use it every day.      Every.  Day.      And have changed the batteries once.      Ten months.  Every day.  One battery swap.    That is all.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a breakthrough product based on price, convenience and effectiveness. It costs less than twenty bucks, you can take in anywhere, and it shaves well (although, I recommend giving your beard a splash of Williams&#x27; Lectric Shave before shaving with it). I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right I returned the Panasonic Vortex after 3 weeks when I bought this funky little gizmo!  It&#x27;s true I had the fancy rechargeable thing, but it didn&#x27;t dry-shave as close, took longer and constantly needed to be recharged.    This gives an incredibly comfortable smooth shave, quick to use, easy to clean, washable, good battery life so far (3 weeks strong with daily use &amp; still going), can be slipped into your bag/briefcase, easy for touch ups, great for travel as no separate plugs needed, the spin-over foil protection also stops it being switched on by accident.    One bad thing is the awkward sideburn trimmer other than that, you should definately buy one.      I&#x27;m buying another so I can keep one in the car/office and one at home, at the bargain price of $15 today you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I needed a travel shaver to take on a trip to India because I was warned not to use a blade razor to avoid getting contaminated water in a facial cut. While the price and size of this shaver is okay, it just didn&#x27;t shave that well unless I went over the same area several times. But doing so irritated my skin too much. End result is that I used the shaver for quick touch-ups and I ended up looking like I needed a shave for much of the trip. Might work well for light beards, avoid it if you have a heavy, fast-growing beard.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.  It is small works vary well.  You can get it wet,  runs on batteries you can get at almost any store.  Best of all it is a Braun which is a quality product.  I just love it.  I bought two, one for me and one for a friend.</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to my expectation of quality I usually get from Braun. My old pocket shaver from braun worked great but needed a new film cover, was cheaper to buy new shaver.  This one is a bit bigger but not nearly as efficient.The shave and feel is not as good. But for the money and compared to other companies I give it 1 star</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 yr. old son who has been shaving since 14.  We were going broke supplying hm with razor blades, so I figured we&#x27;d try a shaver and see what happened.  To my delight he gets a decent shave with this little shaver AND it costs much, much less than the blades.  It&#x27;s worked out great for us.</li>
            <li> Not often am I pleasently surprised by an item at the low end of the cost scale, but this one hits the mark.  It shaves as well as a razor 10 times it price, is easy to use, easy to clean and all in all a best buy.  If you are already using an electic razor there is no period of adjustment.  If you are in the market for a cheap travel razor, this is it.</li>
            <li> This model is now called the Braun Mobile Shaver - M90 and its suitable for folks with not so heavy beard growth.  This is my daily shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;For stubble length hairs&lt;br /&gt;Washable, making cleaning the easiest yet&lt;br /&gt;trimmer included&lt;br /&gt;self contained blade guard&lt;br /&gt;AA powered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Not powerful enough for heavier beard growth, when I skip a few days, I need to use a razor&lt;br /&gt;Not adequate for cutting longer hair&lt;br /&gt;Dead spots on my face, it will not shave certain areas unless I concentrate on them</li>
            <li> Was on vacation recently and somehow managed to lose my razor I normally take with me.  I had bought this model over a year ago and stuck it in a side area of my suitcase where I just found it. Oddly enough, the batteries that came with it still worked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, wouldn&#x27;t you know it had no problem taking off my 2 day beard growth.  In fact, it felt awfully close to a blade shave without the irritation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I now use it as my daily shaver and it does better than my former daily shaver, a Panasonic wet/dry, which cost 3 times more.</li>
            <li> I have a rechargeable shaver, which is &gt;5 years old, and I new I needed to get a new one or grow a beard again.  I chose this Braun because of the name and the price.  I have been using it for a few weeks and I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries.  I would have had to recharge my other shaver.  It gives a nice shave also.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I got this razor today and tried it briefly but long enough to know that this well built razor is a winner. So much so, that I&#x27;m going to buy two more today. I&#x27;ll use them for spare parts,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since they only cost $12.00 each. Replacing the cutter and foil would cost more than that. I won&#x27;t know how long the batteries will last but even if I only get a few shaves, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a charger and four rechargeable batteries for under $10.00 will do away with having to replace the AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little razor cuts closer than a Panasonic portable wet/dry razor that I recently bought on Amazon, (see my review). And the Braun 370 cuts closer dry than the Panasonic cuts wet. This morning I shaved with the Panasonic and got only a marginal shave. This afternoon, I shaved over the stubble and got down to smooth skin....WOW, is all I can say about this little Braun gem. It removed the stubble that the Panasonic left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, gotta go and order two more of these before the price goes up.  :-)</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun 370 to replace a 20 year old Aramis travel shaver (now dead). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Positives are the low price, the trimmer, and the fact that it shaves really well. The shaver also seems to be really well made. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the only negative is that it is about half as big again as the Aramis. (Braun is 4.5 inches long when stowed)</li>
            <li> I bought 2 for home and in the car, they work fine for a light beard.</li>
            <li> I have a older version of the Braun which I have  used for many years to remove the 5 oclock shadow.  The new version has been improved over what was ,and is a very  good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel.  I usually use a large Norelco, but for the price this seemed like it was worth a try.  I used it everyday for two weeks on a trip to China using the included alkaline batteries and it still has plenty of juice left.  It is small and light (half the size and weight of a Norelco) and has a flip over guard to protect the heads so it doesn&#x27;t require a separate case.  It shaves very close, closer than my Norelco.  The only difference is that it is not as gentle on the skin as some other razors. &lt;br /&gt;It is a perfect travel razor. Battery life is good, batteries available most anywhere and one doesn&#x27;t have to worry about voltage converters for travel outside of the U.S. (see my review of Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter).......</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare cases of getting more than you expected. The pop-out hair trimmer is useful for light-duty trimming between hair cuts. The swiveling cover is great because it&#x27;s not a separate piece to misplace. And a  great shave for this type of shaver. I&#x27;d be happier if it were a bit more compact for travel, but I&#x27;m not complaining. Easy enough to clean. I&#x27;d buy one for the glove compartment of my car, if I had a car.</li>
            <li> This shaver is quite small and does a good job. It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave as the advanced shavers but considering the extremely cheap price, you cannot beat it. Also being battery powered is an extra plus when traveling. Buy one for your trips.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little shaver, great for roadtrips or storing at the office for when you forget.  May not be the best for those with heavy beard, but good enough, and simply amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I am in the cateogry of individuals who went a little nuts and probably over-tried and over-analyzed every razor out there for a period of time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The PocketGo for starters is a substanital upgrade over its&#x27; predecessor, the Pockettwist, as a travel shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The design is solid, feels substantial, and amazingly for the price tag is fully immersible which means it can be used with shave cream, shave soap etc. and in the shower.  And can be rinsed clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I am not sure that I would use the PocketGo as an everyday device I can see why many would and in fact many are doing so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The PocketGo renders a highly respectable dry shave.  It&#x27;s not quite as fast and just a little more inconsistent than my dry shaver of choice, the Remington MS2 line, so I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for it at home now that I&#x27;m done testing. But when I use it, it doesn&#x27;t miss a beat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The wet shave option opens up a new dimension.  The PocketGo renders an excellent shave used with shave cream/shave soap. Just about as good as any I&#x27;ve ever had, although again it maybe takes a bit longer than say the Shick TR3 twin-foil which is my current wet shaver of choice (another great deal at about $35 BTW). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Say you&#x27;re in a hotel room...hop in the shower, lather up your face with the soap provided in the room, do several passes in this manner in the shower and have you have an excellent shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if its lost or stolen, you&#x27;re out a $15 not a $100+ unit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun PocketGo is a substantial step forward in \\&quot;travel shaver\\&quot; design, quality and peformance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It renders a nearly high end shave, offers wet shave versatility for a laughably low price and could be used nearly daily if you wished to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is probably worth twice it&#x27;s price if not more and I would not hesitate to purchase it.  I bought 8 for staff members and plan on buying more for some of our best customers this fall.</li>
            <li> Its a OK device for below $20.  The most positive feature,  its Handy. But it needs two batteries.</li>
            <li> I was, like so many others, ready to praise this shaver.  It is compact, convenient and does a great job as a travel shaver.    In fact, I have only used it on a few trips and after a very modest amount of use the screen is wearing out and I find no replacements are available.    Our throw-away culture has got to change, so I am offended to be stuck with an irreparable throw-away product!    John</li>
            <li> the extension for long hairs is a bit awkward to use and the top part only works well with shorts hairs. its still a good buy though, comparable to shavers at $100+</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using it for more than 2 weeks and it is still on the original batteries. Very well designed and the shave is great. Hard to believe it sells for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I never liked electric razors, because I find that they don&#x27;t give a close enough shave.  But I decided to try this one for use on five o&#x27;clock shadow late in the day, and it works well.  After only a couple of uses, I have not had any problem with irritation and the shave is OK.  And the price is right.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad shaver for the price. Very compact and easy to maintain.  It does not do a very good job on the neck, otherwise it gives a close  shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this little shaver several years ago in Berlin when BA lost my luggage in Heathrow. Still use it and love it. Use it for travel to bring in my carry-on luggage and still use it every day as it gets those areas which a large Panasonic (nice but more expensive) doesn&#x27;t get. Only complaint: Replacement parts (foil and blade) cost as much as a new shaver. Not very sustainable for the environment but guess what. Ordered a new one and will keep the other one as backup/work shaver as it still works, only would like after 5 years or so to exchange the blade.  EDIT Since using it nothing to add other than in this newer model the long hair cutter is considerable smaller and sideways, rather than in parallel to the main one.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about a month ago and I am completely satisfied with it. This might only be my second shaver but it was beyond my expectations for a $20 piece of equipment. I had to replace my old one because my roommate broke it and I did a bit of research and figured that within budget this would probably be the best one. I was skeptical about the small trimmer but it turned out to be perfect for trimming my mustache and goatee, and if you just skim it along the hair it does a good job on thinning it out. For the first couple of days it agitated my skin but it got used to it. I wouldn&#x27;t say that its the best on the market but for a low budget or a first shaver it is satisfactory. One concern that was brought to my attention is that it uses AA batteries that always need to be replaced, well I have had this unit for about a month now and the batteries are still good. And it only uses two AA batteries and at the rate that they discharge its not much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Convenient and inexpensive but disappointed that three out of four I gave away as presents worked. The head of the shaver kept falling off so it was useless. But the other three worked fine.</li>
            <li> Found this product at my local mall... for more then triple the price!!! When I found it at Amazon thought... can&#x27;t be!? Sure enough it was and the product is all it is described to be!!! Awesome!! My Husband loves it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model and the previous Braun AA shaver for many years, and find they are great for traveling, and weekend use at home. I especially like it on long road trips camping, not having to worry about recharging. It cuts pretty well, as long as you give it a few passes (I find 4 is good), so it&#x27;s not particularly fast.    My only grip is that I&#x27;ve had two of these recent models (the 370) and the foils broke quite quickly on both. After some searching I found replacement foils, but I&#x27;m a little disappointed about two failing (one after &lt; 7 days use). However, I like it enough to stick with it for now.</li>
            <li> This shaver is perfect for travel.  Its small yet very efficient.  It doesn&#x27;t require a cord or a charger since it operates on two AA batteries.  I am quite pleased with this item snd recommend it to anyone on the go.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and unlike many in its price range it actually works and works well.  A breeze to clean. Water proof.  I love the using AA batteries for power.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> With the price less than 16.00 on Amazon, this rasor not only beat any razor within the price range, but also beat shavers cost more than double.  The construction is solid, the result is good, the battery last longer than others. What eles could you want with less than 16.00?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 yrs old and have been shaving for quite some time. I&#x27;ve kissed a lot of frogs, but this Braun PocketGo is a prince. I have one in my car, next to my computer, on my boat, and one at the office. I&#x27;m never without a great shave. Clean up is very easy and the attached brush saves me from searching. As long as the PocketGo is clean, it shaves VERY close. THUMBS UP BRAUN! MaxScratch</li>
            <li> Nice portable shaver.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably well designed, has a quality feel that belies its under $20 pricetag, and works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Purchased this little razor from Amazon in Feb 2008. I have just taken my first trip using it. I cannot believe it. I have a $120 Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver at home. This little guy gives me just as close a shave as the Panasonic - and with less time going back and forth. It even gets the neck hairs very well. Now my wife is asking me why I spent $120 on the Panasonic - and I don&#x27;t have a good answer...</li>
            <li> I hate to shave, hence the beard but this inexpensive well designed little beauty works very well.  Awesome for traveling.</li>
            <li> SUMMARY: I give it 2-1/2 stars (rounded down to 2). The design is really cool and I really wanted to like it, but I just wish it shaved better. This shaver is ultimately just &#x27;ok&#x27; -- ok for short trips or stuffing in the glove box, not so good for day-to-day use or getting an all-around good, close shave.    DETAILS: The shaver design is cool as it&#x27;s very compact, has no cords and runs for up to a month on a set of batteries if using it every day for a couple of minutes per day.    Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s cool:  * Small, compact, portable design.  * Rotating cover that automatically locks the razor and protects the foil when closed and lets you shave when opened.  * Nice simple battery access that is sealed away from water. Battery cover on the bottom rotates to reveal the batteries.  * Cleaning brush built into the base.  * Easy to clean - just open, brush off the blades and rinse under the water. I recommend you let it air dry before replacing the foil/cover.  * My face gets irritated easily and I didn&#x27;t get razor burn from this shaver, no matter what I did.  * Small, portable and easy to travel with or for a quick shave in the car.    Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s just ok:  * Kind of noisy.  * Shave was decent on my face. Neck was not so good and had to resort to using my old shaver to get some of the missed hairs.  * As the batteries wear down, the shave isn&#x27;t as good, but it&#x27;s hard to tell when you have reached the point of needing to change the batteries.  * Trimmer is inconvenient to use.    SUMMARY: Don&#x27;t buy this as a day-to-day razor. It&#x27;s nice to keep in your bag or glove box for those days you forget or don&#x27;t have time to shave before leaving the house, or for when you are taking a quick trip and don&#x27;t want to bring your bulkier electric razor. I really wanted to like this shaver, but it&#x27;s difficult to give it a better rating than 2 stars (which is mostly for the design itself).</li>
            <li> Nice for the price.  Leaves my skin a little more irritated than my much more expense Panasonic, but not so bad that I would hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for 10 dollars and still felt ripped off.  At first I had high hopes.  A high seller rating and the feeling of a hefty quality build.  I probably ran this thing over my face for 30 minutes and nothing happened other than horrible burning skin irritation.  Simply put, it doesn&#x27;t work.  There was no noticeable difference, and I don&#x27;t have much facial hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised.  A very economical shaver that works as good as more expensive shavers</li>
            <li> Please note... I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because -- like any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned -- it misses some hairs.  The other reviewer is correct... you might have to use a razor on occasion to get &#x27;em all.  If you&#x27;re familiar with electric shavers, you probably know exactly what we&#x27;re talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I think it does as good a job as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  And I&#x27;ve spent a lot more than 10 or 11 bucks on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I like it and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a travel shaver.  It&#x27;s \\&quot;spunky\\&quot; because it&#x27;s battery powered.  My rechargable starts to slow down after a couple of uses and, of course, needs to be charged.  This one really has some energy and so far I haven&#x27;t worn down the batteries.  Battery life seems good since I&#x27;d be recharging by now with my other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might want to carry a couple of extra batteries with you when you&#x27;re traveling.  But consider this... the shaver itself is self-contained.  You don&#x27;t have to carry a recharging cord (you don&#x27;t need access to an outlet) and it flips around into it&#x27;s own \\&quot;case\\&quot; so there&#x27;s no case or pouch to carry around.  As such, it&#x27;s a good, very compact Braun shaver (with trimmer) and you sure can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for commuting, to keep in your briefcase, or to leave at the office.  It doesn&#x27;t have the oomph nor the really nice sideburn trimmer that would make it a good choice for daily chopping of a heavy beard.  It does have one noticeable flaw: sometimes the battery cover comes off in a suitcase or briefcase, dumping the AA batteries out.  Most inconvenient. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s certainly worth the price and maybe a good bit more than that just to have a shaver at the office to get a quick trim before going out or before an important meeting.</li>
            <li> Was so looking forward to this ........ gave as gift to brother and he said at first was great but approx. 2 wks. later it had plenty of power but no shave (sharpness of blades I guess).  He rubbed over his face as usual and it left more hair than it cut.  I had read previous reviews and thought it would perform longer than it did ......... disappointed !!</li>
            <li> 1.  Do you think this little shaver would do well for very coarse underarm hair? &lt;br /&gt;2.  Does the razor pinch or pull as it&#x27;s shaving? Is it comfortable to use? &lt;br /&gt;3.  Would you recommend it for the tender underams of someone new to shaving? (We&#x27;re into the third or 4th type of blade and cream removals are leaving the skin red and raw.) &lt;br /&gt;4.  Its not clear if the AA batteries for the Braun 370 are proprietary or does this product run on ordinary batteries bought in a grocery store? &lt;br /&gt;5.  How many times can you shave before the batteries have to be replaced? &lt;br /&gt;6.  What&#x27;s your experience with how sharp the blade stays?  How quickly do you have to replace the whole unit/or blade that goes with it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If anyone can speak to these issues, I&#x27;d be most grateful. We are moving overseas without convenience of 110, and must also consider the difficulty of getting batteries.  The product use is intended for the very tender underams of a pre-teen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> On my last trip, I swapped my much more expensive travel razor for this remarkable little gem.  It is feature rich and gives a good, close shave on two AA batteries, which can be found anywhere.  You can&#x27;t beat the price with features this good.  It&#x27;s so light, it&#x27;s great for camping, business travel, or just as a spare razor to keep in the office for a quick shave or touch up. I give this razor the highest praise!</li>
            <li> I am a first time electric shave user. I tried it once almost 10 years ago and it had really irritated my skin then. So I was reluctant about trying electric shavers again. But now I have to go to a place where there is no water to shave for a month. I decided to give this little guy a try mostly bacause of the small size, being operated by AA and very low price.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works really well. Even after my first try there was almost no irritation. Yes, it misses some hair at the neck area (which caused the only irritation since I really pushed hard to shave those few hair in the neck). But still it is impressive for the first try. I also loved the protective cap. Altough it is larger than other pocket shavers I have seen I will still give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews, and the ones I don&#x27;t agree with I will simply ignore and not bring attention to their sinful lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver for use on other body parts than my face. To tell you the truth, I&#x27;m afraid of electrical devices near my face, so I use a regular shaver for that and store it in a separate drawer with other non-electrical items so it doesn&#x27;t become corrupt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is very good at removing all kinds of hair in non-facial areas, but it should come with a stick because my arms are not that long and I don&#x27;t like to directly touch anything electrical. So I use gloves, just as I&#x27;m wearing gloves to type right now. If anyone else has this problem, it&#x27;s not that cumbersome to wear gloves and, as you can see, I can type just fine with them on. Here are some types of hair this shaver has helped me remove:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Upper back hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Lower back hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Thick hair (in individual hair diameter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Thick hair (in terms of density, not diameter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Thin hair (in individual hair diameter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Thin hair (in terms of density, not diameter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Matted hair, with use of the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Hair in delicate places&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Hair on my toes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Stubble&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Strange long hairs on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Underarm hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all those areas, underarm hair was the most troublesome... even worse than \\&quot;hair in delicate places.\\&quot; I think it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m ticklish and the cat kept bugging me when I was shaving the last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who like to be entirely shorn, this shaver is perfect, and you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s cordlessness is awesome. I not only live the shorn lifestyle, but am shed-free in terms of skin. By that, I mean that I wash and scrub off dead skin before leaving home so as to minimize hair and skin-cell leavings. This shaver works wonderfully with my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> This pocket shaver works very well. You get a close, comfortable shave every time, it is easy to clean and the built-in head cover works nice. My only suggestion to Braun is to make the bottom square so it will stand on end better in your medicine cabinet. Overall, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I found this little gadget when my rotary-head Norelco razor was dropping hints of its impending demise and thought I&#x27;d pick up the Braun until I found another really good razor.  I was surprised to find that the Braun 370 is a good razor.  More than that, it&#x27;s a really good razor.         Personal items like razors have a feel that some will find more or less to their liking and some people who&#x27;ve grown used to a rotary-head razor might not care for this foil head on the Braun.  Most differences that I expected to find annoying in this device have proved easy to get used to.         First of all, this razor is much lighter and more compact than most, so it has a different heft, and it works best when held nearly perpendicular to the skin.  It shaves as closely as my Norelco did, I believe, and is actually more comfortable.  It has a slightly smaller shaving area and may not shave as quickly, but I don&#x27;t think the difference is significant.  The rotary-head Norelco was probably better at shaving a 3- or 4-day old beard, but the Braun has been perfectly fine for daily or every-other-day use.  It runs on two AA batteries and I was glad to find that it works just as well on rechargeable AAs and gets about the same number of shaves on a charge that my Norelco did.  Keeping a second set of batteries in my charger (or if I&#x27;m caught on a trip, dropping in a pair of disposables) means that I don&#x27;t have to hunt for an electrical outlet in order to shave.         The Braun has a built-in trimmer which, because of its size, I expected to be relatively useless:  it&#x27;s only about a half-inch wide and slides out a half-inch from the body of the shaver.  The Norelco&#x27;s, by contrast, was both larger and extended farther.  Again, I was wrong:  the Braun&#x27;s trimmer is effective and easy to use and, unlike that on the Norelco, has never nicked my skin.  An odd characteristic is that the trimmer slides out easily but requires a stiff push to retract.         The built-in cover protects the shaving head when closed and swings open to unlock the on/off switch.  It&#x27;s an elegantly simple design.  The razor also comes with a cleaning brush that clips into the bottom.  The brush is really too small and when the shaver head is exposed, the cover blocks access to the brush; it&#x27;s the only aspect of this design which seems awkward.  The razor does not come with a case and probably doesn&#x27;t need one.  It does come with two AA alkaline batteries.  I&#x27;d suggest getting a battery charger and a set of rechargeable AAs.  Anyone buying this to replace an older razor might hang on to the old case and the cleaning brush as well.         In short, the simple, functional design of this little razor has won me over completely; I&#x27;ve had it for half a year, it hasn&#x27;t skipped a beat, and I still like it.  Braun calls it a travel razor; right now, it&#x27;s my only razor.  I had no major complaints about the series of expensive razors that preceded it, but this is just, all things considered, a better razor.  I have given up looking for another expensive razor and have ordered a second Braun 370 to keep in my desk at work.    - - -    This little gem is still available from Amazon, which surprises me, because I worry that sooner or later Braun is going to decide that it&#x27;s stealing sales from the company&#x27;s more expensive razors and pull it off the market.  Currently, Braun calls this a model P-70 but it appears to be identical to the 370.  Even the packaging is the same.  (A P-70 was also a World War II aircraft but as far as I am aware, that P-70 is not available from Amazon.)    It&#x27;s been nearly a year since I first posted the remarks above on this razor and it&#x27;s still buzzing away on rechargeable AA batteries.  It hasn&#x27;t missed a beat, I still like it, and it&#x27;s still my only electric razor.    Two additional comments:    &gt;&gt; Braun calls this a \\&quot;fully washable\\&quot; travel razor.  All I&#x27;ve ever done is remove the foil head and blow the hair out of the mechanism.  I&#x27;ve never washed it, fully or otherwise.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it out with the brush once or twice and once I oiled it.  It still works great.    &gt;&gt; The manufacturer probably does not intend the razor to be knocked off a counter onto a tile floor as I did once.  The foil screen popped out of the shaver head and it took me nearly a minute to set the screen back on the four pins that held it in place.  It still works great, but that&#x27;s not an exercise I would recommend.    I stand by everything I said a year ago.  I&#x27;ve had my 370 a year and a half and it&#x27;s still a great little razor.</li>
            <li> Its a decent deat for $10 especially since its washable. But if you miss a couple of days of shaving (like the weekend), don&#x27;t expect it to do a very good job getting \\&quot;long\\&quot; hairs. Since it flips into a case I expected it to contain all the loose hairs inside. Instead, it leaked them out all over things in my travel case. Also, if you use it a couple of times and don&#x27;t clean expect to be cleaning your clothes too since during operation everthing inside tends to vibrate out. The trimmer is horrible. Its very small and curved so it was very difficult to trim my moustache quickly. One great feature is that it won&#x27;t turn on unless its flipped open for use; so no worries at the airport. That and it holds its own cleaning brush. Spend some money and get a real razor.</li>
            <li> This Braun razor does an amazingly good job.  It is probably not a good choice for your main razor or for shaving every day:  the shaving head is just too small for that.  But as a second razor or for occasional use, it&#x27;s pretty near to perfect.    I have a heavy beard, and I normally shave with a blade.  But even so, there are days when I could use a \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; by the afternoon.  So I keep one of these in my office to use before a big meeting, and I now leave a second one in my gym bag. They really help if I am going out after work or going to the gym.     You can definitely get a close shave with the Braun 370, although it may take longer than it would with a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; electric shaver or a blade.  And it uses AA batteries rather than rechargeables.  That makes it fine for occasional use, but it would be expensive if you needed to use it everyday. On the other hand, I took the Braun 370 on my last vacation, and the AA batteries easily lasted for two weeks&#x27; worth of shaves while I was away.  It was much better than carrying a blade razor and shaving cream (and the shaving cream would be confiscated at the airport these days if you leave it in your carry-on bag).     There are probably better electrics out there, but they are bigger and heavier, and they cost at least 5 times as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Did OK in a pinch.  I have a tough beard to shave and I have to repeat shaving 2-3 times, but it did finally work sufficiently.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE SHAVER IS A DYNAMO!  I LOVE IT.  IT IS SMALL, HANDY, DOES THE JOB, AND THE PRICE IS ABSOLUTELY A GIFT.  DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT!</li>
            <li> I almost never take the time to write reviews for products.  I am blade shaver, but there are times when using an electric razor is just more convenient.  For those times, this inexpensive razor does a very good job.  The batteries seem to last forever.</li>
            <li> Im an over the road truck driver and a road trip biker, I need a small compact razor that fits into my shaving kit is easy to use and tough enough to stand the abuse of ridding around for thousands of miles in heavy trucks and motorcycle saddle bags.   For more then 30 years Braun razors have met the challange and given me good service.   The Braun P70 is my third Braun (2-AA) battery operated razor.   My last Braun was more then 15 yrs old before it quit working and a tough unit it was indead.  I am very pleased with the improvements made to the P70 over my older models. The P70 is a more substantial unit and address the problem the old one had of accidently being turned on while being jared around in my vehicles. This can&#x27;t happen with the P70 as when the swing cover is in place it locks the off/on control. The head on the P70 is also a stronger unit then the one on my older model.   I especially like the new modern looks of the P70, it&#x27;s slightly bigger and it has better, tougher feel to it. The head and cutter can also be washed in water, which also lends it&#x27;s self well to backpacking and camping.  This is a quality unit and I reccomend it to any one that want&#x27;s a compact razor that can stand up to rough treatment, run for longer then you can believe on a set of good batteries and give a quality shave.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting anything with this purchase.  One of those things where it would be ok to lose, and not lose money.  However, I actually feel like I should buy another for backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this shaver will exceed your expectations as well.  The portability, the convenience, the design, quality, and more importantly, the function.  I am a razor guy.  But there are rare times I don&#x27;t have time  for that.  So I just wanted a dry shaver backup... however, you can get this thing wet, take it apart and wash it etc.  No wires.  Two AA batteries.  No case, with a sliding foil cover.  And the simple setting of \\&quot;on\\&quot;.  It shaves close, and does it well.  How long it will last, I have no idea.  Blade replacement?... no clue.  For this price, it does not matter.  Get two.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just incase i forgot to shave at home&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s cheap, I can just leave it in my car without worrying about being stolen and use it incase I came out of home without shaving. Great Value, Great Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheap&lt;br /&gt;2. Trustworthy (Braun product)&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;4. Runs with 2 AA Battery (No need of International Watt Adapter/Converter when used outside of U.S)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bit Noisy, your wife might complain in the morning</li>
            <li> This little shaver is awesome. I bought it for $20 and it shaves extremely close, works extremely well, and have had no complaints yet and probably will not. Love this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little shaver if you only have a day or two&#x27;s growth (depending on your facial hair of course).  I have a reasonably thick growth, and found that anything after a day was impossible to remove consistently with this shaver (hence, I would always used my razor blade).  Otherwise I really like the shaver for the cost and the way it stores.    I&#x27;m glad to have purchased it, but unfortunately it really is only good for a quick clean-up of a relatively short growth.  The trimmer is virtually useless because it is awkward to open, awkward to close, and very awkward to use!    I guess they say that you get waht you pay for, and I think that is true in this case.  So being realistic, it only cost $15.</li>
            <li> This item is most convenient especially the ability to wash the cutting blade daily in the sink but I find it to be less than satsifactory in terms of closeness of shave.  But then  almost all Braun&#x27;s have this same deficiency in my opinion.  The other Braun pocket shaver which is black but also functions on batteries is better in that regard which I also purchased but it cannot be cleaned by water.</li>
            <li> 10 years ago I bought an earlier generation of this shaver. I still have it and it works like it was new. I decided to buy a new one to have in my car for emergencies. I love it.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my car for those days I forget to shave.  Easy to use and works very well.  I normally use a Norelco and the Braun shaves as close as that but not as comfortably.  Very noisy!  Love the cover.  Protects the razor head, you can&#x27;t lose it, prevents it from accidentally turning on, and it doesn&#x27;t need a case.</li>
            <li> This small razor is amazing. I have a top of the line Braun razor as well.  This portable shaves as close as it&#x27;s more expensive sibling with some irritation not present in the higher end model. However, considering its cost this is an amazing value, I use it on all by trips and continue to be amazed at it durability, convenience and effectiveness and I have a tough beard.    I would recommend this to anyone who needs a travel electric razor, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Handy, close shaving, battery powered portable that is great to keep in the car or travel pack. Blades are sharp and give a resectable shave for a unit at this price. A fresh set of batteries will last through a week long vacation but it is wise to keep an extra set. It will even do a decent job hitting that unruly hair that us over 50 get in those places we would rather not have hair; nose and ears.  Does not collect all the shavings like the bigger electrics but it&#x27;s a small inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Cheap enough ($10 ea) where I can leave one at home, one in my truck, one in my commute car, and one in my travel bag, and also one at the gf&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> Simply put this shaver starts off with a bang and two months later peters out with a fizzle. I know  foil screens  don&#x27;t last forever on a shaver but 60 days after I bought this shaver it was already  nicking &amp;  cutting my face up. Do you replace a  foil screen on an inexpensive shaver like this ? ....No....you toss it in the garbage and learn that cheap is expensive.</li>
            <li> This shaver was a gift for my husband, and loves it.  He says it shaves really well for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This little machine is just what I wanted.  It works well, and the batteries lasts quite a while.  It&#x27;s good to have for a travel, and even at home.</li>
            <li> The last couple of years I&#x27;ve used a blade, (the brand that vibrates) because while this may be changing,&lt;br /&gt;many lower-end shavers come with ni-cad batteries that prefer to be drained all the way before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;Which means you buy two or have to burn calories keeping track of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Higher end shavers may use li-ion but since two lower end shavers cost less than one higher end I could never&lt;br /&gt;justify the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun PocketGo P-70 Men&#x27;s Shaver is the best of both worlds, it feels well made and designed by someone&lt;br /&gt;who can think about how things SHOULD work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swapping out batteries on this thing isn&#x27;t just easy, it hints at how this should be handled by every device.&lt;br /&gt;The flip cover for the foil can&#x27;t be lost or dropped, the blade itself gave a close shave,&lt;br /&gt;and like I said before it has a solid feeling. Not heavy like a brick, but not flimsy or chintzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem I&#x27;m having at the moment is a quandary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing seems like it should last for years, but at these prices how can I not buy a spare?</li>
            <li> The Braun P-70 has all the inherent advantages and deficiencies of an electric shaver vs. razor blade. Have a hair the foil won&#x27;t get, hit it with the trimmer. Hint: Turn the P-70 off, extend the trimmer, turn the P-70 back on. The advantage of the P-70 is that it uses AA batteries, not a built-in battery pack. You can get fresh AA&#x27;s literally anywhere. Better yet, you can use rechargables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weakness of ANY battery powered shaver is the decreased head speed as the battery discharges. The shaver goes from cutting the hairs, to pulling the hairs, to grabbing the hairs. Rechargables can be kept to max charge after each shave. BUT, max charge is only 1.2 volts so you are always starting slower than disposables. Until now. The new NiZn rechargable AA&#x27;s are 1.6 volts (and come out of the charger at 1.85). This gives the shaver a very fast, very clean cutting speed. The blades on the head will dull and the foil over the blades will wear out with use. And the electric motor will wear out quicker with the higher voltage. I&#x27;m betting that the head and foil wear out before the motor and you have to replace the entire $18 unit anyway. This only makes economic sense if you use rechargables for all your AA needs. But, you already KNOW that you should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for quite a while now and I have not had any problem with it at all.  It gives a great shave and is easy on the batteries.  It has a fold out trimmer and a snap-off cleaning brush.  It has a screen protector that rotates up when you aren&#x27;t using it that protects the screen and also keeps the unit from being powered on accidentally.  Whenever I am running late for work, which is most days, I get this razor out of my glove box and shave on the way to work.  Even got pulled over by the police once and asked not to shave while driving, but you gotta do what you gotta do!  I recommend this razor for anyone on the go!</li>
            <li> My (30 year old) travel Norelco broke and I needed a replacement. I saw this cheap, compact, neat-looking unit and figured the worst that could happen was wasting eighteen bucks. Surprise! This is a beautiful razor! Well made, good heft, clever cover and switch, shaves very close. The trimmer is tiny but perfect for those little repairs when you are on the road. I haven&#x27;t had to replace the two AA batteries yet -- they last quite a while. If you want longer life you can use lithiums or rechargeables. The foil comes off easily for cleaning and you just rinse out the cutters (never use a brush on the foil). All in all, a razor that is perfectly designed for its intended purpose (travel).</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same shaver that I have used daily for about 5 years. I think I just wore the last one out. Go figure ,20 bucks for a new one over 5 years,I&#x27;ll probably be writting another review in about another 5 years. Great product,quality name.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for almost three years and have found it very kind to my tender face. It takes a long time to shave close and it does not like long whiskers.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  This does not shave well, and the cover over the blades is flimsy which, means if you drop the shaver it&#x27;ll break.  I recently bought a battery-powered Norelco, and it is a much better buy at only a slightly higher price.</li>
            <li> This shaver may be OK for your 14 year-old nephew, but for a man with a heavy beard, it is inadequate, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for a year now.  It still is in good condition and mechanically works well.  It is very well designed to protect the foil and be kept clean.   Unfortunately for me I have very heavy facial hair.  This razor just can not give me a clean shave under any circumstance.   I had a Titanium Turbo for a year before this razor and was very satisfied with its ability to cut my tougher than average beard.   I am very disapointed with this razors ability to provide me with a clean shave.  The best it can do is leave me looking patchy if I use it twice a day.   I would have gave it one or no stars but it is too well designed and built to deserve that sort of flame.   I would only recomend this to someone who has a light beard.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a self powered shaver to bring with me on my travels and camping.  After reviewing all the ones I found available, I chose the Braun shaver. One reason is the name Braun, I have a Braun coffee maker that has lasted over 20 years.  Once I tried this shaver, I found that it did everything I needed it to do. It&#x27;s compact, it has a cover you can&#x27;t lose, and it uses AA batteries that you can get anywhere.  The trimmer is a little small but it works. You can wash it.  And that&#x27;s nice.  Great for all around used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after trying a $15 model that worked but the head kept coming apart.  I have been extremely satisfied with the Braun and use it every day.  Good shave and no irritation.  Better than the $100 Norelco I bought and gave to my son because it didn&#x27;t shave as well as I wanted.  He couldn&#x27;t use it because his beard is even tougher than mine.  For the money, the Braun is a great buy and you can get replacement heads so it will last.  No rechargable batteries that have questionable life.  All around great deal.</li>
            <li> This is what my husband says about this product: \\&quot;I like it! It&#x27;s compact, has an &#x27;off&#x27; locking mechanism (won&#x27;t accidentally turn on in my luggage), close and smooth shave, feels good in my hand, and a trimmer is included.\\&quot; He uses this shaver for everyday use since he enjoys it so much. However, this product is available at Walgreens for a cheaper price than what I bought it for here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these types of pocket shavers before and this one is vastly improved from older models. However, it is intended to be a touch-up shaver, not really a daily-use one. It is a bit slower than a rechargeable and will miss long or heavy beard growth. The batteries last longer than I would have expected. It&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver before my vacation based on the positive reviews. It arrived on-time (thanks Amazon!) and it performs great. It is very portable, has the cover built-in, can be used dry or wet, runs on regular 2 AA batteries, and surprisingly for its size (and price) gives a very comfortable and clean shave. I actually switched to DE razors but I still keep (and use) this little shaver for times when I need a quick shave or something to take with me on a trip. I tried several expensive electric razors before and honestly, this one out performs them and costs 1/3 of what I paid for them. Great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best battery-powered pocket shaver I&#x27;ve found for less the twenty shekels.    I bought a second one because I keep two travel kits ready to go. Works great for back-to-back trips.    The trimmer is a big plus. Plenty of go on a set of AAs.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in an electric razor.  Battery operated, so you can bring it anywhere, easy to clean, and it does a very fine job with the shaving.  Oh, and the price is reasonable.  What more can one ask?</li>
            <li> For a cheap but very good product nothing can beat this shaver.  Closer shave than most expensive ones plus that it can travel everywhere and anywhere.</li>
            <li> This shaver is.......ok. That&#x27;s the best that can be said about it. It&#x27;s only \\&quot;amazing\\&quot;, etc. if you don&#x27;t mind spending about 20 minutes with it while it tries again and again to cut the same few hairs over and over and over. I could shave with a razor and shaving cream three or four times while this things tries to get the job done. It&#x27;s fine if you just want to control the stubble a bit but if you need a clean, proper shave you will not get it with this.</li>
            <li> I normally use a blade and, when on trips over 1 week, do take a blade and shaving gel.  However, I got this for 2-4 day getaways.  It gives an (IMHO) acceptable shave.  Not usually using an electric or being used to one, it seems my face takes a little more heat when I am done using the Braun instead of a blade, but nothing bad.  It is easy to throw this into the travel bag as the flip top protects the blades.  Clean up is easy with the snap in brush and running the head under water.  At first, it was a little hard to open the battery compartment (as I take them out when the shaver is in storage) but that got easier after a few openings.  Not sure about frequent use, but for a few days, it has my vote!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s cheap, but it&#x27;s cheap with a reason. God, it can hurt your skin so badly, I really don&#x27;t understand why it could get so many 5&#x27;s. Trust me, don&#x27;t even think, stay away this shaver. I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> This thing has little bitty holes in the screen instead of slots.  The whiskers have to go through the holes to get cut.  Try threading a hair through a needle.  It might cut short stubble OK, but it just won&#x27;t cut a three day growth of my graying blond beard at all.  No how, no way.  Run the thing across your face until it&#x27;s raw, ain&#x27;t gonna happen.  I suppose I could shave three or four times a day and it might work, but I am retired and don&#x27;t have any reason or motivation to do that.  For 20 years I wore a full face beard and didn&#x27;t shave, just mowed every few months.  If I could find a decent shaver I might shave twice a week maybe, just to get around the \\&quot;toothpaste in the beard\\&quot; problem.  This thing won&#x27;t do the job for me.  Too bad, it&#x27;s a nice widget otherwise.  Sure wish it worked for me.</li>
            <li> This razor has good battery life and shaves as well as any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. However, if you have arthritis or other hand/grip problems, you may find this razor difficult to use. The on/off slide button is flat and difficult to move.  The trimmer is very small and slides out perpendicular to the side of the razor.  It&#x27;s difficult to slide in and out and awkward to use.  There is a small cleaning brush in the base--a nice touch; but, again, difficult to get a grip on to slide it out.  Finally, although it&#x27;s washable, the instructions tell you to coat the shaving screen with a light machine oil or cooking oil after each washing.   Unless you normally travel with a bottle of Wesson Oil, that&#x27;s an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive shaver. I got it for my husband who is now in hospice care and has difficulty with shaving. This Braun shaver comes in very handy in keeping him groomed. It&#x27;s not the closest shave, but it&#x27;s very adequate for the small price I paid.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand how the designers, who obviously put so much though into this thing, let it come to market while this ineffective. Honestly, you could not shave a balloon with this thing. It feels solid and well built, it has great features (battery power, size, water-proof, built in trimmer, built in foil guard/lock, built in cleaning brush) but you could get a better shave if you clicked you heels together and wished for your facial hair to fall out. I don&#x27;t even have thick facial hair and this thing is useless. I do not understand how it got so many great reviews...it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Super handy. I keep the batteries out, so they are always fresh. Super clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver to pack in my suitcase for travel.  It does get nice and close for a long lasting shave.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who thinks the new Braun pocket travel shaver is inferior to the old Braun Pocket Twist model?!?!?!  the shave is not as close.    I saw this new model in Hong Kong while traveling on business.  I thought what the heck I&#x27;ve had the older model for a few years now and its time to get the newer, more modern looking unit.  I used the old unit (which I&#x27;ve had 3 of them over 12+ years) and left it on the bathroom counter on purpose as I checked out.  Flew home to the USA, opened the new packaged unit and tried it.  Boy, what a disappointment.  At that moment I was hoping I had packed the old unit in my toiletry kit when I checked out of the hotel.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel about a year ago.  This is a very frustrating product to use.  You have to go over the same places again and again and again, and it still misses hairs.  I finally gave up a bought a different razor.</li>
            <li> Seller did a good job getting the product to me.  The shaver is garbage.  Before finishing my travels I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I knew that this was an inexpensive travel razor, and that I shouldn&#x27;t have high hopes, but I am disappointed with its performance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it is well designed for travel, has a nice safety lock in a closed position to keep it from turning on, cleans fairly easily, and has a good battery life for its two batteries. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, for my thicker-haired beard (which admittedly has foiled most every foil head electric razor), the fine foil holes in the cutting surface is not nearly wide enough to admit my whiskers for chopping.  It has all the effect of rubbing a roll-on deodorant on my face as far as hair removal goes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give the clipper on the side average marks as well.  While it is good for trimming down sideburns and working on the &#x27;stache, it doesn&#x27;t stick out far enough from the side to keep from getting the foil shaver portion buzzing and tickling against your face, at least not for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is one of those \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; moments.  The reason it gets three stars and not two is its acceptably low price point.  For a quick shave or touch up that might take some people with thinner hairs at least down to five o&#x27;clock shadow whisker length, this is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> A great item at a great price.  Finally, a tiny electric shaver for travel, camping, adventures, wherever.  Main benefit:  no charger or power cords to worry about &amp; no need to make sure it&#x27;s charged.  Just throw in a couple plain AA batteries &amp; it&#x27;s good to go, no matter where you happen to be.</li>
            <li> Nothing equals a razor shave. Period. But with a musician&#x27;s schedule there are times when I have to grab a quick shave en route to a gig. With a tough beard and sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve had more than my share of uncomfortable experiences using electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the trick is to keep the skin as taut as possible, while moving the shaver in a circular motion WITH VERY LITTLE PRESSURE. The result is two-fold: the whiskers aren&#x27;t flattened against the skin (allowing a closer shave on fewer passes) and irritation is significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little shaver looked a bit flimsy at first. Looks can be deceiving: I&#x27;ve bounced this thing around from job to job &amp; it still works like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which reminds me: I gotta grab a quick shave before I head out. See you later!</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a blade for many years.  Recently my job began requiring much longer days and I frequently found myself sporting quite a shadow with no opportunity to lather up.  As a result I bought this Braun and tossed it in my bag, figuring at the worst I&#x27;d be out a few bucks.  As it turns out, its a nice little razor.  Using it as I do it doesn&#x27;t have to cut a full day&#x27;s growth of beard, only a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  But it does that well, with none of the neck irritation I remember from other electrics.  The design is remarkably well thought out, it is very compact and travels well.  Since mine has only light duty I can&#x27;t comment on battery life (still on the originals) or how it performs as a primary shaver.  However, for the guy on the go it does great.  Not much bigger than a PDA, it fits great in a suitcase or glovebox.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Review after review praising this shaver, people running out to buy extras, and it not only destroyed my face but wouldn&#x60;t cut half the hairs. It will take weeks to heal. And I have a light beard, the kind many said this shaver is suited for. So I bought this double head foil Eltron at the drug store for $10 and go figure, it gives a decent shave with a fraction of the irritation...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 other models of this shaver for many years.  They have worked flawlessly and I still use them.  I find that it takes a little longer to get that smooth feel, but the convenience and price make up for this. I have one at the office, one in each car, and one at home. I haven&#x27;t tried this one in the shower (my others aren&#x27;t waterproof) but it is a feature that some people might like.  For the price, this is the best little shaver around!</li>
            <li> The price tells it all. It simply doesn&#x27;t give a good shave. About the same as my dull Norelco shaving heads. Don&#x27;t expect to get the same quality shave as you will get with a more expensive model. Even my Remington, which was given to me on my graduateion from high school in 1955 (yes, 1955) gave a comparable shave.</li>
            <li> My husband used this shaver while we traveled all over Europe. No worry about different electric currents.  Batteries are the same the  world over.</li>
            <li> Small, close shave and works on 2AA so you do not need to worry about running out of power or having to carry yet another charger.    Trimmer is small, but its the price you pay for a compact shaver. I like the built in cleaning brush</li>
            <li> This is not fancy but it does it&#x27;s job.  Ideal for travel because it is small, easy to clean, has no annoying cord to keep track of, and is inexpensive.  If you lose it you&#x27;re not losing something you will regret because of the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice foil shaver, which happens to run on AAA batteries.  The pop-up (actually slide out) trimmer is a little awkward to use until you get used to it, since it sticks out from the side.  My husband uses it in our RV where we may not have 120 volts for a corded shaver or charger, and its compact size and light weight are also advantages.</li>
            <li> Purrs like a tiger and seems to last longer on batteries than the Braun instructions indicate, but for me it will go over the same wisker 10 times before it finally gets caught in the foil and pulled in. But for the price just impossible to complain about that too much. Great design and mobility...</li>
            <li> My youngest son, a US Marine stationed in Irag, needed a shaver that was battery powered, light but sturdy,  and that could do a nice job on his light beard once a day.  Looked at many brands, checked spec&#x27;s,  purchased the Braun 370,  and shipped it to him. He got it, gave it a test run (as did many of his squad-platoon), and he loved it. They asked for many more and I shipped same. Cost per unit great: under $20 @. Two batteries will do 50 shaves. Only drawback I found was that it is not for anyone with a \\&quot;heavy, tough, daily growth\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad and he loves this shaver. It shaves pretty well and it is pretty hand since it is cordless and runs on batteries.</li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s not as small as I thought it would be, and is a little noisier than my norelco, but the features in this thing are great, very well thought out and good for traveling, its intended purpose. But I like it so much, I am using it as my main razor.</li>
            <li> I expected a shaver that would actually \\&quot;shave\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t. I tried it out and it barely scraped the surface of my stubble. Maybe I misunderstood its purpose and it was meant only for removing the odd tiny bit of hair here and there. Even so, calling it a shaver is very misleading as it simply doesn&#x27;t shave. Fortunately it was not too expensive, but I think you are better off paying a few more bucks and getting a proper shaver</li>
            <li> I have been having problems shaving ever since I joined the Navy at age 18. Having course, curly facial hair, I constantly had to deal with painful ingrown hairs and irritation.  So, over the next 12 years, I ended up tried just about everything from top of the line Disposables, expensive safety and straight razors and even laser hair removal. But nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;I have also had my share of electric shavers and clippers. Over the years, I&#x27;ve grown disappointed with the quality of electric shaves. They either didn&#x27;t cut all of the hair, which lead to ingrown hairs or really irritated my face, which lead to ingrown hairs :(&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews about the PocketGo p-70 and after seeing the price of it, I&#x27;d figured that I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, this little, inexpensive shaver gives me the best shave that I ever had. Granted, I had to train my face, such as removing all of the current ingrown hairs that I had and using a facial scrub to help remove all of the harden skin, from razor shaving, off of my face. Note: being that my facial skin was hard, my facial hair difficulty breaking the surface and with either lay flat against my face or curl back under. I also used a electric eyebrow shaver to the trim the hairs that were too long for the razor to cut. After doing this for about a week, my face has completely cleared up and with no signs of irritation. I use the razor, as my primary shaver, everyday and would highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> okay shaver but dropped it once and stopped working.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased for under $20 in 2008 to introduce my child with special needs to the world of shaving.  Child has major sensory issues as well as intellectual disability, so the need was for something safe, easy to use and that would not cause sensory overload.    This shaver fit all the criteria and has lasted through multiple use/abuse on a daily basis-until today-three years later(The foil has split on one corner).  More importantly, this shaver enabled my child to become independent in shaving within a very short time.  I plan on purchasing another Braun Pocket To Go albeit at pricing more reflective of true value.  As has been noted elsewhere, this razor goes for a long time before needing battery replacement.  We used rechargable batteries.  Do not expect this shaver to get all the coarse or dense hairs that a straight razor does.  It is great for travel &amp; maintenance shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this electric razor for several years now and I have no complaints whatsoever. I&#x27;ve used it in the shower, car, home, vacation, etc. etc. One set of batteries usually lasts me at least 3 weeks using this device and this is with me using it for about 5 minutes every day. It&#x27;s small, portable and it works very well. Get it!</li>
            <li> This has been the absolute best shaver.  Batteries last forever, the shave is very close, and the cutter and foil have lasted far longer than competing products.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the quality and performance of this little unit.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for my desk and briefcase.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for hubby in Dec 09. He&#x27;s been using it this whole time and traveling with it as part of his carry-on luggage so it has seen a lot of use and a lot of miles. It is now Nov 2014 and requesting a new one because this one, though still working, it getting a bit rough. I&#x27;d say we got our money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> good portability, but rough on skin</li>
            <li> This battery-operated shaver shaves as well as my new Norelco rotary razor that retails for about $100 more.  The Braun gives a great, quick shave and is incredibly easy to use.  I keep mine in my desk drawer at work and plan on buying another for my travelling shave kit, since it&#x27;s much smaller and lighter than my regular Norelco razor.  My only complaint is that it does not do well with long hairs (e.g., I had difficulty shaving a 3-day beard with it).  That being said, for ocassional touch-up or regular use (with 1-day beard growth), it certainly can&#x27;t be beat at this price -- given that it costs less than just the replacement blades alone for a corded/rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li> This one is very good and handy for all travel purpose. If you are a frequent traveler then I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> A shaver for $10.99...I expected it to be a piece of junk...It works as good as my $99.00 Norelco.  I keep it in my car for those days when a miss a spot or two...lol...nearly every day...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for our son who was deloyed to Afghanistan. it works great. He saved up a 3 day beard to test it out and it worked great. Very compact and light. A must have for those Warriors who can&#x27;t get the cream and razors out in bad conditions.</li>
            <li> I buy this to replace my old Braun shaver (bought 7 years ago and still working well, but lost a few weeks ago). Sharp and quick. Very convenient to clean. Excellent Buy with tight budget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for a gift, so not used the product yet but the service was exceptionaly good, I recieved it much before the schedule date and it is exactly the same as shown on web!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after my old battery powered Remington wore out.  I was looking for something that would allow me to touch-up shave and that I could leave in my gym bag.  The ability to shave in the shower is a real bonus and does improve the closeness of the shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is such a great bargain for $12.98, that I bought three more to give as gifts.  I typically pay more money for a pack of razor blades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to purchase at this price.</li>
            <li> I bought 2, one for me, and one for my 14 year old son.  Both of us are very pleased with the razor.  I especially like the the flip-over cover which can&#x27;t get lost.  The screen and blade are much better than what you would expect at this price.  I keep it in my briefcase, it is perfect when I&#x27;m working late and want to get rid of five-o&#x27;clock shadow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I own an earlier version of this shaver also, still working fine, but the newer version does give a better shave.</li>
            <li> My old shaver failed. On a lark while shopping for my next electric, I purchased one of these. Amazing buy. Cheaper than the refill kit for a Braun 360, and you can wash it with hot water.  I love the thing.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well built and intelligently thought out.  I did not want to bring my $100 big heavy recent make Panasonic wet/dry shaver with accessory charger and cord when I made trips so I was researching all kinds of alternatives including disposable razors.    Because of the way this shaver is designed, you can travel without an extra case, without the cumbersome charger, and it even has a cleaning brush built in.  I find the single foil allows me to shave without shaving cream, something else I don&#x27;t have to bring.  However, if you would like to shave this way, the unit is waterproof!    When the unit is closed for travel, it can&#x27;t accidentally turn on in your travel luggage and leave you with an un-powered unit when you desperately need a shave.  And you can be on any length trip as long as you can get a pair of AAs, you have a shaver ready to rock and roll!    The shave is fantastic.  I think it&#x27;s about the same as my $100 unit (maybe better) and I am in pure shock because I bought this unit from Amazon for $11.99.  No kidding.  If the shave sucked, I would be the first to tell you.  I just take my time, don&#x27;t jam the razor into my face, and shave carefully and slowly like I would with a blade.  And the results are more than satisfactory for me.    When this unit dies, I will buy another one.  I highly recommend this unit.  Yes, I know it&#x27;s insane, how can something so unbelievably cheap be getting such rave reviews, but it&#x27;s all true.  This travel shaver is a GEM.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having a smaller electric for travel. And the swivel design that protects the screen is a nice innovation. I always take this on trips, leaving my bulkier Norelco at home.    I also own an earlier model of this shaver-about 3 years old--and it gives a closer shave. But the shave provided by this model is close enough.    My main gripe is the lack of a built-in rechargeable battery. Disposable AA cells are expensive, and rechargeable AA&#x27;s are less convenient than simply being able to plug in the shaver or place it in a dock.    If this shaver had a rechargeable built-in battery, it would definitely earn a 5-star rating. Until then, I&#x27;ll consider it \\&quot;average.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two and I&#x27;m ordering a third right now.  Great price when you compare to the rechargables.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several shavers...rechargeable, cord etc.  This one not only shaves just as close as the others, I use high capacity rechargeable batteries in it, and so far, two weeks later I&#x27;m still shaving everyday. Great design and I like the idea that the cap is attached to the shaver...no more losing cap.  Since most of the time the cap gets lost during travel, while it&#x27;s in your bag, and that&#x27;s how the head stands to get damaged. I canned the other expensive rechargeables since the battery often will not last the amount it claims to last, and now you have a $80 - 100 shaver that&#x27;s useless since it will no longer hold a charge.  Cleaning on this shaver is very simple, just follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver for travel and it does a great job - sometimes I think it&#x27;s better than my full-size Braun.  It&#x27;s definitely better than all the other electric full-sized shavers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I use the shaver to shave my face and head.  I have a mohawk with thick hair.  I have light facial hair growth but THICK, COARSE, and rapid scalp growth.  This single foil shaver simply gets the job done. If you can shave with an electric razor (some dudes can&#x27;t) then this one will get the job done for you.  It is waterproof and easy to clean.  I originally purchased this for travel use but now use it daily for over a month now.    Pros: you can use your own rechargeable batteries.  I use 2000mah AA NiMH and the charge lasts over a week for shaving both face AND scalp (minus the strip down the middle).  This is more shaving time during a week than most men will use. I can imagine getting 2 weeks of shaving on a charge if only shaving the face alone.  Alkaline batteries also work well, however the lower voltage rechargeable batteries still provide the power to shave smoothly.      Cons:  There seems to be no replacement foil or blade assemblies for this shaver...but at the cost they are selling the whole shaver I can see why.   The only other deficit is a the crudeness of the trimmer...however my other shaver, a high end rechargeable Braun, is not much better.    I will buy this shaver again.</li>
            <li> I CAN NOT BELIEVE AN \\&quot;AA\\&quot; BATTERY OPERATED RAZOR CAN GIVE YOU SUCH A CLOSE SHAVE. THIS IS ONE HECK OF AN ITEM. NOT ONLY DO I USE IT FOR TRAVELING...BUT FOR EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> and then I bought one for myself and it&#x27;s been a good value so far but it might be wearing out; however, I plan on getting another soon to replace it for when it finally breaks down.</li>
            <li> Worked 4 times then head broke due to flimsy construction. Braun site had no replacement head. Typical modern day made-to-break junk then they want you to purchase another. This cost me $6 per shave. Braun buyer beware.</li>
            <li> For travel the design is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It fits very well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;Uses batteries that we can get anywhere in the world.&lt;br /&gt;However this thing couldn&#x27;t shave the bum fluff off a teenager.  Used it once and it now gathers dust waiting to be thrown in the trash.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my partner, who previously used only disposable razors.  He is very satisfied with it.  Excellent value.  I may buy him another to keep in our weekend get-away place.</li>
            <li> I have only used it as a dry shaver but it performs well.  The trimmer is handy, and it does a respectable job on my face.  I don&#x27;t use it every day because I am a blade shaver but it will do the job as well as any more expensive electric I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift and the recipient is quite pleased with the \\&quot;PocketGo\\&quot; Men&#x27;s Shaver.</li>
            <li> The model P-70 Braun is an upgrade from the Model 370.  Both are pocket size, excellent shavers, great for travel and inexpensive to buy.  Get an extra for your car, etc.</li>
            <li> I use to use lather and a safety razor but my skin was always raw and I could only shave every other day until I discovered electric shavers.  Braun makes the best razors but they are expensive.  I found the early version of P-70 in a bin at Wal-Mart for $17 so I bought two.  When these wore out - the foil that touches you face will go before the razor will but a replacement will cost you more than a new razor complete - I bought ten more on line to save on shipping.  I put them everywhere - one in my car, one in my knap sack etc. That version had a trimmer that slid up and was perfect for the hairs you always miss on your neck.  This newer version looks decidedly better but the trimmer slides sideways, not up, and is a pain to use - a definite step backwards - but I got two with free shipping for $15 each and am happy to have them.  It runs on batteries and you can use it anywhere.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving since 1953 With out a doubt, this 10.00 shaver has given me,the most comfortable, and closest shaves I have ever had  in the last 54 years. How can this be?&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE....As of April 23 2010 nothing has changed. It still after over a year,gives me the same close shaves as when I first purchased it. I have since then , purchased another 2 dozen to give as gifts and keep several for myself as well. How can they make something so good for this price? Go Figure.&lt;br /&gt;  \\&quot; UPDATE \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;As of Nov 2011, everything is as it was when I first started using it in 09.</li>
            <li> Happy with this electric shaver. It does the job as good or better than the much more expensive shavers. I paid in the past $200-300 for some of them and found them not really better. I had to sell them on ebay with great losses.</li>
            <li> At my University, I am required to be clean-shaven. For someone of my propensity, having this little fella in my bookbag has saved my butt from a bunch of demerits. It isn&#x27;t as clean as a normal shave, but does the trick if you only have one day&#x27;s growth, maybe two. for me the evening of the second day it really gets kinda ragged when I used this. I have recommended this to many a freshman :)</li>
            <li> Portable, waterproof, fairly good shave, and reasonably priced.  Locks out to protect the blade when traveling.  It has replaceable AA batteries that lasts long with each replacement set.  Just be sure to close it completely or the batteries will die.</li>
            <li> This is the second shaver my son has had. He loves it very compact. easy to clean and does not hurt his face being a teen with teen issues this is a plus. As his mother I like the idea of battery&#x27;s. His last one he left charging all the time and the internal battery went bad. This was strong enough for his full face beard.</li>
            <li> I love it!  This little shaver is amazing! Great to throw in your travel bag for the road. The closeness of the shave is hard for me to believe. The shaving head is rather small so it does take a while to shave with this thing. For the money, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Short batterylife as I remember and then the head screen wore thru. Not good quality.</li>
            <li> It works all right, but is slow and can easily miss long hairs. Oh, and I bought two for $20 each. Maybe they&#x27;ve changed it, but it looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a battery-powered shaver for traveling and trekking.  This shaver has provided me great shaves for many years in many remote locations including Kilimanjaro, Switzerland, and hiking the Wonderland Trail around Mt Rainier.  It is also my daily shaver at home.  Two rechargable eneloop batteries last me over 4 weeks of daily shaving at home or on the road.  I replaced the screen after 4 years of use.  I don&#x27;t expect it to fail any time soon, but if it does I will look for this same shaver again.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recomend this one. It is confortable, easy to handle, practical, versatile. I bought two before, and a repeated cuz the first one was broken by my fault. All the parts (screens, blades...) I could find them in the market. I hope to get it forever.</li>
            <li> At $150 this is too expensive and you should get the newer P-90 for $23: [[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun M90 Mobile Shaver, 1 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about the M-90, I absolutely love this shaver. I do not use it for my daily shave except when traveling. I often use it to touch up on the evening or when I am in a rush. It generally does an excellent job and has held up over the last 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Compact design with a nice integrated protective cover&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave&lt;br /&gt;Does not chew my skin up as much as rotary shavers&lt;br /&gt;Has a little pop out trimmer for sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Takes widely available AA batteries that last a long time&lt;br /&gt;Durable (3 years so far and still going)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Often misses longer or curled hairs. Best for short growth.</li>
