            <li>This is the best place to find a replacement for this razor.</li>
            <li>This is a good item and works great.</li>
            <li>Part fit perfect with no issues.  </li>
            <li>but still, it&#x27;s a good item.</li>
            <li>Good items - delivered as promised - good seller</li>
            <li>The cutters were a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>Good replacement head for this model razor.</li>
            <li>perfect fit, quick delivery, good price</li>
            <li>They give a nice shave.</li>
            <li>It was easy to find this part, price was best available, the shipment was very quick.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the great experience.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>better to order 2 or more to have them available</li>
            <li>Good as new!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this replacement shaver head for months now and it works just as well as the original.</li>
            <li>However that looks to be true of every OEM replacement out there.</li>
            <li>Much better performance than my old one.</li>
            <li>These replacement blades with \\&quot;shields and frame\\&quot; snap right into the razor without any fuss.  </li>
            <li>My husbands blades were extremely dull, but the unit still held a charge and was in great condition.</li>
            <li>Spared the expense of a whole new unit and popped these right in.</li>
            <li>Gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Best price and my Remington is cutting like new!</li>
            <li>It had been about a year since I had new shaving blades.</li>
            <li>Basically, the razor works like new again.  </li>
            <li>Really sharp at first, but as with most of this style it gradually loses the keen edge feel.  </li>
            <li>It was a little more than I expected to pay</li>
            <li>It took me longer to open the package than to install the new cutters.  </li>
            <li>Not much else to say about the product, except that I now have a new shaver - another remington.</li>
            <li>was te exact replacement part I needed; took only a few seconds to install and works like a charm,</li>
            <li>Seems to work like it did when new, but not a lot better than it did with the used blades, maybe mine weren&#x27;t too bad yet even though 6 years old.</li>

            <li> Purchased a replacement Remington blade for electric razor.  It was easy to find this part, price was best available, the shipment was very quick.  Part fit perfect with no issues.  Thanks Amazon for the great experience.</li>
            <li> Talk about beating the competition. It is a wonder the factory ever sells replacement parts with the price savings here.</li>
            <li> I love it. It had been about a year since I had new shaving blades. Gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this when one of the heads for my shaver broke off and I need to replace it. This is a good item and works great. It was a little more than I expected to pay but still, it&#x27;s a good item.</li>
