            <li>It is good though.</li>

            <li>I heard good things about this lip balm however it didn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this around my eyes since I couldn&#x27;t find a good eye cream that didn&#x27;t make my eyes burn</li>
            <li>it is soooooooo good</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I was hoping.</li>

            <li>yet, if this will do my lips any good, but it sure tastes good and feels good on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I took the cap off was the scent - a great mix of coconut &amp; pina-colada YUM!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It absorbs real quick, and it smells heavenly!</li>

            <li>I was so fortunate to receive an opportunity to review this great Lip Balm.</li>
            <li>It smells soooo delicious and really nourishes your lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it in my car for handy use, but it is not my &#x27;Go-To&amp;#34; cosmetic.</li>
            <li>lips are in best shape ever~soft,plump and perfect after just a few days after using this balm.</li>
            <li>so I ordered Smiths rose bud &amp; eucalyptus  </li>

            <li>This balm smells very tropical and delicious.</li>
            <li>I received this at a discounted rate for honest review.</li>
            <li>, flavor/scent was nice.</li>
            <li>It smells and tastes great without being too sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and LOVE</li>
            <li>and this was in the suggested products list at the bottom of the screen and decided to add it because I have been wanting a new lip balm and thought that a coconut would be awesome for summer.</li>
            <li>The soft candy is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>The Treat Cocunut Cream Old Fashiioned Jumbo Flavored Lip Balm is the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lip balm out there.</li>
            <li>but I honestly still love my eos</li>
            <li>This is a seriously HUGE lip balm!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came in a seriously HUGE .50 oz size!</li>
            <li>This tastes more like piña colada, not a fan.</li>
            <li>night i love to exfoliate my lips</li>
            <li>/&gt;i simply love it.</li>
            <li>The scent isnt as prominent as i though it would be</li>
            <li>but i still love the smell i could eat it</li>
            <li>I love anything that smells of coconut</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you got</li>
            <li>I could not stop putting it on. :)</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li>I did some research and found out my lips are probably allergic to petroleum and most of the ingredients they use to make lip balms minty (which I love)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>Now I can continue to wear all the matte lipsticks that I love 😃</li>
            <li>Please consider making a man-friendly/pocket-friendly version! :)</li>
            <li>I WAS ABLE TO FIND AN ORGANIC LIP BALM WITH HEALTHY INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already at the point where I have to use my finger to dig out the last remaining remnants of this wonderful lip balm.</li>
            <li>and I love that with such awesome ingredients I don&#x27;t have to worry if she takes a nibble</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to get this on sale!</li>
            <li>I love all things</li>
            <li>Have I mentioned that I love the scent?</li>
            <li>I’ll be buying more whenever this one runs</li>
            <li>My wife just love it...</li>
            <li>It is her favorite lip balm and plans to buy more when she runs out.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened it up, which was immediately, I was in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>but this one wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>but it smells more like a pina colada.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil as a moisturizer and chapstick at night, and thought they must have this in a more convenient lip product form.</li>
            <li>I love the size--it&#x27;s comparable to a glue stick but much more conducive to moistening the lips.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to try more products from treat.</li>
            <li>and I even put it under my eyes if needed :)</li>
            <li>I love the size--</li>
            <li>if only it tasted like it smelled it would be awesome, because after the smell goes away</li>
            <li>Very happy to find this and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>ok thought it wouldve smelled better</li>
            <li>Love anything with coconut oil in it for my lips and face.</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients on it.</li>
            <li>product is ok, glides pretty smooth, but the taste isnt that great...</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; creamy, but nothing to get excited about.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this moisturized my lips for a long time, but it does smell and feel wonderful when you put it on!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its a jumbo size because I can easily find it in my purse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of really nice ingredients, smells great, works a-okay, big, but...</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes my lips very soft and lasted years.</li>
            <li>The size is a huge plus because it has more product.</li>
            <li>I love that the container is huge</li>
            <li>i have tried all my life.&lt;br /&gt;i love to use it because it&#x27;s lightweight,not gloosy,not waxy,no &amp;#34;heavy sticky&amp;#34; feeling at all,&lt;br /&gt;i smooth it on my lips whenever i feel i need</li>
            <li>most importantly....</li>
            <li>so it smears easily over one&#x27;s face even when applied with care from an angle just using an outer edge as one of the reviewers recommended.  </li>
            <li>i also like that it&#x27;s a jumbo size, easy to find in my bag.</li>
            <li>Aside from a very pleasant coconut scent the balm is very light and moisturizes perfectly without leaving an oily, heavy sheen like a lot of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lip balm is by far the best EVER~ all natural and the smell is divine(pina colada)~my</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the coconut cream after trying the marshmallow this one just had a lacking flavor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be buying this product again, even though I liked the size and really wanted it when I bought it.</li>
            <li>It is not yet available for sale through Amazon</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and keeps my lips hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell is fantastic</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Taste is light</li>
            <li>So overall it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic</li>
            <li>far so good that I have ordered another one to gift away.</li>
            <li>but it does feel nice on my lips and smells good too but not really like coconut.</li>
            <li>Mild scent, and four easily discernible</li>
            <li>My new favorite go-to lipbalm!</li>
            <li>First off, it is huge!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i exfoliate my lips with a usual lip exfoliator, and from all the ones i have tried, the best one for me would be (undoubtedly)</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it, but after using it for 2 days I have to say I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to recieve this</li>
            <li>The tube is sooo large and cute.</li>
            <li>it is just right!  </li>
            <li>the bright side, this lip balm is a larger size</li>
            <li>I use this many times a day and do not see it going anywhere anytime fast.</li>
            <li>I love the jumbo size because I don&#x27;t run out as often and they are also so much easier to keep track of.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip balm because it&#x27;s very moisturizing and stays on.</li>
            <li>I love that this uses all natural products and is cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER seen a lip balm this size, so I was VERY interested in seeing how this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the products normally</li>
            <li>Last winter I waited to long to go on the hunt for the best lip balm.</li>
            <li>My two year old daughter calls this her coconut and is in love with this lippie.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>the size of the product is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product since it was all natural, coconut, and in a large cute packaging, but its not as moisturizing as I excepted.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a number of different lip balms on Amazon in one order trying to find one that actually feels good on my lips, smells and tastes good, and actually works without having to reapply it every 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li>sticky or drying (some balms dry the lip area out more than before applied, this one doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;Great for cuticles!</li>
            <li>lip balm is sooo good and comfirting for dry lips, its really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>Apparently they love the scent and taste as much as I do!  </li>
            <li>I liked so much that I ordered a second one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I like them very much; in fact I&#x27;ve purchased several on more than one occasion to replace those that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I was willing to let go of the fact it didn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all-</li>
            <li>They then said that Amazon requires the refund to be handled by the customer contacting Amazon about it even though most refund-guarantee sellers issue an immediate refund without a problem or requiring anything further once notified their product did not work well</li>
            <li>(this actually happens more than I would like).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this lip balm to everybody else who has searched for years to find a lip balm that really works!  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Treat!  </li>
            <li>It really smells like coconut cream!</li>
            <li>overall i like it, but dont love it.</li>
            <li>The flavor tastes exactly like coconut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The feel is smooth &amp; not heavy</li>
            <li>Love it Totally !</li>
            <li>the smell is EXACT).</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it is pretty much the size of a glue stick, it will last me forever!</li>
            <li>Here are a few things that right off the bat I love about this Product !</li>
            <li>The name is &amp;#34;cocokind&amp;#34; &amp; it comes in &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; flavor as well as a scented flavor which I prefer to avoid both because of my chemical sensitivities &amp; also because purer is better especially on one&#x27;s lips as so much absorbs through them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty large</li>
            <li>It will last longer than 4 or 5 normal sized lip balms, easily!  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves my lips feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It was a lot better on my lips, but would still dry out a bit.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to find in my big purse.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to lose &amp; easy to find in my purse :)</li>
            <li>First saw this on my favorite youtube beauty guru Kandee Johnsons page when she was talking about the other flavor/scent.</li>
            <li>the smooth texture cause it sweeps all the dead skin cells away and that means your lipstick will go on totally smooth and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a huge stick and will probably last me all year.</li>
            <li>it gives a Real longlasting moisturized feel to the lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think the Glycerin and coconut oil is what really makes the difference in this</li>
            <li>and I needed a last item to make my order qualify for the free shipping</li>
            <li>Well the lip balm is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>This product will make your lips very moist.</li>
            <li>It leaves a layer of residue on my lips and does not provide much moisture.</li>
            <li>It is REALLY about the size of three lip balms combined.</li>
            <li>Absolutely delish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It says coconut cream, but what it really smells/taste like is pineapple.</li>
            <li>moisturizes really well</li>
            <li>high quality and protected all of our lips!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just light enough that I get a hint of it</li>
            <li>I keep on having to apply over and over and it doesnt seem to sink in that much either</li>
            <li>I just ordered the vanilla buttercream and the pink buttercream lipbalms hopefully those will be better</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend if you like coconut scents!</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of a larger size lip balm- longer lasting, so fewer trips to the store.</li>
            <li>And I love how the ingredients are natural and simple.  </li>
            <li>It is real big, so not too portable but it is so nice to keep in the makeup shelf or next to the bed!</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but it&#x27;s sweet</li>
            <li>JUMBO SIZE ALSO MAKES IT MUCH MORE INCONVENIENT TO USE in that it doesn&#x27;t fit easily in one&#x27;s pocket</li>
            <li>The original flavor feels &amp; stays on great &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have that sweet coconut smell despite organic virgin coconut oil being its main ingredient &amp; organic beeswax being the only other ingredient.et coconut smell despite organic virgin coconut oil being its main ingredient &amp; organic beeswax being the only other ingredient.</li>
            <li>Nothing special especially for the price</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and stays on long.</li>
            <li>The label &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; is understandably popular these days, but I am not sure just what this refers to i.e. cocoa butter, coconut oil, Shea, or all three.</li>
            <li>THAT HAS NONE OF THE ABOVE DRAWBACKS OR THE SWEET SMELL</li>
            <li>You have found a new forever customer!  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes lips very well, and, compared to other popular chapsticks I&#x27;ve tried this outlasts and outperforms them all in terms of reapplication times, quality, and overall fabulousness.</li>
            <li>it is more expensive than most chapsticks, it can literally treat an army of Angelina Jolies.</li>
            <li>, it is super moisturizing and I will definitely repurchase this again!</li>
            <li>It was a little more expensive than your regular chapstick (which now has some pretty good flavors), but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It certainly brings a lot of questions, like where on Earth did I find such a large lip balm?!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for coconut addicts like myself and for anyone with chapped lips, mine are caused by hypothyroidism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this chap stick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>as opposed to the normal sized lip balm of .15 oz.  </li>
            <li>OF ALL, THEIR &amp;#34;100% HAPPINESS GUARANTEE&amp;#34; IS NOT EASY TO COLLECT ON as you have to search to find a way to contact them as that information is not posted on their product page or given through the usual email most companies provide following a purchase.  </li>
            <li>These really have become my favorite lip balms because of their natural and organic ingredients, large size (makes them last long and easier to find in my purse) and they actually work.  </li>
            <li>The softness also makes it smoosh quite rapidly within the tube &amp; also means the MOISTURIZING PROTECTION DOES NOT LAST LONG, REQUIRING WAY MORE FREQUENT APPLICATIONS THAN I&#x27;VE EVER</li>
            <li>Then she got in the new Coconut Cream to review</li>
            <li>The Coconut Cream has a nice, subtle smell of Coconut and tastes like coconut as well.  </li>
            <li>Also the consistency is very soft and buttery greasy to me.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The smell is exact to cream de coco (I&#x27;m a big pina colada drinkers...</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that the circumference of the balm is so large it applies beyond my lips, so instead of applying it like I normally would  </li>
            <li>Wow this lip balm is huge in comparison to an average size balm.  </li>
            <li>The feel is slightly grainy, not the silky smooth that I am used to.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for people who want a high quality lip balm and don&#x27;t mind a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  December, 2012</li>
            <li>and I love that its natural with no harsh chemicals although the scent is hard to detect.</li>
            <li>I use it at night for soft lips while I sleep.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed some natural lip balms need to be reapplied quite often.</li>
            <li>always looking for something natural to put on my face &amp; lips, so this is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t cause any problems.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>And it leaves my lips moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Have tried a few different flavors and love them all.</li>
            <li>Crazy good value when I lose my regular chapstick sized lip balms almost right away.</li>
            <li>(these are so small they are easily lost before the container is empty.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>The fragrance is OK, but too subtle for my taste.</li>
            <li>I love the moisture that it gives my lips without the stickiness of a lip gloss and without drying them out like other lip balms that contain alcohol or other drying agents.</li>
            <li>Treat&#x27;s jumbo lip balms really moisturizer my lips for a long time before needing to reapply!  </li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it is a fairly good lip balm, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad and it really IS jumbo.</li>
            <li>The smell is  like buttercream frosting with a dash of coconut and has a texture that is a nice middle ground of a thick balm and the smooth, slickness of a thin one.  </li>
            <li>Other then getting the wrong scent the product is great.</li>
            <li>It enormous - but to me, that just means it will last FAR longer than those tiny tubes we normally get!</li>
            <li>It seems to “last” longer than other lip balms I’ve used, meaning more moisture and less drying and “chappiness.”</li>
            <li>For others this would probably last a lot longer, but I use mine nearly every day.</li>
            <li>brand barely a week or so</li>
            <li>Nothing more frustrating then bleeding,ripped,and patchy lips.</li>
            <li>it makes it harder to just get it on one&#x27;s lips easily &amp; rapidly as the usual lip balm size naturally</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product and I will be purchasing the other flavor and another one of these too.</li>
            <li>(even our dry climate here)&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a super long time (had my pink one for over a month now with continued use &amp; still have plenty</li>
            <li>I feel ridiculous using the huge one, and it definitely takes up a lot of space in my purse.</li>
            <li>I really cant wait to try the other flavors !!</li>

            <li> It is good though.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>

            <li> I heard good things about this lip balm however it didn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this around my eyes since I couldn&#x27;t find a good eye cream that didn&#x27;t make my eyes burn</li>
            <li> it is soooooooo good</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and feels good, too (not sticky).  </li>
            <li> This lip balm is really good.  </li>
            <li> I recieved it today and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love all treat lip balms, and this one is great for coconut lovers.</li>
            <li> yet, if this will do my lips any good, but it sure tastes good and feels good on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I took the cap off was the scent - a great mix of coconut &amp; pina-colada YUM!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It absorbs real quick, and it smells heavenly!</li>

            <li> This product checks all the boxes...organic, cruelty free, non-drying, great flavor.  </li>
            <li> I was so fortunate to receive an opportunity to review this great Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> It smells soooo delicious and really nourishes your lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it in my car for handy use, but it is not my &#x27;Go-To&amp;#34; cosmetic.</li>
            <li> lips are in best shape ever~soft,plump and perfect after just a few days after using this balm.</li>
            <li> so I ordered Smiths rose bud &amp; eucalyptus  </li>
            <li> balm.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product was recieved at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>

            <li> It works well, has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I LOVE a good lip balm.</li>
            <li> I feel the need to try every kind of lip balm I come across, so of course I needed this one.</li>
            <li> (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> This balm smells very tropical and delicious.</li>
            <li> I received this at a discounted rate for honest review.</li>
            <li> , flavor/scent was nice.</li>
            <li> It smells and tastes great without being too sweet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and LOVE</li>
            <li> and this was in the suggested products list at the bottom of the screen and decided to add it because I have been wanting a new lip balm and thought that a coconut would be awesome for summer.</li>
            <li> The soft candy is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> The Treat Cocunut Cream Old Fashiioned Jumbo Flavored Lip Balm is the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip balm out there.</li>
            <li> but I honestly still love my eos</li>
            <li> This is a seriously HUGE lip balm!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a seriously HUGE .50 oz size!</li>
            <li> This tastes more like piña colada, not a fan.</li>
            <li> night i love to exfoliate my lips</li>
            <li> /&gt;i simply love it.</li>
            <li> The scent isnt as prominent as i though it would be</li>
            <li> but i still love the smell i could eat it</li>
            <li> I love anything that smells of coconut</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you got</li>
            <li> I could not stop putting it on. :)</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and found out my lips are probably allergic to petroleum and most of the ingredients they use to make lip balms minty (which I love)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Now I can continue to wear all the matte lipsticks that I love 😃</li>
            <li> Please consider making a man-friendly/pocket-friendly version! :)</li>
            <li> I WAS ABLE TO FIND AN ORGANIC LIP BALM WITH HEALTHY INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already at the point where I have to use my finger to dig out the last remaining remnants of this wonderful lip balm.</li>
            <li> and I love that with such awesome ingredients I don&#x27;t have to worry if she takes a nibble</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to get this on sale!</li>
            <li> I love all things</li>
            <li> Have I mentioned that I love the scent?</li>
            <li> I’ll be buying more whenever this one runs</li>
            <li> My wife just love it...</li>
            <li> It is her favorite lip balm and plans to buy more when she runs out.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened it up, which was immediately, I was in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> but this one wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> but it smells more like a pina colada.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil as a moisturizer and chapstick at night, and thought they must have this in a more convenient lip product form.</li>
            <li> I love the size--it&#x27;s comparable to a glue stick but much more conducive to moistening the lips.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to try more products from treat.</li>
            <li> and I even put it under my eyes if needed :)</li>
            <li> I love the size--</li>
            <li> if only it tasted like it smelled it would be awesome, because after the smell goes away</li>
            <li> Very happy to find this and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> ok thought it wouldve smelled better</li>
            <li> Love anything with coconut oil in it for my lips and face.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients on it.</li>
            <li> product is ok, glides pretty smooth, but the taste isnt that great...</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; creamy, but nothing to get excited about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this moisturized my lips for a long time, but it does smell and feel wonderful when you put it on!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that its a jumbo size because I can easily find it in my purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of really nice ingredients, smells great, works a-okay, big, but...</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my lips very soft and lasted years.</li>
            <li> The size is a huge plus because it has more product.</li>
            <li> I love that the container is huge</li>
            <li> i have tried all my life.&lt;br /&gt;i love to use it because it&#x27;s lightweight,not gloosy,not waxy,no &amp;#34;heavy sticky&amp;#34; feeling at all,&lt;br /&gt;i smooth it on my lips whenever i feel i need</li>
            <li> most importantly....</li>
            <li> so it smears easily over one&#x27;s face even when applied with care from an angle just using an outer edge as one of the reviewers recommended.  </li>
            <li> i also like that it&#x27;s a jumbo size, easy to find in my bag.</li>
            <li> Aside from a very pleasant coconut scent the balm is very light and moisturizes perfectly without leaving an oily, heavy sheen like a lot of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lip balm is by far the best EVER~ all natural and the smell is divine(pina colada)~my</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the coconut cream after trying the marshmallow this one just had a lacking flavor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be buying this product again, even though I liked the size and really wanted it when I bought it.</li>
            <li> It is not yet available for sale through Amazon</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and keeps my lips hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell is fantastic</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Taste is light</li>
            <li> So overall it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic</li>
            <li> far so good that I have ordered another one to gift away.</li>
            <li> but it does feel nice on my lips and smells good too but not really like coconut.</li>
            <li> Mild scent, and four easily discernible</li>
            <li> My new favorite go-to lipbalm!</li>
            <li> First off, it is huge!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i exfoliate my lips with a usual lip exfoliator, and from all the ones i have tried, the best one for me would be (undoubtedly)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it, but after using it for 2 days I have to say I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this</li>
            <li> The tube is sooo large and cute.</li>
            <li> it is just right!  </li>
            <li> the bright side, this lip balm is a larger size</li>
            <li> I use this many times a day and do not see it going anywhere anytime fast.</li>
            <li> I love the jumbo size because I don&#x27;t run out as often and they are also so much easier to keep track of.  </li>
            <li> I love this lip balm because it&#x27;s very moisturizing and stays on.</li>
            <li> I love that this uses all natural products and is cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER seen a lip balm this size, so I was VERY interested in seeing how this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the products normally</li>
            <li> Last winter I waited to long to go on the hunt for the best lip balm.</li>
            <li> My two year old daughter calls this her coconut and is in love with this lippie.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> the size of the product is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product since it was all natural, coconut, and in a large cute packaging, but its not as moisturizing as I excepted.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a number of different lip balms on Amazon in one order trying to find one that actually feels good on my lips, smells and tastes good, and actually works without having to reapply it every 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li> sticky or drying (some balms dry the lip area out more than before applied, this one doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;Great for cuticles!</li>
            <li> lip balm is sooo good and comfirting for dry lips, its really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> Apparently they love the scent and taste as much as I do!  </li>
            <li> I liked so much that I ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I like them very much; in fact I&#x27;ve purchased several on more than one occasion to replace those that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I was willing to let go of the fact it didn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all-</li>
            <li> They then said that Amazon requires the refund to be handled by the customer contacting Amazon about it even though most refund-guarantee sellers issue an immediate refund without a problem or requiring anything further once notified their product did not work well</li>
            <li> (this actually happens more than I would like).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this lip balm to everybody else who has searched for years to find a lip balm that really works!  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Treat!  </li>
            <li> It really smells like coconut cream!</li>
            <li> overall i like it, but dont love it.</li>
            <li> The flavor tastes exactly like coconut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The feel is smooth &amp; not heavy</li>
            <li> Love it Totally !</li>
            <li> the smell is EXACT).</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it is pretty much the size of a glue stick, it will last me forever!</li>
            <li> Here are a few things that right off the bat I love about this Product !</li>
            <li> The name is &amp;#34;cocokind&amp;#34; &amp; it comes in &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; flavor as well as a scented flavor which I prefer to avoid both because of my chemical sensitivities &amp; also because purer is better especially on one&#x27;s lips as so much absorbs through them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty large</li>
            <li> It will last longer than 4 or 5 normal sized lip balms, easily!  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves my lips feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It was a lot better on my lips, but would still dry out a bit.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to find in my big purse.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to lose &amp; easy to find in my purse :)</li>
            <li> First saw this on my favorite youtube beauty guru Kandee Johnsons page when she was talking about the other flavor/scent.</li>
            <li> the smooth texture cause it sweeps all the dead skin cells away and that means your lipstick will go on totally smooth and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a huge stick and will probably last me all year.</li>
            <li> it gives a Real longlasting moisturized feel to the lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think the Glycerin and coconut oil is what really makes the difference in this</li>
            <li> and I needed a last item to make my order qualify for the free shipping</li>
            <li> Well the lip balm is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This product will make your lips very moist.</li>
            <li> It leaves a layer of residue on my lips and does not provide much moisture.</li>
            <li> It is REALLY about the size of three lip balms combined.</li>
            <li> Absolutely delish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says coconut cream, but what it really smells/taste like is pineapple.</li>
            <li> moisturizes really well</li>
            <li> high quality and protected all of our lips!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just light enough that I get a hint of it</li>
            <li> I keep on having to apply over and over and it doesnt seem to sink in that much either</li>
            <li> I just ordered the vanilla buttercream and the pink buttercream lipbalms hopefully those will be better</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend if you like coconut scents!</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a larger size lip balm- longer lasting, so fewer trips to the store.</li>
            <li> And I love how the ingredients are natural and simple.  </li>
            <li> It is real big, so not too portable but it is so nice to keep in the makeup shelf or next to the bed!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but it&#x27;s sweet</li>
            <li> JUMBO SIZE ALSO MAKES IT MUCH MORE INCONVENIENT TO USE in that it doesn&#x27;t fit easily in one&#x27;s pocket</li>
            <li> The original flavor feels &amp; stays on great &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have that sweet coconut smell despite organic virgin coconut oil being its main ingredient &amp; organic beeswax being the only other ingredient.et coconut smell despite organic virgin coconut oil being its main ingredient &amp; organic beeswax being the only other ingredient.</li>
            <li> Nothing special especially for the price</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and stays on long.</li>
            <li> The label &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; is understandably popular these days, but I am not sure just what this refers to i.e. cocoa butter, coconut oil, Shea, or all three.</li>
            <li> THAT HAS NONE OF THE ABOVE DRAWBACKS OR THE SWEET SMELL</li>
            <li> You have found a new forever customer!  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes lips very well, and, compared to other popular chapsticks I&#x27;ve tried this outlasts and outperforms them all in terms of reapplication times, quality, and overall fabulousness.</li>
            <li> it is more expensive than most chapsticks, it can literally treat an army of Angelina Jolies.</li>
            <li> , it is super moisturizing and I will definitely repurchase this again!</li>
            <li> It was a little more expensive than your regular chapstick (which now has some pretty good flavors), but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It certainly brings a lot of questions, like where on Earth did I find such a large lip balm?!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for coconut addicts like myself and for anyone with chapped lips, mine are caused by hypothyroidism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this chap stick.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> as opposed to the normal sized lip balm of .15 oz.  </li>
            <li> OF ALL, THEIR &amp;#34;100% HAPPINESS GUARANTEE&amp;#34; IS NOT EASY TO COLLECT ON as you have to search to find a way to contact them as that information is not posted on their product page or given through the usual email most companies provide following a purchase.  </li>
            <li> These really have become my favorite lip balms because of their natural and organic ingredients, large size (makes them last long and easier to find in my purse) and they actually work.  </li>
            <li> The softness also makes it smoosh quite rapidly within the tube &amp; also means the MOISTURIZING PROTECTION DOES NOT LAST LONG, REQUIRING WAY MORE FREQUENT APPLICATIONS THAN I&#x27;VE EVER</li>
            <li> Then she got in the new Coconut Cream to review</li>
            <li> The Coconut Cream has a nice, subtle smell of Coconut and tastes like coconut as well.  </li>
            <li> Also the consistency is very soft and buttery greasy to me.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The smell is exact to cream de coco (I&#x27;m a big pina colada drinkers...</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that the circumference of the balm is so large it applies beyond my lips, so instead of applying it like I normally would  </li>
            <li> Wow this lip balm is huge in comparison to an average size balm.  </li>
            <li> The feel is slightly grainy, not the silky smooth that I am used to.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for people who want a high quality lip balm and don&#x27;t mind a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  December, 2012</li>
            <li> and I love that its natural with no harsh chemicals although the scent is hard to detect.</li>
            <li> I use it at night for soft lips while I sleep.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed some natural lip balms need to be reapplied quite often.</li>
            <li> always looking for something natural to put on my face &amp; lips, so this is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t cause any problems.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> And it leaves my lips moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Have tried a few different flavors and love them all.</li>
            <li> Crazy good value when I lose my regular chapstick sized lip balms almost right away.</li>
            <li> (these are so small they are easily lost before the container is empty.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> The fragrance is OK, but too subtle for my taste.</li>
            <li> I love the moisture that it gives my lips without the stickiness of a lip gloss and without drying them out like other lip balms that contain alcohol or other drying agents.</li>
            <li> Treat&#x27;s jumbo lip balms really moisturizer my lips for a long time before needing to reapply!  </li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it is a fairly good lip balm, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad and it really IS jumbo.</li>
            <li> The smell is  like buttercream frosting with a dash of coconut and has a texture that is a nice middle ground of a thick balm and the smooth, slickness of a thin one.  </li>
            <li> Other then getting the wrong scent the product is great.</li>
            <li> It enormous - but to me, that just means it will last FAR longer than those tiny tubes we normally get!</li>
            <li> It seems to “last” longer than other lip balms I’ve used, meaning more moisture and less drying and “chappiness.”</li>
            <li> For others this would probably last a lot longer, but I use mine nearly every day.</li>
            <li> brand barely a week or so</li>
            <li> Nothing more frustrating then bleeding,ripped,and patchy lips.</li>
            <li> it makes it harder to just get it on one&#x27;s lips easily &amp; rapidly as the usual lip balm size naturally</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product and I will be purchasing the other flavor and another one of these too.</li>
            <li> (even our dry climate here)&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a super long time (had my pink one for over a month now with continued use &amp; still have plenty</li>
            <li> I feel ridiculous using the huge one, and it definitely takes up a lot of space in my purse.</li>
            <li> I really cant wait to try the other flavors !!</li>
            <li> Due to technical issues had to contact TREAT directly  </li>
            <li> It makes my lips feel soft and buttery and not waxy like some other organic balms.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> scent is great, which makes my husband happy when he kisses me because he doesn&#x27;t like other lip balms that smell bad or taste awful</li>
            <li> I switched to natural products a few years ago</li>
            <li> It leaves your lips feeling moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> This stays on for a surprisingly long time.  </li>
            <li> it smells a little gross actually until you put it on then</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm on August 28, 2012, used it every single day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sucker for everything coconut, since I was a young tyke growing up, still am to this day.  </li>
            <li> My lips are no longer dried out and when they need some extra moisture</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell remotely like Coconut Cream and the formula is not that moisturizing.</li>
            <li> i spent $8 on it.</li>
            <li> ; the reasons for that would be because it comes in a nice soft cream base so its not as harsh on your lips as all those harsh suger based lip exfoliators out in the market</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just seems odd to have such a large surface sliding over my lips.</li>
            <li> Also bought the other two flavors.</li>
            <li> HAD TO DO WITH ANY OTHER LIP BALM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband also loves it, he even tries to steal it from me when I&#x27;m not paying attention!</li>
            <li> As someone who likes to change their lip balm once its done, I might buy the other flavor for a change.</li>
            <li> One only needs to use this lip balm a few times a day!  </li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is that there is not a &amp;#34;pocket-size&amp;#34;, man-friendly version of this which my boyfriend can use...comfortably</li>
            <li> The picture I added shows a size comparison to an average size lip</li>
            <li> only negative that I can find versus the alternative is price.  </li>
            <li> and this product has not let me down.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that about any other lip balm!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is not your typical lip balm that just &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on the lips and once it rubs off...</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d spent the money on it again --</li>
            <li> Not even like real pineapple, but artificial pineapple flavoring like they use in candy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the formulation is too soft</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used this a few times before bed on my cuticles &amp; it leaves them</li>
            <li> and i was kinda over it after a few uses and ended up giving it to my sister.....</li>
            <li> it was basically just like plain shae butter to myself and my mom.</li>
            <li> It is the texture is not appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if beeswax would/could be treated with a chemical anyway.</li>
            <li> so that is why i give it 3 stars  :/</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Once an addict but no more.  </li>
            <li> I live in a drier region &amp; we have little to no humidity here which makes for awful dry skin &amp; lips.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> It hardly smells of coconuts...</li>
            <li> At least.</li>
            <li> i apply my lips with a somewhat thick layer of this &amp;#34;Treat coconut cream lip balm&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li> Needless to say my lips,my husband lips,&amp; my little girls lips got chapped.</li>
            <li> but after a short while I noticed that it tasted horrible and drinking water didn&#x27;t get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a weird taste, like coconut</li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed with all things</li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed with this lip balm</li>
            <li> I received the WRONG lip balm....</li>
            <li> I am not happy!</li>
            <li> a bit expensive though</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with chap stick/ lip balms and this one delivers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste like coconut  :(</li>
            <li> I felt stupid paying 8 bucks for lip balm, but I did it anyway.</li>
            <li> What I hate is the smell/taste.</li>
            <li> However, the taste was just horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it is a fairly good lip balm, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad and it really IS jumbo. However, the taste was just horrible. I was willing to let go of the fact it didn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all-but after a short while I noticed that it tasted horrible and drinking water didn&#x27;t get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, even though I liked the size and really wanted it when I bought it.</li>
            <li> This tastes more like piña colada, not a fan. Hoping to hear from the company if it has any pineapple flavoring in it. The soft candy is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> i will start off buy saying that i am an addect to lip balms,&lt;br /&gt;i tried LOTS of different kinds of products (&amp;#34;lip serum&#x27;s&amp;#34;,lip balms,lip scrubs,lip plumpers,etc..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every night i love to exfoliate my lips (this gives your lips the smooth texture cause it sweeps all the dead skin cells away and that means your lipstick will go on totally smooth and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i exfoliate my lips with a usual lip exfoliator, and from all the ones i have tried, the best one for me would be (undoubtedly) the &amp;#34;bliss fabulips pout-o-matic lip-perfecting system&amp;#34; the reasons for that would be because it comes in a nice soft cream base so its not as harsh on your lips as all those harsh suger based lip exfoliators out in the market (treat beauty,lush,sara happ,bliss and thats to name a few)&lt;br /&gt;plus it comes with a battery operated exfoliating device that really helps slough off dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after the exfoliation i apply my lips with a somewhat thick layer of this &amp;#34;Treat coconut cream lip balm&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;this lip balm is sooo good and comfirting for dry lips, its really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;its the BEST one i found from tens and tens i have tried all my life.&lt;br /&gt;i love to use it because it&#x27;s lightweight,not gloosy,not waxy,no &amp;#34;heavy sticky&amp;#34; feeling at all,&lt;br /&gt;i smooth it on my lips whenever i feel i need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and most importantly....it gives a Real longlasting moisturized feel to the lips.&lt;br /&gt;this is not your typical lip balm that just &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on the lips and once it rubs off...your back to square one.&lt;br /&gt;i think the Glycerin and coconut oil is what really makes the difference in this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i simply love it.</li>
            <li> First saw this on my favorite youtube beauty guru Kandee Johnsons page when she was talking about the other flavor/scent.Then she got in the new Coconut Cream to review and she raved about it.  And i just had to try it. I recieved it today and am very pleased. The tube is sooo large and cute. I cant stop putting it on. The scent isnt as prominent as i though it would be but i still love the smell i could eat it lol. Makes my lips feel amazing. Definately wont be running out anytime soon. Cant wait to try more products from TREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> I love anything that smells of coconut and I needed a last item to make my order qualify for the free shipping and this was in the suggested products list at the bottom of the screen and decided to add it because I have been wanting a new lip balm and thought that a coconut would be awesome for summer. Well the lip balm is very moisturizing and I love that its natural with no harsh chemicals although the scent is hard to detect. It hardly smells of coconuts...it smells a little gross actually until you put it on then it smells good but just in the stick it doesn&#x27;t. I love the fact that its a jumbo size because I can easily find it in my purse. Although I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Treat Cocunut Cream Old Fashiioned Jumbo Flavored Lip Balm is the best. It smells soooo delicious and really nourishes your lips. The size is a huge plus because it has more product. I really recommend this product and I will be purchasing the other flavor and another one of these too.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a larger size lip balm- longer lasting, so fewer trips to the store. Unfortunately, it just seems odd to have such a large surface sliding over my lips. Someone likened it to a glue stick in a review, and I now understand why.  The fragrance is OK, but too subtle for my taste. It is the texture is not appealing to me. The feel is slightly grainy, not the silky smooth that I am used to. The label &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; is understandably popular these days, but I am not sure just what this refers to i.e. cocoa butter, coconut oil, Shea, or all three. Not sure if beeswax would/could be treated with a chemical anyway. I&#x27;ll keep it in my car for handy use, but it is not my &#x27;Go-To&amp;#34; cosmetic.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I took the cap off was the scent - a great mix of coconut &amp; pina-colada YUM! It feels great on my lips..definitely not greasy. Absorbs quickly and leaves my lips feeling soft. My new favorite go-to lipbalm!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that customer service at TREAT rocks!  Due to technical issues had to contact TREAT directly  and Marnie assisted me with my order and just went above and beyond with her customer service. This lip balm is by far the best EVER~ all natural and the smell is divine(pina colada)~my lips are in best shape ever~soft,plump and perfect after just a few days after using this balm. MUST TRY ~it will NOT disappoint. I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This lipbalm is a whopping .5 oz, which is awesome when most are .15 and around $3 a tube.  The smell is  like buttercream frosting with a dash of coconut and has a texture that is a nice middle ground of a thick balm and the smooth, slickness of a thin one.  And I love how the ingredients are natural and simple.  Great for any lip balm lover!</li>
            <li> It is a good value for the price. Not the best lip balm I have used. It is good though. I use it at night for soft lips while I sleep. It smells yummy.</li>
            <li> This lip balm will last me for 10 years. At least. It has a great flavor and leaves my lips feeling incredibly smooth and hydrated. I keep it in my purse and around me at almost all times. It certainly brings a lot of questions, like where on Earth did I find such a large lip balm?! I use this many times a day and do not see it going anywhere anytime fast. This is an investment into your lips. You&#x27;ll be glad you got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Love it! Also bought the other two flavors.</li>
            <li> This product will make your lips very moist. It smells and tastes great without being too sweet. This is a huge stick and will probably last me all year. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It absorbs real quick, and it smells heavenly! It is real big, so not too portable but it is so nice to keep in the makeup shelf or next to the bed! &lt;3 it! I could not stop putting it on. :)</li>
            <li> I just received it today &amp; I love it.  I used to use Burts Bee lip balm but it never kept my lips this moisturized so I ordered Smiths rose bud &amp; eucalyptus  salve but I started to get a reaction to those.  I did some research and found out my lips are probably allergic to petroleum and most of the ingredients they use to make lip balms minty (which I love) so I decided to go the organic route. I&#x27;m glad I did.  I will be ordering more so I can have one of these everywhere. Now I can continue to wear all the matte lipsticks that I love 😃</li>
            <li> LOVE this lip balm! Have tried a few different flavors and love them all. Moisturizes lips very well, and, compared to other popular chapsticks I&#x27;ve tried this outlasts and outperforms them all in terms of reapplication times, quality, and overall fabulousness. My ONLY complaint is that there is not a &amp;#34;pocket-size&amp;#34;, man-friendly version of this which my boyfriend can use...comfortably (it&#x27;s just too bulky for pant pockets and too feminine in the packaging...according to him). Please consider making a man-friendly/pocket-friendly version! :)</li>
            <li> Wow this lip balm is huge in comparison to an average size balm.  This organic lip balm by Treat smells amazing.  In my opinion it smells like coconut and pineapple, like a pina collada. I love that this uses all natural products and is cruelty free.  It makes my lips feel soft and buttery and not waxy like some other organic balms.  The only problem I had was that the circumference of the balm is so large it applies beyond my lips, so instead of applying it like I normally would  I twist it up a bit and apply it at an angle.  It&#x27;s perfect! The picture I added shows a size comparison to an average size lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> Best lip gloss I have ever tried.  It will last you forever and ever. Kinda looks like a glue stick. I like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would work given great organic ingredients.  Unfortunately the formulation is too soft so it smears easily over one&#x27;s face even when applied with care from an angle just using an outer edge as one of the reviewers recommended.  The softness also makes it smoosh quite rapidly within the tube &amp; also means the MOISTURIZING PROTECTION DOES NOT LAST LONG, REQUIRING WAY MORE FREQUENT APPLICATIONS THAN I&#x27;VE EVER HAD TO DO WITH ANY OTHER LIP BALM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE JUMBO SIZE ALSO MAKES IT MUCH MORE INCONVENIENT TO USE in that it doesn&#x27;t fit easily in one&#x27;s pocket + it makes it harder to just get it on one&#x27;s lips easily &amp; rapidly as the usual lip balm size naturally enables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORST OF ALL, THEIR &amp;#34;100% HAPPINESS GUARANTEE&amp;#34; IS NOT EASY TO COLLECT ON as you have to search to find a way to contact them as that information is not posted on their product page or given through the usual email most companies provide following a purchase.  They then said that Amazon requires the refund to be handled by the customer contacting Amazon about it even though most refund-guarantee sellers issue an immediate refund without a problem or requiring anything further once notified their product did not work well or satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO FIND AN ORGANIC LIP BALM WITH HEALTHY INGREDIENTS THAT HAS NONE OF THE ABOVE DRAWBACKS OR THE SWEET SMELL THAT I THOUGHT WAS THE RESULT OF THE COCONUT OIL.  It is not yet available for sale through Amazon but I discovered it at a local health food store.  The name is &amp;#34;cocokind&amp;#34; &amp; it comes in &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; flavor as well as a scented flavor which I prefer to avoid both because of my chemical sensitivities &amp; also because purer is better especially on one&#x27;s lips as so much absorbs through them.  The original flavor feels &amp; stays on great &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have that sweet coconut smell despite organic virgin coconut oil being its main ingredient &amp; organic beeswax being the only other ingredient.et coconut smell despite organic virgin coconut oil being its main ingredient &amp; organic beeswax being the only other ingredient.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip balm out there. I haven&#x27;t thrown mine away yet (purchased October 2013) and I&#x27;m already at the point where I have to use my finger to dig out the last remaining remnants of this wonderful lip balm. For others this would probably last a lot longer, but I use mine nearly every day. My husband also loves it, he even tries to steal it from me when I&#x27;m not paying attention! Aside from a very pleasant coconut scent the balm is very light and moisturizes perfectly without leaving an oily, heavy sheen like a lot of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying 2 this time!</li>
            <li> I switched to natural products a few years ago and I have noticed some natural lip balms need to be reapplied quite often. Treat&#x27;s jumbo lip balms really moisturizer my lips for a long time before needing to reapply!  These really have become my favorite lip balms because of their natural and organic ingredients, large size (makes them last long and easier to find in my purse) and they actually work.  My lips are no longer dried out and when they need some extra moisture I just grab for these.  The coconut smell is very pleasant and reminds me of a day at the beach with a piña colada. I love the jumbo size because I don&#x27;t run out as often and they are also so much easier to keep track of.  Things are always getting lost in my purse and diaper bag but not these.  My two year old daughter calls this her coconut and is in love with this lippie.  She is always digging through my stuff to find it and I love that with such awesome ingredients I don&#x27;t have to worry if she takes a nibble (this actually happens more than I would like).  Overall this is just a terrific product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was recieved at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to get this on sale! I love all things coconut and I may just have a lip balm obsession (just, maybe). I love the scent! I love the moisture that it gives my lips without the stickiness of a lip gloss and without drying them out like other lip balms that contain alcohol or other drying agents. It enormous - but to me, that just means it will last FAR longer than those tiny tubes we normally get! It seems to “last” longer than other lip balms I’ve used, meaning more moisture and less drying and “chappiness.” Have I mentioned that I love the scent? I’ll be buying more whenever this one runs out!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received at a discount in exchange for honest review*</li>
            <li> My wife just love it... It is her favorite lip balm and plans to buy more when she runs out.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve used,and tastes deliciously of coconut!</li>
            <li> Nothing special especially for the price</li>
            <li> Love all treat lip balms, and this one is great for coconut lovers. Smells great and leaves your lips moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it, but after using it for 2 days I have to say I&#x27;m returning it. It has a weird taste, like coconut but with a chemical after taste. It leaves a layer of residue on my lips and does not provide much moisture. Also, it&#x27;s too big.</li>
            <li> LOVE! So moisturizing, feels like clouds around rubbing on your lips!! MUAH!!</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I am a certified Lip Balm Junkie!  This is the ONLY Lip Balm I will EVER buy again!  I purchased a number of different lip balms on Amazon in one order trying to find one that actually feels good on my lips, smells and tastes good, and actually works without having to reapply it every 20 minutes!  Well, my search is over!  This USDA Organic, Cruelty Free Lip Balm is perfect in every way!  First off, it is huge!  One of these lip balms is .50 oz as opposed to the normal sized lip balm of .15 oz.  It will last longer than 4 or 5 normal sized lip balms, easily!  The Coconut Cream has a nice, subtle smell of Coconut and tastes like coconut as well.  I have rabbits, and they will lick my lips whenever I have this lip balm on!  Apparently they love the scent and taste as much as I do!  Lol. This lip balm is not too greasy or too waxy.......it is just right!  I cannot say that about any other lip balm!  I apply it before bed and it is still on in the morning!  WOW!  So, I just purchased the Treat 3 pack of Lip Balms and the Lip Scrub and they will be arriving tomorrow!  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors!  I would recommend this lip balm to everybody else who has searched for years to find a lip balm that really works!  Thanks, Treat!  You have found a new forever customer!  </li>
            <li> I like this lip balm. It works well, has a nice scent. I wish I could get it in a smaller tube. I feel ridiculous using the huge one, and it definitely takes up a lot of space in my purse. I&#x27;ll keep my eye on this company for newer sizes in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm on August 28, 2012, used it every single day and I just ran out of it. Crazy good value when I lose my regular chapstick sized lip balms almost right away. It&#x27;s about the size of a glue stick, too big for my purse. I recommend keeping this baby on your night stand to apply before bed. Smells great, makes my lips very soft and lasted years. Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> WOW! This is a seriously HUGE lip balm! I purchased this because I LOVE a good lip balm. I feel the need to try every kind of lip balm I come across, so of course I needed this one. I have NEVER seen a lip balm this size, so I was VERY interested in seeing how this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a seriously HUGE .50 oz size! It is REALLY about the size of three lip balms combined. As soon as I opened it up, which was immediately, I was in love with the scent. It really smells like coconut cream! Absolutely delish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hydrates my lips instantly and there&#x27;s no need to constantly reapply it throughout the day because the hydration lasts for hours.. I also absolutely love that this product is cruelty-free! I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and LOVE how great it smells. I would definitely buy again. (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm because it&#x27;s very moisturizing and stays on. What I hate is the smell/taste. It says coconut cream, but what it really smells/taste like is pineapple. Not even like real pineapple, but artificial pineapple flavoring like they use in candy. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the vanilla buttercream from now on.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the coconut cream after trying the marshmallow this one just had a lacking flavor/smell it was basically just like plain shae butter to myself and my mom. Love the products normally but this one wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> This balm smells very tropical and delicious. It glides on smoothly and keeps my lips hydrated all day. It does have a pineapple scent to it but it smells more like a pina colada.  I will be re purchasing it when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sucker for everything coconut, since I was a young tyke growing up, still am to this day.  I don&#x27;t know, yet, if this will do my lips any good, but it sure tastes good and feels good on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for coconut addicts like myself and for anyone with chapped lips, mine are caused by hypothyroidism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  July, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased every one of the different lip balms they have.  I like them very much; in fact I&#x27;ve purchased several on more than one occasion to replace those that I&#x27;ve used up.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like about them:&lt;br /&gt;- they last me a couple of months versus the [[ASIN:B005KSY9QI Chapstick Lip Balm Variety Pack (10 Sticks X 4g Each)]] brand barely a week or so (these are so small they are easily lost before the container is empty.&lt;br /&gt;They work well for my lips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative that I can find versus the alternative is price.  When you consider the price per day or week this ceases to be an issue with me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for people who want a high quality lip balm and don&#x27;t mind a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  December, 2012</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this lip balm however it didn&#x27;t impress me. It doesn&#x27;t smell remotely like Coconut Cream and the formula is not that moisturizing. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I live in a drier region &amp; we have little to no humidity here which makes for awful dry skin &amp; lips.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always looking for something natural to put on my face &amp; lips, so this is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great, which makes my husband happy when he kisses me because he doesn&#x27;t like other lip balms that smell bad or taste awful (I totally don&#x27;t like them either)&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, this lip balm is a larger size so it&#x27;s hard to lose &amp; easy to find in my purse :)&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes really well (even our dry climate here)&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a super long time (had my pink one for over a month now with continued use &amp; still have plenty left)&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky or drying (some balms dry the lip area out more than before applied, this one doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;Great for cuticles! (I&#x27;ve used this a few times before bed on my cuticles &amp; it leaves them nice)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t melt in my pocket (I&#x27;m a pocket carrier, or else I leave it in my purse *This size is great for finding it in a purse*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great stocking stuffer, Vday gift (is really great before, during &amp; after make-out sessions) :)&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t cause any problems.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good that I have ordered another one to gift away.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm.  I liked so much that I ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> I love this chap stick! Its my go-to chap stick for bed time. Smells so good!! Love that it is all natural. I highly recommend this chap stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a chapstick fiend--I guess I just admitted to having Sahara-desert lips. I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil as a moisturizer and chapstick at night, and thought they must have this in a more convenient lip product form. And I found it. I love the size--it&#x27;s comparable to a glue stick but much more conducive to moistening the lips. Mild scent, and four easily discernible ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already recommended this to my friend. Granted it is more expensive than most chapsticks, it can literally treat an army of Angelina Jolies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this around my eyes since I couldn&#x27;t find a good eye cream that didn&#x27;t make my eyes burn and this is wonderful. A little goes a long way and it lasts a very long time. The smell is a little strong but it&#x27;s sweet so I don&#x27;t mind and for the amount of product you get (4x the amount of regular chapstick) it&#x27;s very reasonably priced. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents!</li>
            <li> product is ok, glides pretty smooth, but the taste isnt that great...overall i like it, but dont love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Goes on smooth and stays on long. The flavor tastes exactly like coconut. It&#x27;s very nice to wear on your lips.</li>
            <li> I heard about this lip balm from Kandee Johnson on YouTube and just had to try it out. I am completely obsessed with all things coconut and this product has not let me down. It leaves your lips feeling moisturized all day long. I am completely obsessed with this lip balm and I can&#x27;t wait to try more products from treat. I love that the container is huge and I feel like I wont be running out any time soon.</li>
            <li> This balm has been the best that I&#x27;ve had. I always carried around the chapstick brand, but had to stop using it because I would have to apply just about every 20 mins. And, it would leave my lips a bit chapped. Then I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees. It was a lot better on my lips, but would still dry out a bit. But THIS! This stays on for a surprisingly long time.  I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks and by far my favorite. And it leaves my lips moisturized and soft. I am very pleased with this product and it smells great! Kinda reminds me of a Pina Colada. I put it on at night and wake up in the morning with plump and moisturized lips. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received the WRONG lip balm.... I am not happy! I wanted the coconut &amp; got the vanilla. Products did come on time but it doesn&#x27;t matter if you got them on time if it&#x27;s not the ones you ordered! Other then getting the wrong scent the product is great. It glides on well and I even put it under my eyes if needed :)</li>
            <li> Last winter I waited to long to go on the hunt for the best lip balm. Needless to say my lips,my husband lips,&amp; my little girls lips got chapped. Nothing more frustrating then bleeding,ripped,and patchy lips. So I went on the hunt looking under coconut and found this product during the Summer and had it shipped quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Smell is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;Taste is light&lt;br /&gt;Size LARGE/Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;The feel is smooth &amp; not heavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Women approved,Man approved,Child approved. It&#x27;s pretty large so it&#x27;s easy to find in my big purse.My daughter(4yr) put&#x27;s it on with ease,and my husband doesn&#x27;t find this balm too girly not to use. So overall it&#x27;s a great buy. high quality and protected all of our lips! No lip peels for us! It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This says coconut but this is &amp;#34;pina colada&amp;#34; flavor. I dont like pina colada so that is why i give it 3 stars  :/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this moisturized my lips for a long time, but it does smell and feel wonderful when you put it on! I love the size--especially so i don&#x27;t lose it!</li>
            <li> Very nice lip balm. It&#x27;s huge. So you get a lot of product. This will last me for quite awhile. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have an overly coconut scent. It&#x27;s just light enough that I get a hint of it and it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I received this at a discounted rate for honest review.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! GREAT FOR CHAPPED LIPS!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, and is made from great ingredients-the size of the product is worth the price.  As someone who likes to change their lip balm once its done, I might buy the other flavor for a change.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product since it was all natural, coconut, and in a large cute packaging, but its not as moisturizing as I excepted.  I keep on having to apply over and over and it doesnt seem to sink in that much either but it does feel nice on my lips and smells good too but not really like coconut.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome at first but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as i thought it would. It doesn&#x27;t taste like coconut  :( if only it tasted like it smelled it would be awesome, because after the smell goes away im just left with the waxy taste, but it did make my lips a lot smoother.and its a big tube! I think it&#x27;ll last me for over a year</li>
            <li> This product checks all the boxes...organic, cruelty free, non-drying, great flavor.  Very happy to find this and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I felt stupid paying 8 bucks for lip balm, but I did it anyway. It&#x27;s made of really nice ingredients, smells great, works a-okay, big, but... you know. It&#x27;s lip balm. Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s changed my life. Not sure if I&#x27;d spent the money on it again -- but, luckily, it&#x27;s so big I won&#x27;t have to decide for a while.</li>
            <li> It is the best ever!!</li>
            <li> I was so fortunate to receive an opportunity to review this great Lip Balm. as part of a promotion . Here are a few things that right off the bat I love about this Product !&lt;br /&gt;* Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;*Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;* only 4 ingredients that are Certified Organic&lt;br /&gt;* it smells supper Yummy&lt;br /&gt;* and IT WORKS WELL!!&lt;br /&gt;  PS I also Love that it is over sized !! I truly couldn&#x27;t be more impressed . I really cant wait to try the other flavors !!</li>
            <li> excellent scent, but it is soooooooo good I do wish that the scent lasted longer!  will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> regular lip balm nothing i was blown away with, flavor/scent was nice. i also like that it&#x27;s a jumbo size, easy to find in my bag. a bit expensive though</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this and i thought it smelled ok thought it wouldve smelled better and i was kinda over it after a few uses and ended up giving it to my sister.....kinda bummed considering i spent $8 on it. I just ordered the vanilla buttercream and the pink buttercream lipbalms hopefully those will be better cause i love the buttercream lipscrub!</li>
            <li> Love it Totally ! Smells Yummy!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I was hoping. Also the consistency is very soft and buttery greasy to me. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to but I honestly still love my eos</li>
            <li> My favorite flavor! and the only one that I actually used until finished! Would highly recommend if you like coconut scents!</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; creamy, but nothing to get excited about.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product. I LOVE that it is pretty much the size of a glue stick, it will last me forever! It smells fantastic, it is super moisturizing and I will definitely repurchase this again!</li>
            <li> Love anything with coconut oil in it for my lips and face.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients on it. Also the size. I keep it on my bedside and apply it before going to bed, I wake up with moisturized lips.</li>
            <li> Once an addict but no more.  One only needs to use this lip balm a few times a day!  It does not get lost in the bottom of your bag.  If you like coconut .... it is perfect!</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT. I am obsessed with chap stick/ lip balms and this one delivers. The smell is exact to cream de coco (I&#x27;m a big pina colada drinkers... the smell is EXACT).</li>
            <li> This is going to last a loooong time!  It smells good, and feels good, too (not sticky).  It was a little more expensive than your regular chapstick (which now has some pretty good flavors), but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is really good.  It provides you with everything you need to keep your lips moisturized.  I will buy this again!</li>
