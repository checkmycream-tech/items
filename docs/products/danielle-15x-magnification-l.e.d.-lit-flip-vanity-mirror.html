    <ol>
            <li>Beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy.</li>
            <li>Good for plucking eyebrows since it is good 15x magnification.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise is a good mirror.</li>
            <li>Seems to be as good as description.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife but the light wasn&#x27;t very bright</li>
            <li>No distortion, great magnification and adequate light to pluck eyebrows!</li>
            <li>is Very Sturdy and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it seemed ok.</li>
            <li>I am finally able to see to put my make up on.</li>
            <li>This is lovely mirror</li>
            <li>IT WAS MORE LIKE A FISH EYE MIRROR.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>You turn on or off the light by dialing the switch in the cord once it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li>Wish the light was a bit brighter.</li>
            <li>Great for a 40+ person with recent Lasik surgery.</li>
            <li>the light in this mirror did not work.</li>
            <li>I have had this mirror for six months and it doesn&#x27;t light.  </li>
            <li>Love it fast delivery</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY TRUE.  </li>
            <li>The light is just right for her  purpose.</li>
            <li>The 15X magnification side of the mirror is tremendously distorted.</li>
            <li>And I clearly paid the full price for something better than what I got.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my Christmas present but took it out to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li>There is no option to make the dim light brighter.</li>
            <li>Excellent magnification, unfortunately it stopped working 1 week after I received it.</li>
            <li>I sent it back and replaced it with the Danielle 10X Column Stem mirror without a light</li>
            <li>The light had a short in it and the mirror was blurry and gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li>The light is dim, but I assume because you have to be fairly close to the mirror to use the 15x size they didn&#x27;t want to blind you.</li>
            <li>There is only one light level and it is DIM.</li>
            <li>I have to get very close to it to see anything clearly</li>
            <li>Great magnification that is difficult to find.</li>
            <li>I have always been so pleased with my Amazon purchases, as have my gift recipients, that I wasted time searching for a receipt from another seller before returning this item.  </li>
            <li>The 15X side was wavy, plastic, blurry and generally not usable as any sort of mirror unless you just want to make a fun house diorama and pay dearly.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A LITTLE TOO STRONG FOR ME, BUT IT HAS BEAUTY AND QUALITY</li>
            <li>When I step back to allow room to use my tweezers or makeup item, the distortion is too much for me to see anything clearly.</li>
            <li>There is about a one inch viewing area where it is somewhat clear.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time/money.  </li>
            <li>Well, this is my second try, first one only lasted less then 30 days, however the return process was swift and easy, lets see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li>but I thought one side would be 5x and the other side is 15x which is too intense for me.</li>
            <li>The LED light is very low power, hardly illuminates your face at all, may return the item, if I can be bothered....</li>

            <li> YOU COULDNT USE THE WHOLE MIRROR, JUST A SMALL PORTION OF THE MIDDLE.</li>
            <li> The other side is not good for seeing your whole face.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even back up a little to compare both eyes when applying make up.  </li>

            <li> It also bulky and heavy.</li>

            <li> IT WAS HARD TO USE FOR GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF MY EYE, WHICH IS WHY I PURCHASED IT.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> wrong again.  </li>
            <li> it is impossible to see in the 15x magnification side of this mirror unless your nose is pressed against the glass.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is absolutely impossible to see into with it&#x27;s concave magnification area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible mirror!</li>
            <li> Horrible....</li>
            <li> Worst part is, if you don&#x27;t believe me and order it anyway, you will have to pay shipping costs both ways plus they have the option of deducting a &amp;#34;restocking fee&amp;#34; from your refund.  </li>
            <li> IT IS AWFUL.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible mirror! There is only one light level and it is DIM. You turn on or off the light by dialing the switch in the cord once it&#x27;s plugged in. There is no option to make the dim light brighter. The 15X magnification side of the mirror is tremendously distorted. I have to get very close to it to see anything clearly but at this point I&#x27;m too close to the mirror that there is no room for me to use tweezers or makeup items. When I step back to allow room to use my tweezers or makeup item, the distortion is too much for me to see anything clearly. I took it back to the department store that I bought it from for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have always been so pleased with my Amazon purchases, as have my gift recipients, that I wasted time searching for a receipt from another seller before returning this item.  Warning:  it is impossible to see in the 15x magnification side of this mirror unless your nose is pressed against the glass.  If you do choose to do so, you will see an enormous enlargement of a portion of your eye but will be unable to, say, squeeze in a contact lens or a mascara brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 93 YO Mother in law who has facial whiskers.  She doesn&#x27;t need to use her glasses to remove them with the 15x.&lt;br /&gt;It is Very Sturdy and beautiful.  The light is dim, but I assume because you have to be fairly close to the mirror to use the 15x size they didn&#x27;t want to blind you. The light is just right for her  purpose.</li>
            <li> Good for plucking eyebrows since it is good 15x magnification.  The other side is not good for seeing your whole face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife but the light wasn&#x27;t very bright so she had me return it.  Otherwise it seemed ok.</li>
            <li> Wish the light was a bit brighter. Beautiful. Great magnification that is difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Great for a 40+ person with recent Lasik surgery. I am finally able to see to put my make up on. You will need to get close to focus in though. Otherwise is a good mirror. LED lighting could be brighter.</li>
            <li> This is lovely mirror but I thought one side would be 5x and the other side is 15x which is too intense for me. The mirror works well however I want to return it. It is not satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Love it fast delivery</li>
            <li> totally distorted, and the mirror is so small across.  Never would I recommend this to anyone.  And I clearly paid the full price for something better than what I got.  I tried with my glasses on and with them off could not see unless I got within one inch of the mirror and then you can only see a spot the size of your thumb.  Horrible....</li>
            <li> This mirror is absolutely impossible to see into with it&#x27;s concave magnification area.  There is about a one inch viewing area where it is somewhat clear.  It also bulky and heavy. I sent it back and replaced it with the Danielle 10X Column Stem mirror without a light and I am so happy. Buyer beware.[[ASIN:B0041OBN8O Danielle 15x Magnification L.E.D. Lit Flip Vanity Mirror]]</li>
            <li> The mirror was too small for the magnification strength. I could only see my nose or one eye at a time. I also had to be one inch away from the mirror to see at all.............I returned it. I am farsighted</li>
            <li> Well, this is my second try, first one only lasted less then 30 days, however the return process was swift and easy, lets see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li> the light in this mirror did not work. I took it apart and repaired it. It had not been checked over correctly.</li>
            <li> IT WAS HARD TO USE FOR GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF MY EYE, WHICH IS WHY I PURCHASED IT. IT WAS MORE LIKE A FISH EYE MIRROR. YOU COULDNT USE THE WHOLE MIRROR, JUST A SMALL PORTION OF THE MIDDLE.</li>
            <li> The light had a short in it and the mirror was blurry and gave me a headache.  I am sorry to say I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> No distortion, great magnification and adequate light to pluck eyebrows! I have bought others and returned them so I am judgmental on magnifying mirrors.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time/money.  Worst part is, if you don&#x27;t believe me and order it anyway, you will have to pay shipping costs both ways plus they have the option of deducting a &amp;#34;restocking fee&amp;#34; from your refund.  So, what I&#x27;m telling you is that you will have to pay for the privilege of attempting to purchase this thing.  The 15X side was wavy, plastic, blurry and generally not usable as any sort of mirror unless you just want to make a fun house diorama and pay dearly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. IT&#x27;S A LITTLE TOO STRONG FOR ME, BUT IT HAS BEAUTY AND QUALITY I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND.&lt;br /&gt;JOYCE</li>
            <li> Excellent magnification, unfortunately it stopped working 1 week after I received it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Christmas present but took it out to see how I liked it. I then wrapped it. Seems to be as good as description.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS MIRROR.  What the other people have said about having to have your face pressed against it to see it..ABSOLUTELY TRUE.  You can&#x27;t even back up a little to compare both eyes when applying make up.  IT IS AWFUL.  And then, i turned my mirror on one day...and nothing.  I have had this mirror for six months and it doesn&#x27;t light.  I took it apart, hoping to buy a replacement bulb..wrong again.  Its some sort of LED panel.  So now..it is headed for the junk heap...which is where it belongs.  BUYER BEWARE.</li>
