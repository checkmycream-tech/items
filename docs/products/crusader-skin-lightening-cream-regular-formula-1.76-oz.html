    <ol>
            <li>An excellent buy.</li>
            <li>Awesome!  </li>
            <li>So if you do that then you will be good.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well on acne scars.  </li>
            <li>It gives my skin an amazing glow.</li>
            <li>l just saw my hands this morning and they look really nice, and the spots in my legs are lighter  already</li>
            <li>No one is ever able to guess that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, which is just fine by me!</li>
            <li>and I have been using it for three years now and could not be more satisfied at the outcome.</li>
            <li>, for me i just evened it out and try to maintain what i was:)</li>
            <li>I would have been better off going to Walgreens and buying something from there to brighten my skin which would have also been cheaper.</li>
            <li>However I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day, most of the time once a day.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Hopefully that works better on me.</li>
            <li>So maybe it fades some spots better than others or maybe I should have used it even longer</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the benefits for a while when I would put it on every day!</li>
            <li>Word to the wise, don&#x27;t put too much on otherwise will scab</li>
            <li>After a week or so, I noticed it was a bit lighter, though not as light as I intended.</li>
            <li>Its best to use this product consistently every single day as directed to see results!</li>
            <li>far as how effective it is, though?</li>
            <li>So basically if you sto using this cream your spots will return rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great on dark rings under your eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 and on the fair side, but olive toned thanks to my Italian roots.  </li>
            <li>I had more luck with the old lemon/lime juice method than I did with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very fair skinned girl with Irish ancestry, so my experience may not be the same as anyone with naturally darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First I want start off by saying that I did not buy this on amazon.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is a very low-end product.  </li>
            <li>But to lighten up your complexion I don&#x27;t know too much about that</li>
            <li>so I was really upset when these spots appeared.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s too much of any moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I works very well.</li>
            <li>I have a darker complexion but this cream didn&#x27;t help me much.  </li>
            <li>It might take a couple weeks to actually notice it&#x27;s working, but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>This felt a little oily and gross on my fairly acne-prone face and chest, but because I didn&#x27;t apply it all over, it didn&#x27;t make me break out that much.</li>
            <li>I used it to remove dark spots on my face (mostly on my forehead) from acne that I get when my period comes around.</li>
            <li>There is a smell to,this product I mainly used it at night.</li>
            <li>If you need more than that, perhaps look elsewhere or use another product before or after this one.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not really sure I&#x27;d recommend this as a first resort.</li>
            <li>Well, it could be a little better.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is well worth $5.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other fancy skin treatments - just Olay moisturizer morning and night - and a little dusting of Bare Minerals foundation (which also happens to be the best daily sunscreen I have ever used!).  </li>
            <li>Years of baking in the sun left me with some hyper-pigmentation on my cheeks, nose, and most recently on my brow bone and upper lip.  </li>
            <li>and I got a little bit more darker than I wanted to starting this new job</li>
            <li>my skin was so clear, use it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li>took something of a chance using it on some of those areas where my skin, and perhaps also yours, tends to be sensitive.</li>
            <li>Under my arms, of course the skin is quite sensitive, but this didn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li>I also want to say that I am a dark skinned African American 20 yr old woman and DID NOT use this product to make me lighter because I love my complexion.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of on and off application I got major results.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t disgustingly potent or anything, but you will notice the smell when you apply it, no matter how thin a layer you put on.</li>
            <li>and i think the diffrence of getting back to your normal color and bleaching to be lightskinn is a big difference, you are obsessed with bleaching if you are trying to be a whole new skin tone thats far from your regular color</li>

            <li> Would have 5 stars if completely cleared my black spots...</li>
            <li> It may give results, but if you care about your skin in the long run I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time the result was always</li>
            <li> but I only used it once every other day</li>
            <li> other big downside for me aside from it</li>
            <li> If you use it with sunscreen it wont dry you out.</li>
            <li> The main reason I give this a negative rating is because it has HQ.  </li>
            <li> I only put the cream where the dark spots were</li>
            <li> The description says it doesn&#x27;t show noticeable effects on very dark skin, so I guess that&#x27;s why the rest of my body, especially the darker areas haven&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> Thousands of dollars spent and zero results.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully they continue to fade in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> My brown spots are due to age spots (46) and freckles.  </li>
            <li> The cream has helped to lighten up my dark indian skin</li>
            <li> So I say if you are trying to get rid of dark spots on your face</li>
            <li> but I believe it should work since it did lighten up dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots on my stomach from shaving.</li>
            <li> If using on a spot that&#x27;s gonna be exposed to the sun, wear sunscreen at least 15 SPF or else the spots will darken back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used that on my face before and it worked at least as well as this in the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So all in all, it took me down about two or three shades in these areas within two weeks.</li>
            <li> (you only need a very small amount), and they began to fade within two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Typically you should apply this twice every day</li>
            <li> and I have been using this for a month and a half.</li>
            <li> that.&lt;br /&gt;Another side note is that it never damaged my clothing or bedding, but maybe you&#x27;ll want to experiment a little to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> feeling a little greasy is the smell.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never ordered this product because it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> this product works in just a few applications at night.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently everyday for almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a few scarred areas on my face and chest, as well as some areas that just have always had darker skin, like under my arms and around my knees.</li>
            <li> Once they were almost gone, I started mixing a small amount into my nightly moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and I had some small acne spots on my forehead.</li>
            <li> and it had to be at least 2 weeks</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After two weeks of on and off application I got major results. Typically you should apply this twice every day but I only used it once every other day and it still worked wonders. An excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and on the fair side, but olive toned thanks to my Italian roots.  Years of baking in the sun left me with some hyper-pigmentation on my cheeks, nose, and most recently on my brow bone and upper lip.  After trying unsuccessfully to cover these spots with makeup, I resorted to laser treatments.  Thousands of dollars spent and zero results.  A friend told me about this cream, and I figured, for such a low price, why not give it a shot.  It works like a dream!  I started by applying it only to my spots at bedtime (you only need a very small amount), and they began to fade within two weeks.  Once they were almost gone, I started mixing a small amount into my nightly moisturizer.  As a result, my skin is brighter and my spots have vanished.  I don&#x27;t use any other fancy skin treatments - just Olay moisturizer morning and night - and a little dusting of Bare Minerals foundation (which also happens to be the best daily sunscreen I have ever used!).  No one is ever able to guess that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, which is just fine by me!</li>
            <li> The cream has helped to lighten up my dark indian skin and I have been using it for three years now and could not be more satisfied at the outcome.</li>
            <li> l just saw my hands this morning and they look really nice, and the spots in my legs are lighter  already</li>
            <li> The main reason I give this a negative rating is because it has HQ.  In my opinion this is a very low-end product.  It may give results, but if you care about your skin in the long run I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> im darkskinned and I got a little bit more darker than I wanted to starting this new job and i used this time to time and i think the diffrence of getting back to your normal color and bleaching to be lightskinn is a big difference, you are obsessed with bleaching if you are trying to be a whole new skin tone thats far from your regular color, for me i just evened it out and try to maintain what i was:)</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT DIMINISH DISCOLORATION AS ADVERTISED. THE SKIN LIGHTENING CREAM DID NOTHING BUT DEHYDRATED MY SKIN!!!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BELLE&lt;br /&gt;WHIGHAM, GEORGIA</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time the result was always great.&lt;br /&gt;I will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it did not work for me.  I also tried the soap with it and it only made my skin look darker.  I wish I had never ordered this product because it was a waste of money.  I would have been better off going to Walgreens and buying something from there to brighten my skin which would have also been cheaper.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Works amazingly well on acne scars.  I have olive color skin and this product works in just a few applications at night.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Would have 5 stars if completely cleared my black spots... However I am pleased. Word to the wise, don&#x27;t put too much on otherwise will scab</li>
            <li> First I want start off by saying that I did not buy this on amazon. My mother bought it for me at a local beauty supply store. I started using it last month and I totally see a difference in my face. I also want to say that I am a dark skinned African American 20 yr old woman and DID NOT use this product to make me lighter because I love my complexion. I used it to remove dark spots on my face (mostly on my forehead) from acne that I get when my period comes around. I only put the cream where the dark spots were and it had to be at least 2 weeks and I noticed results. Today the spots on my forehead and cheeks are almost gone and I have been using this for a month and a half. I used it twice a day, most of the time once a day. So I say if you are trying to get rid of dark spots on your face this product works! But to lighten up your complexion I don&#x27;t know too much about that but I believe it should work since it did lighten up dark spots. Also I did not use the soap..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female. I have some dark spots on my stomach from shaving. I like my stomach so I was really upset when these spots appeared. Anyways, I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently everyday for almost 3 weeks. I DO see some improvement and lightening. They&#x27;re not as noticable, but still there. Hopefully they continue to fade in the next few weeks. Its best to use this product consistently every single day as directed to see results! :) P.S. If using on a spot that&#x27;s gonna be exposed to the sun, wear sunscreen at least 15 SPF or else the spots will darken back.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this product to even out my skin tone. I have about 5 different shades all over my body and I wanted to even it out. This product didn&#x27;t help at all. I&#x27;m on my second one and I have a third bottle waiting to be used. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even going to use it because I&#x27;ve been using this product since February and it is now May. There is no difference, except on my belly. My belly has had different shades on just that area. So now my belly has one shade. The description says it doesn&#x27;t show noticeable effects on very dark skin, so I guess that&#x27;s why the rest of my body, especially the darker areas haven&#x27;t changed. I&#x27;m gonna discontinue using it and find a discoloration lotion. Hopefully that works better on me.</li>
            <li> This cream works! I have medium brown skin and I had some small acne spots on my forehead. Not anymore. After using this for months I the marks are gone. There is a smell to,this product I mainly used it at night. It worked for me</li>
            <li> I like it. It gives my skin an amazing glow. If you use it with sunscreen it wont dry you out. Don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s too much of any moisturizer. Hydroquione is what Dr&#x27;s recommend to fade discoloration. Overall the product is well worth $5. Just purchased my second supply.</li>
            <li> years ago I use this cream and soap to lightening my skin. I works very well. my skin was so clear, use it 2 times a day. Say out of the sun  or use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I used this cream faithfully for one month but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference whatsoever.  My brown spots are due to age spots (46) and freckles.  So maybe it fades some spots better than others or maybe I should have used it even longer but I like instant gratification and if I don&#x27;t see any changes after a month then I&#x27;m going to throw in the towel!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a few scarred areas on my face and chest, as well as some areas that just have always had darker skin, like under my arms and around my knees. I&#x27;m a very fair skinned girl with Irish ancestry, so my experience may not be the same as anyone with naturally darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;I took something of a chance using it on some of those areas where my skin, and perhaps also yours, tends to be sensitive. This felt a little oily and gross on my fairly acne-prone face and chest, but because I didn&#x27;t apply it all over, it didn&#x27;t make me break out that much. This balances out for me since it means it&#x27;s not drying. Under my arms, of course the skin is quite sensitive, but this didn&#x27;t irritate at all. I even applied this about an hour or two after shaving without any burn. So just in case you wanted it for that purpose, there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;Another side note is that it never damaged my clothing or bedding, but maybe you&#x27;ll want to experiment a little to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;As far as how effective it is, though? Well, it could be a little better. After a week or so, I noticed it was a bit lighter, though not as light as I intended. After two weeks, it was almost where I wanted it. After that, it stopped lightening. So all in all, it took me down about two or three shades in these areas within two weeks. If you need more than that, perhaps look elsewhere or use another product before or after this one.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not really sure I&#x27;d recommend this as a first resort. Like someone else said here, the various treatments using lemon, lime, papaya, etc. tend to do the same thing. I&#x27;ve used that on my face before and it worked at least as well as this in the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;The other big downside for me aside from it feeling a little greasy is the smell. This isn&#x27;t disgustingly potent or anything, but you will notice the smell when you apply it, no matter how thin a layer you put on.</li>
            <li> So basically if you sto using this cream your spots will return rather quickly. within about 2 to 3 weeks. I did enjoy the benefits for a while when I would put it on every day! So if you do that then you will be good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. it met my expectation</li>
            <li> Works great on dark rings under your eyes. It might take a couple weeks to actually notice it&#x27;s working, but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have a darker complexion but this cream didn&#x27;t help me much.  I had more luck with the old lemon/lime juice method than I did with this.</li>
            <li> The area on my neck in which I am using the Crusader Cream, I haven&#x27;t seen any results.  However, it may be to soon to tell.</li>
