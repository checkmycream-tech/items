            <li>This is great tool to have, especially for me, in a salon setting...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price, but not when it only lasts 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>kinda cheap.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable for the girlfriend to sit on while she paints.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t roll smooth when your sitting on it.</li>
            <li>But it is a comfortable seat.</li>
            <li>The wheels glide smoothly and the hydraulic functions well.  </li>
            <li>smoothly moves on the carpet.</li>
            <li>I thought this was so fabulous</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product at such a great price!</li>
            <li>Wheels move smoothly and are very supportive for adult men and women.</li>
            <li>very comfortable, too.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and the delivery was very prompt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the seat is perfect size for me and wont take much space, my previous one was bulky couldn&#x27;t maneuver from room to room, this solved the problem.</li>
            <li>only thing is if it can rise 1&#x27; more in height it would have been even greater.</li>
            <li>and the padding is comfortable and rebounds cleanly after very use.</li>
            <li>It assembled easily and was ready to go in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Assembly was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>Its a great stool for studio use and not to heavy.</li>
            <li>Hydraulic system is very quite and smooth.</li>
            <li>so I need to be able to move rather smoothly and quietly around the massage table.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A very positive experience.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly &amp; was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It rolls right out of the way.</li>
            <li>The upholstery grips just right,</li>
            <li>very very easy to assemble, took only a minute.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only rated to 250.So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have back problems (spinal stenosis) and can&#x27;t stand or walk for more than a minute or so.  </li>
            <li>The seat is soft and cushioned, the wheels roll smoothly with no hesitation.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and comfortable...great buy!  </li>
            <li>Once I got it together though, it&#x27;s been exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>5 star rating for providing a product exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
            <li>My son is newly paralyzed and didn&#x27;t fit through some of our doors, he uses this to get into some rooms, then collapses his wheelchair to navigate our old house</li>
            <li>I just needed a basic stool to sit on for patient interviews and some bodywork and this will do just fine.</li>
            <li>This stool can be used for many purposes, in salon, kitchen, office etc, my little one is having fun rotating on it.</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that I can roll it from place to place, instead of lift it, makes life much easier for me.  </li>
            <li>The stool works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have a desk in the kitchen and didn&#x27;t want to have a chair that would take up too much room.  </li>
            <li>but this occurrence is very seldom.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a really sturdy chair.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, quiet, rolls easily and holds up to long use.  </li>
            <li>Very useful in massage practice while sitting to work on neck area of client.&lt;br /&gt;Adjustment capability of stool makes my work easier when adjusting for individual clients.</li>
            <li>Seems to be decent quality.  </li>
            <li>The wheels are kind of hard to pop in.</li>
            <li>a replacement part would at least be nice.</li>
            <li>It is able to handle various heights for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble, stable base, and the hydraulic lift works great.  </li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY what I needed, it has changed my daily life!  </li>
            <li>I pulled the wheels off (tough but not impossible with a heavy rope tied in a clove hitch and a strong back)  to make it lower and more stable.  </li>
            <li>This stool is good for the money, but the wheels keep breaking and their customer service will only send a new wheel after I send them a photo of a broken wheel.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy I bought this stool as I have a bad back</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t break or do anything unexpected, so how could anyone complain?  </li>
            <li>the cushion is soft yet sturdy.</li>
            <li>If you want basic, simple, comfortable, quiet, and rolls on carpet with ease give this stool a shot!!</li>
            <li>is so far.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it adjusts to different heights, as we also have several caregivers that sometimes assist with his care  1 caregiver is 6ft tall, and the other caregiver is about 5 ft 1 in.</li>
            <li>However if you&#x27;re up and down, as I am, this unit is quite adequate for the task.  </li>
            <li>an associate bought one for half the price that looks the same, with a white top, and the bottom leg area was too broad and always tripping everyone who passed by it.</li>
            <li>Will definitely refer to this particular seller if anyone needs a stool in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sitting for several hrs at a time on this thing, but it rolls its soft and it&#x27;s adjustable...</li>
            <li>if your heavy set or need a thicker padding, you need to spend the $$ and get the higher priced one....</li>
            <li>I spent quite a bit of time pricing a rolling stool for my new massage practice room and was dismayed at the pricing on massage supply websites.  </li>
            <li>What this means is that about two weeks (the time it takes them to mail one) out of every other month I have to balance on 4 wheels while I wait for the new wheel to arrive.  </li>

            <li> It is very sturdy and comfortable...great buy!  </li>

            <li> 5 star rating for providing a product exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
            <li> My son is newly paralyzed and didn&#x27;t fit through some of our doors, he uses this to get into some rooms, then collapses his wheelchair to navigate our old house</li>
            <li> I just needed a basic stool to sit on for patient interviews and some bodywork and this will do just fine.</li>
            <li> This stool can be used for many purposes, in salon, kitchen, office etc, my little one is having fun rotating on it.</li>
            <li> Also, the fact that I can roll it from place to place, instead of lift it, makes life much easier for me.  </li>
            <li> The stool works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have a desk in the kitchen and didn&#x27;t want to have a chair that would take up too much room.  </li>
            <li> but this occurrence is very seldom.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a really sturdy chair.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, quiet, rolls easily and holds up to long use.  </li>
            <li> Very useful in massage practice while sitting to work on neck area of client.&lt;br /&gt;Adjustment capability of stool makes my work easier when adjusting for individual clients.</li>
            <li> Seems to be decent quality.  </li>
            <li> The wheels are kind of hard to pop in.</li>
            <li> a replacement part would at least be nice.</li>
            <li> It is able to handle various heights for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, stable base, and the hydraulic lift works great.  </li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what I needed, it has changed my daily life!  </li>
            <li> I pulled the wheels off (tough but not impossible with a heavy rope tied in a clove hitch and a strong back)  to make it lower and more stable.  </li>
            <li> This stool is good for the money, but the wheels keep breaking and their customer service will only send a new wheel after I send them a photo of a broken wheel.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought this stool as I have a bad back</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t break or do anything unexpected, so how could anyone complain?  </li>
            <li> the cushion is soft yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> If you want basic, simple, comfortable, quiet, and rolls on carpet with ease give this stool a shot!!</li>
            <li> is so far.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it adjusts to different heights, as we also have several caregivers that sometimes assist with his care  1 caregiver is 6ft tall, and the other caregiver is about 5 ft 1 in.</li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re up and down, as I am, this unit is quite adequate for the task.  </li>
            <li> an associate bought one for half the price that looks the same, with a white top, and the bottom leg area was too broad and always tripping everyone who passed by it.</li>
            <li> Will definitely refer to this particular seller if anyone needs a stool in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sitting for several hrs at a time on this thing, but it rolls its soft and it&#x27;s adjustable...</li>
            <li> if your heavy set or need a thicker padding, you need to spend the $$ and get the higher priced one....</li>
            <li> I spent quite a bit of time pricing a rolling stool for my new massage practice room and was dismayed at the pricing on massage supply websites.  </li>
            <li> What this means is that about two weeks (the time it takes them to mail one) out of every other month I have to balance on 4 wheels while I wait for the new wheel to arrive.  </li>
            <li> So far holding up without any problems since I received it a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this stool for very long</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will hold up over the long run, but so far (10 days)</li>
            <li> only complaint from me is that the seat is a little too small for me to sit comfortably.</li>
            <li> I like the wide range of heights and</li>
            <li> wheel fell out within a few short months of purchase.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it rolls smoothly because I am on the lighter side or if the amount of weight is irrelevant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered a couple of times to increase our fleet and have been using them since May of 2013 with no problems, big or small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell these days if something made in china is gonna last.</li>
            <li> at times I need to sit down while working or doing extensions.</li>
            <li> Faster delivery than expected!!</li>
            <li> Takes less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that at this (very reasonable) price (I&#x27;d shopped around everywhere)</li>
            <li> I use it to assist with the care that my disabled family member requires.  </li>
            <li> Rolls well, sturdy, but the cushion is a little small.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not designed for all-day comfort, as the padding in the seat starts to feel a bit hard after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> The seat settles a few inches after you&#x27;ve sat on it, a bit unsettling and also makes it difficult to adjust if different people are using it.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I might be too heavy for it,since I&#x27;m 300 lbs</li>
            <li> The stool arrived poorly packaged, in a box meant to be shipped to a store, not via UPS.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed and probably the last time ill order off amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had this stool approximately 12 days and 2 wheels have already busted off of it rendering it completely useless.  </li>
            <li> Rest of chair was holding up... but now useless.  </li>
            <li> It is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> It was impossible for me to get around the house to do my chores.  </li>
            <li> I had trepidation about making this purchase, based on some of the bad reviews.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the cushion is comfier than I thought it would be.I was afraid I might be too heavy for it,since I&#x27;m 300 lbs and it&#x27;s only rated to 250.So far so good. It assembled easily and was ready to go in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what I needed, it has changed my daily life!  I have back problems (spinal stenosis) and can&#x27;t stand or walk for more than a minute or so.  It was impossible for me to get around the house to do my chores.  Then I got this stool, and it is perfect!  I easily scoot along the kitchen cooking and cleaning; use it to pick up through the living room; etc.  I can do everything again, with no pain!  I was afraid that at this (very reasonable) price (I&#x27;d shopped around everywhere) the stool would be flimsy or unreliable, but no, it&#x27;s just perfect.  It&#x27;s solid, sturdy, supports over 200 lbs. no problem.  The seat is soft and cushioned, the wheels roll smoothly with no hesitation.  I am happy every day that I have it!  Really nice and prompt customer service too.  Puts together in a minute.  HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!</li>
            <li> Super product, works great! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great Chair - my estheticians love it.  Very comfortable and rolls easily - even on the carpet.</li>
            <li> Easy assembly. Seems to be decent quality.  I just needed a basic stool to sit on for patient interviews and some bodywork and this will do just fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for your butt.  it doesn&#x27;t break or do anything unexpected, so how could anyone complain?  I pulled the wheels off (tough but not impossible with a heavy rope tied in a clove hitch and a strong back)  to make it lower and more stable.  works good.</li>
            <li> All the way up was still too low</li>
            <li> Love it so far! The chair is comfortable, light, and seems to be of good quality. It&#x27;s hard to tell these days if something made in china is gonna last. But, we&#x27;ll see, won&#x27;t we?</li>
            <li> came on time and it is perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Fantastic chair for the value. I&#x27;ll likely order another.</li>
            <li> cheap is as cheap is made. Rest of chair was holding up... but now useless.  a replacement part would at least be nice.</li>
            <li> This is great tool to have, especially for me, in a salon setting...at times I need to sit down while working or doing extensions. Very sturdy and good quality. Also, easy to put together.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and comfortable...great buy!  Perfect for using and rolling under the desk to save room!</li>
            <li> This stool is really nice I would tell a friend that this product nice.</li>
            <li> The stool arrived poorly packaged, in a box meant to be shipped to a store, not via UPS.  The box had holes in it, thankfully all the parts were still in there.  It is very poorly made. One of the plastic legs had a hole the size of a quarter knocked out of the top of it. Assembly was fast and easy. The seat settles a few inches after you&#x27;ve sat on it, a bit unsettling and also makes it difficult to adjust if different people are using it.  I couldn&#x27;t be bothered repackaging it for return, I just threw it out.  The price was attractive, but it really turned out to be a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> Rolls well, sturdy, but the cushion is a little small.  Casters seem to be mid grade in quality.  Definitely a good value.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, stable base, and the hydraulic lift works great.  Seat is not well padded, but is sufficient for short visits.</li>
            <li> My son is newly paralyzed and didn&#x27;t fit through some of our doors, he uses this to get into some rooms, then collapses his wheelchair to navigate our old house</li>
            <li> I am a teacher and use the stool at my reading table.  The adjustable height is nice and the seat&lt;br /&gt;is very comfortable, too.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and the delivery was very prompt.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for me.  I use it to assist with the care that my disabled family member requires.  He needs assistance with all activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing, putting on shoes, and exercising.  This stool SAVES MY BACK AND KNEES, when I need to exercise his leg, exercise his arm, put on his pants, put on his socks, splints and shoes.  Then, of course, it also helps me when I take all of his clothing off at the end of the day.  I love the fact that it adjusts to different heights, as we also have several caregivers that sometimes assist with his care  1 caregiver is 6ft tall, and the other caregiver is about 5 ft 1 in., so this 1 stool works easily for all of us.  Also, the fact that I can roll it from place to place, instead of lift it, makes life much easier for me.  I have had this stool for several months now, I use it daily, and it has remained sturdy and dependable.  So, it works well for us and the price was the cheapest that I found for adjustable height and 5 rolling wheels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say that I made a great find!</li>
            <li> The stool works very well for my needs. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected. I would order again!</li>
            <li> Looking for a handy stool? This is it. I like the wide range of heights and the cushion is soft yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tell the boys it&#x27;s a salon chair.  I use it in my shop!  I roll under trucks and stuff.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I like it for my needs, but would not recommend it to a person over 150lbs. max, preferably smaller.  Assembly was very easy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase! It shipped quickly &amp; was exactly as described. I appreciate also that it was very easy to assemble!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. The stood is easy to assemble, sturdy and comfortable to sit on.  Wheeled casters give you mobility if you&#x27;re doing multiple tasks while seated.</li>
            <li> This stool is perfect for the esthetician in my office.  It was very easy to put together.  The adjustable height is nice. It is very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;and rolls easily.</li>
            <li> If you can get a good rpice get this. Its a great stool for studio use and not to heavy.</li>
            <li> I have a desk in the kitchen and didn&#x27;t want to have a chair that would take up too much room.  It rolls right out of the way.</li>
            <li> Basic to put together. Takes less than 10 minutes. My concern was I couldn&#x27;t find a stool that rolled well on carpet. I have a Reiki practice and carpeted floors so I need to be able to move rather smoothly and quietly around the massage table. It meets both those expectations. I am not sure if it rolls smoothly because I am on the lighter side or if the amount of weight is irrelevant. If you want basic, simple, comfortable, quiet, and rolls on carpet with ease give this stool a shot!!</li>
            <li> We use this product in our primary care clinic and it works well and looks great. No complaints from the physician or staff.</li>
            <li> I bought this stool for my massage room and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Works great and was easy to assemble. Great product.</li>
            <li> Very smooth movement and cushion is comfortable.  Faster delivery than expected!!</li>
            <li> Great price and a great stool.  So far holding up without any problems since I received it a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Very easy to assemble.  Seems to be well built and has held up to daily use.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This chair is not the one pictured, the seat is a lot smaller. Really disappointed and probably the last time ill order off amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had this stool approximately 12 days and 2 wheels have already busted off of it rendering it completely useless.  It&#x27;s a great price, but not when it only lasts 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful stool and super easy to put together. Might need a strong arm to put it together though. The wheels are kind of hard to pop in. Once I got it together though, it&#x27;s been exactly what I needed. I&#x27;m a student massage therapist and this stool is perfect for when I work on a client&#x27;s neck. Sometimes the hydraulics can seem kind of jumpy/noisy and throw off my client&#x27;s relaxation... but this occurrence is very seldom. Thank you so much for this product at such a great price!</li>
            <li> eh.  kinda cheap.  wheel fell out within a few short months of purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to use at work.  She has not had any problems with is so far.  It is able to handle various heights for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very reasonable price.  I use this stool often and feel it is a good quality.</li>
            <li> Very useful in massage practice while sitting to work on neck area of client.&lt;br /&gt;Adjustment capability of stool makes my work easier when adjusting for individual clients.</li>
            <li> Stool is fine...only complaint from me is that the seat is a little too small for me to sit comfortably.</li>
            <li> easy to use and comfortable</li>
            <li> I spent quite a bit of time pricing a rolling stool for my new massage practice room and was dismayed at the pricing on massage supply websites.  I was thrilled to find this stool on Amazon with good ratings and a good price, but had some concerns about reported issues with the hydraulics.  This stool was shipped in four pieces and literally slid together--no tools required.  Hydraulics worked immediately.  It&#x27;s comfortable, quiet, rolls easily and holds up to long use.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought lots of stools over the years for work. this one is the best. I had trepidation about making this purchase, based on some of the bad reviews. but my stool turned out great. easy to put together. easy to move around. I don&#x27;t trip over it. comfy. everything I wanted in a stool. an associate bought one for half the price that looks the same, with a white top, and the bottom leg area was too broad and always tripping everyone who passed by it. Thank goodness this one is not like that! Perfect.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this item.  Assembly was really easy and it&#x27;s a really sturdy chair.  You can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price here.</li>
            <li> Put it together in about 1-2 minutes, wheels snapped on and everything else just slides together. Comfortable for the girlfriend to sit on while she paints.</li>
            <li> Great stools! We have ordered extras after all my stylists anonymously agreed that they were a nice fit for our salon. Wheels move smoothly and are very supportive for adult men and women. The upholstery grips just right, and the padding is comfortable and rebounds cleanly after very use. I&#x27;ve reordered a couple of times to increase our fleet and have been using them since May of 2013 with no problems, big or small. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> 5 star rating for providing a product exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality. Easy to order. Arrived when expected.&lt;br /&gt;Zero issues or complaints.&lt;br /&gt;A very positive experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sitting for several hrs at a time on this thing, but it rolls its soft and it&#x27;s adjustable...if your heavy set or need a thicker padding, you need to spend the $$ and get the higher priced one....this one suits me just fine for the price and does it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good stool.  It&#x27;s not designed for all-day comfort, as the padding in the seat starts to feel a bit hard after a couple of hours.  However if you&#x27;re up and down, as I am, this unit is quite adequate for the task.  Not sure how it will hold up over the long run, but so far (10 days) it&#x27;s been quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble. Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t roll smooth when your sitting on it. But it is a comfortable seat. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Shelby&amp;#34; classic stool works great for my craft room.  The wheels glide smoothly and the hydraulic functions well.  Great product and good price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this stool for very long so I don&#x27;t know what its wear and tear rating will be.  It was very easy to put together, rolls easily, is comfortable to sit on and has a satisfactory height adjustment.  For now I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought this stool as I have a bad back and I use it in my kitchen so I  can scoot around in the kitchen and get things out of lower cabinet so i dont have to bend over. Thanks for a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Its a perfect size for me, using it while doing facials in my salon. smoothly moves on the carpet. very very easy to assemble, took only a minute. the seat is perfect size for me and wont take much space, my previous one was bulky couldn&#x27;t maneuver from room to room, this solved the problem. only thing is if it can rise 1&#x27; more in height it would have been even greater. Hydraulic system is very quite and smooth. This stool can be used for many purposes, in salon, kitchen, office etc, my little one is having fun rotating on it. price is great too, on the whole I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I thought this was so fabulous, I bought a second one!  Love using while working in the kitchen and my office!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Will use again if need arises.  Will definitely refer to this particular seller if anyone needs a stool in the future.</li>
            <li> This stool is good for the money, but the wheels keep breaking and their customer service will only send a new wheel after I send them a photo of a broken wheel.  What this means is that about two weeks (the time it takes them to mail one) out of every other month I have to balance on 4 wheels while I wait for the new wheel to arrive.  They are courteous, but I wish they would use better wheels or just send me some extras...</li>
            <li> works well. Comfortable.</li>
