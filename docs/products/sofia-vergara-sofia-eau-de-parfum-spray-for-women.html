            <li>Very nice, soft, not overpowering perfume.  </li>
            <li>this is not sugar sweet smelling fragrance!</li>
            <li>The fragrance fades very quickly, as well.</li>
            <li>has a fruity &amp; lightly floral scent to it.</li>
            <li>It turned on me and smelled like cheap purfume...</li>
            <li>If you think Sofia Vergara is hot you will love her perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance so much!  </li>
            <li>but I smelled it on a friend and it is so unique.</li>
            <li>it came in a well protected package as well as the box was sealed in the original plastic.</li>
            <li>nothing special.  </li>

            <li>Not a girly scent, more like a perfume for a young woman.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not even the right perfume in the box.</li>
            <li>Very trust worthy company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and just lovely, with hints of rose, sandalwood, berries, cloves and just a touch of vanilla.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I normally wear CoCo Channel and I must admit I get a lot more compliments (especially from men)</li>
            <li>I mix it in the palm of my hand with Bath &amp; Body Work&#x27;s True Blue Spa Fragrance-Free Shea Butter Super Rich Body Cream (formerly known as &amp;#34;Lay</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s a little too powdery for me, smells too much like my Grandma&#x27;s perfume.</li>

            <li> I usually don&#x27;t go for these &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband even likes it ( on me) and he&#x27;s hard to please</li>
            <li> perfume is so hard....</li>
            <li> Not to flowery, delicate and inviting.  </li>
            <li> On Thick Shea Butter Body Cream&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Brand new packages, Hate to give it as a gift always want to keep it for myself and do!</li>
            <li> So I am keeping  the wrong perfume</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t get the bad reviews!!!!  This stuff smells FANTASTIC!!!  I get compliments like crazy when I am wearing this!!!  Have tons of designer perfumes and this BY FAR THE BEST!!!! AND it lasts!!!!!!!!  Thank you SOFIA!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for herself, and honestly i dont love it.  Its maybe a step above that spray you use in the bathroom when your done with your business.  I think Sofia herself would have trouble pulling this off.  Lo siento mi amor.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I ordered this for my mom for Christmas. I just received the box yesterday and it&#x27;s not even the right perfume in the box. So if I send it back to exchange it I won&#x27;t have a present for her Christmas. So I am keeping  the wrong perfume and I hope she likes it. I guess if she doesn&#x27;t care for it after christmas I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> If you think Sofia Vergara is hot you will love her perfume.  It&#x27;s smell great and it knock my socks off every time my puts it on.  No blue pill needed fellas.  Lol.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail about three days early. I love this perfume. I lady walked up to me and said u smelled so good. This is something I can wear all year long.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent! It&#x27;s not overly strong &amp; stinky like that high priced crap at Dillards.&lt;br /&gt;This has a fruity &amp; lightly floral scent to it. Can&#x27;t believe it last long all day &amp; night.&lt;br /&gt;I only sprayed it on my arms &amp; chest and I can still smell it on me once I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that&#x27;s lasts longer &amp; that is not strong. I suggest you pick this one up. I&#x27;m getting a bigger bottle since they&#x27;re selling like hot cakes.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase. Good size bottle and it smells wonderful! I highly recommend!!</li>

            <li> Love the scent....love Sofia!!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, and price was very good compared with stores and discount perfume retailers</li>
            <li> A fresh, delightful fragrance and non offensive, spray. Liked by more people than any perfume I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, good value. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a different take on the whole Celebrity Fragrance trend. It&#x27;s actually very nice. Not a girly scent, more like a perfume for a young woman. Very very nice. I didn&#x27;t care for the bottle, though... All in all, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wow this smells awsome. My husband even likes it ( on me) and he&#x27;s hard to please</li>
            <li> It has become my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I normally wear CoCo Channel and I must admit I get a lot more compliments (especially from men) when I wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Fragrant, but soft &amp; alluring fragrance.  Dress up or dress down, this fragrance will work.  Why not have a variety in your collection, add this one?</li>
            <li> My signature smell., I love this perfume so much and I always get compliments and Questions about the perfume.. &amp; how great I smell lol ALWAYS!! I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I love the scent for buying this and not ever smelling - LOVE</li>
            <li> This smells remarkably like Bath &amp; Body Works &amp;#34;Warm Vanilla Sugar&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s pleasant, but not at all unique. The fragrance fades very quickly, as well. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft, not overpowering perfume.  Thank you Sofia!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this bought 2 for gifts for Christmas</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive one compliment and my son told me I smelled like am old lady.  I am only 47...way to young to be called an old lady.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance so much!  The fragrance lasts a long time also.</li>
            <li> LOVELY LOVELY SCENT!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect , I was pleasantly surprised with the fragrance. I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> this is not sugar sweet smelling fragrance! it is not overpowering but is subtle and very gentle. i highly recomend it fir women who like s gentle fragrance!</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift from my husband. This is my favorite perfume that I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s subtle and just lovely, with hints of rose, sandalwood, berries, cloves and just a touch of vanilla. Slightly sweet, slightly spicy, but very mellow and not too flowery. Perfectly balanced. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing like this. I usually don&#x27;t go for these &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; celebrity perfumes but I smelled it on a friend and it is so unique. Perfectly my personality. Constant compliments and a huge bottle for low cost.</li>
            <li> llove this. Not to flowery, delicate and inviting.  iuse with the body lotion to layer the scents.</li>
            <li> I love it, I ordered one, and when I received, I decided to order 5 more for mother day and one for my 10 years old daughter, thanks sofia</li>
            <li> smell really bad like a cheap perfume</li>
            <li> One of my total obsessions!  And take it everywhere I go!  I mix it in the palm of my hand with Bath &amp; Body Work&#x27;s True Blue Spa Fragrance-Free Shea Butter Super Rich Body Cream (formerly known as &amp;#34;Lay It On Thick Shea Butter Body Cream&amp;#34;.  I squeeze my palm closed with a quarter-sized amount of the cream in my hand so it&#x27;s spread out across my palm, then I pump two-to-three sprays of Sofia on top of the cream, rub my palms together, then rub it in. The body-cream helps the fragrance last even longer.  And it lingers nicely in your clothes after you&#x27;ve worn them (no stinky clothes in the hamper)!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Perfumes are my weakness, and this one does not disappoint.  The bottle is a work of art, and the perfume is lovely. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li> its not what I thought.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SPICY LATIN FRAGRANCE IT STAYS ALL DAY</li>
            <li> Do not like this. It turned on me and smelled like cheap purfume...</li>
            <li> Smells good. .. but the sent doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME SMELLS AMAZING!  LOVE IT!!!  OTHERS LOVE IT ALSO!  YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> Perfume smells great....but doesn&#x27;t last long!!!!</li>
            <li> I love my Sophia perfume!</li>
            <li> Love it! People always asked me what perfume I am wearing! Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> My favorite new perfume!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with my purchase! it came in a well protected package as well as the box was sealed in the original plastic. After opening it I looked and smelled it and it had not been sprayed before and it works great! Very trust worthy company. I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Roxanne Sugameli</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. nothing special.  scent does not last long on me.  nothing special.  disappointed as I love SV and was expecting more.  Perhaps the scent just didn&#x27;t mix well with my chemistry?  perfume is so hard....</li>
            <li> I love Sofia Vergara so I wanted to try it out and it&#x27;s a little too powdery for me, smells too much like my Grandma&#x27;s perfume. Surprised me since Sofia is anything but Grandma.</li>
