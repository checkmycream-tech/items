            <li>but very happy so far....</li>
            <li>Its a WONDERFUL starter kit to do your own nails at home for single moms that don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend to get their nails done!</li>
            <li>it brings everything you need and more</li>
            <li>My soon to be daughter love the set</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but i wish it had a bit more like more polish.</li>
            <li>I suggest ordering a UV gel top coat [not included] and additional brush or two for switching colors.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my kit.</li>
            <li>First of all, it didn&#x27;t send a good nail brush.</li>
            <li>But based on what I seen I&#x27;m really happy came with everything it said was surprised it came with top coat</li>
            <li>Great so far.  </li>
            <li>Such beautiful, eye-catching glitter colors are pictured and the brand OPI....</li>
            <li>The whole kit itself has EVERYTHING you need to start doing your own nails at home.</li>
            <li>Overall, great price for what you get.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great set</li>
            <li>Other than those 3 things this is a great starter kit</li>
            <li>made everything super sticky.</li>
            <li>White gel has been more challenging to cure .</li>
            <li>fun kit</li>
            <li>Success achieved by going thinner than usual with the white and doing more coats [but that also means more time, to apply, more rounds of curing, and more UV exposure on your hands].  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to contact the seller to get full instructions from them directly before deciding to return.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was very please with the upgrade I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>HOW LONG I KEPT MY HAND UNDER THE UV LIGHT.</li>
            <li>, you get more than enough product for the price... definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend to a beginner.</li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you are a beginner to gel nails as it doesn&#x27;t provide good instructions (better off with a youtube video) and can be a little complicated to use.</li>
            <li>THE GEL WAS STICKY AND NEVER COMPLETELY DRIED REGARDLESS</li>
            <li>the only thing I would say this kit really lacked would be directions.</li>
            <li>I also tried putting the white tips on first [since they were peeling off separately when applied over the clear or pink] and curing the clear gel over the white tips..</li>
            <li>GREAT deal, just a little disappointed that the extra light bulb was not also shipped.</li>
            <li>but the white tips still peeled taking the clear layer with it.  </li>
            <li>Some items in kit are not labeled in English - I have figured out that the bottle that looks like the topcoat is most likely the primer [thin, smells like vinegar] or it could be considereddehydrator.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing at least as much preparation as I used to with my former kit [IBD from Sally Beauty Supply at 3x the price], and those lasted several weeks, generally never peeled, and required fill in at new growth.  </li>
            <li>I have done 1 manicure, so I can confirm that Clear and Pink builder gels properly cure in 2 minutes.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This not what i though it was i wil not ordered one again and the nail don&#x27;t stay on your hand</li>
            <li> Great packaging uv works great and everything was in the box</li>
            <li> I just received my package today... Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet..... But based on what I seen I&#x27;m really happy came with everything it said was surprised it came with top coat but very happy so far.... And I read every review and my lamp does work I put the bulb in and plugged it in.... And to the person who said that they don&#x27;t stay on you might need a primer which you need to order separately otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work correctly for gel nails or acrylic.... And I have been doing acrylics for about a year..... My only question is does this gel self level? When I use the kit I will come back and do an update on my review.....</li>
            <li> this is a great buy! I&#x27;d recommend it to my family and friends...it brings everything you need and more</li>
            <li> My soon to be daughter love the set and she used it a few time already. thank you.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. First of all, it didn&#x27;t send a good nail brush. Second, i was shorted the 4 way nail file. Then to to it all off it didn&#x27;t come with instructions. It&#x27;s so bad that I&#x27;m sending it back. Oooh and did i mention that the items/name brands that draw your attention to this photo are not going to be what you actually receive. Such beautiful, eye-catching glitter colors are pictured and the brand OPI....well nothing beautiful about the colors I received and I definitely did not receive anything that OPI.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected....</li>
            <li> THE GEL WAS STICKY AND NEVER COMPLETELY DRIED REGARDLESS HOW LONG I KEPT MY HAND UNDER THE UV LIGHT. WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Really amazing products . You need to know how to do gel nails in order to use it because it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions . Other than that it is a great set</li>
            <li> No instruction to make it simple for a starting little girl.</li>
            <li> The package came in on time, and actually sooner than i was expecting. The whole kit itself has EVERYTHING you need to start doing your own nails at home. The only thing that was missing in the kit was the extra light bulb for the lamp, which was disappointing. As soon as i opened the kit, i did mine and my sisters nails. GREAT deal, just a little disappointed that the extra light bulb was not also shipped.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to start making beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> I love it it came on time and everything was nice and not spilled i would recommend</li>
            <li> the only thing I would say this kit really lacked would be directions.</li>
            <li> Every thing is good came on time nothing was broke will use them again</li>
            <li> fun kit but i wish it had a bit more like more polish. edit 5/22/15 i took the lamp out put in the bulb and nothing it was so depressing</li>
            <li> I got my kit yesterday and I had to through away all my UV gel because it was all opened and leaked out made everything super sticky. And its techinally not a full nail kit it doesn&#x27;t even come with a tool to cut the nails.</li>
            <li> My pink and white gels came with no seal and they were covered and gel and made them sticky. Didnt receive the nail glue either. Brush wasnt sized needed to apply gel. Other than those 3 things this is a great starter kit</li>
            <li> 12/16/14  Update: Despite following instructions for the Sina product found elsewhere online, the product is still peeling off within days of manicure application [as some other reviews also mentioned].  I&#x27;m doing at least as much preparation as I used to with my former kit [IBD from Sally Beauty Supply at 3x the price], and those lasted several weeks, generally never peeled, and required fill in at new growth.  NOW, I AM going thinner than I used to with each layer to compensate for the curing challenge mentioned before, so that may be a factor.  I also tried putting the white tips on first [since they were peeling off separately when applied over the clear or pink] and curing the clear gel over the white tips.. but the white tips still peeled taking the clear layer with it.  I&#x27;m going to contact the seller to get full instructions from them directly before deciding to return.  As I mentioned before, kit did not come with a primer, it does have an unmarked [in English] bottle that smells like vinegar, which a manicurist suggested was the dehydrator - so I&#x27;ve been using it as that.  The addition of a primer may solve the issue, but that should have come with the kit.  There are differing opinions amongst instructional videos on whether primer is needed, or if a thin layer of builder gel will suffice as the primer. Stay Tuned    12/9/14  Great so far.  Kit included everything advertised [photo attached as received]. No instructions are included [advertised as a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; kit] but I found instructions here: http://www.nailsxo.com/creating-uv-gel-nails/#Q3  And YouTube video instructions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Fbs_rKeFZsA  Without instructions, some reviewers may not have done sufficient nail prep to have a successful experience.  I&#x27;ll do an update after a few manicures.  Some items in kit are not labeled in English - I have figured out that the bottle that looks like the topcoat is most likely the primer [thin, smells like vinegar] or it could be considereddehydrator.  I&#x27;m requesting instructions with photos from seller [will post here if I get them]    Products appear to be good quality.  I have done 1 manicure, so I can confirm that Clear and Pink builder gels properly cure in 2 minutes.  White gel has been more challenging to cure . Success achieved by going thinner than usual with the white and doing more coats [but that also means more time, to apply, more rounds of curing, and more UV exposure on your hands].  Overall, great price for what you get.  Note: I suggest ordering a UV gel top coat [not included] and additional brush or two for switching colors.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my kit. Its a WONDERFUL starter kit to do your own nails at home for single moms that don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend to get their nails done! Love my choice in purchasing this!</li>
            <li> As soon as we plugged up the uv lamp it started smoking.!! Do not buy</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit. I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you are a beginner to gel nails as it doesn&#x27;t provide good instructions (better off with a youtube video) and can be a little complicated to use. Overall I like the set, you get more than enough product for the price... definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend to a beginner.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very please with the upgrade I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I hope it all works. Can&#x27;t wait to get started.</li>
