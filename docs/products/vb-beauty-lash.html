            <li>She had wonderful results after using it for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>The best gift ever!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great discovery!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF !!!</li>
            <li>I bought one tube from another site, and was so happy with the results; I decided to stock up here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, my lashes are noticeably longer after about 7 weeks.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any darkening of my lashes, which I was hoping for, but they look so great, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>I am happy I bought this product.</li>
            <li>OK but not the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for years, and I didn&#x27;t think it was effective for me anymore.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think this was going to work.  </li>
            <li>Very easy application.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this lash enhancer.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed and ordered the VB Beauty Lash that same week.</li>
            <li>be sure to place it on evenly</li>
            <li>The is definitely one of the best lash growth products on the market.  </li>
            <li>And I have tried many of them.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love my eyebrows now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference as more time passes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another one for myself and my mom now !:)</li>
            <li>After 3 months consistent use, she now has gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li>Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li>have very fair skin and brown eyelashes that turn blonde on the ends.</li>
            <li>My lashes look incredibly more full and are still getting longer.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>It does cause some light irritation and the area where I applied</li>
            <li>I bought this to stimulate hair growth and it seems to be working since each time I go to get my lash extensions filled</li>
            <li>I have referred this product to several friends and all are seeing great results.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have filled in the damage I did from years of overplucking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>So, the product is effective or none effective on individual level.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this so far!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if this product was going to work, but sure enough after 3 weeks or more I saw results,  people are always asking if I have falsies, I love that it made my lashes grow with no side effects</li>
            <li>If the serum is used on the area which is naturally rich with hair follicles, the growth can be stimulated.</li>
            <li>So fun to tell them they&#x27;re my lashes!</li>
            <li>No kidding, after 4 weeks lashes were thicker significantly...</li>
            <li>They started to fill in visibly in about 30 days, but as I continued to use this product, the really great thing is that my lashes got LONGER, darker and noticeably thicker (after the first 45 days, I got a new gentler, non-waterproof mascara, and new eyelash curler with easily replaceable pads...</li>
            <li>Made my eyes bright red for two days and my lids sore and swollen!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey to run out so quickly.</li>
            <li>It works really well!!</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing considering that most with this active ingredient cost 3-4 times as much.</li>
            <li>VB Beauty Lash has gotten my lashes nice and long again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to curl them anymore because they are long and curl on their own.  </li>
            <li>Better eyelashes than when I was a teen.</li>
            <li>It has given me the exact RESULTS that I was searching for.  </li>
            <li>It does help with lashes but not so much with eyebrows in my experience.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to soak your lashes with the product.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>And I think it&#x27;s working on my very sparse eyebrows too.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This may not be as quick or dramatic, but it doesn&#x27;t require a prescription or a doctor visit, and the price is good, considering the results.</li>
            <li>My lashes are significantly longer and darker and actually makes my eyes stand out.  </li>
            <li>When my eyelids are clean and dry, I apply this just as the instructions direct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have new lashes growing.</li>
            <li>and my eyes were red the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>but it ran out of fluid quickly even without any double dipping.  </li>
            <li>Between that and daily curling with an older eyelash curler, I started LOSING eyelashes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a health care professional</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use, my eyebrows and eyelashes were considerably darker.  </li>
            <li>I am on the 2nd tube and this is when I really started noticing the difference.</li>
            <li>so I knew how much was left.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am completely hooked on this amazing eyelash enhancer.  </li>
            <li>This product is making them grow back, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>and already I see major results.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are long and lush and far surpasses my experience with the competition.</li>
            <li>I got my first compliment the other day!  </li>
            <li>If the number of hair follicles is naturally not very large, there can&#x27;t be a real impact.</li>
            <li>I can tell when I put too much on because my eyes will be a little dry, but I think those that are saying their eyes are red are using too much (I use one dip for both eyes and brows).</li>
            <li>Lashes long and lush.</li>
            <li>They are now much darker, no longer &amp;#34;blonde on the ends&amp;#34; and need much less mascara and curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This one actually works w/ single daily application...unlike smartlash which requires twice daily &amp;</li>
            <li> but now my eyelashes are growing longer and thicker and there are all these new little lashes popping up.</li>
            <li> I actually use it every other day to make the product last and still does the trick!</li>
            <li> I have damaged eyebrows due to over plucking them for years when I was younger and they wouldn&#x27;t grow back with anything.</li>
            <li> Also I expected it to last about as long as a tube of mascara</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews, I got RED eyes for about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> :  Only use this product where you want hairgrowth and don&#x27;t over do it...a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> it turned a little red</li>
            <li> It still worked, but I would rather spend a little extra money and not have that happen.  </li>
            <li> As I said, I see no real change.</li>
            <li> No real way of knowing without trying.</li>
            <li> results are minimal.</li>
            <li> I began to notice a difference in the length of my eyelashes after only a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because it made my friend&#x27;s lashes so long I thought they were fake at first.</li>
            <li> Less than a month into it but have a friend who recommended it.</li>
            <li> Also, the tube lasted me a little over 2.5 months.</li>
            <li> or else you can get some uneven growth like I did.</li>
            <li> I have green eyes with no discoloration.  </li>
            <li> It took a few weeks before there where any noticeable differences</li>
            <li> so approximately 2 months later</li>
            <li> First time I used the product I had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Even so, I proceeded with applications for the past 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell how they are working.</li>
            <li> know some posters have complained about allergic reactions and I suppose that is a possibility, but I had none.</li>
            <li> I had people come up to me at work and ask me if I was sick or crying because my eyes were red and puffy.</li>
            <li> I was sloppy and now the peach fuzz below my lower lashes have darkened and are a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> I did not react as badly but still remained uncomfortable for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I used to use Latisse but stopped because it was so ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> I was using a (waterproof) mascara that was VERY tough on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but it was nothing really bad or unbearable.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fabulous product. My eyelashes are long and lush and far surpasses my experience with the competition. Better eyelashes than when I was a teen.</li>

            <li> Just like the other reviews, I got RED eyes for about 2-3 weeks. But I hung in there and now I got the eyelashes I&#x27;ve always wanted and my eyes are no longer red. Yay!! Also, the tube lasted me a little over 2.5 months. I used it on my eyebrows and top/bottom lashes. Sparingly as instructed. You really don&#x27;t need to soak your lashes with the product. And I apply it daily befor bed.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But I absolutely LOVE this lash enhancer. I only used it a couple of weeks, but I can see the difference in my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> I was using a (waterproof) mascara that was VERY tough on my eyelashes. Between that and daily curling with an older eyelash curler, I started LOSING eyelashes! (They were being pulled out by the mascara stuck to the pad on the eyelash curler!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up all mascara for about 45 days (easiy for me to do; I was between two jobs) and started using this EVERY night to repair the &amp;#34;empty spots&amp;#34;. They started to fill in visibly in about 30 days, but as I continued to use this product, the really great thing is that my lashes got LONGER, darker and noticeably thicker (after the first 45 days, I got a new gentler, non-waterproof mascara, and new eyelash curler with easily replaceable pads...I replace those pads religiously every 30 days, or sooner, if they seem &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.) I also remove my mascara and eye makeup EVERY night with a moisturizing eye makeup remover, and then wash the remover off when I remove the rest of my makeup. When my eyelids are clean and dry, I apply this just as the instructions direct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and brown eyelashes that turn blonde on the ends. They are now much darker, no longer &amp;#34;blonde on the ends&amp;#34; and need much less mascara and curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some posters have complained about allergic reactions and I suppose that is a possibility, but I had none. I bought one tube from another site, and was so happy with the results; I decided to stock up here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a health care professional and I&#x27;ve seen people who use prescription Latisse®. This may not be as quick or dramatic, but it doesn&#x27;t require a prescription or a doctor visit, and the price is good, considering the results.</li>
            <li> I last ordered this product in December of 2014.  I have been trying to order again.  This product really works.  Please bring this product back again.&lt;br /&gt;It is on my wish list.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product. She had wonderful results after using it for 4 weeks. I was very impressed and ordered the VB Beauty Lash that same week. Unfortunately it did not work for me. I have used it religiously for 6 weeks now, applying it as directed once every night before bed. I see no improvement in length or quality of my lashes. First time I used the product I had a bad reaction. In the morning my eyes hurt and were very red. I had people come up to me at work and ask me if I was sick or crying because my eyes were red and puffy. I did not use the product for several nights after that and then gave it another try. I did not react as badly but still remained uncomfortable for at least a week. Even so, I proceeded with applications for the past 5 weeks. As I said, I see no real change. I don&#x27;t say that the product does not work because I saw firsthand the impact on my friend. But, it did not work for me. I think the clue lies within the presence of hair follicles. If the serum is used on the area which is naturally rich with hair follicles, the growth can be stimulated. If the number of hair follicles is naturally not very large, there can&#x27;t be a real impact. You can&#x27;t stimulate what&#x27;s not there. So, the product is effective or none effective on individual level. No real way of knowing without trying.</li>
            <li> So i ordered this item for my mother and a package came to my house and it was feather earrings. So i contacted amazon and they are only sold through amazon so now i have to PAY for the return and wait 30 days. I dont even get to keep the earrings either!!</li>
            <li> This does lengthen your lashes but you have to have some patience as it takes about 3-4 weeks to see results. I checked the ingredients &amp; this contains progesterone (like latise) which is why it works but also has the issues associated which are redness at the area of placement etc. be sure to place it on evenly or else you can get some uneven growth like I did. The price is amazing considering that most with this active ingredient cost 3-4 times as much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, my lashes are noticeably longer after about 7 weeks. I got my first compliment the other day!  My eyebrows are filling in too. I can tell when I put too much on because my eyes will be a little dry, but I think those that are saying their eyes are red are using too much (I use one dip for both eyes and brows). I have green eyes with no discoloration.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any darkening of my lashes, which I was hoping for, but they look so great, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> The is definitely one of the best lash growth products on the market.  And I have tried many of them.  It definitely grows the lashes longer. I LOVE THIS STUFF !!! Because as God is my witness….IT RERALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Result s OK but not the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I have seen dramatically longer lashes, and don&#x27;t even touch my curler anymore! I&#x27;ve even been asked who does my extensions... So fun to tell them they&#x27;re my lashes!</li>
            <li> This one actually works w/ single daily application...unlike smartlash which requires twice daily &amp; results are minimal.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  It took a few weeks before there where any noticeable differences but now my eyelashes are growing longer and thicker and there are all these new little lashes popping up. It does cause some light irritation and the area where I applied it turned a little red but it was nothing really bad or unbearable.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes bright red for two days and my lids sore and swollen!  I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months and I also have lash extensions as well so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell how they are working. I bought this to stimulate hair growth and it seems to be working since each time I go to get my lash extensions filled I have new lashes growing.</li>
            <li> No kidding, after 4 weeks lashes were thicker significantly... After 6 weeks, thicker and definitely longer. Worth the money. Cheaper too than going to a esthetician.</li>
            <li> It did increase my lashes, but also made my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Lashes long and lush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for years, and I didn&#x27;t think it was effective for me anymore. VB Beauty Lash has gotten my lashes nice and long again. And I think it&#x27;s working on my very sparse eyebrows too. I&#x27;m very pleased with this so far!</li>
            <li> I began using VB Beauty Lash about 9 months ago.  I began to notice a difference in the length of my eyelashes after only a few weeks of use. My lashes look incredibly more full and are still getting longer.  Needless to say I am completely hooked on this amazing eyelash enhancer.  It has given me the exact RESULTS that I was searching for.  I have referred this product to several friends and all are seeing great results.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Less than a month into it but have a friend who recommended it. After 3 months consistent use, she now has gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li> I received this product from a friend as a gift.  The best gift ever!  After 3 weeks of use, my eyebrows and eyelashes were considerably darker.  My eyelashes have multiplied in numbers and noticibly longer.  I did get the redness and irritation along my lashline and my eyes were red the first couple of weeks.  Some days my eyes looked infected but weren&#x27;t.  My eyebrows have filled in the damage I did from years of overplucking. I didn&#x27;t get the irritation on my eyebrows.  I love my eyebrows now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  Only use this product where you want hairgrowth and don&#x27;t over do it...a little goes a long ways.  I was sloppy and now the peach fuzz below my lower lashes have darkened and are a bit longer.  Looks like smeared mascara or eyeliner.  I plan on either bleaching it or have it waxed off.  This product will grow hair where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different serums over the a period of time and I have to say that this one was my least favorite.  It made my eyes red and it burned a bit and sometimes they were itchy. It still worked, but I would rather spend a little extra money and not have that happen.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works very well. I actually use it every other day to make the product last and still does the trick!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think this was going to work.  I bought the VB Beauty Lash on February 22, 2013 and the product arrived 2 days later.  I immediately started using it and only use it once per day.  Today is 4/3/13 so approximately 2 months later and I can definitely tell you that this product works.  My lashes are significantly longer and darker and actually makes my eyes stand out.  It&#x27;s really truly amazing.  I&#x27;ve only been using it on my upper lashes and will now start using it on my bottom lashes.  I didn&#x27;t experience any eye irritation at all.  Buy this product you will not regret that you did.</li>
            <li> 5 STAR I LOVE IT! I USE IT ON MY LASHES AND THEY ARE GROWING IT TOOK ABOUT 3 MONTHS..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using VB Beauty for a while.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I noticed my lashes growing in a short period of time.  I don&#x27;t have to curl them anymore because they are long and curl on their own.  I just went to a party and my friend said, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t stop staring at your eyelashes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Just started using, it seems it will work as well as GrandeLash MD.&lt;br /&gt;Using in the morning as well as in the evening.</li>
            <li> I am happy I bought this product. I have damaged eyebrows due to over plucking them for years when I was younger and they wouldn&#x27;t grow back with anything. This product is making them grow back, slowly but surely. I am on the 2nd tube and this is when I really started noticing the difference. Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because it made my friend&#x27;s lashes so long I thought they were fake at first. I&#x27;ve been using it for four weeks now and already I see major results. I used to use Latisse but stopped because it was so ridiculously expensive. This stuff has given me the same effect but at a fraction of the price. Great discovery!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I noticed a different in my lashes within two weeks of using the product. Very easy application. Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference as more time passes.</li>
            <li> The liquid in this product did not last three weeks. I thought I read that it was suppose to last 2 or 3 month.</li>
            <li> I just wish I could see through the barrel so I knew how much was left. I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m getting low.</li>
            <li> It works really well!! it&#x27;s been a couple months since i&#x27;ve been using, and i recognized the difference after a month. I bought my mom the same one and her lashes have been growing well too. I&#x27;m buying another one for myself and my mom now !:)</li>
