            <li>and this just kept my hair wonderful!</li>
            <li>The shine was also perfect!</li>
            <li>This works wonderfully for my hair.</li>
            <li>LOL!</li>
            <li>it was once the best moisturizer on the planet.</li>
            <li>luster&#x27;s did us a GREAT disservice when they tried to make the greatest product better.  </li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>Its smells good and doesn&#x27;t cause product build-up.</li>
            <li>and I love that !</li>
            <li>the old formula looked more oily, smelled wonderful and was the MOST wonderful, hair softening, hair moisturizing formula on the face of this planet.  </li>
            <li>product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful, and moisturizes my 4c hair very well.</li>
            <li>This product is the perfect size for little hands, good quality, easy to use and the price makes it an ideal find.</li>
            <li>On Curl Original Formula, it works good as a substitute.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe more people don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li>Section your hair and use one to two pumps at the most in the palm of your hand, and then apply it one section at a time.  </li>
            <li>Much better then wave geel because it dosent cause damage to you hair.</li>
            <li>I put Echo Stying Gel (either the crystal or argon) on top of this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I hit the the holy grail of hair products with the combination of this moisturizer as a leave-in and the Echo styling gel on top to seal the deal.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you put a gel of your choice on top to zeal in the moisture and provide definition if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeking.  </li>

            <li>but I do believe I&#x27;ve found the perfect combo that actually works and doesn&#x27;t put a hole in my wallet.</li>
            <li>, it makes my hair thicker and more susceptible  to breakage.  </li>
            <li>I agree with most of the reviews on here.</li>
            <li>I have been using Lusters S&#x27; Curl for many years.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair on the top of my head and curly hair at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>The shipping is more</li>
            <li>it works all right but not as good as the Lustrasilk</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t blv they changed this decades long perfect moisturizing product!</li>
            <li>and wow my type 4 hair looks great ..</li>
            <li>It is so strong and distracting.</li>
            <li>I was pleased however with the customer service and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Hopefully if Luster&#x27;s notices a drop in sales they will realize they&#x27;ve made a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>but hey it was worth holding that good &#x27;ol classic in my hands.</li>
            <li>I found this &amp;#34;ole school&amp;#34; cheap product that works wonders on my hair that none of the so called &amp;#34;natural CG&amp;#34; friendly products could deliver...</li>
            <li>Generally, the product works better when I am not wearing my own hair out and hiding it under a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hair moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It is a very good product for me because it adds the right amount of moisture to my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because of the s-curl spray because before I had it my hair never felt so</li>
            <li>I have been all over town searching for the original S-Curl Activator/Moisturizer</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture here on Amazon, it is no longer the original.</li>
            <li>this stuff is cool ..</li>
            <li>No Drip that I attain does still have a nice cent and keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It actually works good but as others said it doesn&#x27;t mousterize well</li>
            <li>It does contain a cone which I normally will do my best to avoid due to the problem of build-up on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had been using this product since the early 90&#x27;s, and I was surprised and happy to find it at amazon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to help moisturize my new growth in between relaxers based on the advice of many YouTubers.</li>
            <li>but I do believe I&#x27;ve found the perfect combo that actually works and doesn&#x27;t put a hole in my wallet.is long, bouncy, shiny, defined,</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s curly very curly!!</li>
            <li>It is easily accessable and most definitely affordable.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend this for anyone who wants waves ! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they are making an effort to help keep hair natural</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair right away because my scalp was itching and burning uncontrollably.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use my leave in conditioner first then this , then my jelly soft gel on top</li>
            <li>Overnight success, but remember, don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy - takes away having to use many other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning but STOP messing up what&#x27;s not broken!</li>
            <li>I bought two of these and will make sure I never get low on this stuff.</li>
            <li>and we all should be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I love this and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s less effective and filmy...</li>
            <li>I purchased both the spray pump and the large refill bottle thinking</li>
            <li>While the product does help soften new growth and make it more manageable (for that I will give it credit and an extra star), I&#x27;ve decided for certain that I donâ€™t like it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to put this product in my hair and was left with soft, manageable hair!</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my curls in place and relieves dryness very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t drip - as the product name states and it really does soften the hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this in my 6 year old sons hair since he as about 3, and we have to use large sticks to bat away the girls of all ages from him!</li>
            <li>I recently began wearing my own hair out after protective styling for a long time using wigs.</li>
            <li>It is simply a great product made for people like myself with dry scalps without the heavy oily feel.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how dry it was and none of these popular products were getting the job done by a long shot.</li>
            <li>Two pumps may even be too much but for instant stoppage of breaking and dryness, you will never find a better product.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, ladies, if you have dry, brittle/breaking hair, nothing nourishes those thirsty straw strands like this product, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>It washes out easy, and doesn&#x27;t build up or collect dirt like other products.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would normally use an oil like grapeseed to finish out the routine, but, found I don&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li>Also, it feels more heavy on my strands in the summer time as opposed to the cooler months.</li>
            <li>Echo styling gel by itself left my hair crunchy and dry, however, when I use it on top of the S-Curl</li>
            <li>Echo styling gel by itself left my hair crunchy and dry, however, when I use it on top of the S-Curl</li>

            <li>(my new growth is curly enough!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New formula dries out my hair and causes breakage.  </li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;d like to address that the seller&#x27;s price here is the exact same price I paid at my local Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I was going to use it on a regular basis; however, I just cannot deal with the constant itching (perhaps I am allergic to an ingredient or two - most likely the fragrance).  </li>
            <li>I just had to get on here and warn others that the new formula does not moisturize like the old formula.</li>
            <li>The old formula did the exact opposite-</li>
            <li>Plus my hair needs a strong holding gel because although my individual strands are fine, my hair is dense and I need a little bit of weight added to my hair to control the frizz and acheive some elongation due to shrinkage.  </li>
            <li>Plus my hair needs a strong holding gel because although my individual strands are fine, my hair is dense and I need a little bit of weight added to my hair to control the frizz and acheive some elongation due to shrinkage.  </li>
            <li>After blow drying and flat ironing my hair, my hair came out nice, soft, and fluffy!</li>
            <li>So I started frequenting black hair forums and read where many sistas use this on their dry hair and new growth to stretch relaxers.</li>
            <li>I know every1 is jumping on the natural hair bandwagon</li>
            <li>but I Cldnt find the old formula nowhere.</li>
            <li>I could feel my hair getting soft and moist after I sprayed in the S-curl</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a relaxed lady, then don&#x27;t use too much of this (I used 3 short sprays around my hair--</li>
            <li>it made my hair appear to be fuller, moist, &amp; soft</li>
            <li>Now, I have to mix this with hair grease just to get it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So, I contacted Luster&#x27;s directly to find out how I could get the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>yes with the high content of glycerine you run the risk of having big poofy hair if you use this product by itself once your hair drys.  </li>
            <li>am hoping that my daughter - who is natural with very dense, dry and coily hair - can find some use for the stuff</li>
            <li>do admit that the price listed for this product here is extremely high for what you can get it for at your local CVS or Walmart, but that aside, the trick to using this product to nourish dry hair if you don&#x27;t have a curl is to use it very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>the new formula looks like watery, white grits and has this smell that i can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li>My new growth loves it, it&#x27;s the only product that softens it.</li>
            <li>GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA!  </li>
            <li>I recently tried Wave Nouveau moisturizing finishing lotion and my hair FINALLY feels soft after 15 years of being natural!</li>
            <li>Not only is the new scent not appealing, but unlike the original formula this leaves my 4b/4c hair dry &amp; greasy once it has dried; the original seemed to quench my thirsty hair&#x27;s needs for up to 2 days at a time.</li>
            <li>but noooooo I NEED MY OLD FORMULA BACK!</li>
            <li>which is simply moisture which is a natural&#x27;s</li>
            <li>For reference, I have low porosity 4c hair which is all natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s watery and this barely curled my hair.</li>
            <li>I generally relax 1-2x per year and my new growth tends to be very dry at times.  </li>
            <li>This beats out all the other products sold for at least $12-$20 dollars or more for the same amount but with lack luster results.  </li>

            <li> I could feel my hair getting soft and moist after I sprayed in the S-curl</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a relaxed lady, then don&#x27;t use too much of this (I used 3 short sprays around my hair--</li>
            <li> it made my hair appear to be fuller, moist, &amp; soft</li>
            <li> Now, I have to mix this with hair grease just to get it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> So, I contacted Luster&#x27;s directly to find out how I could get the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> yes with the high content of glycerine you run the risk of having big poofy hair if you use this product by itself once your hair drys.  </li>
            <li> am hoping that my daughter - who is natural with very dense, dry and coily hair - can find some use for the stuff</li>
            <li> do admit that the price listed for this product here is extremely high for what you can get it for at your local CVS or Walmart, but that aside, the trick to using this product to nourish dry hair if you don&#x27;t have a curl is to use it very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> the new formula looks like watery, white grits and has this smell that i can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> My new growth loves it, it&#x27;s the only product that softens it.</li>
            <li> GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA!  </li>
            <li> I recently tried Wave Nouveau moisturizing finishing lotion and my hair FINALLY feels soft after 15 years of being natural!</li>
            <li> Not only is the new scent not appealing, but unlike the original formula this leaves my 4b/4c hair dry &amp; greasy once it has dried; the original seemed to quench my thirsty hair&#x27;s needs for up to 2 days at a time.</li>
            <li> but noooooo I NEED MY OLD FORMULA BACK!</li>
            <li> which is simply moisture which is a natural&#x27;s</li>
            <li> For reference, I have low porosity 4c hair which is all natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s watery and this barely curled my hair.</li>
            <li> I generally relax 1-2x per year and my new growth tends to be very dry at times.  </li>
            <li> This beats out all the other products sold for at least $12-$20 dollars or more for the same amount but with lack luster results.  </li>
            <li> I searched Amazon in hopes someone still had a few &#x27;classic&#x27; formulas left...</li>
            <li> If you are like me and find that shea butter, oils, and leave-in conditioners don&#x27;t moisturize your hair but sit on top of your strands creating a dull dry residue with little curl or shine...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blv they changed this decades long perfect moisturizing product! I know every1 is jumping on the natural hair bandwagon bcz I&#x27;m transitioning but STOP messing up what&#x27;s not broken! I wld use this even whn I was relaxed, wore braids etc. and this just kept my hair wonderful! Now it&#x27;s less effective and filmy...I new o wasn&#x27;t gng to like it but I Cldnt find the old formula nowhere. Some products like queen Helene cholesterol despite the ingridients JUST WORKS! I&#x27;m glad they are making an effort to help keep hair natural but noooooo I NEED MY OLD FORMULA BACK!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled dry relaxed hair for some time now.........especially in the nape of my neck. No matter what I tried, nothing worked. Even the so called quench moisturizers didn&#x27;t help me. So I started frequenting black hair forums and read where many sistas use this on their dry hair and new growth to stretch relaxers. I was skeptical but being the product junkie I am, I said why not. Bought this from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply put it on my nape area (or my kitchens if you wanna call it that) and SHAZAM! My hair went from parched to quenched in seconds. I was like WTF???? How the heck could I not have known about this product since it&#x27;s been around for years??? I cannot believe more people don&#x27;t use this. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days now and there is no breakage and my hair feels moisturized all day and even into the next day. Before using this I was applying moisturizers and oils to that area almost every other HOUR beause that&#x27;s how dry it was and none of these popular products were getting the job done by a long shot. Over the weekend, I am going through my cabinet and throwing out lots of useless products. No need to have a cabinet full of useless products when one gets the job done! Woo hoo!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 10 stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;I do admit that the price listed for this product here is extremely high for what you can get it for at your local CVS or Walmart, but that aside, the trick to using this product to nourish dry hair if you don&#x27;t have a curl is to use it very sparingly.  Section your hair and use one to two pumps at the most in the palm of your hand, and then apply it one section at a time.  Two pumps may even be too much but for instant stoppage of breaking and dryness, you will never find a better product.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, ladies, if you have dry, brittle/breaking hair, nothing nourishes those thirsty straw strands like this product, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Overnight success, but remember, don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> I tried this on dry hair. I used it to moisturize one of my braid outs and it made my hair sticky. Next time I will try it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I had to return this item as I found the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; version now contains formaldehyde which I feel might be to dangerous to my health. I have switched to another manufacture&#x27;s moisturizer activator. I was pleased however with the customer service and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have used this in my 6 year old sons hair since he as about 3, and we have to use large sticks to bat away the girls of all ages from him! It goes on easy - takes away having to use many other products. It washes out easy, and doesn&#x27;t build up or collect dirt like other products. It&#x27;s the one and only thing necessary - and he has 14 inch long curls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who has have tried before to get waves in the past but it dident work to well, then i started using this product and with constant brushing i got waves in about 3 weeks. Much better then wave geel because it dosent cause damage to you hair. Highly Recommend this for anyone who wants waves ! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> This is the only product that truly moisturizes and penetrates my low porosity 3c/4a hair.  I understand that they changed the ingredients  and it does not have minieral oil, parapens, or petroleum etc.  It does contain a cone which I normally will do my best to avoid due to the problem of build-up on my hair.  However, the cone is about 9 ingredients down from the list and has not effected my hair negatively as far as build-up.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that it will give you no hold and yes with the high content of glycerine you run the risk of having big poofy hair if you use this product by itself once your hair drys.  So, understand your hair will be moisturized but very little defination and high chance of frizz despite the marketing that states otherwise.  To combat the frizz I put Echo Stying Gel (either the crystal or argon) on top of this moisturizer.  The results were elongated, shiny, moisturized, slick, no frizz hair that is soft, resilent, and had bounce back when I extended my curls.  I hit the the holy grail of hair products with the combination of this moisturizer as a leave-in and the Echo styling gel on top to seal the deal.  I would normally use an oil like grapeseed to finish out the routine, but, found I don&#x27;t need it.  The other bonus is that this product can be found at Walgreens, Wegmans, Walmart, and maybe your local Sallys or beauty supply store.  It is easily accessable and most definitely affordable. I payed under 3 dollars for an 8oz container.  This beats out all the other products sold for at least $12-$20 dollars or more for the same amount but with lack luster results.  After spending an exorbant amount of money on expensive leave-ins in the form of conditioners, creams, puddings, custards, and gels I found this &amp;#34;ole school&amp;#34; cheap product that works wonders on my hair that none of the so called &amp;#34;natural CG&amp;#34; friendly products could deliver...which is simply moisture which is a natural&#x27;s must if her goal is long, bouncy, shiny, defined, hair.&lt;br /&gt;My search is over...I just hope they don&#x27;t discontinue or change the product line. If you are like me and find that shea butter, oils, and leave-in conditioners don&#x27;t moisturize your hair but sit on top of your strands creating a dull dry residue with little curl or shine...this is for you.  Just make sure you put a gel of your choice on top to zeal in the moisture and provide definition if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeking.  I use the echo styling gel because it plays well with this moisturizer not creating any flakes or the annoying little white balls.  Plus my hair needs a strong holding gel because although my individual strands are fine, my hair is dense and I need a little bit of weight added to my hair to control the frizz and acheive some elongation due to shrinkage.  Echo styling gel by itself left my hair crunchy and dry, however, when I use it on top of the S-Curl No Drip my hair is butter....I hope this helps someone.  It has been quite a journey for me but I do believe I&#x27;ve found the perfect combo that actually works and doesn&#x27;t put a hole in my wallet.is long, bouncy, shiny, defined, hair.&lt;br /&gt;My search is over...I just hope they don&#x27;t discontinue or change the product line.

            <li> So I&#x27;ve seen some rave reviews about this product on various black hair sites, so I decided to give it a try when I went to Wal-Mart the other day. First off, I&#x27;d like to address that the seller&#x27;s price here is the exact same price I paid at my local Wal-Mart. Second off..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is AMAZING. I decided to use it as a leave-in for my short, (6-weeks post)relaxed hair, along with my Shea Butter leave-in (just a quarter size). I could feel my hair getting soft and moist after I sprayed in the S-curl activator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I put a dime-sized drop of my heat protectant serum through my hair, put a little Aphogee Green Tea/Keratin spray on, and combed my hair with a wide toothed comb. After blow drying and flat ironing my hair, my hair came out nice, soft, and fluffy! I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because of the s-curl spray because before I had it my hair never felt so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a relaxed lady, then don&#x27;t use too much of this (I used 3 short sprays around my hair--it&#x27;s short) because it will get greasy if you overdo it! I think I&#x27;ll be using this once a week, just because I don&#x27;t want any waves/curls in my hair (my new growth is curly enough!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to a friend? OF COURSE! This is my new favorite hair moisturizer! And now I think I&#x27;m going to stock up on this stuff!</li>
            <li> am i the only one who realizes that this activator formula has been changed???  the old formula looked more oily, smelled wonderful and was the MOST wonderful, hair softening, hair moisturizing formula on the face of this planet.  and like everything else, lusters went and changed the formula.  the new formula looks like watery, white grits and has this smell that i can&#x27;t stand.  i&#x27;ve tried it over and over and over again and not only does it not work the same, it makes my hair thicker and more susceptible  to breakage.  the old formula would make your hair feel like newly permed hair, not this crap!  i am SOOOOOOOO disappointed.  i&#x27;ve looked in every store, every online boutique and NOBODY has it anymore.  luster&#x27;s did us a GREAT disservice when they tried to make the greatest product better.  GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA!  PLEASE!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is cool .. I use my leave in conditioner first then this , then my jelly soft gel on top and wow my type 4 hair looks great .. it made my hair appear to be fuller, moist, &amp; soft and I love that !</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews on here. I used to be able to put this product in my hair and was left with soft, manageable hair! The shine was also perfect! Now, I have to mix this with hair grease just to get it soft and shiny. I didn&#x27;t have to mix it with anything before! This is the worst &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; ever!! After this bottle is gone, I will not be spending my money on it anymore! If I could give this product 0 stars I would. Companies need to leave well enough alone when it comes to products.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known before I bought this product that you could buy this from Walmart for 2 DOLLARS AND CHANGE! This seller is ripping us off. You can buy three for the price that they are selling one. PLEASE learn from my mistake and do not buy from this seller! The product is wonderful, and moisturizes my 4c hair very well. But I would never purchase from Beauty in Black again.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing for my hair. No moisture, nothing! All it does is load my hair with that dreadful fragrance! It is so strong and distracting. Some people seem to like it though. For reference, I have low porosity 4c hair which is all natural. I recently tried Wave Nouveau moisturizing finishing lotion and my hair FINALLY feels soft after 15 years of being natural! Never give up. If you try this and do not like it, maybe give Wave Nouveau a try.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and will make sure I never get low on this stuff. I have in a protective hair style, box braids with extensions. My scalp was so itchy and dry. Someone recommended I try this and spray on my scalp and that did the trick. My hair was so soft and very moisturized. Its smells good and doesn&#x27;t cause product build-up.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells very bad. I think they changed their formula because it is very different. It&#x27;s watery and this barely curled my hair. My hair was still frizzy after applying this product. It didn&#x27;t leave any residue but the smell lasted for a few hours. I will not be purchasing this product again. I do not recommend purchasing this product because they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> I just had to get on here and warn others that the new formula does not moisturize like the old formula. Not only is the new scent not appealing, but unlike the original formula this leaves my 4b/4c hair dry &amp; greasy once it has dried; the original seemed to quench my thirsty hair&#x27;s needs for up to 2 days at a time. I have been all over town searching for the original S-Curl Activator/Moisturizer and I&#x27;m sad to report that Luster&#x27;s has taken every bottle of the original off the store shelves. The extra added oils &amp; removal of other ingredients has destroyed this product. Hopefully if Luster&#x27;s notices a drop in sales they will realize they&#x27;ve made a huge mistake. But don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture here on Amazon, it is no longer the original. Looks like I&#x27;ll be trying CFC Gold or Wave Nouveau.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lusters S&#x27; Curl for many years. It is a very good product for me because it adds the right amount of moisture to my dry scalp. I had been using this product since the early 90&#x27;s, and I was surprised and happy to find it at amazon. It is simply a great product made for people like myself with dry scalps without the heavy oily feel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my curly hair it works all right but not as good as the Lustrasilk Right On Curl Original Formula, it works good as a substitute.</li>
            <li> liberiangrl, in your comment you said that the formulate must have been changed. If like to say that the S-Curls No Drip that I attain does still have a nice cent and keeps my hair soft. I do know that when you purchase online that there is the chance that you might receive counterfeit products and we all should be aware of that. However I do not like this price price for the 8 once bottle. I can&#x27;t get the 8 once bottle in my area for under $5.00. In Southern California.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair on the top of my head and curly hair at the bottom.  This activator allows my hair to curl and wave, but I must not comb or brush it.  It keeps the frizzes away.</li>
            <li> My hair simply loves this moisturizer.  It keeps my curls in place and relieves dryness very well.</li>
            <li> I use the Very big bottle which i pour in my hand and massage in hair, im a male with an afro that&#x27;s curly very curly!! It actually works good but as others said it doesn&#x27;t mousterize well but i use creme of nature leave in conditioner to make up for it.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully for my hair. I&#x27;ve been natural for a few years and had not yet found that product that would completely soften and moisturize my hair. This is it!! I was a little apprehensive to use it because all I kept thinking about was my hair dripping jerry curl juice. LOL! No such thing. It doesn&#x27;t drip - as the product name states and it really does soften the hair. I&#x27;m a bit of a wash and go girl and this is the only thing that revitalizes my hair like it&#x27;s supposed to. I love this and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily moisturizer for my relaxed hair and it leaves my hair softttt ALL day. My new growth loves it, it&#x27;s the only product that softens it. Give it a try</li>
            <li> I do not like the &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; formula either. I searched Amazon in hopes someone still had a few &#x27;classic&#x27; formulas left... Nope. So, I contacted Luster&#x27;s directly to find out how I could get the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; S-Curl No Drip formula. I would have to order it from them and note &amp;#34;Original formula&amp;#34; in the &#x27;order comments&#x27;. I ordered 2 16oz sized bottles and my hair has been in heaven since. The shipping is more but hey it was worth holding that good &#x27;ol classic in my hands. :o)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help moisturize my new growth in between relaxers based on the advice of many YouTubers. I generally relax 1-2x per year and my new growth tends to be very dry at times.  I recently began wearing my own hair out after protective styling for a long time using wigs. Generally, the product works better when I am not wearing my own hair out and hiding it under a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being overzealous the second time I used it, I put the S-Curl in an applicator bottle and used that to apply the moisturizer to my hair since the spray pump was temperamental. Needless to say, it was too much. I had to wash my hair right away because my scalp was itching and burning uncontrollably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used it again this weekend to try it out again after leaving it in my closet for some time. While the product does help soften new growth and make it more manageable (for that I will give it credit and an extra star), I&#x27;ve decided for certain that I donâ€™t like it as much as I thought I would. It feels tacky, weighs hair down, and makes my hair/scalp feel unclean. It also causes my scalp and body to itch incessantly. I purchased both the spray pump and the large refill bottle thinking I was going to use it on a regular basis; however, I just cannot deal with the constant itching (perhaps I am allergic to an ingredient or two - most likely the fragrance).  Also, it feels more heavy on my strands in the summer time as opposed to the cooler months. I will not purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that my daughter - who is natural with very dense, dry and coily hair - can find some use for the stuff so it doesn&#x27;t go completely to waste.</li>
            <li> New formula dries out my hair and causes breakage.  The old formula did the exact opposite- it was once the best moisturizer on the planet.</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect size for little hands, good quality, easy to use and the price makes it an ideal find.</li>
    </ol>
