            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE ALL WEN.....</li>
            <li>Awesome WEN conditioner for very dry hair.</li>
            <li>It is true that that longer you leave it on your hair the better it looks.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is pleasing and I&#x27;m looking forward to having it available in the more  convenient and more economical full sized jar.</li>
            <li>Hair feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Liked product but the cost is way too high for the amount of product bc of this</li>
            <li>Wen Remoist is absolutely the best conditioner for dry damaged hair on the market.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sweet Almond Mint scent for years, and tried this lavendar for the 1st time.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week on my fine, stick straight, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>As long as it doesn&#x27;t touch my scalp, the moisturization for the hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>once a month is more then enough</li>
            <li>It adds bounce and shine  and strengthens your hair to deal with hot styling products.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love ALLWen products.</li>
            <li>I sleep with this conditioner on my hair overnight 2-3x week, and in the morning my hair is super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>MADE MY HAIR VERY SILKY.</li>
            <li>The treatment is so rich and of high quality that you don&#x27;t need to use much, which makes the product last longer than you would expect.</li>
            <li>If you have long hair, you will find you need to use more, but compared to off-the-shelf products you buy in your local drug store you will find that you won&#x27;t use as much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the cleansing conditioner, intensive hair treatment, oil, hair refresher....</li>
            <li>more in the summer to combat the harsh effects from the sun and chlorine.  </li>
            <li>I know that I spent way more than $100 a year on off-the-shelf shampoos, conditioners and deep conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Wen products suit me very well, and I think when purchased a la carte on Amazon they aren&#x27;t especially pricey.</li>
            <li>The intense deep conditioner replenishes moisture to my hair and repairs the damage from styling processes.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and glossy.</li>
            <li>If you look how many times you purchase  off-the-shelf shampoos, conditioners, deep conditioners and other styling products  (just a figure I am throwing out there)  in any given year: (once a month X 12 months), the cost really adds up to more than I spend on Wen products.  </li>
            <li>As far as the cost goes, many people to whom I recommend Wen products tell me that they think the products are too expensive.  </li>
            <li>I had major straw like damage &amp; severe breakage from over dying my hair blonde, and this is the only product that literally saved (the rest!)</li>

            <li> Wen products suit me very well, and I think when purchased a la carte on Amazon they aren&#x27;t especially pricey. (The subscription makes you buy stuff you may or may not want/need and doesn&#x27;t  provide it on demand. That&#x27;s overpriced.) The lavender scent is pleasing and I&#x27;m looking forward to having it available in the more  convenient and more economical full sized jar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good but I have used other products that are loess expensive.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the hair!</li>
            <li> The very best treatment for damaged hair.  In fact, I need to order some now.</li>
            <li> Awesome WEN conditioner for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I get dandruff from using WEN products.  As long as it doesn&#x27;t touch my scalp, the moisturization for the hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> NOTHING BUT WEN FOREVER!!!</li>
            <li> I really expected this product to make a big difference being WEN.  I used it about a dozen times and it made absolutely no difference in the condition of my hair.  The CHI regular conditioner made a bigger improvement.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Liked product but the cost is way too high for the amount of product bc of this I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> tames my hair and brings control, love this. Actually works!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she loves it a lot. She loves all the Wen products I have purchased for her.</li>
            <li> once a month is more then enough</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this incredible moisturizing product.  It is the solution to dry, heat-styled, color processed hair.  My hair is subject to all of the aforementioned.  The intense deep conditioner replenishes moisture to my hair and repairs the damage from styling processes.  I use this about once a month... more in the summer to combat the harsh effects from the sun and chlorine.  After washing with my Wen cleansing conditioner I  apply it to my hair  - sometimes I leave it on overnight.  The treatment is so rich and of high quality that you don&#x27;t need to use much, which makes the product last longer than you would expect. If you have long hair, you will find you need to use more, but compared to off-the-shelf products you buy in your local drug store you will find that you won&#x27;t use as much.  You can&#x27;t believe how it rejuvenates your hair.  It adds bounce and shine  and strengthens your hair to deal with hot styling products.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for approx. 10 years  - matter of fact, I am exclusively a Wen product user.  I highly recommend the cleansing conditioner, intensive hair treatment, oil, hair refresher.... and the list goes on!  As far as the cost goes, many people to whom I recommend Wen products tell me that they think the products are too expensive.  If you look how many times you purchase  off-the-shelf shampoos, conditioners, deep conditioners and other styling products  (just a figure I am throwing out there)  in any given year: (once a month X 12 months), the cost really adds up to more than I spend on Wen products.  As I said Wen products last a long time.  In a given year I buy and use approximate 4 to 8 oz of the intensive hair treatment at approx. $50;  I use 2 16 oz bottles of conditioning cleanser at approx $50 total.  I know that I spent way more than $100 a year on off-the-shelf shampoos, conditioners and deep conditioners.  The products are actually a better bang for your buck.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love ALLWen products.</li>
            <li> Love this hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Remoist Remoist Remoist. I love this product. Use it every week. Put it on at night and sleep with it on. Pillow does not get gooey. Hair feels silky and smooth. Love the lavender smell, wonderful to help you sleep also</li>
            <li> Love it ! It&#x27;s amazing !! Your hair feels great after each and every use !!</li>
            <li> LOVE ALL WEN.....MADE MY HAIR VERY SILKY.</li>
            <li> Now this is some wonderful stuff. I use it once a week on my fine, stick straight, color treated hair. I am not spring chicken. Once I rinse it out and dry my hair I feel like a princess. My hair is soft and glossy. This stuff is not a lie. It is true that that longer you leave it on your hair the better it looks. As with any WEN product you must rinse, rinse, RINSE. That is the key.</li>
            <li> Wen Remoist is absolutely the best conditioner for dry damaged hair on the market. I have been using the Sweet Almond Mint scent for years, and tried this lavendar for the 1st time. It works just as well as the SAM, and the fragrance is incredible! I sleep with this conditioner on my hair overnight 2-3x week, and in the morning my hair is super shiny and soft. I had major straw like damage &amp; severe breakage from over dying my hair blonde, and this is the only product that literally saved (the rest!) of my hair. I will never be without it! Also, the seller&#x27;s service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Amazing softness created!</li>
