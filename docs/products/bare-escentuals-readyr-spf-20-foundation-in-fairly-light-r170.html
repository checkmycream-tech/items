            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>start, I really liked the compact it came in.</li>
            <li>I just have to trust her on that because I don&#x27;t know anything about this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend unless you have young, flawless skin to begin with.</li>
            <li>Love love love this foundation!</li>
            <li>The finish is not as shiny, more satin/matte.  </li>
            <li>But it is lovely.</li>
            <li>and although I love MAC foundation too</li>
            <li>I have ordered this for both of my daughters, and they both really love it.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to tuck this in my purse and use it for touch-ups, but I didn&#x27;t realize that it is made to use with a brush (the swirl and tap)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I have been using this foundation for a couple months and love it more every day.</li>
            <li>Love the ease of using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will love the medium to full coverage!</li>
            <li>I like the loose powder the best that they have to use</li>
            <li>Great coverage, looks natural.</li>
            <li>easy to apply</li>
            <li>this is an easy part of my makeup that I carry with me even though I seldom reapply makeup during my day.</li>
            <li>LIke all Bare Escentuals products, this is great.</li>
            <li>Like all Bare Escentual foundations, it also works great as a concealer if you use a concealer brush.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no place to fit a one.  </li>
            <li>Do be warned that a light hand is a must or you will end up with a cakey look.  </li>
            <li>light weight foundation...</li>
            <li>I have light skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this so far.</li>
            <li>and now this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Used the original Foundation for 5 years before this came out</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see the foundation in a compact.  </li>
            <li>It gives super good coverage, much better than their loose foundations.</li>
            <li>Stays on much better than the original, and transports very well-no powder spill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a bummer because the product has such good spf protection with good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Still a good product overall, just not meeting the need I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I liked this so much more than the loose powder.</li>
            <li>you thought the original Bare Escentuals foundation was easy you will LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had a relatively mild summer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this makeup for years, and Bare Minerals is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still pretty tan free.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t make the mess that the swirl, tap and apply powder makes.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s quite fine especially with the amount of coverage</li>
            <li>and I have overall liked the product.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t the right color for me, or something.</li>
            <li>When buffing it with the brush there is nowhere for the powder to go except on the brush or right off the edges of the compact.</li>
            <li>Even tho this is the same color as the loose power I use and love, this one comes across more orangey on my face and looks more caked on.  </li>
            <li>In love Bare Essentials!</li>
            <li>I was completely out of my Light Bare Minerals loose powder and thought it was a perfect opportunity to give the new one</li>
            <li>nice summer foundation but a bit too dry for winter.</li>
            <li>The color is a much more yellow tone.  </li>
            <li>It has helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li>I am really glad to finally have a compact the does not spill.  </li>
            <li>Same coverage with better convenience.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to the SPF rating being any better than the SPF 15 in the original loose powder formula I use, as I don&#x27;t spend much time out in the sun.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in this product, I recommend the Bare Essentials Original foundation.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t feel the need to because the initial coverage is good and stays generally all day.</li>
            <li>I like this much better than the loose powder.</li>
            <li>I also keep my skin fairly wrinkle free except for a few small laugh lines around my eyes when I smile.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to brush much of this on at all, it covers very well and will look cakey if you put too much on.  </li>
            <li>of the largest issues I had - the color wasn&#x27;t accurate to my standard \\&quot;light\\&quot; color from their line.</li>
            <li>the problem is that the product gathers in your pores and really makes them stand out.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I really did not care for this product at all for my purposes.</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s quite fine, as I&#x27;ve rarely had issues with the SPF 15 in the other formulation</li>
            <li>Although the shades are given the same names, they are somewhat lighter than the original powder.  </li>
            <li>I like this product better than the bare ecentuals regular foundation powder I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a MAC and Urban Decay girl, but I received a gift card for Bare Escentuals (which I use from time to time), and I ended up buying this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe comparing them side by side, but this foundation leaned more towards an almost neutral or gray tone in its coverage when applied - while the Bare Minerals loose powder in\\&quot;light\\&quot; has nice golden undertones and a warmth to it.</li>
            <li>Definitely buildable and after a full day, a quick buff brings my makeup back to morning coverage without looking cakey.  </li>
            <li>Less is more.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really quick, just use the kabuki brush or something similar.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this because the loose powder works well on me, it just doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I usually love Bare Minerals Products, and always have gotten the loose powders.</li>
            <li>Using a Bare Minerals make-up brush is better, but the color still seems a bit off to me (vs. their loose powder).</li>
            <li>I have used the loose bare minerals for many years.  </li>
            <li>The loose powder by Bare Minerals rarely gives me any of these issues and certainly has a much lighter, airy feel to wear - which I much prefer to this</li>
            <li>last problem I had, which isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker - it was kind of messy to use.</li>
            <li>I have such a hard time finding makeup for yellow skin undertones, and this color is great.  </li>
            <li>it came out straight from the Bare Minerals site.</li>
            <li>Shades are a bit lighter than original formula so definitely get shade matched prior to purchase!</li>
            <li>and this is a slightly darker version of light.</li>
            <li>much though - seems I always go back to it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go that far.</li>
            <li>It covers up all scars and blemishes and works with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t look as natural as bare minerals did.</li>
            <li>Although the color is the same as I usually get, it does not behave at all like the original foundation.</li>
            <li>I normally use the loose powder but wanted something on the go.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer it to the powder because it&#x27;s a lot less messy and more matte.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way the loose powder formula feels, and compared to that - this just cakes on and literally felt heavy on my face with minimal application.</li>
            <li>Different then Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for me, even when applying with a bare minerals brush, it sits in my wrinkles and made my pores look HUGE!</li>
            <li>This was rather cold and when I applied it, I swear I&#x27;ve been to funerals where that person had a more lively skin tone than this had on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend going to a physical store and putting your eyes on the colors before you commit to buying (which I did because I had heard this from other reviewers).  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try a formulation from them that specifically works to hydrate skin, especially as my own skin tends to dry out quite badly in the cold Chicago winters.</li>

            <li> If you do use the Kabuki brush don&#x27;t expect it to be any less messy than the original loose foundation.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with my other Bare Escentuals powder and it keeps me from looking quite as ghostly!!</li>
            <li> It covers just as well as the traditional loose powder, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling it.</li>
            <li> would switch back to the loose powder, but will probably by studio fix mac again which stays on the longest out of any i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> With the loose powder formula, you have the lid with enough edge to catch the powder from flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> Does the same job without the mess.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this left me with a very powdery make-up</li>
            <li> I have used BareMinerals for years now, and thought finally it&#x27;s in a form that affords me a little freedom!  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve carried around the loose powder, but I think this works just as well -- and takes up much less space in my purse.</li>
            <li> She says you don&#x27;t have to put as much on as other makeups...</li>
            <li> While the freedom part is true, I am disappointed to say that the product is not the same.  </li>
            <li> If you expecting an exact color cross over, you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My suggestion is when you using it to swipe your brush over it very slowly, or even use a smaller brush, and have a place where the excess can fall.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that is sort of annoying is that if you use the medium-sized blush brush for BE is that when you swipe your brush over it, so much excess foundations floats off the compact and is a little wasteful.  </li>
            <li> When trying to cover my acne and enlarged pores, the application almost enhanced my trouble spots rather than masked them.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> Hard to use this product with a make-up sponge, as it looks cakey and way too thick.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting acne lately, and was also looking forward to the added coverage.</li>
            <li> I used a sponge to apply the foundation (instead of a brush), and it was really thick.</li>

            <li> It came all broken up.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it does not wear well over time if you have pores on your t-zone that are inclined to produce oil over time.</li>
            <li> If I tried to correct it by wiping it with my finger, it smudges and looks bad.</li>

            <li> This product is a good concept but unfortunately it does not wear well over time if you have pores on your t-zone that are inclined to produce oil over time. the problem is that the product gathers in your pores and really makes them stand out. If you have combination skin at some point this product will smear all over your face and look terrible. It&#x27;s such a bummer because the product has such good spf protection with good ingredients. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I usually love Bare Minerals Products, and always have gotten the loose powders. This seemed convenient since it is in a compact, so I thought I would like it. Although the color is the same as I usually get, it does not behave at all like the original foundation. I used a sponge to apply the foundation (instead of a brush), and it was really thick. After an hour I could see it sitting on my skin and causing it to look cakey and unblended in different areas of my face. If I tried to correct it by wiping it with my finger, it smudges and looks bad. It would just come off if i touched my face at all. If you are interested in this product, I recommend the Bare Essentials Original foundation.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much more than the loose powder. Does the same job without the mess. It is also easier to transport. Great coverage, looks natural.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I normally use the loose powder but wanted something on the go. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have used BareMinerals for years now, and thought finally it&#x27;s in a form that affords me a little freedom!  While the freedom part is true, I am disappointed to say that the product is not the same.  While I like the creamy texture, the colors are not at all like the powder, and makeup will bleed into it like a liquid to powder foundation.  The color is a much more yellow tone.  I&#x27;d suggest trying in store before you buy.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation.  I have such a hard time finding makeup for yellow skin undertones, and this color is great.  You don&#x27;t need to brush much of this on at all, it covers very well and will look cakey if you put too much on.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with this so far.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve carried around the loose powder, but I think this works just as well -- and takes up much less space in my purse.</li>
            <li> LIke all Bare Escentuals products, this is great. It covers just as well as the traditional loose powder, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling it.</li>
            <li> BAD, BAD, BAD.  ARRIVED ALL BROKEN.&lt;br /&gt;RETURNED AFTER CLEANING UP THE MESS!!!&lt;br /&gt;ONE OF THE WORST PURCHASE AT AMAZON, INDEED.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT. Do yourself a favor and just go to a department store, or a boutique. I now have wasted time returning the product, just to go buy the real thing which I was expecting. I&#x27;ve used this makeup for years, and Bare Minerals is AMAZING. This is not even the same shade, smell, or texture.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this because the loose powder works well on me, it just doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.&lt;br /&gt;I got color matched and bought the color that i was matched to. it isn&#x27;t the right color for me, or something. BUT either way it was not what i was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;am not buying again. would switch back to the loose powder, but will probably by studio fix mac again which stays on the longest out of any i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it was broken to pieces and a complete mess when it arrived!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this makeup. It has helped my skin so much! I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this foundation but, it does not cover as well as my liquid foundation. It also gives my skin a yellow looking glow. So I have to use a bronzer afterwards. I was color matched, so that is not the issue, just the foundation I guess.</li>
            <li> Should go to the store for this.  It came all broken up.  I still use it, but I&#x27;m tempted to pitch it.</li>
            <li> Different then Bare Minerals. I like the loose powder the best that they have to use</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a brush or anything to apply it with. It&#x27;s a compact &amp; I  planned to carry  it in my purse. There&#x27;s no place to fit a one.  For the price, it should.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this the week it came out straight from the Bare Minerals site. I was excited to try a formulation from them that specifically works to hydrate skin, especially as my own skin tends to dry out quite badly in the cold Chicago winters. I have been fighting acne lately, and was also looking forward to the added coverage. I was completely out of my Light Bare Minerals loose powder and thought it was a perfect opportunity to give the new one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, I really liked the compact it came in. I also feel that after an entire day of wear, my face did stay quite hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the SPF rating being any better than the SPF 15 in the original loose powder formula I use, as I don&#x27;t spend much time out in the sun. I imagine it&#x27;s quite fine, as I&#x27;ve rarely had issues with the SPF 15 in the other formulation - I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s quite fine especially with the amount of coverage this formula offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I really did not care for this product at all for my purposes. I absolutely love the way the loose powder formula feels, and compared to that - this just cakes on and literally felt heavy on my face with minimal application. When trying to cover my acne and enlarged pores, the application almost enhanced my trouble spots rather than masked them. I also keep my skin fairly wrinkle free except for a few small laugh lines around my eyes when I smile. By the end of the day I had some serious crows feet going on where the makeup had settled and just stayed. The loose powder by Bare Minerals rarely gives me any of these issues and certainly has a much lighter, airy feel to wear - which I much prefer to this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the largest issues I had - the color wasn&#x27;t accurate to my standard \\&quot;light\\&quot; color from their line. It&#x27;s hard to describe comparing them side by side, but this foundation leaned more towards an almost neutral or gray tone in its coverage when applied - while the Bare Minerals loose powder in\\&quot;light\\&quot; has nice golden undertones and a warmth to it. This was rather cold and when I applied it, I swear I&#x27;ve been to funerals where that person had a more lively skin tone than this had on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last problem I had, which isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker - it was kind of messy to use. When buffing it with the brush there is nowhere for the powder to go except on the brush or right off the edges of the compact. With the loose powder formula, you have the lid with enough edge to catch the powder from flying everywhere. Needless to say, this left me with a very powdery make-up spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not tossing it in the trash, I feel it was too pricey to let go. I&#x27;ll keep it on hand to use when/if I run out of my loose powder by Bare Minerals. I won&#x27;t be letting that happen much though - seems I always go back to it.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than the bare ecentuals regular foundation powder I&#x27;ve been using for years.  The finish is not as shiny, more satin/matte.  Also, it&#x27;s not as drying.  I read that it&#x27;s supposed to be moisturizing - I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. But it is lovely. Would definitely recommend it to gals over 40.</li>
            <li> Pros: It covers up all scars and blemishes and works with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it dries out skin... so i don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> This foundation is wonderful and leaves the softest finish on my face. It is wonderful and goes on very nice!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I love how it is still a powder but is so silky and covers great.  Used the original Foundation for 5 years before this came out and now this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these for my wife. She loves them. She says you don&#x27;t have to put as much on as other makeups... I just have to trust her on that because I don&#x27;t know anything about this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used the loose bare minerals for many years.  I am really glad to finally have a compact the does not spill.  This makes for easier travel.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than the loose powder. Same coverage with better convenience.</li>
            <li> It came quickly. In love Bare Essentials!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product as I was looking for a pressed powder foundation. The color matched perfectly. Unfortunately for me, even when applying with a bare minerals brush, it sits in my wrinkles and made my pores look HUGE! Would not recommend unless you have young, flawless skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> Love love love this foundation! Excellent coverage. You must purchase the brush that goes with this to achieve the airbrushed perfect finish! Shades are a bit lighter than original formula so definitely get shade matched prior to purchase! You will love the medium to full coverage!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a very good product! I even got it in the mail like a week earlier! And it&#x27;s just perfect i used to use MAC and although I love MAC foundation too but it wouldn&#x27;t look as natural as bare minerals did. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> nice summer foundation but a bit too dry for winter.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to have a solidcompact now</li>
            <li> I have ordered this for both of my daughters, and they both really love it.  Maybe I should order it for myself!</li>
            <li> If you expecting an exact color cross over, you will be disappointed.  I highly recommend going to a physical store and putting your eyes on the colors before you commit to buying (which I did because I had heard this from other reviewers).  It covers well and I have overall liked the product.  I switch between the foundation brush and my Kabuki brush depending on the coverage I want.  If you do use the Kabuki brush don&#x27;t expect it to be any less messy than the original loose foundation.  Definitely buildable and after a full day, a quick buff brings my makeup back to morning coverage without looking cakey.  Do be warned that a light hand is a must or you will end up with a cakey look.  Less is more.  Also glad they upped the SPF to 20!!</li>
            <li> Even tho this is the same color as the loose power I use and love, this one comes across more orangey on my face and looks more caked on.  I was hoping to be able to tuck this in my purse and use it for touch-ups, but I didn&#x27;t realize that it is made to use with a brush (the swirl and tap) and I was hoping to use it with a slim puff and save the mess/steps of the brush.  Still a good product overall, just not meeting the need I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way...good coverage...light weight foundation...easy to apply</li>
            <li> Hard to use this product with a make-up sponge, as it looks cakey and way too thick. Using a Bare Minerals make-up brush is better, but the color still seems a bit off to me (vs. their loose powder).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It gives super good coverage, much better than their loose foundations. It goes on really quick, just use the kabuki brush or something similar. You can build coverage too. Wears well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see the foundation in a compact.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t make the mess that the swirl, tap and apply powder makes.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had a relatively mild summer and I&#x27;m still pretty tan free. I have light skin and this is a slightly darker version of light. I mix it with my other Bare Escentuals powder and it keeps me from looking quite as ghostly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a MAC and Urban Decay girl, but I received a gift card for Bare Escentuals (which I use from time to time), and I ended up buying this.  I actually prefer it to the powder because it&#x27;s a lot less messy and more matte.  Like all Bare Escentual foundations, it also works great as a concealer if you use a concealer brush.  The only thing that is sort of annoying is that if you use the medium-sized blush brush for BE is that when you swipe your brush over it, so much excess foundations floats off the compact and is a little wasteful.  My suggestion is when you using it to swipe your brush over it very slowly, or even use a smaller brush, and have a place where the excess can fall.  Then use that part as concealer with your concealer brush.  Good product!</li>
            <li> Love this foundation. Great coverage and very easy to apply with a brush. Lasts all day. I have been using this foundation for a couple months and love it more every day. Especially love the Fairly Light.</li>
            <li> this is an easy part of my makeup that I carry with me even though I seldom reapply makeup during my day. Normally I don&#x27;t feel the need to because the initial coverage is good and stays generally all day.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you thought the original Bare Escentuals foundation was easy you will LOVE this product.  Very easy to apply.  Stays on much better than the original, and transports very well-no powder spill. (Does not come with an application brush-need to buy.)  Only drawback is choosing the correct shade.  Although the shades are given the same names, they are somewhat lighter than the original powder.  I would advise going to one of the stores to match before ordering.</li>
