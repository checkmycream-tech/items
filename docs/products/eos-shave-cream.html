            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of the great reviews, and perhaps this is a good product for those with very fine hair or something like that.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, and leaves my legs very smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li>Smells great, cute recyclable bottle</li>
            <li>this helps and of course Happy Shaving:)</li>
            <li>If you use more than the recommended amount you will have problems!</li>
            <li>AND SMOOTH!!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I look at shaving cream as kind of a luxury anyway, but I would not repurchase this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job effectively.</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>Its nice for people who shave their legs with out water</li>
            <li>nice shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Also, the pomegranate-raspberry has a medicinal smell, kind of like cough syrup.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaving cream that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love it amazing</li>
            <li>The packaging is lovely, the scent is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my legs very smooth and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I recently switched to shaving with a double-edge safety razor and this shave cream is the perfect companion.  </li>
            <li>Most of the people giving this product 1 star noted that they used way more than the instructions told them too.</li>
            <li>I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used $0.99 shaving creams that work better than this.</li>
            <li>I used most of the bottle as a moisturizer/aftershave instead of for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>I think a lot of people were probably getting the build up on their razor because they were using more product than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I do NOT understand how so many people like it..</li>
            <li>i love all of the eos product</li>
            <li>I love this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I would love it since I have already fallen for the lip balms &amp; hand creams.</li>
            <li>cute scent</li>
            <li>But I love EOS products</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I love the smell.</li>
            <li>And I love how this smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>It takes all of two seconds more.</li>
            <li>as most can tell by what&#x27;s already been written, so it is in the end up to you to make up your mind as to if you like it or not.</li>
            <li>I love EOS lip balm and hand lotion</li>
            <li>I bought this at the store and was very excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I did use it on dry skin, as I&#x27;ve read that&#x27;s the best way to use the product.  </li>
            <li>While I still used my tub faucet to rinse out my razor, I was able to have not just smooth, but silky smooth legs!  </li>
            <li>The smell is very sweet, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of sugar-y smells, don&#x27;t go for this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is the only one that works for me, and it smells good too!</li>
            <li>and I had to take even more time to clean the tub.</li>
            <li>This product was amazing, I loved the smell and the packaging, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it&#x27;s like a lotion instead of foam or gel</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shave cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have never been a huge fan of non-foaming shaving cream but wanted to try this brand.  </li>
            <li>EOS shave cream leaves my legs smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this by mail.</li>
            <li>But in it&#x27;s primary job-</li>
            <li>and I try to smooth this on or lather up with it</li>
            <li>light scent.</li>
            <li>I first tried the EOS shaving cream a couple of months ago and fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>While at Target with a friend she pointed out this product and told me it&#x27;s great to shave dry.  </li>
            <li>All in all, great for shaving dry and moisturizing skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a true shaving cream.</li>
            <li>one it smells SO GOOD and second</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever had good luck with it.</li>
            <li>It left my legs feeling smooth all day and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Put simply: it works OK, it smells OK, and they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>Love it, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I ended up using much more product than I think I normally use.</li>
            <li>im going back to pure silk shaving cream :P</li>
            <li>but thats really the only good thing i have to say about this.</li>
            <li>, it drips off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the right type of moisturizing..</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t uncommon for me to finish shaving with rashes and small bumps - never once with this product.  </li>
            <li>so you do have to rinse your razor more when using it dry, but that said if you don&#x27;t have time for a full shower</li>
            <li>No red bumps, no discomfort and my legs feel very smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it does make my legs smooth and shiny, and they feel somewhat more moisturized after using this.</li>
            <li>and if you like to get a nice, close shave and don&#x27;t mind shaving your legs dry, go for it!</li>
            <li>The first time this happened, I patiently ran the water and swept each and every blob into the drain.</li>
            <li>my regular bar soap works better as a &#x27;shave lotion&#x27; in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I got razor burn and not a close shave.  </li>
            <li>My legs felt so soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference immediately and ended up having to shave the first leg again.  </li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews, I had to share my own experience.</li>
            <li>I tried it and was really amazed at how soft and smooth my legs were.</li>
            <li>It works really well , left my skin really soft and no razor burn surprisingly because i have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s better to turn the water off and shave or just shave dry.</li>
            <li>: It does take a bit more to cover my leg when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>know people are very quick to judge things and write reviews based on something they have only tried once.</li>
            <li>When you blend a large amount of this onto your leg, it thins out immediately causing you to apply and reapply.</li>
            <li>It does take more of the cream than it would with your typical foaming shave gel, but it is worth it for the moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li>Again, very time consuming.</li>
            <li>I think it works very well.</li>
            <li>I think some reviewers thought it should be and used too much.  </li>
            <li>I achieved a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I kept trying because i wanted so much to like it.  </li>
            <li>does that really matter?</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t help much at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comparable to Keihls shave cream, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>was that it uses up really fast</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit (at most two pumps per leg, three if you are very tall), so the bottle lasts me much longer than any gel based shaving cream.</li>
            <li>but the shave cream is kind of pointless</li>
            <li>Love it, but I can get it at Walmart for WAY less.</li>
            <li>I am almost certain that it had no difference compared to my St. Ives sensitive skin body wash when used to shave.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it clogged my razor despite frequent rinsing, so my shave wasn&#x27;t very close</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t annoy my skin like a lot of products and it seems to really help with razor rash, which as people with sensitive skin will know lots about.</li>
            <li>it be known, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>it has a lotion like consistency and come in a really big bottle totally worth it</li>
            <li>but overall it was worth it</li>
            <li>Used a brand new razor and again it felt like I had no cream on my skin</li>
            <li>Oh, well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>I only needed 1-2 pumps to cover each leg (I&#x27;m a bigger girl) and it shaved off smooth.  </li>
            <li>Eos is overrated: I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use two pumps on each leg (and as a plus sized women these aren&#x27;t tiny legs) and it is more than enough to coat my entire leg.</li>
            <li>After all the time it took me to shave using this product, I can&#x27;t imagine people&#x27;s hot water bills who regularly use this product!!</li>
            <li>First I only intended to shave with it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It was what i expected and smelled really nice only draw back</li>
            <li>I know most people cringe at the thought of shaving their legs when they are dry, however I&#x27;ve no complaints when I use this on dry skin.</li>
            <li>While I usually end up with razor burn if I shave too quickly, this cream protects my legs better than any other shaving cream I have tried.</li>
            <li>People have their own likes and dislikes and some will love or hate this</li>
            <li>It leaves me legs incredibly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and have been looking for years for something that will not irritate my legs when shaving.</li>
            <li>After using this shaving cream my legs were not itchy and they are soooo soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Leaves legs feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, in the shower: I find that one pump is enough to do my whole leg</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how soft it make my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t really want a super hydrating shaving cream because my lotion is more than enough.. but my complaint with this cream is the fact it seriously DULLS your blades and clogs it up like no other..</li>
            <li>I usually dread shaving my legs, but this product makes me look forward to shaving! :-)</li>
            <li>first of all it takes three pumps just to get enough to cover an entire leg.</li>
            <li>Using the same midgrade razor I&#x27;ve used successfully for years, in the shower, this cream left my legs feeling like I had dry shaved with an old dull razor.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but I&#x27;m going back to foaming gel.  </li>
            <li>Major plus!</li>
            <li>so this was a major factor in if I&#x27;d like it or not.</li>
            <li>you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a shave cream so much as it&#x27;s a shave</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical because it&#x27;s not like a foam but creamy like lotion.</li>
            <li>--I can get a much smoother shave with plain old bar soap.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> No red bumps, no discomfort and my legs feel very smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it does make my legs smooth and shiny, and they feel somewhat more moisturized after using this.</li>
            <li> and if you like to get a nice, close shave and don&#x27;t mind shaving your legs dry, go for it!</li>
            <li> The first time this happened, I patiently ran the water and swept each and every blob into the drain.</li>
            <li> my regular bar soap works better as a &#x27;shave lotion&#x27; in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I got razor burn and not a close shave.  </li>
            <li> My legs felt so soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference immediately and ended up having to shave the first leg again.  </li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I had to share my own experience.</li>
            <li> I tried it and was really amazed at how soft and smooth my legs were.</li>
            <li> It works really well , left my skin really soft and no razor burn surprisingly because i have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s better to turn the water off and shave or just shave dry.</li>
            <li> : It does take a bit more to cover my leg when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> know people are very quick to judge things and write reviews based on something they have only tried once.</li>
            <li> When you blend a large amount of this onto your leg, it thins out immediately causing you to apply and reapply.</li>
            <li> It does take more of the cream than it would with your typical foaming shave gel, but it is worth it for the moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> Again, very time consuming.</li>
            <li> I think it works very well.</li>
            <li> I think some reviewers thought it should be and used too much.  </li>
            <li> I achieved a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I kept trying because i wanted so much to like it.  </li>
            <li> does that really matter?</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t help much at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comparable to Keihls shave cream, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> was that it uses up really fast</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit (at most two pumps per leg, three if you are very tall), so the bottle lasts me much longer than any gel based shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but the shave cream is kind of pointless</li>
            <li> Love it, but I can get it at Walmart for WAY less.</li>
            <li> I am almost certain that it had no difference compared to my St. Ives sensitive skin body wash when used to shave.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it clogged my razor despite frequent rinsing, so my shave wasn&#x27;t very close</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t annoy my skin like a lot of products and it seems to really help with razor rash, which as people with sensitive skin will know lots about.</li>
            <li> it be known, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> it has a lotion like consistency and come in a really big bottle totally worth it</li>
            <li> but overall it was worth it</li>
            <li> Used a brand new razor and again it felt like I had no cream on my skin</li>
            <li> Oh, well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> I only needed 1-2 pumps to cover each leg (I&#x27;m a bigger girl) and it shaved off smooth.  </li>
            <li> Eos is overrated: I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use two pumps on each leg (and as a plus sized women these aren&#x27;t tiny legs) and it is more than enough to coat my entire leg.</li>
            <li> After all the time it took me to shave using this product, I can&#x27;t imagine people&#x27;s hot water bills who regularly use this product!!</li>
            <li> First I only intended to shave with it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It was what i expected and smelled really nice only draw back</li>
            <li> I know most people cringe at the thought of shaving their legs when they are dry, however I&#x27;ve no complaints when I use this on dry skin.</li>
            <li> While I usually end up with razor burn if I shave too quickly, this cream protects my legs better than any other shaving cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> People have their own likes and dislikes and some will love or hate this</li>
            <li> It leaves me legs incredibly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and have been looking for years for something that will not irritate my legs when shaving.</li>
            <li> After using this shaving cream my legs were not itchy and they are soooo soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Leaves legs feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, in the shower: I find that one pump is enough to do my whole leg</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how soft it make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t really want a super hydrating shaving cream because my lotion is more than enough.. but my complaint with this cream is the fact it seriously DULLS your blades and clogs it up like no other..</li>
            <li> I usually dread shaving my legs, but this product makes me look forward to shaving! :-)</li>
            <li> first of all it takes three pumps just to get enough to cover an entire leg.</li>
            <li> Using the same midgrade razor I&#x27;ve used successfully for years, in the shower, this cream left my legs feeling like I had dry shaved with an old dull razor.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but I&#x27;m going back to foaming gel.  </li>
            <li> Major plus!</li>
            <li> so this was a major factor in if I&#x27;d like it or not.</li>
            <li> you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a shave cream so much as it&#x27;s a shave</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical because it&#x27;s not like a foam but creamy like lotion.</li>
            <li> --I can get a much smoother shave with plain old bar soap.  </li>
            <li> I only need one or two pumps per leg, so I think it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> it clogs up your razors like no other and dulls them FASTER than any shaving cream I have ever used..</li>
            <li> Light small, a little goes a long way, I&#x27;ve used it both</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve no red bumps or very very very few if my razor is on the older side.</li>
            <li> I even tried to do it dry and got the same results.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and coarse hair so that may be why is just isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> Finally a last minute party invitation had me shaving dry.  </li>
            <li> Usually when shaving dry, my legs get very itchy afterward.  </li>
            <li> to facilitate a smooth, nick-free shave- it fails.  </li>
            <li> It took me twice as long to shave as I kept having to go over spots and reapply this product.</li>
            <li> so I can continue shaving my legs.. takes me four times as long to shave my legs..</li>
            <li> So it lasts a long time as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs were very soft for the remainder of the day, but the hair growth seemed to appear sooner than usual</li>
            <li> I winced because I&#x27;ve never shaved dry before</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ve tried it dry, i&#x27;ve tried it damp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both in the shower and tried it dry skin, it works well both ways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry skin</li>
            <li> but it still leaves your legs dry and sticky.</li>
            <li> After I shaved and dried my legs, i had numerous red bumps and my legs still had stray hairs!</li>
            <li> It also allows for a very close shave without leaving behind any red bumps, nicks, or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> but i have to say i was quite disappointed with this, though i have to say the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but I could only stomach to half a bottle and tossed it..</li>
            <li> it also dries out even though it says its for wet and dry shaving</li>
            <li> The second time, I was lazy and left those blobs there.</li>
            <li> wet (in the shower) and dry and have no complaints either way.</li>
            <li> saw it at food 4 less today, for only 4 bucks.</li>
            <li> I think some of the other reviewers were bent on having a thick layer of white covering their entire leg, which isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> cream leaves my skin feeling baby soft for at least 2 days after using it.</li>
            <li> When my legs are wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it wet</li>
            <li> It spreads well over wet skin.</li>
            <li> A little of this cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Tried it on one leg with my Venus Olay razor; didn&#x27;t even use it on my other leg because I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  </li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is hard to get the last 2\\&quot; of the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is lite and subtle without being overpowering (I hate overly strong smells from products in general)</li>
            <li> It floats around in little blobs all over the bathtub.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes, I saw my legs were covered in nicks and bumps.  </li>
            <li> Yes you have to rinse out your razor every few swipes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not light..</li>
            <li> its a a waste of money..</li>
            <li> it took a while to ship and came a few days after I was expecting it</li>
            <li> What a waste of time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some reviewers felt like they needed to use upwards of two pumps per leg.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this shaving cream and was fairly skeptical because of all the mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> It goes on thin and you rub it in a little bit (like a lotion).</li>
            <li> hope this helps someone at least.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look thick like gels can...</li>
            <li> it was too thick, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> , least I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After a shower and a shave with this, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or unhappy.</li>
            <li> Even worse this time around.  </li>
            <li> I used a thin layer of product and it still worked well.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS by far the worst shaving cream I have ever had the displeasure to use..</li>
            <li> but I just hate to see reviews saying a product is bad then not listing anything other than it arrived late or in the case of this</li>
            <li> and I ended up having to throw out my expensive razor cartridge after every shave.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t failed me.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product for several reasons.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, let&#x27;s face it</li>
            <li> And before all the lovers for this crap jumps on me..</li>
            <li> and finally i hate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dissolve  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s AWFUL..</li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I feel the need to add my opinion. I first tried the EOS shaving cream a couple of months ago and fell in love with this product. I have only used it in the shower but had no issues with it gumming up my razor or anything. I use two pumps on each leg (and as a plus sized women these aren&#x27;t tiny legs) and it is more than enough to coat my entire leg. I think some of the other reviewers were bent on having a thick layer of white covering their entire leg, which isn&#x27;t necessary. This shaving cream does the job with just a thin smooth layer. It does take more of the cream than it would with your typical foaming shave gel, but it is worth it for the moisturizing effects. EOS shave cream leaves my legs smooth and moisturized. While I usually end up with razor burn if I shave too quickly, this cream protects my legs better than any other shaving cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this by mail. What a waste of time! It took me twice as long to shave as I kept having to go over spots and reapply this product. I ended up using much more product than I think I normally use. It also left a film on my razor so I couldn&#x27;t just rinse the hair off the razor, I had to wipe it off! Again, very time consuming. After I was done, I realized that this product left an oily residue all over my tub and I had to take even more time to clean the tub. My legs were very soft for the remainder of the day, but the hair growth seemed to appear sooner than usual so I did not get to close of a shave with it. After all the time it took me to shave using this product, I can&#x27;t imagine people&#x27;s hot water bills who regularly use this product!!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I had to share my own experience. Yes, you can use a lot of this product, but 2-3 pumps is sufficient. It leaves me legs incredibly soft and moisturized. The bottle is attractive and it smells amazing! I think it works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the store and was very excited to use it. After I shaved and dried my legs, i had numerous red bumps and my legs still had stray hairs! ): very disappointed in this product!!! I even tried to do it dry and got the same results. Smells great, cute recyclable bottle but thats really the only good thing i have to say about this.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. You only need a tiny bit (at most two pumps per leg, three if you are very tall), so the bottle lasts me much longer than any gel based shaving cream. It left my legs feeling smooth all day and smells amazing.  I recently switched to shaving with a double-edge safety razor and this shave cream is the perfect companion.  FYI: Most of the people giving this product 1 star noted that they used way more than the instructions told them too. This is a true shaving cream. It is not gel based, it does (and is not supposed to) lather up. It goes on thin and you rub it in a little bit (like a lotion). If you use more than the recommended amount you will have problems!</li>
            <li> This shave cream stays put and feels wonderful after the shaving is done</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream. All of the Eos line are great products...&lt;br /&gt;I have to add I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this shave cream last summer on a whim to take on vacation.  I fell in love.  I have sensitive skin and it wasn&#x27;t uncommon for me to finish shaving with rashes and small bumps - never once with this product.  During the summer months, I skip lotion.  My only complaint is that is hard to get the last 2\\&quot; of the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it, but I can get it at Walmart for WAY less.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is wretched. The packaging is lovely, the scent is light and pleasant.  But in it&#x27;s primary job- to facilitate a smooth, nick-free shave- it fails.  I have never been a huge fan of non-foaming shaving cream but wanted to try this brand.  Using the same midgrade razor I&#x27;ve used successfully for years, in the shower, this cream left my legs feeling like I had dry shaved with an old dull razor.  It also left a goopy film on the blades.  But I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product so I waited a while and tried again.  Even worse this time around.  Used a brand new razor and again it felt like I had no cream on my skin at all providing a layer of protection. Within a few minutes, I saw my legs were covered in nicks and bumps.  I had high hopes for this, but I&#x27;m going back to foaming gel.  I&#x27;ve used $0.99 shaving creams that work better than this. I&#x27;ve read a lot of the great reviews, and perhaps this is a good product for those with very fine hair or something like that.  I have dry skin, and coarse hair so that may be why is just isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> Good. How I was expecting.</li>
            <li> OMGEEEE!!! I did not buy this from Amazon. It was on sale and decided to but it. I was kind of skeptical because it&#x27;s not like a foam but creamy like lotion. I tried it and was really amazed at how soft and smooth my legs were. This is a really good product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin moisturized. I noticed that it clogged my razor despite frequent rinsing, so my shave wasn&#x27;t very close and I ended up having to throw out my expensive razor cartridge after every shave. I used most of the bottle as a moisturizer/aftershave instead of for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and have been looking for years for something that will not irritate my legs when shaving. This product is the only one that works for me, and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been one to use hair conditioner to shave. It leaves my legs very smooth and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  While at Target with a friend she pointed out this product and told me it&#x27;s great to shave dry.  I winced because I&#x27;ve never shaved dry before and I couldn&#x27;t imagine it to be at all pleasant.  I took her word and bought it.  First I only intended to shave with it in the shower.  I only needed 1-2 pumps to cover each leg (I&#x27;m a bigger girl) and it shaved off smooth.  Yes you have to rinse out your razor every few swipes but that&#x27;s shaving with anything. It doesn&#x27;t look thick like gels can...you can barely see it. I think some reviewers thought it should be and used too much.  While it didn&#x27;t make much difference vs. conditioner on my legs, I did start to see smoother skin on my underarms after shaving with it a few times.  Finally a last minute party invitation had me shaving dry.  While I still used my tub faucet to rinse out my razor, I was able to have not just smooth, but silky smooth legs!  All in all, great for shaving dry and moisturizing skin.  I&#x27;m going to keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have this in Pomegranate and Vanilla. The smells are pleasant. It&#x27;s not really a shave cream so much as it&#x27;s a shave lotion-- it&#x27;s not aerosol and it doesn&#x27;t foam up. It&#x27;s like a lotion. When my legs are wet and I try to smooth this on or lather up with it, it drips off pretty quickly. I find it&#x27;s better to turn the water off and shave or just shave dry. On the other hand, it does make my legs smooth and shiny, and they feel somewhat more moisturized after using this. Because I am vegan, I am happy that EOS does not test on animals. Put simply: it works OK, it smells OK, and they don&#x27;t test on animals. I look at shaving cream as kind of a luxury anyway, but I would not repurchase this.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving cream that I have ever used. I usually dread shaving my legs, but this product makes me look forward to shaving! :-) I&#x27;m not sure why some reviewers felt like they needed to use upwards of two pumps per leg. I only need to use one pump for my lower leg and one pump for my upper leg. A little of this cream goes a long way. I&#x27;ve found that if you take a few seconds to rub the cream into your leg before shaving, you don&#x27;t need to use as much. Rubbing the cream into your legs also alleviates the problem of cream build up on your razor blade. I think a lot of people were probably getting the build up on their razor because they were using more product than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;This cream leaves my skin feeling baby soft for at least 2 days after using it. BEST SHAVING CREAM EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this shaving cream and was fairly skeptical because of all the mixed reviews.  I did use it on dry skin, as I&#x27;ve read that&#x27;s the best way to use the product.  Usually when shaving dry, my legs get very itchy afterward.  After using this shaving cream my legs were not itchy and they are soooo soft and moisturized.  AND SMOOTH!!  I achieved a very close shave.  I used a thin layer of product and it still worked well.  The smell is very sweet, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of sugar-y smells, don&#x27;t go for this product.  All in all, I like it and if you like to get a nice, close shave and don&#x27;t mind shaving your legs dry, go for it!</li>
            <li> Smells sooo good. Leaves legs feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> Always loved this product. It hasn&#x27;t failed me.</li>
            <li> never use this shaving i just try it i love it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS by far the worst shaving cream I have ever had the displeasure to use.. I do NOT understand how so many people like it.. it clogs up your razors like no other and dulls them FASTER than any shaving cream I have ever used.. it&#x27;s AWFUL.. I know it brags that it leaves your skin moisturized and that was one of the selling points that I decided to give this a try.. Bottom line.. it&#x27;s not the right type of moisturizing.. it&#x27;s just ick.. i can&#x27;t describe it.. I feel like there is a layer of oil on my skin or something.. it&#x27;s not light.. I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t really want a super hydrating shaving cream because my lotion is more than enough.. but my complaint with this cream is the fact it seriously DULLS your blades and clogs it up like no other.. i&#x27;m sitting under the water trying my hardest to get rid of the gunk inside of my blades so I can continue shaving my legs.. takes me four times as long to shave my legs.. I told myself I would use the entire bottle up before moving on but I could only stomach to half a bottle and tossed it.. And before all the lovers for this crap jumps on me.. YES I only used TWO pumps per leg.. like the directions.. there are two pros though.. one it smells SO GOOD and second the bottle doesn&#x27;t rust..</li>
            <li> This product was amazing, I loved the smell and the packaging, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it&#x27;s like a lotion instead of foam or gel but I don&#x27;t regret getting it and I got used to it being lotion</li>
            <li> i love all of the eos product but i have to say i was quite disappointed with this, though i have to say the smell is amazing.  first of all it takes three pumps just to get enough to cover an entire leg. it also dries out even though it says its for wet and dry shaving and finally i hate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dissolve  and you&#x27;re left with it floating in the water.guess im going back to pure silk shaving cream :P</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product for several reasons. The biggest reason is that it does not do it&#x27;s job effectively. When you blend a large amount of this onto your leg, it thins out immediately causing you to apply and reapply. It also clogs up the razor halfway up your leg which causes you to run your razor over the same area multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, when the shave cream drops into the water (when it falls off each time you run your razor or simply when you dunk your razor in the water to get the excess cream off), it does not disintegrate into the water. It floats around in little blobs all over the bathtub. Then, when you drain the water, all of those blobs are stuck to the bottom of your tub. The first time this happened, I patiently ran the water and swept each and every blob into the drain. The second time, I was lazy and left those blobs there. The next day, there were ants all over the inside of my tub. Disgusting. I cleaned the blobs and ants, and then threw this product in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving cream. When I seen it in stores I had no doubt I would love it since I have already fallen for the lip balms &amp; hand creams. Light small, a little goes a long way, I&#x27;ve used it both wet (in the shower) and dry and have no complaints either way. Like someone else said, if you use too much you will come across waste product on the razor. I found mine cheaper in stores like Walgreens but I&#x27;ve very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- not tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;- plastic bottle that does not rust in the shower (and has recycling logo on it)&lt;br /&gt;- cute scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- does not work well with or without water&lt;br /&gt;- gums up razor (esp when used with water)&lt;br /&gt;- have to use lots&lt;br /&gt;- my regular bar soap works better as a &#x27;shave lotion&#x27; in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to try because it was not tested on animals and it had a plastic bottle so it would not rust in the shower.  I was very disappointed.  The first time I used it, I got razor burn and not a close shave.  I kept trying because i wanted so much to like it.  I&#x27;ve tried it wet, i&#x27;ve tried it dry, i&#x27;ve tried it damp.  Bottom line is that it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as my bar soap, even for shaving.</li>
            <li> nice. bit pricey tho. saw it at food 4 less today, for only 4 bucks.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this shaving cream I was a bit skeptical, let&#x27;s face it the reviews for it aren&#x27;t that great. But I love EOS products so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love the smell. It is lite and subtle without being overpowering (I hate overly strong smells from products in general) so this was a major factor in if I&#x27;d like it or not. And I love how this smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it smells is great but does it work well, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;The answer is YES. I&#x27;ve used it both in the shower and tried it dry skin, it works well both ways.&lt;br /&gt;First, in the shower: I find that one pump is enough to do my whole leg (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3 so that&#x27;s saying something).&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t annoy my skin like a lot of products and it seems to really help with razor rash, which as people with sensitive skin will know lots about. It spreads well over wet skin. And you don&#x27;t need a lot of it, least I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After a shower and a shave with this, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or unhappy. Major plus! And I&#x27;ve no red bumps or very very very few if my razor is on the older side. But that&#x27;s through no fault of the product, simply the razor being old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On dry skin: It does take a bit more to cover my leg when it&#x27;s dry but it works just as well as in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is on the thicker side so you do have to rinse your razor more when using it dry, but that said if you don&#x27;t have time for a full shower does that really matter? It takes all of two seconds more. I know most people cringe at the thought of shaving their legs when they are dry, however I&#x27;ve no complaints when I use this on dry skin. No red bumps, no discomfort and my legs feel very smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know people are very quick to judge things and write reviews based on something they have only tried once. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and my bottle still hasn&#x27;t run out. That&#x27;s with using it every time I need to shave. So it lasts a long time as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone at least. People have their own likes and dislikes and some will love or hate this as most can tell by what&#x27;s already been written, so it is in the end up to you to make up your mind as to if you like it or not. I&#x27;ve only ever had good luck with it. So that&#x27;s my two cents.&lt;br /&gt;Let it be known, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I just hate to see reviews saying a product is bad then not listing anything other than it arrived late or in the case of this it was too thick, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This product warranted a good review in my eyes so I&#x27;m happy to take the time and write one after having tested it out for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and of course Happy Shaving:)</li>
            <li> Eos is overrated: I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t help much at all. If your going to buy it get it at a drug store; its way cheaper. Its nice for people who shave their legs with out water but it still leaves your legs dry and sticky. I am almost certain that it had no difference compared to my St. Ives sensitive skin body wash when used to shave. &#x3D;_&#x3D; its a a waste of money.. their products smell great but they never actually seem to work.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shave cream I have ever used. My legs felt so soft and smooth after using it. This is the only shave cream I will use from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells great, and leaves my legs very smooth after shaving. It also allows for a very close shave without leaving behind any red bumps, nicks, or razor burn.  I only need one or two pumps per leg, so I think it should last a long time.  It&#x27;s very comparable to Keihls shave cream, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Love it, highly recommend. Can&#x27;t believe how soft it make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love it amazing it has a lotion like consistency and come in a really big bottle totally worth it it took a while to ship and came a few days after I was expecting it but overall it was worth it</li>
            <li> nice shaving cream. light scent.</li>
            <li> Tried it on one leg with my Venus Olay razor; didn&#x27;t even use it on my other leg because I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  I love EOS lip balm and hand lotion but the shave cream is kind of pointless--I can get a much smoother shave with plain old bar soap.  I could feel the difference immediately and ended up having to shave the first leg again.  Also, the pomegranate-raspberry has a medicinal smell, kind of like cough syrup.  Oh, well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> It works really well , left my skin really soft and no razor burn surprisingly because i have really sensitive skin. It was what i expected and smelled really nice only draw back was that it uses up really fast beacause it doesnt lather up but other then that it was spot on. (:</li>
