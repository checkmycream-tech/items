            <li>I bought a brush and this shaving cream for my husband, but it smells so wonderful that my daughters and I wanted to try it for shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>I think you will be impressed.</li>
            <li>He applies this with a Edwin Jagger Best Badger Shaving Brush, which he also loves!</li>
            <li>I decided to test this stuff out and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Very good price also.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Now I use it lol because it is great for your skin</li>
            <li>After the cheaper glycerol based shave soap I had ran out I decided to try the Proraso, which I&#x27;ve always heard great things about.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this soap makes shaving pleasant.</li>
            <li>Used it twice , no problem in getting a good amount of lather.</li>
            <li>(for me this is as good as it has ever been).  </li>
            <li>Really good lather.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re shaving a day&#x27;s growth and want to feel cool after your shave, this cream is best.</li>
            <li>Lathers up really nice and smells good too.</li>
            <li>Cannot say too many good things about it.</li>
            <li>I like the container as well because I find it handy to pick up some soap on the brush and then use the lid to work up the lather before brushing onto my face</li>
            <li>Nice smell too - not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the sandlewood variation when shaving 4 or 5 days&#x27; growth, but it&#x27;s still a great product well worth the price.</li>
            <li>There is a mild, pleasant scent that I notice while using it</li>
            <li>They both suffer from eczema so what they put on their skin is very important - it must promote healing and hydration and this cream does both.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, great lather, lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Honestly love it.</li>
            <li>I have really irritable skin and when inside this my skin feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li>The more water the wetter it will be.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The lather is decent and scent is great.  </li>
            <li>, it helps me fine tune it</li>
            <li>Has an interesting smell that&#x27;s not unpleasant</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li>You can pick up a brush for relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>Then add a tub of this fragrance free shaving soap and you are set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t chew your face up with cheap soap.</li>
            <li>smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This shaving soap is absolutely the best I have ever used and will probably be the last soap I will ever have to use.</li>
            <li>This lasted a reasonable amount of time, great suds, though I have soft water.</li>
            <li>I instantly noted the pleasant smell it had and the thicker and richer lather it created.</li>
            <li>The most notable and exciting thing I found, was that it did not cause any irritation at all to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As always, it&#x27;s better if you lather once, wipe off, and then lather again before shaving but even if I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m getting better results with this than with post-shower double lathers from cheap shave soaps.  </li>
            <li>It really does take a tiny amount to make a good lather, and the blade just glides without skipping off my face.  </li>
            <li>Originally I tried this one first, but since it was the first one I used</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, he can shave the next day if he wants and with 0 problems.</li>
            <li>I also learned that shaving soaps that are applied with a brush stay moist for a much longer time</li>
            <li>He really likes the cooling effect on his face.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with a mug and brush my whole life.</li>
            <li>I have also had skin problems my whole life.</li>
            <li>Its a decent match for Derby DE blades.</li>
            <li>I was shocked and very happy.</li>
            <li>I still get some light redness on my neck but do not feel any irritation and the pink color fades in minutes</li>
            <li>Short version - this IS worth the money.</li>
            <li>As a shaving soap it is good but not great.</li>
            <li>It does not lather as well as others, it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as close of a shave as other soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it leaves his face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Soak the razor and brush in hot water prior to shaving.</li>
            <li>It creates a rich but sheer foaming action that gives a closer shave than the thicker foaming  English style soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Foams well, smells good and last a long time considering I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin try this as I haven&#x27;t found any others that work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, One of these containers will last me at least 6 months of regular shaving, and the quality is superb.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and makes shaving much nicer and easier on your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this for an anniversery present for my husband because he wanted to try someting different on his face because he can only shave maybe twice a week without to much irritation.</li>
            <li>Recently I found Proraso Shaving Soap for Ultra Sensitive Skin, which is made in Italy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used soap like this before, it can be a little bit of a pain at first</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say it is any better or worse than other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; soaps but does work well for me.</li>
            <li> What I learned is that gels tend to dry on your face very quickly, therefore making the lubrication useless.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on this as a few other similar ones I&#x27;ve tried from local stores did not last long.</li>
            <li> If you simple wet the brush and swirl it a few times you will pick up enough soap.</li>
            <li> I have used the same canister for over 6 months and have not finished the half of it.</li>
            <li> I experience minor razor burn on the neck with other creams/soaps and have none with this product.  </li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> It only has a slight perfume so no strong smells left over after use.</li>
            <li> I shave almost everyday and a jar of lasts me several months.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a safety razor about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> but then once you get it down</li>
            <li> And the less water the drier it will be.</li>
            <li> Also leaves a slightly minty feeling; I think there&#x27;s a bit of menthol in it.  </li>
            <li> little tip.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of.  </li>
            <li> No more cans of goo for us!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shave soap is so luxurious. Do yourself a favor, and buy a proper shaving brush that won&#x27;t leave its fibers all in the canister, which was a mistake that I made. When you&#x27;re shaving a day&#x27;s growth and want to feel cool after your shave, this cream is best. I find it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the sandlewood variation when shaving 4 or 5 days&#x27; growth, but it&#x27;s still a great product well worth the price. I have used the same canister for over 6 months and have not finished the half of it.</li>
            <li> I bought a brush and this shaving cream for my husband, but it smells so wonderful that my daughters and I wanted to try it for shaving.  It is GREAT!  They both suffer from eczema so what they put on their skin is very important - it must promote healing and hydration and this cream does both.  No more cans of goo for us! This 2 jar deal is the one to get.</li>
            <li> I had never used shaving soaps before so after reading some reviews and doing some research I bought this soap. All I can say is that this soap makes shaving pleasant. Lathers up really nice and smells good too. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Its a decent match for Derby DE blades. It creates a rich but sheer foaming action that gives a closer shave than the thicker foaming  English style soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer it to more expensive English soaps.</li>
            <li> As a shaving soap it is good but not great. It does not lather as well as others, it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as close of a shave as other soaps. But it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and that makes it a 5 out of 5 any day for me. If you have sensitive skin try this as I haven&#x27;t found any others that work for me.</li>
            <li> Honestly love it. I have really irritable skin and when inside this my skin feels great afterwards. If you&#x27;ve never used soap like this before, it can be a little bit of a pain at first but then once you get it down it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Will never go back. When you get it all you need to do is start using your brush in circular motions.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an anniversery present for my husband because he wanted to try someting different on his face because he can only shave maybe twice a week without to much irritation. This stuff is amazing, he can shave the next day if he wants and with 0 problems. Now I use it lol because it is great for your skin</li>
            <li> I experience minor razor burn on the neck with other creams/soaps and have none with this product.  The lather is decent and scent is great.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> For years I used shaving gels that come in a can. They seemed to be alright until I did some research. What I learned is that gels tend to dry on your face very quickly, therefore making the lubrication useless. I also learned that shaving soaps that are applied with a brush stay moist for a much longer time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive skin I tried several different brands. Originally I tried this one first, but since it was the first one I used I did not have anything to compare it to. After trying several other brands I always found myself coming back to Proraso Sensitive Skin version. I shave almost everyday and a jar of lasts me several months. If you simple wet the brush and swirl it a few times you will pick up enough soap. Then you can swirl the brush against the palm of your hand and the soap comes to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have never tried a shaving soap I think you will be impressed. You can pick up a brush for relatively cheap. Then add a tub of this fragrance free shaving soap and you are set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On little tip. Soak the razor and brush in hot water prior to shaving. The shake some of the water out before applying the soap. The more water the wetter it will be. And the less water the drier it will be. Each person has to experiment for themselves.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great lather, lasts a very long time.  Cannot say too many good things about it. Very good price also.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Foams well, smells good and last a long time considering I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I bought a manual razor and brush. This soap lasts forever!!! And it&#x27;s cheaper than those can shaving creams too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves the &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;, it is more like a thick stiff cream. He really likes the cooling effect on his face. He compared it to Noxzema face wash. I&#x27;ve noticed that it leaves his face feeling very soft. He doesn&#x27;t use facial moisturizer, so the added softness is a plus. He applies this with a Edwin Jagger Best Badger Shaving Brush, which he also loves!</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a mug and brush my whole life. I have also had skin problems my whole life. Recently I found Proraso Shaving Soap for Ultra Sensitive Skin, which is made in Italy. I figured I had nothing to lose so I ordered it to try. I received it in a short time and started using it immediately. I instantly noted the pleasant smell it had and the thicker and richer lather it created. The most notable and exciting thing I found, was that it did not cause any irritation at all to my sensitive skin. I was shocked and very happy. This shaving soap is absolutely the best I have ever used and will probably be the last soap I will ever have to use.</li>
            <li> Used it twice , no problem in getting a good amount of lather.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a safety razor about a year ago.  After the cheaper glycerol based shave soap I had ran out I decided to try the Proraso, which I&#x27;ve always heard great things about.

Hope it lasts as long as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> I had been using a different soap before this and was getting some irritation and redness on my neck.  I decided to test this stuff out and am very happy with it.  I still get some light redness on my neck but do not feel any irritation and the pink color fades in minutes (for me this is as good as it has ever been).  There is a mild, pleasant scent that I notice while using it but it does not linger.  Really good lather.  I like the container as well because I find it handy to pick up some soap on the brush and then use the lid to work up the lather before brushing onto my face, it helps me fine tune it a bit before I start.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on this as a few other similar ones I&#x27;ve tried from local stores did not last long. This lasted a reasonable amount of time, great suds, though I have soft water. It only has a slight perfume so no strong smells left over after use. I can&#x27;t say it is any better or worse than other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; soaps but does work well for me.</li>
            <li> Short version - this IS worth the money. It lasts a long time and makes shaving much nicer and easier on your skin. Nice smell too - not overpowering. Don&#x27;t chew your face up with cheap soap.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, One of these containers will last me at least 6 months of regular shaving, and the quality is superb.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. smooth shave. you&#x27;ll want a badger brush though</li>
