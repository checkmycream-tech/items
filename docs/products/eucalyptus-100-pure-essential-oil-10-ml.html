            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Ever since I was little and my mom used it to ward of fleas (we had two large dogs), I have loved this scent.  </li>
            <li>Check out the Green Clean Aromatherapy Kit from Happy Soul or just purchase the individual bottles from Plantlife.  </li>
            <li>You can never go wrong with Eucalptus Oil and this particular brand is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely make amazon my first place to look for great deals on essential oils in the future.</li>
            <li>The scent is not as strong as I have experience with other brands, also there is no double safty lid  on top</li>
            <li>This idea came from a review at Amazon for the steam inhaler and I am very grateful.</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling this.  </li>
            <li>Smells fabulous and I am now just waiting to use it in my hand-held vaporizer when it gets here!</li>
            <li>the delivery was fast, so no problem there.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t want to make your own laundry detergent add a few drops of Eucalyptus to every load for its antiviral properties.</li>
            <li>Why better quality than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>and I have every confidence given their quality that it will remain as useful on the last day of its use as it was on its first.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely buying more essential oils from this brand and seller.</li>
            <li>It smells great, it was sealed, and the seller even included a little brochure about the uses of essential oils with a whole list of recipes on the back!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Fast delivery of an intact product from Plantlife Natural Body Care.</li>
            <li>Just waiting for a few more ingredients</li>
            <li>I typically mix it with extra virgin olive oil, using a 1 tsp of olive oil and 3 drops of the essential oil, the scent that arises from this mixture is a noticeable Eucalyptus scent which is quite pleasant and without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Eucalyptus is a natural antiseptic, anti-inflamitory, and help the air way.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this oil brand and the seller (Plantlife) as it arrived in a timely manner and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, but the quality compared to more expensive brands is drastic, it is like water and the scent doesn&#x27;t last, not therapeutic quality, maybe if you mixed it with water and used it as a room freshener.</li>
            <li>I guess I was hoping for more of a subtle strength to this oil...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert on essential oils, but I thought that this product was equal in quality to various essential oils I have bought in-store at higher prices.</li>
            <li>I used this to help with a stuffy nose, actually rubbed it on to an old t-shirt I had on</li>
            <li>I used this to make my bedroom smell fresh and soothing, put a few drops on a cotton ball and place it above the headboard.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as much as some other essential oils I&#x27;ve acquired due to my projects not requiring use of it as much, but the shelf life of these oils is quite long</li>

            <li> When mixed with large almond oil bottle still seemed to have a lot of fragrance for small bottle.</li>
            <li> If a child drinks it, they have less than five minutes to live.  </li>
            <li> I can not get past that harsh smell to enjoy the eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li> At first glance it seems like only a small amount if you&#x27;re new to using essential oils, or at least that was my initial reaction when I started using these.  </li>
            <li> so I could bring back the scent to my old dried leaves.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it late-night one day with regular shipping, and it arrived three days later -- way faster than I expected!  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re both in the dark blue bottles which keeps all essential oils protected from the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please, Please, Please be careful with essential oils.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ve been using it since and still (a month and a half later)</li>
            <li> A few drops last for ever</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked at the website yet that they provided to see all the other uses but will soon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately paid as much in shipping as I did for product.</li>
            <li> However that is not the case, this small vial will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I used quite a bit of it when my baby was sick for the first time last month.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but I assume it will be fine</li>
            <li> There are products out there that might be better.  However, Plantlife gives you the best bang for the buck!!</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell. Good.</li>
            <li> Got this as a healing aroma therapy catalyst.  It works well, has a &#x27;clean&#x27; smell to it.  Would recommend peppermint more so than eucalyptus though.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Fast delivery of an intact product from Plantlife Natural Body Care. I&#x27;m no expert on essential oils, but I thought that this product was equal in quality to various essential oils I have bought in-store at higher prices. I&#x27;ll definitely make amazon my first place to look for great deals on essential oils in the future.</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus is a natural antiseptic, anti-inflamitory, and help the air way. I am in Iraq. It is difficult to get alcohol for cut and scrapes. The Ibuprofen sells out. I work in in dust storms so bad you can&#x27;t see across the street. THe dust cause respitory infections. It helped. It is not a cure all for basic sanitation, health care, which Iraq lacks. A bug bite here can kill! It helped heal a bug bite that took 5-6 monthes to heal. In a week healed.</li>
            <li> not sure  what it costs to produce, seemed a little expensive for size of product. When mixed with large almond oil bottle still seemed to have a lot of fragrance for small bottle. Unfortunately paid as much in shipping as I did for product. I might look around more before I ordered again. Smelled great however.</li>
            <li> good stuff in a steam inhaler</li>
            <li> Very strong and smells great.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase of this product. i bought it because i read somewhere that a few drops of eucalyptus oil on a dog collar can help rid them of fleas. well within days the fleas were GONE. don&#x27;t know if it was coincidence or what but we&#x27;ve been using it since and still (a month and a half later) NO FLEAS. ;)&lt;br /&gt;i received it within a reasonable amount of time, and it also came with a free gift. i would recommend PLANTLIFE to anyone reading this.</li>
            <li> great for diy cleaning supplies</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil. It has a clean and pure Eucalyptus scent. I used quite a bit of it when my baby was sick for the first time last month. I would definitely recommend this oil brand and the seller (Plantlife) as it arrived in a timely manner and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the smell of eucalyptus.  Ever since I was little and my mom used it to ward of fleas (we had two large dogs), I have loved this scent.  What I didn&#x27;t realize is all the ways the essential oil can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have now used it in our laundry - not overpowering but definitely makes me not mind starting up a load of laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also made my own \\&quot;all-purpose cleaner\\&quot; with the use of borax, vinegar, water, and this oil.  Wow.  Definitely LOVE it.  It&#x27;s not only CHEAPER than the store-bought brands, but it is also better for the environment and SMELLS BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you interested in knowing the \\&quot;All-Purpose cleaner\\&quot; recipe, here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/4 cup baking soda (or 2 teaspoons borax) into 1/2 gallon (2 liters) water.&lt;br /&gt;Store and keep.&lt;br /&gt;Use for removal of water deposit stains on shower stall panels, bathroom chrome fixtures, windows, bathroom mirrors, etc.&lt;br /&gt;20-30 drops of essential oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up is making our own hand lotions.  Just waiting for a few more ingredients and we&#x27;ll be using more of this oil.  I already ordered more!</li>
            <li> Great product for your home...helps clear sinus issues. just put it in with your humidifier or oil burner and enjoy the benefits.  I bought this for the sinus relief and enjoy it every day.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I guess I was hoping for more of a subtle strength to this oil...It is very strong and very mentholated smelling.  I wanted to get an oil that smelled just like my dried Eucalyptus leaves so I could bring back the scent to my old dried leaves.  I did find out it makes a good repellant if you want to keep cats out of certain areas though.  I had a carpet my cat continues to pick at and pick at- I added 6 dropped of oil to a spray bottle of water and misted the carpet-the cat won&#x27;t touch the carpet now!  :)</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this in my humidifier and it helps with my breathing. I would recommend this to anyone who needs help with similar issues.</li>
            <li> I used this in my steam inhaler when I was sick with congestions and sinus problems.  It worked great.  I felt so much better.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my steamer. I usually use it when I feel like I am coming down with a cold. It also feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> This is good quality oil for the price. Mix with peppermint essential oil and put in a diffuser (or just put on a cotton ball) for a home that smells like a spa. No kidding.</li>
            <li> Lead me to purchase a much bigger size.</li>
            <li> great for hair and stuffy nose love it very strong only like 2 drops needed to place in your hair love this product</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT...I USE IN HOMEMADE LAUNDRY DETERGENT I MADE..&amp; IN  HEATED HOLDER WITH WATER ADDED...I LIKE THE EUCALYPUS BEST FOR SMELL</li>
            <li> Great quality, great company, they even sent me a handwritten note. And a lemongrass bar of soap. Thank you! Would buy again. Why better quality than other brands I have tried. I Used this my sinuses, I would smell it right out of the bottle...helps me and my husband to relax. And it clears sinuses. And it was great in my soap recipe.</li>
            <li> Talk about a natural way to make sure your get your house clean but this is it.  Check out the Green Clean Aromatherapy Kit from Happy Soul or just purchase the individual bottles from Plantlife.  Either way you&#x27;re getting a great deal.  The Plantlife bottles are smaller than The Happy Soul bottles but they&#x27;re both in the dark blue bottles which keeps all essential oils protected from the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own laundry detergent.  I use 3c. Borox, 3c. Arm &amp; Hammer Washing Soda (do not use generic here, it clumps), and then I add 20-25 drops of Eucalyptus and 20-25 drops of Lavender.  The eucalyptus is antiviral and the lavender is antibacterial, as well as smelling good.  I use 1/4c. in each load of laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son no longer wakes up with headaches and I think it was because I was washing his bed sheets in chemical laden laundry detergent and he&#x27;s sensitive to it.  This home-made recipe we all love the smell and actually feel better.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can it hurt to try it a few times and check it out? The laundry detergent cost pennies to make.  The eucalyptus provides antiviral properties and gets rid of dust mites too.  It&#x27;s an amazing essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions of me, contact me through Amazon.  I make all my home cleansers now, check out my listmania list.  Even if you don&#x27;t want to make your own laundry detergent add a few drops of Eucalyptus to every load for its antiviral properties.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Mabis Personal Steam Inhaler Vaporizer ...</li>
            <li> I had all kinds of uses for this but found out right away that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for over 10 years but this summer I had severe sinus swelling and pain. I bought the Eucalyptus oil to put on the pad in my Vicks Steam Inhaler when the Vicks on the pad is used up (after about 3 uses). This idea came from a review at Amazon for the steam inhaler and I am very grateful. I had forgotten the benefits of Eucalyptus oil for colds and sinus headaches. I clicked on the product link and included it in my order. My sinus headaches and facial pain have been greatly reduced by using the oil and the steamer.  [[ASIN:B0000TN7MY Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler]]  Sometimes I just hold the bottle below my nostrils and I inhale deeply when I can&#x27;t use the steam inhaler.</li>
            <li> This really open up your head you breath so much better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is NOT want i wanted.. It reaks of vicks big time. I can not get past that harsh smell to enjoy the eucalyptus scent. Will not be getting any more of this. If ur looking for a vicks vapor rub...this is for you.</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells so good and is just perfect.  I use it with my homemade laundry detergent along with lavendar oil.</li>
            <li> A good quality product</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my steamer and it was very good. The steamer was not good and I returned it.</li>
            <li> i use it in the spa and sower/steam room. I love all of the aroma oils and these are not exeption.</li>
            <li> To small and expensive no recomend this product</li>
            <li> I used this to make my bedroom smell fresh and soothing, put a few drops on a cotton ball and place it above the headboard.  I did the same in my daughter&#x27;s bedroom when she had the colds and she slept better that night.</li>
            <li> I used this to help with a stuffy nose, actually rubbed it on to an old t-shirt I had on and it helped.</li>
            <li> This product helps with sleeping.  would get more when what I have runs out.  Thanks for selling this.  Price was fair.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, there is a reason why they are so cheap. I love the smell, but the quality compared to more expensive brands is drastic, it is like water and the scent doesn&#x27;t last, not therapeutic quality, maybe if you mixed it with water and used it as a room freshener.</li>
            <li> A few drops last for ever and it&#x27;s pretty authentic. I&#x27;ve been making my own room smell freshers with it.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous and I am now just waiting to use it in my hand-held vaporizer when it gets here!</li>
            <li> the delivery was fast, so no problem there. I was going to use it in my steam inhaler, but I found out that it doesn&#x27;t mix with water to good, but when it gets to the bottom I get a bit off it. going to try put some on a paper towel and see if that works too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to use for a number of things and I love the smell but please, keep them with child proof caps.  If a child drinks it, they have less than five minutes to live.  Please, Please, Please be careful with essential oils.</li>
            <li> This helps my allergies a lot plus it  feels  great on my scalp I love it can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Eucalptus Oil and this particular brand is wonderful.  Just a few drops in my bath water and I feel refreshed and relaxed, plus such an enhancement to breathing.</li>
            <li> This oil arrived securely packaged and in a sturdy container, and with a speedy delivery.  At first glance it seems like only a small amount if you&#x27;re new to using essential oils, or at least that was my initial reaction when I started using these.  However that is not the case, this small vial will go a long way.  I typically mix it with extra virgin olive oil, using a 1 tsp of olive oil and 3 drops of the essential oil, the scent that arises from this mixture is a noticeable Eucalyptus scent which is quite pleasant and without being overpowering.  I haven&#x27;t used it as much as some other essential oils I&#x27;ve acquired due to my projects not requiring use of it as much, but the shelf life of these oils is quite long and I have every confidence given their quality that it will remain as useful on the last day of its use as it was on its first.</li>
            <li> nice and strong.  it is what it says.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I ordered it late-night one day with regular shipping, and it arrived three days later -- way faster than I expected!  It smells great, it was sealed, and the seller even included a little brochure about the uses of essential oils with a whole list of recipes on the back! As a beginner to essential oils, I like this a lot and I&#x27;m definitely buying more essential oils from this brand and seller.</li>
            <li> I love eucalyptus oil,but this one smells more like vicks,its nice but not what i expected will have to use it for something else.i would buy from this seller again but probably not this product</li>
            <li> The scent is not as strong as I have experience with other brands, also there is no double safty lid  on top, This is the kind were one has to negotiate 2 levels to open the bottle,that is a saftey precaution to keep the product from evaporating.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I&#x27;ve used it in my vaporizer, on cuts, in a pan of warm water for house fresher, I put a couple of drops in my shampoo it&#x27;s amazing. The smell alone is awsome but when used for head aches and sinus in the humidifier it blows any pill you can take away. I also ordered the orange it smells good to. I haven&#x27;t looked at the website yet that they provided to see all the other uses but will soon. I will order a larger bottle and always have it in hand.</li>
