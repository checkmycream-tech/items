            <li>SM is a great product line and their is a formula for every hair issue.  </li>
            <li>The corresponding conditioner is great too.</li>
            <li>I can however, see how these products might not be too great for someone with thicker.</li>
            <li>Organix is a great brand of product and it has taken over my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell.</li>

            <li>which is a shame because I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>I had to wash, rinse and repeat and got a wonderful lather and squeaky clean hair.</li>

            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great option for a chelating shampoo that cleans well, does not dry out your hair and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>You really need to buy this product and never switch again!!!!!</li>
            <li>this shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing</li>
            <li>This shampoo is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This works amazing</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>It does a nice job and what it purports to do.</li>
            <li>Still loving it.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair SO soft and best of all the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair sleek and smooth, smells great and seems to be doing okay in making my hair stronger.</li>
            <li>Shipping and payment was very easy transaction.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think a shampoo with oil would help with oily hair, but it sure does!I love it, along with the conditioner!</li>
            <li>But with fine hair, weight is a wonderful thing as it really smooths each strand.</li>
            <li>This is pretty great shampoo - but the lack of lather is something that bothers me.</li>
            <li>Very cheap too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells super good, too.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair very smooth without adding too many additional products.</li>
            <li>I switched from OGX to SM shampoos and conditioners about a year ago and the difference is striking.  </li>
            <li>I also love SM masks (</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product to get great results.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product to get great results.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to using this some more.  </li>
            <li>My hair is noticably stronger, more supple, and more shiny.</li>
            <li>This shampoo, in combination with the conditioner, has been wonderful for my bleach blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>It feels more protected, stronger and smoother.</li>
            <li>do I love it???  </li>
            <li>Mostly.</li>
            <li>Ok shampoo.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad that I did.</li>
            <li>If you need a shampoo and want to try it, then sure give it a go, but your expectations probably aren&#x27;t going to be met by the promises on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It seemed my hair broke off more with this product</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li>I had to review it because I just realized how much I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel more like straw and frizzier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve went through both bottles and have notice no improvement in my hair breakage, in fact my hair is breaking off even more now,</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and sometimes they even have buy one get one free!</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>The coconut one is better for my hair.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair and noticed that the hair that combed out, with very, very significant.</li>
            <li>Is a nice product, leaves clean and shine your hair, but if you have a greasy or oily hair this product is not for u.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s a welcome, more mature change.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for treatment in addition to a sulfate free drugstore product, then Shea Moisture is a much better choice.  </li>
            <li>they smell great and leave my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>I love love love the smell, however it isn&#x27;t right for my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells very nice and keeps your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my hair feel clean and still moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have trichotillomania, and my hair is easy to fall out because I pick on it.</li>
            <li>It smells like a strong, floral perfume that your grandmother would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it works just as fine for my hair.</li>
            <li>The combination of products with the conditioner did a tremendous job on my hair!</li>
            <li>Yes, they&#x27;re sulfate free</li>
            <li>SM contains no silicone, paraben or phlalates (sp?) and is cruelty free and does treat dryness, damage and frizz.  </li>
            <li>This product is great to use and the results are seen by the second use.  </li>
            <li>My hair went from being straw to silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to OGX.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to OGX.  </li>
            <li>After trying so many other products this product is the absolute best!!!!!</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a budget friendly sulfate free line, then OGX is your answer.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand of shampoo, I have used several different fusions and I like this one and the coconut one the best.</li>
            <li>but smell like old people to me, and they lather nice and work good and leave my hair soft, but they don&#x27;t work for the intended purpose</li>
            <li>I think it gets my hair clean and preserves my color</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so amazing and does not strip the henna from my hair, but leaves it feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>(Feria T53 Cool Medium Brown)</li>
            <li>But this was a different formula, and I had heard good things about keratin shampoo.</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and reminds me of something (candy maybe?)</li>
            <li>(maybe thinking that the name implied it was a nice natural \\&quot;organic\\&quot; product), so I went ahead and bought it.</li>
            <li>and I need to apply a bit more of it to feel that it really cleaned my hair, so</li>
            <li>I tried it out today (the most humid, dreary, slightly rainy day of the year so far in NYC) and I am pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more: Walgreens and Ulta frequently have buy 1 get 1 free sales on SM, which is when I stock up.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more: Walgreens and Ulta frequently have buy 1 get 1 free sales on SM, which is when I stock up.   </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite shampoo out of all the ones from cheap drug store to hairdresser recommended.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite SM shampoos is the Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying formula that&#x27;s sulfate free and safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite SM shampoos is the Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying formula that&#x27;s sulfate free and safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m finished my hair feels very soft and very clean.</li>
            <li>After blow drying, my hair was silky, stunning, and soft.</li>
            <li>I have recently developed a love for oils for my body and hair and when I saw this</li>
            <li>However, alternating this with another shampoo and conditioner seems to achieve the right balance.  </li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was thicker than I expected, smells wonderful, cleans very well, and does not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a small miracle, and I&#x27;m so happy that I tried it.</li>
            <li>When I use them, It feels like oil in your hair but your hair comes out so soft and brushes so easily.</li>
            <li>(my hair is a mess anyway) but holy beef does it smell good.</li>
            <li>I got worried that it would dry my hair out because when I first shampooed and rinsed, my hair was kind of tangled.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it-</li>
            <li>Before that, my hair was really soft and fine.</li>
            <li>The smell of this shampoo is amaaaaazing and it is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that made me feel like I could skip the conditioner after.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, supple, shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, supple, shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>This one leaves my hair really soft ,smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I thought someone was making a joke, but no, at first smell, it literally does.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely repurchase and will be purchasing the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I guess this shampoo does its job at a not expensive price...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried two of their other shampoos and they clean my hair much better than this keratin one does.  </li>
            <li>Also keratin is just becoming more common among drug store brands so in general I&#x27;d expect more cheaper options.</li>
            <li>I have long full, but fine hair</li>
            <li>Well, my hair never feels really clean after using this, it feels more weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I was already using a good low-sulfate natural hair product, but I was curious about this brand</li>
            <li>amazon reviewer wrote that  it smells like old people and she was ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!</li>
            <li>I may have to get a new bottle faster than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the Manuka Honey formula (available only at Target for some strange reason) and the Tahitian Noni formula.  </li>
            <li>My hair is in great condition and I have absolutely no frizz, even if I let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to finally find a shampoo that won&#x27;t leave my hair super oily yet won&#x27;t pull all the red henna out of my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair dries COMPLETELY straight without using a blow dryer or a straightener.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used OGX shampoos for quite some time but have never noticed much of a difference between the formulas.  </li>
            <li>The OGX formulas I&#x27;ve tried, including this one, haven&#x27;t made much difference in the dryness or frizziness, despite the fact that they contain smoothing oils and silicone.  </li>
            <li>However, the shampoos lather really well and the conditioners really target dryness, damage and frizz.  </li>
            <li>So the bottom line is OGX is a basic sulfate free formula whereas SM is a treatment line.  </li>

            <li>So the bottom line is OGX is a basic sulfate free formula whereas SM is a treatment line.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to moisturize my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner have really helped.</li>
            <li>Well I noticed that my hair was especially soft each time I traveled for work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more $$ on keratin conditioners but OGX is all I need.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair very manageable,</li>
            <li>But much cheaper at walgreens</li>
            <li>Even the next day, my hair still felt as soft and clean as it did fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I normally use only low-sulfate products that are as natural as possible and use a good quality hair mask twice a week.</li>
            <li>I have straight, limp, very fine hair that is very prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>my hair usually naturally dries pretty straight, but with this shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but will continue using it# great lather and terrific smell!</li>
            <li>I switched to this one because I was running low and thought my hair was feeling kind of dry.    </li>
            <li>so if you like fruity or sweet, candy-like smelling hair products, you will think this is gross.  </li>
            <li>I was able to pick up the 19.5 oz bottle at Harmon&#x27;s for less than $5 with my coupons.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian, I normally have soft, fine hair.</li>
            <li>So no, I don&#x27;t think this particular formula fights breakage at all.  </li>
            <li>until now, I&#x27;ve religiously used Pantene, because at least I could get a solid good few hours of nice clean looking hair.</li>
            <li>and this is literally the only product I can find that makes my hair soft, smooth, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i literally havent used a straightener in months because this shampoo keeps my hair straight, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li>It removes all traces of sticky styling product buildup with apple cider vinegar and it makes my hair really shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>It removes all traces of sticky styling product buildup with apple cider vinegar and it makes my hair really shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I only used it twice and figured that it would not be worth my money</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it suggests, and really does improve the overall health of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair clean and you can really feel it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol and other stuff</li>
            <li>but this shampoo does not dry out the ends of my hair and cleans very very well.</li>
            <li>I guess you have to sacrifice some features for the comfort of knowing you&#x27;re using all natural products!</li>
            <li>It has this seriously distinct old floral perfume smell that is unmistakable in reminding you of of like an old lady you might sit next to in church.</li>
            <li>Actually went to the hair stylist today and her first question out of her mouth was... &#x27;</li>
            <li>It makes my fine hair feel soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>and they do seem to get my hair nice and clean, but as for targeting specific hair issues, I think they fail on that score.  </li>
            <li>Well, I will say that with but a drop of this stuff, you get quite the lather, aka, bang for your buck, and my hair did come out nice and clean as one would expect from a shampoo, but as for the long list of promises, I found absolutely no difference from using my other regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>However, if your hair is less than perfect, you can&#x27;t go wrong with SM.  </li>
            <li>However, if your hair is less than perfect, you can&#x27;t go wrong with SM.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave me raving about shine or glow or less tangled, or stronger hair, it was just clean, and I went about my day.</li>
            <li>i spray Keratin Complete by Tresemme onto my ends.</li>

            <li> SM is a great product line and their is a formula for every hair issue.  </li>
            <li> The corresponding conditioner is great too.</li>
            <li> I can however, see how these products might not be too great for someone with thicker.</li>
            <li> Organix is a great brand of product and it has taken over my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell.</li>
            <li> I bought it along with the condiciones and they both work great together.</li>
            <li> my kinky curl hair feels good smells good too :D!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> : I also use the John Freida Color Refreshing Gloss once a week, which is excellent at maintaining color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am loving this shampoo!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and that is important to me.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent</li>
            <li> Not too floral, so it&#x27;s good for men.</li>
            <li> which is a shame because I loved the smell.</li>
            <li> I had to wash, rinse and repeat and got a wonderful lather and squeaky clean hair.</li>
            <li> Its a nice price for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Lol  :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and so does my husband!  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great option for a chelating shampoo that cleans well, does not dry out your hair and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> You really need to buy this product and never switch again!!!!!</li>
            <li> this shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing</li>
            <li> This shampoo is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This works amazing</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> It does a nice job and what it purports to do.</li>
            <li> Still loving it.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair SO soft and best of all the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair sleek and smooth, smells great and seems to be doing okay in making my hair stronger.</li>
            <li> Shipping and payment was very easy transaction.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think a shampoo with oil would help with oily hair, but it sure does!I love it, along with the conditioner!</li>
            <li> But with fine hair, weight is a wonderful thing as it really smooths each strand.</li>
            <li> This is pretty great shampoo - but the lack of lather is something that bothers me.</li>
            <li> Very cheap too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells super good, too.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair very smooth without adding too many additional products.</li>
            <li> I switched from OGX to SM shampoos and conditioners about a year ago and the difference is striking.  </li>
            <li> I also love SM masks (</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much product to get great results.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much product to get great results.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to using this some more.  </li>
            <li> My hair is noticably stronger, more supple, and more shiny.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, in combination with the conditioner, has been wonderful for my bleach blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> It feels more protected, stronger and smoother.</li>
            <li> do I love it???  </li>
            <li> Mostly.</li>
            <li> Ok shampoo.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad that I did.</li>
            <li> If you need a shampoo and want to try it, then sure give it a go, but your expectations probably aren&#x27;t going to be met by the promises on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It seemed my hair broke off more with this product</li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li> I had to review it because I just realized how much I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel more like straw and frizzier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went through both bottles and have notice no improvement in my hair breakage, in fact my hair is breaking off even more now,</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and sometimes they even have buy one get one free!</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> The coconut one is better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and noticed that the hair that combed out, with very, very significant.</li>
            <li> Is a nice product, leaves clean and shine your hair, but if you have a greasy or oily hair this product is not for u.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s a welcome, more mature change.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for treatment in addition to a sulfate free drugstore product, then Shea Moisture is a much better choice.  </li>
            <li> they smell great and leave my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> I love love love the smell, however it isn&#x27;t right for my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice and keeps your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my hair feel clean and still moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have trichotillomania, and my hair is easy to fall out because I pick on it.</li>
            <li> It smells like a strong, floral perfume that your grandmother would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it works just as fine for my hair.</li>
            <li> The combination of products with the conditioner did a tremendous job on my hair!</li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re sulfate free</li>
            <li> SM contains no silicone, paraben or phlalates (sp?) and is cruelty free and does treat dryness, damage and frizz.  </li>
            <li> This product is great to use and the results are seen by the second use.  </li>
            <li> My hair went from being straw to silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to OGX.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to OGX.  </li>
            <li> After trying so many other products this product is the absolute best!!!!!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a budget friendly sulfate free line, then OGX is your answer.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand of shampoo, I have used several different fusions and I like this one and the coconut one the best.</li>
            <li> but smell like old people to me, and they lather nice and work good and leave my hair soft, but they don&#x27;t work for the intended purpose</li>
            <li> I think it gets my hair clean and preserves my color</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so amazing and does not strip the henna from my hair, but leaves it feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> (Feria T53 Cool Medium Brown)</li>
            <li> But this was a different formula, and I had heard good things about keratin shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent is sweet and reminds me of something (candy maybe?)</li>
            <li> (maybe thinking that the name implied it was a nice natural \\&quot;organic\\&quot; product), so I went ahead and bought it.</li>
            <li> and I need to apply a bit more of it to feel that it really cleaned my hair, so</li>
            <li> I tried it out today (the most humid, dreary, slightly rainy day of the year so far in NYC) and I am pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more: Walgreens and Ulta frequently have buy 1 get 1 free sales on SM, which is when I stock up.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more: Walgreens and Ulta frequently have buy 1 get 1 free sales on SM, which is when I stock up.   </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite shampoo out of all the ones from cheap drug store to hairdresser recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite SM shampoos is the Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying formula that&#x27;s sulfate free and safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite SM shampoos is the Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying formula that&#x27;s sulfate free and safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m finished my hair feels very soft and very clean.</li>
            <li> After blow drying, my hair was silky, stunning, and soft.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed a love for oils for my body and hair and when I saw this</li>
            <li> However, alternating this with another shampoo and conditioner seems to achieve the right balance.  </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was thicker than I expected, smells wonderful, cleans very well, and does not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a small miracle, and I&#x27;m so happy that I tried it.</li>
            <li> When I use them, It feels like oil in your hair but your hair comes out so soft and brushes so easily.</li>
            <li> (my hair is a mess anyway) but holy beef does it smell good.</li>
            <li> I got worried that it would dry my hair out because when I first shampooed and rinsed, my hair was kind of tangled.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it-</li>
            <li> Before that, my hair was really soft and fine.</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is amaaaaazing and it is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that made me feel like I could skip the conditioner after.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, supple, shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, supple, shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> This one leaves my hair really soft ,smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I thought someone was making a joke, but no, at first smell, it literally does.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely repurchase and will be purchasing the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I guess this shampoo does its job at a not expensive price...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried two of their other shampoos and they clean my hair much better than this keratin one does.  </li>
            <li> Also keratin is just becoming more common among drug store brands so in general I&#x27;d expect more cheaper options.</li>
            <li> I have long full, but fine hair</li>
            <li> Well, my hair never feels really clean after using this, it feels more weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I was already using a good low-sulfate natural hair product, but I was curious about this brand</li>
            <li> amazon reviewer wrote that  it smells like old people and she was ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!</li>
            <li> I may have to get a new bottle faster than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the Manuka Honey formula (available only at Target for some strange reason) and the Tahitian Noni formula.  </li>
            <li> My hair is in great condition and I have absolutely no frizz, even if I let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to finally find a shampoo that won&#x27;t leave my hair super oily yet won&#x27;t pull all the red henna out of my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair dries COMPLETELY straight without using a blow dryer or a straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used OGX shampoos for quite some time but have never noticed much of a difference between the formulas.  </li>
            <li> The OGX formulas I&#x27;ve tried, including this one, haven&#x27;t made much difference in the dryness or frizziness, despite the fact that they contain smoothing oils and silicone.  </li>
            <li> However, the shampoos lather really well and the conditioners really target dryness, damage and frizz.  </li>
            <li> So the bottom line is OGX is a basic sulfate free formula whereas SM is a treatment line.  </li>

            <li> So the bottom line is OGX is a basic sulfate free formula whereas SM is a treatment line.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to moisturize my hair really well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner have really helped.</li>
            <li> Well I noticed that my hair was especially soft each time I traveled for work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent more $$ on keratin conditioners but OGX is all I need.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair very manageable,</li>
            <li> But much cheaper at walgreens</li>
            <li> Even the next day, my hair still felt as soft and clean as it did fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I normally use only low-sulfate products that are as natural as possible and use a good quality hair mask twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have straight, limp, very fine hair that is very prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> my hair usually naturally dries pretty straight, but with this shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but will continue using it# great lather and terrific smell!</li>
            <li> I switched to this one because I was running low and thought my hair was feeling kind of dry.    </li>
            <li> so if you like fruity or sweet, candy-like smelling hair products, you will think this is gross.  </li>
            <li> I was able to pick up the 19.5 oz bottle at Harmon&#x27;s for less than $5 with my coupons.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian, I normally have soft, fine hair.</li>
            <li> So no, I don&#x27;t think this particular formula fights breakage at all.  </li>
            <li> until now, I&#x27;ve religiously used Pantene, because at least I could get a solid good few hours of nice clean looking hair.</li>
            <li> and this is literally the only product I can find that makes my hair soft, smooth, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i literally havent used a straightener in months because this shampoo keeps my hair straight, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li> It removes all traces of sticky styling product buildup with apple cider vinegar and it makes my hair really shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> It removes all traces of sticky styling product buildup with apple cider vinegar and it makes my hair really shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I only used it twice and figured that it would not be worth my money</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it suggests, and really does improve the overall health of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair clean and you can really feel it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol and other stuff</li>
            <li> but this shampoo does not dry out the ends of my hair and cleans very very well.</li>
            <li> I guess you have to sacrifice some features for the comfort of knowing you&#x27;re using all natural products!</li>
            <li> It has this seriously distinct old floral perfume smell that is unmistakable in reminding you of of like an old lady you might sit next to in church.</li>
            <li> Actually went to the hair stylist today and her first question out of her mouth was... &#x27;</li>
            <li> It makes my fine hair feel soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> and they do seem to get my hair nice and clean, but as for targeting specific hair issues, I think they fail on that score.  </li>
            <li> Well, I will say that with but a drop of this stuff, you get quite the lather, aka, bang for your buck, and my hair did come out nice and clean as one would expect from a shampoo, but as for the long list of promises, I found absolutely no difference from using my other regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> However, if your hair is less than perfect, you can&#x27;t go wrong with SM.  </li>
            <li> However, if your hair is less than perfect, you can&#x27;t go wrong with SM.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave me raving about shine or glow or less tangled, or stronger hair, it was just clean, and I went about my day.</li>
            <li> i spray Keratin Complete by Tresemme onto my ends.</li>

            <li> But then, after I worked the conditioner in and rinsed, I had no trouble combing through.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.carry it) but is a little more pricey that typical drugstore finds.  </li>
            <li> I recommend OGX only if your hair is normal and there is no need for treatment ingredients.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and spent hundreds of dollars to find a shampoo for my very oily hair!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick, wavy hair and this stuff has truly tamed it.</li>
            <li> I have fine but thick hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditoner makes my hair silly soft and very easy to work with.</li>

            <li> I didnt see any real difference from when I wash with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to have oily roots/scalp and drier ends (as my hair is very long and the ends are old)</li>
            <li> wow, stick straight with none of the usual frizzies or puffiness, even in this weather.  </li>
            <li> Very concentrated so you use less.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse, non-treated/colored, Asian hair that has been shedding quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> Just about the funniest review I ever read about this product previous to buying it was that it smelled like an old woman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-late 20&#x27;s, fine, long hair that has been noticibely thinning (to me at least) and BREAKING  for the past year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I guess from brushing and straightening) and now it&#x27;s not nearly the problem (ahem, or distracting) as it was.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium textured, dry, wavy, color treated and prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> If I just let my hair air dry rather than using a frizz</li>
            <li> I would find a thousand results on what to do for dry hair, but never oily hair.</li>
            <li> roots are greasy with dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> dry ends.    </li>

            <li> and it is oily at roots but dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up buying them at Target but couldn&#x27;t leave reviews on their site for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> After that, my hair was getting very dry, course, and tangled.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to anyone who needs a little extra and moisture to their hair~!!</li>
            <li> every other day and air dry.  </li>
            <li> My scalp never felt clean and I was considering cutting off my very long curly hair.</li>
            <li> and ive only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This among the other OGX products have saved me from losing all my hair due to dry conditions I moved too.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But I was looking for something else to supplement my other shampoo for my desired hair growth, and I came across this product in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottles look small but  last long&lt;</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, but still had the little hairs at my roots</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick and frizzy hair and was told by my hair stylist that I need to switch to a sulfate and sodium chloride-free shampoo to use in between salon visits and found these at my local Target.</li>
            <li> It has seemed to help cut down on breakage.</li>

            <li> The smell of this shampoo is amaaaaazing and it is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that made me feel like I could skip the conditioner after.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is amazing. my hair usually naturally dries pretty straight, but with this shampoo &amp; conditioner my hair dries COMPLETELY straight without using a blow dryer or a straightener. i literally havent used a straightener in months because this shampoo keeps my hair straight, silky, and soft. i match this shampoo with the keratin oil conditioner and also when im done washing my hair i spray Keratin Complete by Tresemme onto my ends. it does wonders! LOVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used OGX shampoos for quite some time but have never noticed much of a difference between the formulas.  Yes, they&#x27;re sulfate free and they do seem to get my hair nice and clean, but as for targeting specific hair issues, I think they fail on that score.  My hair is medium textured, dry, wavy, color treated and prone to frizz.  The OGX formulas I&#x27;ve tried, including this one, haven&#x27;t made much difference in the dryness or frizziness, despite the fact that they contain smoothing oils and silicone.  If I just let my hair air dry rather than using a frizz fighting primer and styling product, my hair would be one big poufball.  So no, I don&#x27;t think this particular formula fights breakage at all.  I think it gets my hair clean and preserves my color but that&#x27;s about it.  There is no &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; factor in this shampoo line.  Their treatment products are silicone heavy, which doesn&#x27;t treat dryness or damage because the oils and other hydrating ingredients (if there are in fact hydrating ingredients...I am doubtful) do not penetrate the hair shaft because it&#x27;s coated with silicone.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a budget friendly sulfate free line, then OGX is your answer.  If you&#x27;re looking for treatment in addition to a sulfate free drugstore product, then Shea Moisture is a much better choice.  SM contains no silicone, paraben or phlalates (sp?) and is cruelty free and does treat dryness, damage and frizz.  I switched from OGX to SM shampoos and conditioners about a year ago and the difference is striking.  My hair is in great condition and I have absolutely no frizz, even if I let my hair air dry.  I love the Manuka Honey formula (available only at Target for some strange reason) and the Tahitian Noni formula.  I also love SM masks (Manuka Honey and the 10 in 1 Renewal formulas are great) which I use about once a week with a heat cap for 45 minutes or so.  My hair has never looked better.  SM is still a drugstore product (Walgreens, CVS, Ulta, Target and Sally&#x27;s carry it) but is a little more pricey that typical drugstore finds.  However, the shampoos lather really well and the conditioners really target dryness, damage and frizz.  It doesn&#x27;t take much product to get great results.  One of my favorite SM shampoos is the Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying formula that&#x27;s sulfate free and safe for color treated hair.  It removes all traces of sticky styling product buildup with apple cider vinegar and it makes my hair really shiny and soft.  It also smells wonderful.  SM is a great product line and their is a formula for every hair issue.  It leaves my hair soft, supple, shiny and frizz free.  It&#x27;s far superior to OGX.  What&#x27;s more: Walgreens and Ulta frequently have buy 1 get 1 free sales on SM, which is when I stock up.  My hubby uses the Hibiscus formula for his coarse, curly hair and he loves it as much as I do.  So the bottom line is OGX is a basic sulfate free formula whereas SM is a treatment line.  I recommend OGX only if your hair is normal and there is no need for treatment ingredients.  However, if your hair is less than perfect, you can&#x27;t go wrong with SM.  I highly recommend it.carry it) but is a little more pricey that typical drugstore finds.  However, the shampoos lather really well and the conditioners really target dryness, damage and frizz.

            <li> I bought this because I have very hard water and it contains Tetrasodium EDTA, which is a chelating agent and dissolves the minerals in my hard water. Before using this shampoo I could not work up a lather with any shampoo, my hair was weighed down with minerals and was flat and dull. My scalp never felt clean and I was considering cutting off my very long curly hair. After I used this shampoo one time I loved my hair again! I had to wash, rinse and repeat and got a wonderful lather and squeaky clean hair. This stuff smells amazing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was thicker than I expected, smells wonderful, cleans very well, and does not dry my hair out. I have a tendency to have oily roots/scalp and drier ends (as my hair is very long and the ends are old) but this shampoo does not dry out the ends of my hair and cleans very very well. I use it every day, and I use the OGX Keratin Oil Conditioner too and a detangler spray after I towel-dry. I color my hair about once every 6 weeks using drug-store hair color (Feria T53 Cool Medium Brown) and this shampoo did not fade my hair color at all. FYI regarding the hair color: I also use the John Freida Color Refreshing Gloss once a week, which is excellent at maintaining color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great option for a chelating shampoo that cleans well, does not dry out your hair and smells wonderful. The corresponding conditioner is great too. And the price cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! I was loosing hair and started using this shampoo about a year ago. It stopped falling out. Whether coincidence or the shampoo I&#x27;m not sure, but will continue using it# great lather and terrific smell!</li>
            <li> Love this! Keeps my hair very smooth without adding too many additional products. It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon- I bought it in a store, just to be clear.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from very oily hair, and as a result I have to wash my hair every day, only to have oil buildup again after only a few hours. It&#x27;s absolutely gross and I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about it for years. I was embarrassed and afraid that people would think that I was unclean or never showered. I&#x27;ve scoured the internet for solutions, finding very few people with my problem. I would find a thousand results on what to do for dry hair, but never oily hair. I tried everything I could thin of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until now, I&#x27;ve religiously used Pantene, because at least I could get a solid good few hours of nice clean looking hair. But I was looking for something else to supplement my other shampoo for my desired hair growth, and I came across this product in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I was torn- I had tried this brand before, when it was newer, and it made my hair worse than any other product I&#x27;d ever tried. But this was a different formula, and I had heard good things about keratin shampoo. So, I dropped 6 dollars and bought it. In my head, I wondered how it could make any sense to put a shampoo on my head that even had &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in the name, when oil was my biggest problem. When you&#x27;re as desperate as me though, you&#x27;re willing to try anything and just hold out hope that maybe something- anything will answer your prayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo did that for me. After using it just once I immediately noticed a difference. After blow drying, my hair was silky, stunning, and soft. But the test wasn&#x27;t over. I went about my day, just waiting for the oil to strike, and it didn&#x27;t. Even the next day, my hair still felt as soft and clean as it did fresh out of the shower. This shampoo is a small miracle, and I&#x27;m so happy that I tried it.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of shampoo, I have used several different fusions and I like this one and the coconut one the best. they smell great and leave my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> This among the other OGX products have saved me from losing all my hair due to dry conditions I moved too.  This product is great to use and the results are seen by the second use.  In combination with the conditioners and oil repair, it will repair&lt;br /&gt;your hair almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived on time and works above the rating stars.</li>
            <li> I will be using Keratin products from this point on...my kinky curl hair feels good smells good too :D! nice</li>
            <li> This is a very good shampoo. It makes my fine hair feel soft and silky without weighing it down. I like it. It does a nice job and what it purports to do. What is there to complain about?</li>
            <li> It has seemed to help cut down on breakage.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice and keeps your hair soft. I use both the shampoo and conditioner. However, I jisy started using it so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll have any other benefits yet.</li>
            <li> Is a nice product, leaves clean and shine your hair, but if you have a greasy or oily hair this product is not for u.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-late 20&#x27;s, fine, long hair that has been noticibely thinning (to me at least) and BREAKING  for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;My roots are greasy with dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;I apply heat to my hair about 4 days out of the week (curling and straightening). My hair deals with a lot of wear and tear. So I was looking for a product that would restore some moisture to my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try this because it cost less than $6 at walmart..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft and managable&lt;br /&gt;Bottles look small but  last long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-Honestly I didnt see any real difference from when I wash with other shampoos. It cleaned my hair and that was about it..&lt;br /&gt;- My hair is still breaking a lot when I comb it&lt;br /&gt;-An amazon reviewer wrote that  it smells like old people and she was ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! It smells like a strong, floral perfume that your grandmother would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I should mention, I bought the biotin and collagen (purple bottle) shampoo and conditioner as well because I noticed my hair was thinning and it worked great! It made my hair APPEAR fuller/thicker .. but a little frizzy :(</li>
            <li> *UPDATE*  One of the reviews mentioned a waxy build-up.  I have to agree that using this shampoo and conditioner every wash will cause that.  However, alternating this with another shampoo and conditioner seems to achieve the right balance.  Still loving it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I&#x27;ve been using the Shiseido Tsubaki shampoo and conditioner in the red bottle for quite a while.  I switched to this one because I was running low and thought my hair was feeling kind of dry.    My Hair:  I have long, coarse, non-treated/colored, Asian hair that has been shedding quite a bit.  I wash my hair every other day and air dry.  Greasy roots, dry ends.    The Smell:  A lot of reviewers here are complaining about the smell, which isn&#x27;t bad to me.  Yes, it&#x27;s floral so if you like fruity or sweet, candy-like smelling hair products, you will think this is gross.  For me, it&#x27;s a welcome, more mature change.    I was able to pick up the 19.5 oz bottle at Harmon&#x27;s for less than $5 with my coupons.  I tried it out today (the most humid, dreary, slightly rainy day of the year so far in NYC) and I am pretty impressed.  I got worried that it would dry my hair out because when I first shampooed and rinsed, my hair was kind of tangled.  But then, after I worked the conditioner in and rinsed, I had no trouble combing through.  I let my hair air dry as usual and wow, stick straight with none of the usual frizzies or puffiness, even in this weather.  I am impressed.  I did notice a slight tingling sensation on my scalp, not sure what that is about.  Looking forward to using this some more.  Will update if anything goes wrong.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but I was extremely wrong. This dried out my hair so much and made it fall out. I will never use this again. Save your money and try a different brand.</li>
            <li> My hair went from being straw to silky smooth. The texture of my hair has improved drastically, and there isn&#x27;t a build up either. Of course I use this with the matching keratin oil conditioner. Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I have not met an OGX shampoo or conditioner I didn&#x27;t like. Very concentrated so you use less. It lathers well and rinses well.This one leaves my hair really soft ,smooth and shiny. It smells wonderful and that is important to me. This brand is a winner!!</li>
            <li> Perfect. I started using the entire product line of the OGX Keratin Oil about 8 months ago to fix my breaking, falling out, damaged hair. It has worked miracles. My hair is noticably stronger, more supple, and more shiny. And it is no longer falling out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, in combination with the conditioner, has been wonderful for my bleach blonde highlights. I have fine, thick, wavy hair and this stuff has truly tamed it. I had a bad experience with some shearing scissors that made my hair look like it had been fried at the ends. This shampoo/conditoner makes my hair silly soft and very easy to work with. I also have psoriasis of the scalp and this does not aggravate it (yet). Some people complain about the &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; these products leave behind. But with fine hair, weight is a wonderful thing as it really smooths each strand. I can however, see how these products might not be too great for someone with thicker. The scent is sweet and reminds me of something (candy maybe?) but doesn&#x27;t linger after my hair has dried. Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to moisturize my hair really well.  I love the smell and so does my husband!  He&#x27;s actually commented on it at least 2 or 3 times!</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with my hair thinning and breaking during the past year.  I starting using this product along with the conditioner and I could feel an immediate difference in my hair.  It feels more protected, stronger and smoother.</li>
            <li> do I love it???  no, but I do like it for the price.  might as well try it for 6 bucks</li>
            <li> There are not enough stars for this product. I have dry hair and this is literally the only product I can find that makes my hair soft, smooth, shiny, and manageable. Mostly. Smells great and works great! I love this shampoo! Organix is a great brand of product and it has taken over my bathroom. I highly recommend this shampoo! Its a nice price for an amazing product! This is by far my favorite shampoo out of all the ones from cheap drug store to hairdresser recommended. A must have for dry, unmanageable hair. I can see the difference and ive only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Everyone in the household likes this conditioner! With that being said, now I have to hide it!  Lol  :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Ok shampoo. Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Shipping and payment was very easy transaction. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo as I don&#x27;t think it worked for me</li>
            <li> WORK GREAT AND AWESOME PRICE</li>
            <li> I was already using a good low-sulfate natural hair product, but I was curious about this brand (maybe thinking that the name implied it was a nice natural \\&quot;organic\\&quot; product), so I went ahead and bought it. I only used it twice and figured that it would not be worth my money and I will avoid any product from this brand from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I only used it twice. After that, my hair was getting very dry, course, and tangled. Before that, my hair was really soft and fine. I could always run my hands through my hair and never snag on any tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian, I normally have soft, fine hair. I normally use only low-sulfate products that are as natural as possible and use a good quality hair mask twice a week. My hair stylist trims my hair regularly and takes care of me very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this product wrecked my hair in just two days was shocking. Never again!</li>
            <li> I am loving this shampoo! I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it- a little goes a long way. It has a great smell. I use it with the matching conditioner. When I&#x27;m finished my hair feels very soft and very clean. I bought this because my husband and I moved recently and we now use well water. Our hard water was leaving my hair so dry and it looked awful. This shampoo and conditioner have really helped.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is AMAZING. I have recently developed a love for oils for my body and hair and when I saw this I thought why not give it a try. Boy am I glad that I did. This makes my hair SO soft and best of all the smell is amazing. I am SO happy with this and def will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> After trying so many other products this product is the absolute best!!!!! This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so soft and it is all I use. You really need to buy this product and never switch again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my hair feel clean and still moisturized. After using the conditioner my hair is so soft. This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is pretty great shampoo - but the lack of lather is something that bothers me. I guess you have to sacrifice some features for the comfort of knowing you&#x27;re using all natural products!</li>
            <li> Just about the funniest review I ever read about this product previous to buying it was that it smelled like an old woman. I thought someone was making a joke, but no, at first smell, it literally does. It has this seriously distinct old floral perfume smell that is unmistakable in reminding you of of like an old lady you might sit next to in church. Anyway, this shampoo promises that it will basically do a lot for your hair...strengthen it, prevent breakage, protect your delicate strands...this long list on the very front of the bottle definitely designed to lure you in. I mean, I bought it, so there you go. Well, I will say that with but a drop of this stuff, you get quite the lather, aka, bang for your buck, and my hair did come out nice and clean as one would expect from a shampoo, but as for the long list of promises, I found absolutely no difference from using my other regular shampoos. It didn&#x27;t leave me raving about shine or glow or less tangled, or stronger hair, it was just clean, and I went about my day. If you need a shampoo and want to try it, then sure give it a go, but your expectations probably aren&#x27;t going to be met by the promises on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It seemed my hair broke off more with this product</li>
            <li> I only use this shampoo when traveling for work because I just kept it packed in my suitcase always. Well I noticed that my hair was especially soft each time I traveled for work. It has to be the conditioner. I love it and can&#x27;t stop touching my hair. I had to review it because I just realized how much I love it. I&#x27;ve spent more $$ on keratin conditioners but OGX is all I need. Also keratin is just becoming more common among drug store brands so in general I&#x27;d expect more cheaper options. This one works though and I love it so I&#x27;ll keep at it. I have fine but thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> makes hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> i love this product very much ill used every 2 days or maybe every two weeks its keeps my har shiny &amp; beatifull</li>
            <li> This works amazing and I would recommend to anyone who needs a little extra and moisture to their hair~!! I will order again and again~!!</li>
            <li> I switched to this shampoo from Pantene Pro V hoping it would make my hair softer and help with damage. In actually did the opposite. This product made my hair feel more like straw and frizzier. The day I switched back to Pantene Pro V my hair was immediately softer and smoother again.</li>
            <li> My hair was so greasy. It felt disgusting, but that was the worst part. Im not sure if this has happened to anyone, but my scalp got a few blisters from it. I immediately stopped using it. I may have been allergic to it. Not sure. I loved the scent but My scalp was in pain.</li>
            <li> I have straight, limp, very fine hair that is very prone to breakage. I never use heat on it besides maybe straightening it once a week, never put my hair up in ponytails, ect..... No idea what is causing the breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told to try a keratin shampoo &amp; conditioner so I bought this and the conditioner that goes with it. I&#x27;ve went through both bottles and have notice no improvement in my hair breakage, in fact my hair is breaking off even more now, UGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner smell okay but smell like old people to me, and they lather nice and work good and leave my hair soft, but they don&#x27;t work for the intended purpose so I&#x27;m not going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am post-relaxer and stretching my relaxer. I washed my hair and noticed that the hair that combed out, with very, very significant. I would most definitely repurchase and will be purchasing the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and spent hundreds of dollars to find a shampoo for my very oily hair! Search no more! This product makes my hair very manageable, no more knots, less breakage and less oil when I wake in the morning!! You wouldn&#x27;t think a shampoo with oil would help with oily hair, but it sure does!I love it, along with the conditioner!</li>
            <li> If you are lucky enough to stumble across this shampoo, you have found the holy grail of hair products. Congratulations. Made my hair movie-star quality.</li>
            <li> At least, it didn&#x27;t make hair dry. I guess this shampoo does its job at a not expensive price...&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair sleek and smooth, smells great and seems to be doing okay in making my hair stronger. It contains no sulfates, so I can use it after keratin treatment. It&#x27;s quite thick though and I need to apply a bit more of it to feel that it really cleaned my hair, so I may have to get a new bottle faster than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! But much cheaper at walgreens so check it out there (: it&#x27;s only 8 dollars there and sometimes they even have buy one get one free!</li>
            <li> The combination of products with the conditioner did a tremendous job on my hair! Definitely reduced the shedding. I have trichotillomania, and my hair is easy to fall out because I pick on it. This definitely helped me prevent some bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells super good, too. Not too floral, so it&#x27;s good for men. My bf uses this as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this and the conditioner on Amazon. I actually ended up buying them at Target but couldn&#x27;t leave reviews on their site for some odd reason. I like the smell of this shampoo (and conditioner) and the fact that it is sulfate and sodium chloride-free. I have curly, thick and frizzy hair and was told by my hair stylist that I need to switch to a sulfate and sodium chloride-free shampoo to use in between salon visits and found these at my local Target. The conditioner works just as well too but it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize all that well as I want but it works just as fine for my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! I bought it along with the condiciones and they both work great together. It leaves your hair clean and you can really feel it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol and other stuff other products usually have. I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is the best I ever used no itching</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so amazing and does not strip the henna from my hair, but leaves it feeling soft and shiny. I do not know how well it helps with breakage (my hair is a mess anyway) but holy beef does it smell good. I&#x27;m glad to finally find a shampoo that won&#x27;t leave my hair super oily yet won&#x27;t pull all the red henna out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it suggests, and really does improve the overall health of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, but still had the little hairs at my roots (I guess from brushing and straightening) and now it&#x27;s not nearly the problem (ahem, or distracting) as it was. Try this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Smells like coconut...love it</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of months ago after my hair was damaged at the salon. I am using both the shampoo and conditioner, after using Pantene for years! I will never go back!! When I use them, It feels like oil in your hair but your hair comes out so soft and brushes so easily. Very cheap too. Walmart has it for $5.86</li>
            <li> Well, my hair never feels really clean after using this, it feels more weighed down.  I only use sulfate free ever, and I wash my hair every other day. I have long full, but fine hair and it is oily at roots but dry on the ends.  After this my ends are no softer.  Not impressed with this one.  My hair feels  weighted down when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried two of their other shampoos and they clean my hair much better than this keratin one does.  The coconut one is better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it would help my dry-wavy hair. I love love love the smell, however it isn&#x27;t right for my hair. It left it waxy and with that..just heavy and I couldn&#x27;t style it. Actually went to the hair stylist today and her first question out of her mouth was... &#x27;what shampoo are you using?&#x27; and then proceeded to get rid of the waxy build up. Maybe this shampoo works for others, however it didn&#x27;t work for me...which is a shame because I loved the smell.</li>
