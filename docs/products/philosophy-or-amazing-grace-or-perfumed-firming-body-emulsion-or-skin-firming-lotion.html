            <li>My children were hugging me saying how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>and I just put this lotion on my arms before going to work and everyone tells me I smell so good.</li>

            <li>Its creamy and smells so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the type of lotion that smells good on your skin, not by itself.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because many reviews mentioned the beautiful.</li>
            <li>While it does have a moderately pleasant fragrance, it is not anything like the fragrance of Amazing Grace cologne.  </li>
            <li>My very favorite scent and delivered on time..</li>
            <li>I received the product and was very pleased, I plan on reordering.</li>

            <li>Amazing Grace is feminine and delicate.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Philosophy Amazing Grace Firming Body Emulsion, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>But soon, the Amazing Grace scent works its way out.  </li>
            <li>Scent is amazing ..</li>
            <li>Does not smell like amazing grace.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who loves Amazing Grace.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the Amazing Grace perfume spray.</li>
            <li>This does not smell like the Amazing Grace parfum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had nice comments on the fragrant.</li>
            <li>honestly, the Firming Body Emulsion part of it does not work.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy feeling, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I started using philosophy products before they became so popular.</li>
            <li>Nicely moisturizing (will use it all over immediately before bedtime so no greasy residue to leave on sheets)</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice lotion to wear when doing errands</li>
            <li>Was very Satisfied with the product and the Cost would use Amazon more often</li>
            <li>Love this product, so glad I can get a good price and have delivered.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li>Have used amazing grace for many years.  </li>
            <li>What an amazing and refreshing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love amazing Grace.</li>
            <li>I have never used a product where I&#x27;ve gotten as many compliments as I do with Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li>Love the Amazing Grave</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of Amazing Grace..</li>

            <li>I have been using it for more years</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Not so sure about the firming part.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s slightly more firming compared to drug store firming lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to keep buying it.</li>
            <li>You go to bed with this on and your sheets will smell lovely too.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I just love this lotion.  </li>

            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>just lovely &amp; not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>She had seen this product many places, but hadn&#x27;t seen it in this size.  </li>
            <li>but this might be the next best thing.</li>

            <li>My all-time favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products.  </li>
            <li>Of course, like everyone I&#x27;d love a miracle</li>
            <li>I think using a well known company may be more reliable.</li>
            <li>; how many did they review all on one day, etc.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Based on the overwhelming amount of reviews that it smells like heaven, I think it may just be me :)</li>
            <li>I love this item...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and she said it smelled better after you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it softens skin without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Receive many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I went out and purchased the Perfume to layer it for a all day affect :)</li>
            <li>It smelled more like a sunscreen to me.  </li>
            <li>However, It&#x27;s main purpose for firming and that works great.</li>
            <li>It is floral and very clean and non intrusive smelling.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, this lotion is a very clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfume, much prefer this clean, beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the buy!!</li>
            <li>I am so excited!.</li>
            <li>I would only gift her the best on the special occasion of her</li>
            <li>The scent when I first apply the lotion is not the famous Amazing Grace scent, but a lotion-y almost sun-screen-y sent.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and keeps my arms and legs hydrated most of the day without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent this leaves and the softness of my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>this product smells amazing and does absorb right away</li>
            <li>Lovely, rich lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this before at a local store and loved the smell, but this one seems to have none!</li>
            <li>For the hype and price I expected a nice scent and great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I received my order very quickly and would recommend this site to anyone.</li>
            <li>Ok so I read the reviews for this and this product does not smell good like some people say, yes it did make my skin soft</li>
            <li>Its fragrance was so strong</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know this one is so strong to me.</li>
            <li>I choose the lotions because I don&#x27;t find them as strong as the perfumes - that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
            <li>I did notice the scent wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as the stores version.</li>
            <li>grace is a major fashion brand lotion and will make anyone happy who gets it......impressed</li>
            <li>lotion is one of their best, especially when layering as it seems to last longer without that cloying, too sweet scent that some women&#x27;s bath products have, besides that it is a great moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel so pretty when I am wearing my Amazing Grace products.</li>
            <li>Amazing Grace Firming Body Emulsion is the real deal!</li>
            <li>It came quickly!</li>
            <li>This is really too large a bottle but great lotion</li>
            <li>My order was cancelled after placed and confirmed.</li>
            <li>Just a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this fragrance very much - it&#x27;s light and fresh without being too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and leaves your skin extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li>Light moisture with a light scent</li>
            <li>while I love the smell of amazing grace - this didnt seem to be the same - and it was just overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I am overall happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great product use daily.</li>
            <li>Worth the pricey tag!</li>
            <li>Ladies, DEFINITELY worth a try!</li>
            <li>After that, I went to the mall to smell the original product at the store.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect daily lotion that keeps me soft without making me greasy.  </li>
            <li>The lotion spreads easily and is absorbed really quickly leaving a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It smells so clean with just a hint of perfume.  </li>
            <li>People ask what I am wearing and that it smells so clean.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use more than one product, I just use this as my general body lotion each morning when I get out of the shower and then get dressed.</li>
            <li>Makes skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but overall it is good.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and looks smooth, not oily.</li>
            <li>It is fresh and fragrant and leaves a smooth feeling to my skin.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope I love it as much.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product, it is very moisturizing, not sticky at all, absorbs quick and the fragrance is VERY PLEASING :)  </li>
            <li>But for nice soft skin that smells clean and fresh, this is the one.  </li>
            <li>most pleasant to use,not greasy and left me feeling clean after applying after a shower, not heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li>This lotion firms my skin without leaving it sticky, which I&#x27;ve experienced with other firming lotions.  </li>
            <li>A really clean and fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>So clean and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>I love amazing grace and expected it to smell like it.</li>
            <li>Mild but yet gets attention.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product, soft smells amazing not heavy</li>
            <li>Love , love , love the scent and this is the only lotion that will keep my knobby elbows soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite new scent.</li>
            <li>but as soon as I took off the jeans (MANY hours later) the fragrance was still there and still strong.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love the soft feminine scent along with the thickness/coverage of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>worth it.....</li>
            <li>Did not smell as fresh as one I brought from JC Penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v read a lot of very positive reviews about Philosophy products</li>
            <li>I love this product, especially the fresh clean scent it has.</li>
            <li>As many people have said already, I haven&#x27;t noticed any serious &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;, but the scent is so good.  </li>
            <li>Something isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for the past 3 years &amp; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I have used this Philosophy Amazing Grace lotion for a long time.</li>
            <li>However after using the amazing grace firming body emulsion, I am now addicted to amazing grace.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, I pay more for this product than I do for similar items, but it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I like them because they smell so soft and clean,not strong like some others on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I admit that when I first put it on, I was worried it would have too much smell, but it dissipated quickly and left the most glorious scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is drastically different from Amazing Grace and not subtle at all.  </li>
            <li>Clean and light fragrance last all day.</li>
            <li>so I decided to invest in a higher end body lotion.</li>
            <li>I got this bottle and used it for the first night.</li>
            <li>I may use it in the day, definitely not in the night any more.</li>
            <li>and now I am hooked on it and see why it&#x27;s worth this much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had multiple people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing because they love the smell.</li>
            <li>but i asked around and everyone said that it smelled funny</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order this product again!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a 1-month trial for this - results were visible within 3-4 days; my initial purchase was on June and have since purchased 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li>I notice a visible difference in my skin tone with first day use but greater improvement with continued use (probably max improvement at 4 days of continued, nighttime only use).</li>
            <li>;-)].</li>
            <li>and I did associate the smell with sun screan at first.  </li>
            <li>Amazing Grace is such a soft scent.  </li>
            <li>[yes, I&#x27;m talking about arms and legs here; I don&#x27;t use this on my face (and frankly, started using this on my bust area recently since it was doing such a good job elsewhere, then maybe….?</li>
            <li>I have only had it a few days, but so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or caused any issues which is great!</li>
            <li>Has a clean fresh smell that does last all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant to replace toning by exercise, but it certainly does help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve certainly noticed the moisturizing aspects.</li>
            <li>I really wanted Pure Grace.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Amazing Grace for quite a few years.</li>
            <li>I really do like it though.</li>
            <li>inclined to think this is not really Philosophy&#x27;s award winning lotion but a scam.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have much smell  </li>
            <li>so i havent really used much of it since i got it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very healing.</li>
            <li>Lotion is very light...not a restoring or healing lotion.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>; however, where I see the real evidence is that this really is a firming lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall, however, I think this is a fantastic product</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel the price is too much for that reason.  </li>
            <li>Make me feel fresh and alive.</li>
            <li>It does not firm (I doubt any lotion can do that, having firm skin is a matter of avoiding sun and maintaining good muscle tone).  </li>
            <li>And since I cannot return the product without its original packaging, I will use this lotion until it&#x27;s gone, and in the future will buy it from the department stores.</li>
            <li>I have had more compliments from the scent of this product than almost any other perfumed lotion I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She was thrilled and it will last her a long time.</li>
            <li>I will use this product as long as it remains available-</li>
            <li>A little on the pricey side but smells nice and makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thick lotion that lasts all day, so I&#x27;m pleased, I just expected a little more from the scent.</li>
            <li>My hands are no longer dry and my skin is silky smooth and not rough.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t rely on the reviews as much as previously and have to check how many products has this person reviewed</li>
            <li>I have used countless other products on the market, which were more expensive; but, so far, I have had the best results with Philosophy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is part of a retirement present I am giving a very special friend who I have had the privilege of working with the last 22 years.  </li>
            <li>The price is a bit much but when you only need to use a very little bit for a great feel and coverage, the lotion will last a loooonnnnnnggggg time</li>
            <li>The scent is very fresh and clean and very very lightly floral combined with white tea and aloe scent (not sure if that description helps form a mental picture!).</li>
            <li>I use it every day and have gotten several compliments on my fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Ok... so it doesn&#x27;t really firm any...</li>
            <li>After trying it a few times, I like the smell much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thick lotion too, but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Live and learn...</li>
            <li>Further, it is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells and found this one does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I made a big gamble on this lotion - buying it without smelling it on first.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the same as the product from the store.</li>
            <li>I put a little on my finger tips and couldn&#x27;t believe how strong it was.</li>
            <li>But the bigger bottle is definitely a smart buy if you associate with this scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a heavy lotion.  </li>
            <li>But this product makes them soft in a way that doesn&#x27;t make a pen slide out of my grip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft smell and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>My skin is getting that old lady crepey look</li>
            <li>Or it&#x27;s the real thing that has been diluted with a basic lotion.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes very well, a definite plus for me.  </li>
            <li>Has a soft scent and lotion goes on well and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I believe it is a firming lotion, but I use it because it works on my sensitive skin and as mentioned like the scent.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I must have accidentally ordered the wrong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I also love how thick and CREAMY it is.  </li>
            <li>Tend to scour blogs (and Amazon) for highly rated products to try and then will add one at a time for as unbiased evaluation as possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the firming, but it is a very fresh smell when applied that also lasts.</li>
            <li>Sadly, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as it used to when I had a bottle from a few years ago, but it still smells lovely and does a nice job moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li>Smells like the real thing when initially applying but after a short time there is no scent of anything..</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my skin really soft!  </li>
            <li>The product has an extremely faint fragrance that is not what it&#x27;s supposed to be (Amazing Grace)!&lt;br</li>
            <li>was obviously old as some of the words were totally smudged off the bottle.</li>
            <li>Said it makes her skin extra soft.</li>
            <li>If I stop using for awhile, I am always surprised at what a difference it makes in my overall skin tone - skin seems tighter with a poreless sort of airbrushed appearance</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve lost weight, my skin seems to have maintained its elasticity, though I can&#x27;t say for certain whether it&#x27;s due to this product or others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given up wearing actual perfumes and now wear perfumed body creams which are more subtle, longer lasting, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>(read: something I only need to apply once a week--this isn&#x27;t going to happen in the near future</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an alternative to the perfume when I ran out, because I generally think that lotions last longer than perfume.  </li>
            <li>[What follows next is a mini rant about purchasing through Amazon - generally product review ends here.]</li>
            <li>I have been using philosophy products for a little over a year now and have always been a lover of the pure grace scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion, but super frustrating when it is so poorly packed that the dispenser breaks.</li>

            <li> Loved this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Its creamy and smells so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the type of lotion that smells good on your skin, not by itself.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because many reviews mentioned the beautiful.</li>
            <li> While it does have a moderately pleasant fragrance, it is not anything like the fragrance of Amazing Grace cologne.  </li>
            <li> My very favorite scent and delivered on time..</li>
            <li> I received the product and was very pleased, I plan on reordering.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and makes my skin feel soooo very soft and great.</li>

            <li> Amazing Grace is feminine and delicate.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Philosophy Amazing Grace Firming Body Emulsion, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> But soon, the Amazing Grace scent works its way out.  </li>
            <li> Scent is amazing ..</li>
            <li> Does not smell like amazing grace.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who loves Amazing Grace.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the Amazing Grace perfume spray.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the Amazing Grace parfum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had nice comments on the fragrant.</li>
            <li> honestly, the Firming Body Emulsion part of it does not work.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy feeling, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I started using philosophy products before they became so popular.</li>
            <li> Nicely moisturizing (will use it all over immediately before bedtime so no greasy residue to leave on sheets)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice lotion to wear when doing errands</li>
            <li> Was very Satisfied with the product and the Cost would use Amazon more often</li>
            <li> Love this product, so glad I can get a good price and have delivered.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li> Have used amazing grace for many years.  </li>

            <li> I have been using it for more years</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Not so sure about the firming part.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s slightly more firming compared to drug store firming lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> You go to bed with this on and your sheets will smell lovely too.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion.  </li>

            <li> My all-time favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products.  </li>
            <li> Of course, like everyone I&#x27;d love a miracle</li>
            <li> I think using a well known company may be more reliable.</li>
            <li> ; how many did they review all on one day, etc.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Based on the overwhelming amount of reviews that it smells like heaven, I think it may just be me :)</li>
            <li> I love this item...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and she said it smelled better after you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and it softens skin without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Receive many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> I went out and purchased the Perfume to layer it for a all day affect :)</li>
            <li> It smelled more like a sunscreen to me.  </li>
            <li> However, It&#x27;s main purpose for firming and that works great.</li>
            <li> It is floral and very clean and non intrusive smelling.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, this lotion is a very clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume, much prefer this clean, beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> I am so excited!.</li>
            <li> I would only gift her the best on the special occasion of her</li>
            <li> The scent when I first apply the lotion is not the famous Amazing Grace scent, but a lotion-y almost sun-screen-y sent.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and keeps my arms and legs hydrated most of the day without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I love the light scent this leaves and the softness of my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> this product smells amazing and does absorb right away</li>
            <li> Lovely, rich lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before at a local store and loved the smell, but this one seems to have none!</li>
            <li> For the hype and price I expected a nice scent and great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly and would recommend this site to anyone.</li>
            <li> Ok so I read the reviews for this and this product does not smell good like some people say, yes it did make my skin soft</li>
            <li> Its fragrance was so strong</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know this one is so strong to me.</li>
            <li> I choose the lotions because I don&#x27;t find them as strong as the perfumes - that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
            <li> I did notice the scent wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as the stores version.</li>
            <li> grace is a major fashion brand lotion and will make anyone happy who gets it......impressed</li>
            <li> lotion is one of their best, especially when layering as it seems to last longer without that cloying, too sweet scent that some women&#x27;s bath products have, besides that it is a great moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel so pretty when I am wearing my Amazing Grace products.</li>
            <li> Amazing Grace Firming Body Emulsion is the real deal!</li>
            <li> It came quickly!</li>
            <li> This is really too large a bottle but great lotion</li>
            <li> My order was cancelled after placed and confirmed.</li>
            <li> Just a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this fragrance very much - it&#x27;s light and fresh without being too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and leaves your skin extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li> Light moisture with a light scent</li>
            <li> while I love the smell of amazing grace - this didnt seem to be the same - and it was just overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I am overall happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product use daily.</li>
            <li> Worth the pricey tag!</li>
            <li> Ladies, DEFINITELY worth a try!</li>
            <li> After that, I went to the mall to smell the original product at the store.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect daily lotion that keeps me soft without making me greasy.  </li>
            <li> The lotion spreads easily and is absorbed really quickly leaving a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It smells so clean with just a hint of perfume.  </li>
            <li> People ask what I am wearing and that it smells so clean.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to use more than one product, I just use this as my general body lotion each morning when I get out of the shower and then get dressed.</li>
            <li> Makes skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> but overall it is good.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and looks smooth, not oily.</li>
            <li> It is fresh and fragrant and leaves a smooth feeling to my skin.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope I love it as much.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product, it is very moisturizing, not sticky at all, absorbs quick and the fragrance is VERY PLEASING :)  </li>
            <li> But for nice soft skin that smells clean and fresh, this is the one.  </li>
            <li> most pleasant to use,not greasy and left me feeling clean after applying after a shower, not heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> This lotion firms my skin without leaving it sticky, which I&#x27;ve experienced with other firming lotions.  </li>
            <li> A really clean and fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> So clean and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> I love amazing grace and expected it to smell like it.</li>
            <li> Mild but yet gets attention.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, soft smells amazing not heavy</li>
            <li> Love , love , love the scent and this is the only lotion that will keep my knobby elbows soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite new scent.</li>
            <li> but as soon as I took off the jeans (MANY hours later) the fragrance was still there and still strong.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love the soft feminine scent along with the thickness/coverage of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> worth it.....</li>
            <li> Did not smell as fresh as one I brought from JC Penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v read a lot of very positive reviews about Philosophy products</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially the fresh clean scent it has.</li>
            <li> As many people have said already, I haven&#x27;t noticed any serious &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;, but the scent is so good.  </li>
            <li> Something isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for the past 3 years &amp; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have used this Philosophy Amazing Grace lotion for a long time.</li>
            <li> However after using the amazing grace firming body emulsion, I am now addicted to amazing grace.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, I pay more for this product than I do for similar items, but it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I like them because they smell so soft and clean,not strong like some others on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I admit that when I first put it on, I was worried it would have too much smell, but it dissipated quickly and left the most glorious scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is drastically different from Amazing Grace and not subtle at all.  </li>
            <li> Clean and light fragrance last all day.</li>
            <li> so I decided to invest in a higher end body lotion.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle and used it for the first night.</li>
            <li> I may use it in the day, definitely not in the night any more.</li>
            <li> and now I am hooked on it and see why it&#x27;s worth this much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing because they love the smell.</li>
            <li> but i asked around and everyone said that it smelled funny</li>
            <li> I would absolutely order this product again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a 1-month trial for this - results were visible within 3-4 days; my initial purchase was on June and have since purchased 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li> I notice a visible difference in my skin tone with first day use but greater improvement with continued use (probably max improvement at 4 days of continued, nighttime only use).</li>
            <li> ;-)].</li>
            <li> and I did associate the smell with sun screan at first.  </li>
            <li> Amazing Grace is such a soft scent.  </li>
            <li> [yes, I&#x27;m talking about arms and legs here; I don&#x27;t use this on my face (and frankly, started using this on my bust area recently since it was doing such a good job elsewhere, then maybe….?</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few days, but so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or caused any issues which is great!</li>
            <li> Has a clean fresh smell that does last all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not meant to replace toning by exercise, but it certainly does help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly noticed the moisturizing aspects.</li>
            <li> I really wanted Pure Grace.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Amazing Grace for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I really do like it though.</li>
            <li> inclined to think this is not really Philosophy&#x27;s award winning lotion but a scam.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have much smell  </li>
            <li> so i havent really used much of it since i got it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very healing.</li>
            <li> Lotion is very light...not a restoring or healing lotion.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> ; however, where I see the real evidence is that this really is a firming lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall, however, I think this is a fantastic product</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel the price is too much for that reason.  </li>
            <li> Make me feel fresh and alive.</li>
            <li> It does not firm (I doubt any lotion can do that, having firm skin is a matter of avoiding sun and maintaining good muscle tone).  </li>
            <li> And since I cannot return the product without its original packaging, I will use this lotion until it&#x27;s gone, and in the future will buy it from the department stores.</li>
            <li> I have had more compliments from the scent of this product than almost any other perfumed lotion I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She was thrilled and it will last her a long time.</li>
            <li> I will use this product as long as it remains available-</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side but smells nice and makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice thick lotion that lasts all day, so I&#x27;m pleased, I just expected a little more from the scent.</li>
            <li> My hands are no longer dry and my skin is silky smooth and not rough.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t rely on the reviews as much as previously and have to check how many products has this person reviewed</li>
            <li> I have used countless other products on the market, which were more expensive; but, so far, I have had the best results with Philosophy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is part of a retirement present I am giving a very special friend who I have had the privilege of working with the last 22 years.  </li>
            <li> The price is a bit much but when you only need to use a very little bit for a great feel and coverage, the lotion will last a loooonnnnnnggggg time</li>
            <li> The scent is very fresh and clean and very very lightly floral combined with white tea and aloe scent (not sure if that description helps form a mental picture!).</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have gotten several compliments on my fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Ok... so it doesn&#x27;t really firm any...</li>
            <li> After trying it a few times, I like the smell much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice thick lotion too, but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Live and learn...</li>
            <li> Further, it is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells and found this one does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I made a big gamble on this lotion - buying it without smelling it on first.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly the same as the product from the store.</li>
            <li> I put a little on my finger tips and couldn&#x27;t believe how strong it was.</li>
            <li> But the bigger bottle is definitely a smart buy if you associate with this scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a heavy lotion.  </li>
            <li> But this product makes them soft in a way that doesn&#x27;t make a pen slide out of my grip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft smell and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting that old lady crepey look</li>
            <li> Or it&#x27;s the real thing that has been diluted with a basic lotion.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes very well, a definite plus for me.  </li>
            <li> Has a soft scent and lotion goes on well and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I believe it is a firming lotion, but I use it because it works on my sensitive skin and as mentioned like the scent.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I must have accidentally ordered the wrong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I also love how thick and CREAMY it is.  </li>
            <li> Tend to scour blogs (and Amazon) for highly rated products to try and then will add one at a time for as unbiased evaluation as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the firming, but it is a very fresh smell when applied that also lasts.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as it used to when I had a bottle from a few years ago, but it still smells lovely and does a nice job moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells like the real thing when initially applying but after a short time there is no scent of anything..</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my skin really soft!  </li>
            <li> The product has an extremely faint fragrance that is not what it&#x27;s supposed to be (Amazing Grace)!&lt;br</li>
            <li> was obviously old as some of the words were totally smudged off the bottle.</li>
            <li> Said it makes her skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> If I stop using for awhile, I am always surprised at what a difference it makes in my overall skin tone - skin seems tighter with a poreless sort of airbrushed appearance</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve lost weight, my skin seems to have maintained its elasticity, though I can&#x27;t say for certain whether it&#x27;s due to this product or others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up wearing actual perfumes and now wear perfumed body creams which are more subtle, longer lasting, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> (read: something I only need to apply once a week--this isn&#x27;t going to happen in the near future</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to the perfume when I ran out, because I generally think that lotions last longer than perfume.  </li>
            <li> [What follows next is a mini rant about purchasing through Amazon - generally product review ends here.]</li>
            <li> I have been using philosophy products for a little over a year now and have always been a lover of the pure grace scent.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion, but super frustrating when it is so poorly packed that the dispenser breaks.</li>
            <li> I would have given this five stars, however it is always a mystery to me whether it is actually the cream/lotion that created the firmness, or possibly the massage and dry brushing that went with it.</li>
            <li> However, in general, with the explosion of 3rd party sellers on Amazon, I&#x27;ve received other products that I&#x27;ve questioned authenticity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very sure about the firming action, but psychologically feel something like that almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been and probably will be a lifelong NIVEA lotion user, but this lotion has definitely thrown a curve ball into my game.&lt;br /&gt;Scents usually do not last all day on me..</li>
            <li> - my reviews date back to at least 2013 - albeit, not a great many).</li>
            <li> Being a skincare addict, I am extremely critical of products (e.g., usually give a 2 month trial for all supplements; topical products generally a 1-month trial).</li>
            <li> May have set on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> used it once and between the smell and the strange, sticky consistency, I knew it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing these for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> It has an extremely feminine scent which thankfully is long lasting.</li>
            <li> A word with regard to buying through Amazon - the initial bottles I purchased through Amazon and thought the scent seemed harsher than what other reviewers had noted.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if the firming part works because I couldnt stand to use it for very long.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin like me and need some firming, this is it.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the fragrance strong (and IMO unpleasant) but it LASTS.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the formulation has changed or what, but this does not smell anywhere near like what it has in the past.  </li>
            <li> not even half of a day, but this one definitely does.  </li>
            <li> But this is no better or no differently scented than Jergens or any generic brand lotion.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin.  </li>
            <li> but after a few hours my skin actually felt dry all over</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;firm&#x27;, it definitely enhances the quality of your skin!</li>
            <li> The company has changed hands a few times since then, and now the product is different.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> does wonders for my dry skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who smell nice things on other people then try it on myself and hate it.  </li>
            <li> It is a soft subtle scent that gets noticed.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim due to a product review on a message board.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t conflict if you want to use other products with it.</li>
            <li> (I usually apply only at night just for convenience).</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> The lotion was ok, but has absolutely no smell at all, very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I did 30.00 down the drain!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it was slightly cheaper, coz</li>
            <li> I thought the scent would be a little morre noticeable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I have used for several years and am addicted to the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I find that I am smelling what I want to smell after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It is my go to everyday lotion/scent.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> but where is the firming dont waste your money,</li>
            <li> ive searched high and low for a Facial lotion that didn&#x27;t make me break out or irritate my skin or one that didn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would call it firming, who knows, maybe it&#x27;s me, but whateve.</li>
            <li> I bought it at the recommendation of a friend to help firm skin, will see how that works out!</li>
            <li> Someone had given this to me as a gift; and, I have been using it for the past 6 months.  </li>
            <li> it is not overwhelming and people compliment me on &#x27;&#x27;smelling good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The scent is heavy-handed and unappealing, the texture of the lotion is very thick, and it is overall not something I want to buy again.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and finding skin products that don&#x27;t cause irritation or leave my skin feeling greasy or thick is hard.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for at least 5 years now, and would never consider changing it unless they stop making it.</li>
            <li> cannot give the product I received a star at all, but am forced to.</li>
            <li> it is thick and firms.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way so the price is not so bad under those circumstances.  </li>
            <li> The pumps to the bottles were broken.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the cap, I recognized it as a scent that an ex-coworker wore, and I hated it whenever she came near me.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about ordering this because of the price, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li> like this product might be a fake.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Im mad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unpleasant and the bottle leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li> It is very faint.</li>
            <li> very expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very confused by what these posts are saying about the fragrance!</li>
            <li> my bad :-(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the lotion didn&#x27;t seem to go in my skin</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lovely, lovely fragrance. Amazing Grace is feminine and delicate.&lt;br /&gt;My husband always compliments me when I put this lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;It truly is a wonderful body lotion. ~ Mrs. B.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> My order was cancelled after placed and confirmed. No reason given. These were Christmas gifts.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy and this is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who smell nice things on other people then try it on myself and hate it.  I have a graveyard of perfumes in my bathroom.  I made a big gamble on this lotion - buying it without smelling it on first.  I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;I admit that when I first put it on, I was worried it would have too much smell, but it dissipated quickly and left the most glorious scent.  I realize that &#x27;glorious scent&#x27; is relative to your scent preference.  I have four boys and each of them have told me I smell good.  My husband loves it.  I love it.  I had a friend tell me I smelled &#x27;delicious.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a heavy lotion.  If you are looking for a body butter, this isn&#x27;t one.  It&#x27;s a perfect daily lotion that keeps me soft without making me greasy.  I have VERY dry skin.  The skin on my hands doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve put lotion on 30 seconds after I put it on.  But this product makes them soft in a way that doesn&#x27;t make a pen slide out of my grip.  I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had nice comments on the fragrant. Bought as gift...she loves it too</li>
            <li> The scent is drastically different from Amazing Grace and not subtle at all.  The bottle leaked in the plastic bag packaging.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product good for your skin and smells heavenly I always get compliments when I wear it. I will continue to wear it for many years. Judith Douglas</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, soft smells amazing not heavy</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Amazing Grace. People will actually come up to you and ask if it is you they smell....LOL Most say it smells like you just stepped out of the shower. A really clean and fresh fragrance. I love it!</li>
            <li> I thought the scent would be a little morre noticeable. It is very faint.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Philosophy&#x27;s line of bath, lotion and fragrances help to perk up my spriits without fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is one of their best, especially when layering as it seems to last longer without that cloying, too sweet scent that some women&#x27;s bath products have, besides that it is a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is part of a retirement present I am giving a very special friend who I have had the privilege of working with the last 22 years.  I would only gift her the best on the special occasion of her retirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it firms but it smells very good.  It&#x27;s a soft smell and lasts all day. Love it</li>
            <li> What can I say.....It&#x27;s Philosophy and it&#x27;s great.  Been using for years.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and finding skin products that don&#x27;t cause irritation or leave my skin feeling greasy or thick is hard. I bought this on a whim due to a product review on a message board. I really do like it though. I have only had it a few days, but so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or caused any issues which is great!</li>
            <li> Always a good purchase</li>
            <li> My skin is getting that old lady crepey look so I decided to invest in a higher end body lotion. I&#x27;v read a lot of very positive reviews about Philosophy products so I decided to try it. Whoo boy! The fragrance! I put a little on my finger tips and couldn&#x27;t believe how strong it was. I decided to try it on one leg to see how well it served as a moisturizer. I have to admit, it&#x27;s a really good moisturizer but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m putting this all over my body. Not only is the fragrance strong (and IMO unpleasant) but it LASTS. I put on a pair of jeans after I moisturized the one leg and the scent wasn&#x27;t that noticeable but as soon as I took off the jeans (MANY hours later) the fragrance was still there and still strong. Thank goodness for Amazon customer service. Needless to say I returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> Was very Satisfied with the product and the Cost would use Amazon more often</li>
            <li> Best smell, I don&#x27;t care if it moisturizes, it makes me smell soooo good!</li>
            <li> I love the amazing grace sent!</li>
            <li> Always loved this scent and it keeps your skin moisturized all day. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have used amazing grace for many years.  Got ripped off!  Smells like the real thing when initially applying but after a short time there is no scent of anything..as if I never applied lotion at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t !!!</li>
            <li> Feels good and smells good.  Nice fresh scent.  Feels good on my skin. I use it every day and have gotten several compliments on my fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I must have accidentally ordered the wrong fragrance.  I really wanted Pure Grace.</li>
            <li> This was my second bottle from this seller. I&#x27;ve given up wearing actual perfumes and now wear perfumed body creams which are more subtle, longer lasting, and moisturizing. This scent is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;When this bottle is finished, I will reorder from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a very long time. Makes skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for more years then I can remember.  I don&#x27;t wear perfume, much prefer this clean, beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about ordering this because of the price, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for it.  As many people have said already, I haven&#x27;t noticed any serious &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;, but the scent is so good.  I also love how thick and CREAMY it is.  I have been and probably will be a lifelong NIVEA lotion user, but this lotion has definitely thrown a curve ball into my game.&lt;br /&gt;Scents usually do not last all day on me..not even half of a day, but this one definitely does.  My husband loves it and urges me to use it all the time.  It definitely makes my skin really soft!  This really is a great Philosophy product.  But aren&#x27;t they all?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!  Fragrance is so nice!</li>
            <li> I would have given this five stars, however it is always a mystery to me whether it is actually the cream/lotion that created the firmness, or possibly the massage and dry brushing that went with it. In any case, I could see a noticeable difference within four applications. (Two a day for two days)</li>
            <li> Love it.  The scent is awesome, all by itself and lasts all day.  There is a firming to it which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion, use it every day!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! The scent stays all day!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion despite the 3 stars.  It does not firm (I doubt any lotion can do that, having firm skin is a matter of avoiding sun and maintaining good muscle tone).  It does smell great and is moisturizing.  I would like it if the fragrance lasted longer but overall it is good.</li>
            <li> While it does have a moderately pleasant fragrance, it is not anything like the fragrance of Amazing Grace cologne.  It also leaves my skin feeling sticky. I received a 2nd (auto) shipment, but will be cancelling future orders.</li>
            <li> But this is no better or no differently scented than Jergens or any generic brand lotion. I&#x27;m very disappointed. For the hype and price I expected a nice scent and great moisturizer. A $2.99 Walmart lotion could do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m inclined to think this is not really Philosophy&#x27;s award winning lotion but a scam. Or it&#x27;s the real thing that has been diluted with a basic lotion. Something isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle and used it for the first night. Its fragrance was so strong and I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep. I use body cream or lotion without fragrance before. I don&#x27;t know this one is so strong to me. Only used one time. I may use it in the day, definitely not in the night any more.</li>
            <li> Ok... so it doesn&#x27;t really firm any... you have to do that in the gym.  But for nice soft skin that smells clean and fresh, this is the one.  Every time I use someone during the day tells me I smell good!  Worth the pricey tag!</li>
            <li> Sadly, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as it used to when I had a bottle from a few years ago, but it still smells lovely and does a nice job moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side but smells nice and makes your skin feel soft. Not so sure about the firming part. I would say it&#x27;s slightly more firming compared to drug store firming lotions. Probably will purchase again.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion has the most wonderful smell ever! It has an extremely feminine scent which thankfully is long lasting. The scent is very fresh and clean and very very lightly floral combined with white tea and aloe scent (not sure if that description helps form a mental picture!). The lotion spreads easily and is absorbed really quickly leaving a smooth finish. I&#x27;m not very sure about the firming action, but psychologically feel something like that almost immediately. It is a truly beautiful product and you&#x27;ll love to smell yourself! Wish it was slightly cheaper, coz I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to keep buying it. Ladies, DEFINITELY worth a try! If you&#x27;re unsure about the smell, I would recommend a smaller size or going out to Macy&#x27;s and trying some samples! But the bigger bottle is definitely a smart buy if you associate with this scent. 5x Stars!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  It smells so clean with just a hint of perfume.  You go to bed with this on and your sheets will smell lovely too.  My children were hugging me saying how good I smell.  I tend to lather it on because it makes me silky and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the lotion didn&#x27;t seem to go in my skin I thought it was my skin didn&#x27;t change for the moisture I thought I would get for the price</li>
            <li> A wonderful lotion. Just a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001KYOCTK Philosophy Amazing Grace Firming Body Emulsion, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give the product I received a star at all, but am forced to. The product has an extremely faint fragrance that is not what it&#x27;s supposed to be (Amazing Grace)!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I threw the packaging away as I never had to return anything to Amazon. And since I cannot return the product without its original packaging, I will use this lotion until it&#x27;s gone, and in the future will buy it from the department stores.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used for several years and am addicted to the fragrance.  A bit pricee but a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;firm&#x27;, it definitely enhances the quality of your skin! Further, it is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love , love , love the scent and this is the only lotion that will keep my knobby elbows soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion.  I&#x27;m not sure about the firming, but it is a very fresh smell when applied that also lasts.</li>
            <li> I love my &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34; products, but honestly, the Firming Body Emulsion part of it does not work.  Love the soft feminine scent along with the thickness/coverage of the lotion.  I feel so pretty when I am wearing my Amazing Grace products. I have been a fan of Amazing Grace for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> Has a clean fresh smell that does last all day. I am a nurse and I just put this lotion on my arms before going to work and everyone tells me I smell so good. Even at the end of my shift I get compliments...co-workers say &amp;#34;I want what you are wearing&amp;#34; It feels so good when you put it on your skin. I am what you would call a lotion freak..so I have tried many and this is one of the best!!</li>
            <li> most pleasant to use,not greasy and left me feeling clean after applying after a shower, not heavily perfumed. Use after swimming, so counters effects of chlorine, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to the perfume when I ran out, because I generally think that lotions last longer than perfume.  When I got it, I was impressed with the size of the bottle and quantity of lotion.  The scent when I first apply the lotion is not the famous Amazing Grace scent, but a lotion-y almost sun-screen-y sent.  But soon, the Amazing Grace scent works its way out.  Maybe because its a lotion and not a perfume this happens.  Either way, I find that I am smelling what I want to smell after a few minutes.  I also get lots of compliments from others hours after I put the lotion on and can&#x27;t smell it myself anymore.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend asked for this for Christmas.  As a man looking at this and seeing a $50 lotion I thought it was overpriced. I bought it for her anyways to make her happy...then I smelled it........wow this is the best lotion I have ever smelled. It is floral and very clean and non intrusive smelling.  I decided to try it and now I am hooked on it and see why it&#x27;s worth this much. My hands are no longer dry and my skin is silky smooth and not rough.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it.....grace is a major fashion brand lotion and will make anyone happy who gets it......impressed</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have much smell  I love amazing grace and expected it to smell like it. It does fell very nice on skin just doesn&#x27;t have fragrance</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for the past 3 years &amp; it&#x27;s great. Love the scent. Would recommend Amazing Grace to all my friends!</li>
            <li> The pumps to the bottles were broken. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> My very favorite scent and delivered on time..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 8 years,,,I love it  After applying the cream my skin feels like velvet</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money. It&#x27;s hydrating your skin but does not deliver on intent. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially the fresh clean scent it has. It goes on smooth and keeps my arms and legs hydrated most of the day without leaving a greasy residue. I must admit, I pay more for this product than I do for similar items, but it&#x27;s worth the investment. I will use this product as long as it remains available-It works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> The best scent in the world. Sometimes scented lotions don&#x27;t actually moisturize, but this one does. I can&#x27;t get enough of Amazing Grace. Just turned a friend of mine on to it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent - can&#x27;t wait to order more</li>
            <li> Love this product, so glad I can get a good price and have delivered.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance.  Live and learn...my bad :-(</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, but super frustrating when it is so poorly packed that the dispenser breaks.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this fragrance very much - it&#x27;s light and fresh without being too overwhelming. I choose the lotions because I don&#x27;t find them as strong as the perfumes - that&#x27;s just my preference. The shipper was beyond great. I received my product the day after I placed the order - and I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received the product and was very pleased, I plan on reordering.</li>
            <li> This is the best. It is my go to everyday lotion/scent. It is a soft subtle scent that gets noticed.  Everywhere I go people want to know what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> The lotion is creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy feeling, which is nice. Not sure I would call it firming, who knows, maybe it&#x27;s me, but whateve. It smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Lovely, rich lotion.  Scent is amazing .. just lovely &amp; not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have been using philosophy products for a little over a year now and have always been a lover of the pure grace scent.  However after using the amazing grace firming body emulsion, I am now addicted to amazing grace.  This lotion firms my skin without leaving it sticky, which I&#x27;ve experienced with other firming lotions.  It also moisturizes very well, a definite plus for me.  If you have dry skin like me and need some firming, this is it.  It&#x27;s not meant to replace toning by exercise, but it certainly does help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly noticed the moisturizing aspects. As I&#x27;ve lost weight, my skin seems to have maintained its elasticity, though I can&#x27;t say for certain whether it&#x27;s due to this product or others. Either way, it has become an integral part of my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> My sister wanted this for Christmas.  She had seen this product many places, but hadn&#x27;t seen it in this size.  It smells fantastic and leaves your skin extremely smooth.  She was thrilled and it will last her a long time.</li>
            <li> Clean and light fragrance last all day.</li>
            <li> smells great and seems to help with firming. I wish there was a miracle out there but this might be the next best thing.</li>
            <li> What an amazing and refreshing fragrance.  Mild but yet gets attention.  I have received so many compliments, I will make sure to always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> ive searched high and low for a Facial lotion that didn&#x27;t make me break out or irritate my skin or one that didn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on my skin. My search ended here. It&#x27;s so worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn nothing else since I discovered this fragrance and am often questioned as to what I&#x27;m wearing. My skin feels fresh and looks smooth, not oily.</li>
            <li> I love amazing Grace. But for some reason this lotion doesnt smell the same!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  I bought it at the recommendation of a friend to help firm skin, will see how that works out!</li>
            <li> Did not smell as fresh as one I brought from JC Penny.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite new scent. I layer all of these products. I&#x27;ll be purchasing these for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> Works great for toning. Arrived as described. I use this product everyday. Great buy. I am so excited!. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It was just as described.  It came quickly!</li>
            <li> Someone had given this to me as a gift; and, I have been using it for the past 6 months.  I think I definitely notice a difference in my face and neck.  I have used countless other products on the market, which were more expensive; but, so far, I have had the best results with Philosophy. I bought one for my sister also; and, she also has noticed a change in the firmness of her face.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product smells and feels.  A perfect compliment is the lotion and body was. I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I love the Philosophy Amazing Grace Firming Body Emulsion, Philosophy !! My sin feels sooo Good !!&lt;br /&gt;ML</li>
            <li> Great product - always a fan of Philosophy. Has a soft scent and lotion goes on well and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Its wonderful.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and my wife Loves it.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent. very expensive but i only use it occasionaly</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I started using Philosophy with the recommendation of my step daughter.  Amazing Grace is such a soft scent.  Doesn&#x27;t conflict if you want to use other products with it.</li>
            <li> This is a gift.  This is not for my personal use.  I hope the recipient likes it.  I may never know.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product where I&#x27;ve gotten as many compliments as I do with Amazing Grace. I&#x27;ve had multiple people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing because they love the smell. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use more than one product, I just use this as my general body lotion each morning when I get out of the shower and then get dressed. The scent lingers throughout the day just enough without being overbearing. It&#x27;s a nice thick lotion too, but not greasy at all. Been using this product for at least 5 years now, and would never consider changing it unless they stop making it.</li>
            <li> Love the Amazing Grave</li>
            <li> I started using philosophy products before they became so popular. I like them because they smell so soft and clean,not strong like some others on the market. I am very sensitive to smells and found this one does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it smelled better.. i thought it was just me.. but i asked around and everyone said that it smelled funny so i havent really used much of it since i got it.</li>
            <li> I love the light scent this leaves and the softness of my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> Love Philosophy line. This lotion is very healing. I did notice the scent wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as the stores version. May have set on the shelf too long. Anyways, this lotion is a very clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin love this lotion!! Doesnt leave a greasy feel all day like most lotions. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Arrived from seller in timely manner.  It is my favorite scented lotion.  I don&#x27;t know that I believe it is a firming lotion, but I use it because it works on my sensitive skin and as mentioned like the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. My all-time favorite scent. Lotion is very light...not a restoring or healing lotion. Light moisture with a light scent</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Always used to get compliments when wearing it.  I don&#x27;t know if the formulation has changed or what, but this does not smell anywhere near like what it has in the past.  It&#x27;s unpleasant and the bottle leaked during shipment. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of Amazing Grace..it is not overwhelming and people compliment me on &#x27;&#x27;smelling good&amp;#34;. The lotion&lt;br /&gt;also softens my skin. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Used to use this product some years back. The company has changed hands a few times since then, and now the product is different. The scent is heavy-handed and unappealing, the texture of the lotion is very thick, and it is overall not something I want to buy again. I held on to it for a while, but eventually threw it out. A waste of money. And a shame. I used to be a &amp;#34;Philosophy Girl&amp;#34; and bought quite a bit, but no longer.</li>
            <li> Good size for the price. Great lotion bc it is thick and firms. I would absolutely order this product again!</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products.  So clean and fresh smelling.  Always very happy!!!!</li>
            <li> Not a fan .... while I love the smell of amazing grace - this didnt seem to be the same - and it was just overwhelming.  I have no idea if the firming part works because I couldnt stand to use it for very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very confused by what these posts are saying about the fragrance! I bought this lotion based on the great review on the smell...but it smells like sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> this product smells amazing and does absorb right away but after a few hours my skin actually felt dry all over</li>
            <li> like this product might be a fake. I received the product and the bottle was obviously old as some of the words were totally smudged off the bottle. Does not smell like amazing grace. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who loves Amazing Grace.  She had never tried it &amp; now just loves it.  Said it makes her skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> I Love, Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Being a skincare addict, I am extremely critical of products (e.g., usually give a 2 month trial for all supplements; topical products generally a 1-month trial). Tend to scour blogs (and Amazon) for highly rated products to try and then will add one at a time for as unbiased evaluation as possible. I didn&#x27;t need a 1-month trial for this - results were visible within 3-4 days; my initial purchase was on June and have since purchased 3 more bottles. Philosophy Amazing Grace Firming Body Emulsion is the real deal! Nicely moisturizing (will use it all over immediately before bedtime so no greasy residue to leave on sheets); however, where I see the real evidence is that this really is a firming lotion. I notice a visible difference in my skin tone with first day use but greater improvement with continued use (probably max improvement at 4 days of continued, nighttime only use). If I stop using for awhile, I am always surprised at what a difference it makes in my overall skin tone - skin seems tighter with a poreless sort of airbrushed appearance [yes, I&#x27;m talking about arms and legs here; I don&#x27;t use this on my face (and frankly, started using this on my bust area recently since it was doing such a good job elsewhere, then maybe….? ;-)]. It is moisturizing (without being greasy) with an effect that seems to last throughout the next day (I usually apply only at night just for convenience). Of course, like everyone I&#x27;d love a miracle (read: something I only need to apply once a week--this isn&#x27;t going to happen in the near future [but if someone has that product already, please leave a comment!]): you do need to keep using it to get the benefits, natch. [What follows next is a mini rant about purchasing through Amazon - generally product review ends here.] A word with regard to buying through Amazon - the initial bottles I purchased through Amazon and thought the scent seemed harsher than what other reviewers had noted. Purchased my last couple of bottles from Ulta and the scent was slightly different; having said that, the overall effect seemed to be maintained. However, in general, with the explosion of 3rd party sellers on Amazon, I&#x27;ve received other products that I&#x27;ve questioned authenticity. I think using a well known company may be more reliable. However, did review the company listed as supplier for this product and they have 4.8/5.0 stars over the last 12 months (although that raises the issue of &amp;#34;professional reviews&amp;#34; which, I think, has also exploded on Amazon in the last 12-24 months - I can&#x27;t rely on the reviews as much as previously and have to check how many products has this person reviewed; how many did they review all on one day, etc. - my reviews date back to at least 2013 - albeit, not a great many). Overall, however, I think this is a fantastic product and it&#x27;s earned a permanent place in my lineup of body skincare products.</li>
            <li> I have used this Philosophy Amazing Grace lotion for a long time. It is fresh and fragrant and leaves a smooth feeling to my skin. I have had more compliments from the scent of this product than almost any other perfumed lotion I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion without smelling it because all the reviews raved about how it smelled. It does smell good, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away as I was expecting to be. It&#x27;s a nice thick lotion that lasts all day, so I&#x27;m pleased, I just expected a little more from the scent. Based on the overwhelming amount of reviews that it smells like heaven, I think it may just be me :)</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion.  I saw it on a show on t.v. and bought it to try it out.  I think it smells great, feels great, a little goes a long way so the price is not so bad under those circumstances.  The price is a bit much but when you only need to use a very little bit for a great feel and coverage, the lotion will last a loooonnnnnnggggg time so I don&#x27;t feel the price is too much for that reason.  I will be purchasing this lotion again and again.  It is wonderful and makes my skin feel soooo very soft and great.</li>
            <li> I love this item...does wonders for my dry skin and a little goes a long way. Also not greasy. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Its creamy and smells so good. People ask what I am wearing and that it smells so clean. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Everything I expected. Looking forward to my roller ball that I ordered. Let&#x27;s hope I love it as much.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, is silky feeling and a little goes a very long way.  Great moisturizer that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I like to try different lotions from time to time, but I always end up coming back to this one. It has a wonderful smell and I always get compliments on my scent when I layer the lotion with the Amazing Grace eau de toilette. Better yet, it is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have read mixed reviews about the smell of this product.  I bought it myself and I did associate the smell with sun screan at first.  After that, I went to the mall to smell the original product at the store. This is exactly the same as the product from the store. I spoke to the sales rep and she said it smelled better after you put it on your skin. After trying it a few times, I like the smell much better. It&#x27;s the type of lotion that smells good on your skin, not by itself. However, It&#x27;s main purpose for firming and that works great. I am overall happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and it softens skin without being greasy.  I use this with the Amazing Grace perfume spray.</li>
            <li> the sent is heavenly. Make me feel fresh and alive. love it!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good, I am so happy about this purchases. This will be my go to fragrance. Will order it again</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  Receive many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace...my favorite scent.  I received my order very quickly and would recommend this site to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product, it is very moisturizing, not sticky at all, absorbs quick and the fragrance is VERY PLEASING :)  I went out and purchased the Perfume to layer it for a all day affect :)</li>
            <li> Ok so I read the reviews for this and this product does not smell good like some people say, yes it did make my skin soft but where is the firming dont waste your money, Im mad I did 30.00 down the drain!&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this to any of my friends!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because many reviews mentioned the beautiful. pleasant scent.  I was looking for a nice lotion to wear when doing errands so I bought it.  As soon as I opened the cap, I recognized it as a scent that an ex-coworker wore, and I hated it whenever she came near me.  I sent it back.  Sorry I couldn&#x27;t be more helpful.  I guess when it comes to scents, it&#x27;s a personal choice.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. It smells really good and leaves my skin feeling great. Also there is not a greasy after effect.</li>
            <li> This is really too large a bottle but great lotion</li>
            <li> The lotion was ok, but has absolutely no smell at all, very disappointing.  I&#x27;ve bought this before at a local store and loved the smell, but this one seems to have none!</li>
            <li> Great product use daily. The only product of this type i will ever use. Thank you Philosophy. Great, great, great.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the Amazing Grace parfum.  It smelled more like a sunscreen to me.  I sent it back - it was awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and between the smell and the strange, sticky consistency, I knew it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
