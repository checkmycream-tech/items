            <li>Its lighter smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as Beautiful</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>his favorite cologne from a different site--</li>

            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and I have given it to her for our wedding anniversary for several years.</li>
            <li>this is the third time I have done this if I get any more of these request on this item</li>
            <li>two years after she first said she&#x27;d like to try it.  </li>
            <li>Xmas present for my daughter - her favorite perfume</li>
            <li>like they&#x27;ve changed the formula, probably making a better profit now, at the expense of actually having a scent.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I got it first time 8 years ago and still it is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>It was much higher price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I can now get if for less at Amazon.</li>
            <li>A favorite year round fragrance, a light floral that stays.  </li>
            <li>I have worn this for a long time. :)</li>
            <li>I love it because it is strong and light at the same time and leaves a delicate layer of scent on my clothing.  </li>
            <li>not the real thing.......</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase online again if available.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know what else I can say about it</li>
            <li>thanks amazon</li>
            <li>I am very picky and smell everything too.</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>Saved about 30% over shopping locally and the shipping was free also.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift to my wife and it was what she really likes</li>
            <li>She really loves it.</li>
            <li>So I found it much cheaper on amazon</li>
            <li>Very recommend it</li>
            <li>I know the smell very well.</li>
            <li>This is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>though I  have a number of other perfumes I most often reach for this one.</li>
            <li>It never gets old as it keeps a sweet, yet soft, scent to it.  </li>
            <li>This is her favorite hands down.</li>
            <li>When I go to the store, I sample many different perfumes but always come back to Pleasures when it&#x27;s time to order.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>This is wondeful no different than you would get right from the counter in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Received Very Early, the day before arrival date.</li>
            <li>There is no excessive overkill of its aura.</li>
            <li>item was counterfeit , i was not able to return it better if you go to the local mall and get the real deal</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s a clean, long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I was in my early 20&#x27;, when this perfume came out and I wore it a lot.</li>
            <li>Anyway, try it before purchase it, I think it&#x27;s not too expensive, the smell is long-lasting but can be too overwhelming if you spray too much of this killer, haha.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;knock-out&amp;#34; type of scent that sends sinus sufferers and people with sensitive noses running out the door.  </li>
            <li>She was surprised that I remembered (when her husband didn&#x27;t.)  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
            <li>I have wore it for years now and feel so bare without it.</li>
            <li>The tones are soft and not overpowering and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>smells rancid-- a waste of money - have worn this for years- first time buying on</li>
            <li>Not outstanding but has some pizzazz and if the skin is the right match, then you have a winner.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Customer service was very apologetic and refunded me in the full amount.</li>
            <li> Its lighter smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as Beautiful</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> his favorite cologne from a different site--</li>

            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted - this is a 5&amp;#34; bottle</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and I have given it to her for our wedding anniversary for several years.</li>
            <li> this is the third time I have done this if I get any more of these request on this item</li>
            <li> two years after she first said she&#x27;d like to try it.  </li>
            <li> Xmas present for my daughter - her favorite perfume</li>
            <li> like they&#x27;ve changed the formula, probably making a better profit now, at the expense of actually having a scent.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I got it first time 8 years ago and still it is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> It was much higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I can now get if for less at Amazon.</li>
            <li> A favorite year round fragrance, a light floral that stays.  </li>
            <li> I have worn this for a long time. :)</li>
            <li> I love it because it is strong and light at the same time and leaves a delicate layer of scent on my clothing.  </li>
            <li> not the real thing.......</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase online again if available.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know what else I can say about it</li>
            <li> thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I am very picky and smell everything too.</li>
            <li> thanks you</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> Saved about 30% over shopping locally and the shipping was free also.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift to my wife and it was what she really likes</li>
            <li> She really loves it.</li>
            <li> So I found it much cheaper on amazon</li>
            <li> Very recommend it</li>
            <li> I know the smell very well.</li>
            <li> This is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> though I  have a number of other perfumes I most often reach for this one.</li>
            <li> It never gets old as it keeps a sweet, yet soft, scent to it.  </li>
            <li> This is her favorite hands down.</li>
            <li> When I go to the store, I sample many different perfumes but always come back to Pleasures when it&#x27;s time to order.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is wondeful no different than you would get right from the counter in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Received Very Early, the day before arrival date.</li>
            <li> There is no excessive overkill of its aura.</li>
            <li> item was counterfeit , i was not able to return it better if you go to the local mall and get the real deal</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s a clean, long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I was in my early 20&#x27;, when this perfume came out and I wore it a lot.</li>
            <li> Anyway, try it before purchase it, I think it&#x27;s not too expensive, the smell is long-lasting but can be too overwhelming if you spray too much of this killer, haha.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;knock-out&amp;#34; type of scent that sends sinus sufferers and people with sensitive noses running out the door.  </li>
            <li> She was surprised that I remembered (when her husband didn&#x27;t.)  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
            <li> I have wore it for years now and feel so bare without it.</li>
            <li> The tones are soft and not overpowering and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> smells rancid-- a waste of money - have worn this for years- first time buying on</li>
            <li> Not outstanding but has some pizzazz and if the skin is the right match, then you have a winner.</li>
            <li> The price is high, but about half what my husband paid to buy me some when it was a newer perfume.</li>
            <li> I loved it, but over time, I gotten sick of it</li>
            <li> That is how much you would pay for a 1.7 oz with a small bottle of lotion at a department store.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like rainfall on flowers and its a long lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li> You only need a spritz or two to do ya which means the bottle will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> and it last for a long time</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for a long time and I continue to get compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> The cost on Amazon is less than in the major department stores.</li>
            <li> Paid nearly $60 for this bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;After spraying, the scent lasts about 30 seconds, then is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this for my wife for at least 5 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Seems</li>
            <li> From the reviews, I expected a lot from this company and this bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> in the pink box with plastic wrap...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> She has other perfumes as well</li>
            <li> I expected it to be like the one I typically buy from a department store.</li>
            <li> Just remember a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The base notes are Sandalwood and Patchouli and I have always worn those two scents well, the top notes are lilies, peonies and jasmine</li>
            <li> but this one tops the list hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet but is feminine.</li>
            <li> I sprayed just a little on my wrist and it lasted ALL day.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it once and one of her little boys asked &amp;</li>
            <li> waste your money on this unscented alcohol.</li>
            <li> Being a man, I know very little about perfume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find gifts for mom.</li>
            <li> and i consider is a delicate fragance for a woman.</li>
            <li> It is so delicate.</li>
            <li> This product was an imitation, and I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than the bottle I got at Macy&#x27;s-love it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get bored.</li>
            <li> When I removed the cap, there was a faint scent coming from the bottle.</li>
            <li> If you like Pleasures, you won&#x27;t be sorry buying this.</li>
            <li> I will start finding it annoying  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

            <li> Present for wife, who loves it!</li>
            <li> Whether you like the scent or not, is a matter of taste..I have worn this cologne for many years, and still like it. Used to buy it at the&lt;br /&gt;airport Duty Free shops, but they are no longer &#x27;&#x27;bargains.&#x27;&#x27; If you like this cologne, this will be the best price I think, that you will find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say.  My wife has been wearing this perfume for years and she loves it.  It never gets old as it keeps a sweet, yet soft, scent to it.  Most perfumes keep a strong scent to it after it dries up, but this one stays soft throughout the day.  There is no excessive overkill of its aura.</li>
            <li> I was in my early 20&#x27;, when this perfume came out and I wore it a lot. I wear it again from time to time since I collected many favorites thru the years. It&#x27;s not sweet but is feminine. One of those things that is never out of fashion. Men like it too!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume. I have wore it for years now and feel so bare without it. The price was great and the shipping was lightning fast. i will buy again</li>
            <li> Love the product, great seller.</li>
            <li> Just as ordered.Quick shipping</li>
            <li> Just perfect! Thank you!</li>
            <li> You;&#x27;d have to ask the wife for comments.  All I can tell you is that it smells good on her.  :)</li>
            <li> This is a great price for the giant bottle of perfume, my sister will love the scent and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> was a gift she loved it</li>
            <li> This was my favorite fragrance for many years, I wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else. The base notes are Sandalwood and Patchouli and I have always worn those two scents well, the top notes are lilies, peonies and jasmine and they are a heavenly combination. I still keep a bottle of this on hand and wear it if I&#x27;m going to an elegant event, I think this scent is wears well for special occasions and I like to mix up my fragrances so I don&#x27;t get bored. This is just simply a beautiful perfume to have in my collection and I don&#x27;t see it every leaving.</li>
            <li> Great bargain! Love the scent! Good packaging as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume about a year ago, it has a great a unique smell. I loved it, but over time, I gotten sick of it (maybe it&#x27;s because I used it a bit too much, almost everyday, you see). Anyway, try it before purchase it, I think it&#x27;s not too expensive, the smell is long-lasting but can be too overwhelming if you spray too much of this killer, haha. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> wife loves it price is good to.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites</li>
            <li> Wonderful, love the scent</li>
            <li> From the reviews, I expected a lot from this company and this bottle of perfume. I expected it to be like the one I typically buy from a department store. However, this was not the case. When I removed the cap, there was a faint scent coming from the bottle. When I sprayed it on my skin multiple I could not even smell anything. I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Estee Lauder has the greatest smelling perfume ever. My husband actually found this deal. I&#x27;ve been wanting Pleasures for quite a while now. We got a 3.4 oz bottle for $54.99 and no shipping cost. That is how much you would pay for a 1.7 oz with a small bottle of lotion at a department store. We jumped on this deal. It got here in a quick manner; smelled great, no box damage, and the bottle was full. It smelled so great, my husband wouldn&#x27;t leave me alone. The light floral fragrance stays with you all day and you don&#x27;t have to constantly reapply. I would recommend this product to everyone that loves Estee Lauder&#x27;s perfumes and the company that I purchased it from and sold it to me at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I wear this all the time and love it.  The price is incredible, and I hope I can get it again when I&#x27;ve used this bottle.  If you like Pleasures, you won&#x27;t be sorry buying this.</li>
            <li> I have brought this twice.&lt;br /&gt;I keep 1 inside my home and 1 in my vehicle.</li>
            <li> Old-time favorite.  Feminine flowery smell that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  Its lighter smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as Beautiful but that&#x27;s what I wanted for every-day use.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume based upon a sample that I pulled from a magazine.  The tones are soft and not overpowering and it lasts a long time.  You only need a spritz or two to do ya which means the bottle will go a long way.  I&#x27;ve only had it about a week and have had 4 compliments on how it smells.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and a great product. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like Pleasures?  Great price--will purchase again.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I ordered I always loved this fragrance thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume for many years locally and was very happy to find it cheaper online.  Will definitely purchase online again if available.</li>
            <li> This is one perfume my wife ask for every year at christmas. This is her favorite hands down. I think she uses it almost everyday.&lt;br /&gt;And, it is very nice smelling.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes.  It has been around for years and I hope it continues for more years to come.</li>
            <li> IT DIDNT SMELL LIKE PLEASURE</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great price!</li>
            <li> Been using Pleasures Eau De Parfum Spray for several years.  I love it because it is strong and light at the same time and leaves a delicate layer of scent on my clothing.  It&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;knock-out&amp;#34; type of scent that sends sinus sufferers and people with sensitive noses running out the door.  Pleasures is a very elegant and feminine scent that I never tire of and it keeps me from buying anything else.  When I go to the store, I sample many different perfumes but always come back to Pleasures when it&#x27;s time to order.  Thank you Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Great! Just like I purchased from the department store.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom as Christmas gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Pleasures By Estee Lauder For Women. Eau De perfume spray is very nice, one touch and it last for a long time</li>
            <li> Good buy. Xmas present for my wife. She likes it!</li>
            <li> Best smelling perfume I have ever smelled! Great value, and the smell last ask day!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted - this is a 5&amp;#34; bottle</li>
            <li> Wife really liked it.  Don&#x27;t really know what else I can say about it but it does smell very nice</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and I have given it to her for our wedding anniversary for several years. She is always eager to get it. A happy wife means a happy life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a devotee of Estee Lauder Pleasures for many years now. It&#x27;s a beautiful floral fragrance that&#x27;s very romantic, distinctive, and long-lasting. I always get compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Love Pleasures by Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder!  Good price too!</li>
            <li> I get many compliments when I go shopping, people always ask me the name of my perfume.  I never over do when I use it.  So I am very happy that I can buy, from Amazon.  One of my daughter&#x27;s that always shops with Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is a very fabulous perfume and it stays on you all day very worth the money i love pleasure.</li>
            <li> A gift to my daughter. she said she loves it and so does her husband.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite scent. I&#x27;m very glad I can now get if for less at Amazon. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two bottles to date and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is my girlfriend&#x27;s signature scent.  I may be biased because she rocks, but this perfume is regal, sexy, and durable - the aroma still radiates from her body in the morning. I would classify this as perfect for evening dates or whenever you dress fancily.</li>
            <li> For my wife, but it&#x27;s absolutely her favorite!</li>
            <li> item was counterfeit , i was not able to return it better if you go to the local mall and get the real deal</li>

            <li> My daughter was thrilled to get this lovely almost rose smelling perfume two years after she first said she&#x27;d like to try it.  She was surprised that I remembered (when her husband didn&#x27;t.)  The price is high, but about half what my husband paid to buy me some when it was a newer perfume.</li>
            <li> my Daughters favorite perfume....smell is soooo nice</li>
            <li> Love the fresh natural smell!</li>
            <li> After 47 years of marriage, when you make the Queen happy... the kingdom and the castle are happy. She loved the perfume, the joy on her face expressed to me another honeymoon...</li>
            <li> Xmas present for my daughter - her favorite perfume</li>
            <li> Received Very Early, the day before arrival date. So Happy Thank You.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume.  The cost on Amazon is less than in the major department stores.</li>
            <li> Not outstanding but has some pizzazz and if the skin is the right match, then you have a winner.</li>
            <li> Great value - SHW loves it</li>
            <li> This product was an imitation, and I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> A favorite year round fragrance, a light floral that stays.  I switch now and then just for a change but always come back to Pleasures</li>
            <li> This fragrance is just heavenly. I wear it all the time when I want something fresh, elegant and un obtrusive. It lasts most of the day and seems to be universally liked by everyone near me! Buy it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful. It lasts all day and seems to be a pleasant smell for others. I have worn this for a long time. :)</li>
            <li> What a great find for my favorite cologne.  Saved about 30% over shopping locally and the shipping was free also.  Will buy again, when I run low on my supply.</li>
            <li> Love this fresh perfume!</li>
            <li> I use this parfum since I was a teenager. I think it&#x27;s the best parfum of Estee Lauder. The price is very good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and love it</li>
            <li> Paid nearly $60 for this bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;After spraying, the scent lasts about 30 seconds, then is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this for my wife for at least 5 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like they&#x27;ve changed the formula, probably making a better profit now, at the expense of actually having a scent.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this unscented alcohol.</li>
            <li> I searched all over the Internet on and off since last Christmas looking for the best deal and free shipping for my favorite perfume and size: Estee Lauder Pleasures for Women Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 ounce bottle. As usual, Amazon was the BEST DEAL with FREE SHIPPING!!! It is not always easy to find this size for such a great deal, so I purchased TWO bottles of my favorite perfume  because this price was such a GREAT deal. The official web site charges $82 plus shipping and department stores mark up to $85 or more for the 3.4 oz bottle.  The product looked just as if I purchased it at the department store...in the pink box with plastic wrap...but the big difference was the PRICE!!! I would definitely purchase this product again....and again!!!</li>
            <li> nice price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best perfume over eve&#x27;</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and the price is good! Thank you.</li>
            <li> i just  love  this scent,  i  will be  ordering  it again&lt;br /&gt;thank  you  for  the  good  deal&lt;br /&gt;if the price  goes  lower please  let  me  know  so  i can purchased  more.</li>

            <li> Great way to make the wife happy</li>

            <li> i get so many compliments on this perfume. I work in a hospital and even patients that say they are sensitive to perfume say it is very pleasant. it smells clean and fresh but not overpowering!

            <li> Excelent seller, good product.&lt;br /&gt;Tannks</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have been wearing it for years. Just remember a small amount goes a long way. It&#x27;s one perfume that I have found where the scent is still there after wearing it for hours.</li>
            <li> I miss Exotic! This is ok since Exotic is no longer made.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this smell and Amazon&#x27;s price of $47 could not be beat.  I feel much better ordering from Amazon than from eBay where you never know what exactly you&#x27;ll be getting.</li>
